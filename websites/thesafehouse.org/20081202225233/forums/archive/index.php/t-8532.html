<br />
1. NERIAK<br />
You say, 'what about the dark assassin?'<br />
Pazin Punox says 'Aye we were visited by that dark assassin, he left some sketch in my safekeeping, I would gladly give you a copy if you would take care of a problem that has been vexing me.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will take care of problem that has been vexing you.'<br />
Pazin Punox says 'An old student of mine who goes by the name Lon has disgraced this House; his betrayal to Innoruuk and Neriak is unforgivable. ' Pazin grins 'He must be punished through deceit and trickery.  Make him your friend, do as he asks, and pretend to be Redeemed as he calls it.  Once you are Redeemed take the cursed blade of Ro and run it through his heart.  Bring me his rapier and his head and I shall know the task is complete.'<br />
<br />
<br />
2.AKANON<br />
You say, 'What about the dark assassin?'<br />
Lobal Postugger says, 'You have heard of him? I had a nice conversation with him. Sharing some secrets of gnomish spirits if yah know what i mean! In return he gave me a sketch that looks quite interesting. Of course I am stuck in this place waiting youngsters to teach when I would rather be out with you making poisons. Perhaps you are willing to make a trade with me for the sketch?<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am willing to make a trade with you for the sketch.'<br />
Lobal Postugger says, 'Fantastic! If you combine Rage of Incapacitation, Wasted Flesh and Dreams of Drusella within a coffin bottle you can make me a nice bundle of poisons to play with. Then I will have no need for the sketch.' <br />
<br />
3.HALAS<br />
You say, 'What about the dark assassin?'<br />
Ysanna MacGibbon says, 'That poor lad! I saw him in the tundra being chased by that big bear of Tundra Jack. I never liked that bear of his since the day he ate my poor dog Thunderpaw. Anyways i say Iceberg chasing the assassin and grabbed my trusty ahlspiess and threw it, aiming right for his big head. Can you believe I missed?? I hit his side instead. Iceberg ripped my ahlspiess out and ripped it into pieces and then went whining of to Tundra Jack. Serves that bear right! He ate my dog!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What ahlspiess?'<br />
Ysanna MacGibbon says, 'Ahhhh my beloved shrieking ahlspiess, it was nice i was able to help a fellow assassin out but i really do miss it. The dark assassin gave me a sketch of paper he said was very valueable but it still pains me to be without my favourite throwing weapon. If you go get me another I would gladly part with this sketch.'<br />
<br />
<br />
4.Kelethin<br />
You say, 'What about the dark assassin?'<br />
Expin squints at you and says, 'So you have heard about him as well? I had heard of him through the rogue grapevine, so I was wary when the home guard spoke of the arrival of a dark stranger. I was approaching him from behind and some loud ranger clompipng about in the bushes must of spooked him, for off he ran. As he was running I took the liberty to swipe a piece of paper protruding from his pocket.' Expin mumbles to himself, 'Now where did I put that note?'<br />
<br />
You have stolen a Crumpled Piece of Paper<br />
<br />
Expin says 'Ahhh! You found it! Here let me make you a copy and put this in a secure spot so I don't lose it again.'<br />

At least that would be my guess. I would also guess you have to give Pazin the Burning Rapier and the head of Lon to get the sketch.<br />

Was talking about it in serverwide rogue channel..<br />
<br />
Have a couple of things it might be for, working on some now. Then sleep.<br />
<br />
Edit: I did not assassinate him. He hit for anywhere from 20 to 181 was tops on me. He was duel wielding. He put up a decent fight. I could not have soloed him.<br />
<br />
I pulled to zone with no aggro after I realized he had healers. I had a cleric back me up, no one assisted him. I had to have one complete heal. All he dropped was his head and 2 long swords. I lost faction with the temple of sol ro and gained with shadow men. Faction was not enough to move my amiable status.<br />
<br />
To do the hand-in, I had to sneak and hide down there. I am a halfling and very kos in there. Did the &quot;drop hide, hand in, hit hide again&quot; while maintaining sneak and had no problem didn't aggro anything else in room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">10-28-02, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it about 1 hour ago - I soloed him with just a druid level 42 doing 300-point heals and giving me a DS. I couldn't have killed him solo at level 62, he's dual-wielding and hits for up to ~190. I had to Instill Doubt him a few times after the druid had snared him, that way I could fight him while he was running back in.<br />
<br />
Nothing assisted him.<br />
<br />
I am at university right now, once I get back home I will try to talk to all NPCs in Freeport, Qeynos and Halas.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: I love this part of the quest. I never really wanted to be a follower of Solusek. And although I am not a follower of Innoruuk, I still am a Teir'dal at heart. It was fun killing the one that &quot;redeemed&quot; me.</div></div><hr />

The other two are the &quot;Martune Rapier&quot; (rare drop from Scorn Banshee in Hate) and the &quot;Well Balanced Rapier&quot; (purchased from Shady Swashbuckler in EC).  Until we learn more, it would be advisable to retain these in your bank as they could be needed.<br />

Has anyone talked to the Shady Swashbuckler?  What about Vilnious the Small in WK?<br />

[Mon Oct 28 07:18:25 2002] Lendel Deeppockets says 'Yes I saw the stranger of which you speak.  He dashed through the vale muttering something about 'nasty halfling druids'.  While I do agree they are quite dirty I was more interested in his clothing and equipment and couldn't take my eyes off of his mortar and pestle.  It was pitch black and had a smooth marble surface.

Quote:Nestral Tgaza the female dark elf GM in freeport mentions that when she spoke to the dark assassin he gave her the recipe for a black marble mortar and pestal that requires a black pearl powder. She says using this powder with the same formula as a magic bowl one could make a new black marble mortar and pestle. She also mention that he told her to find a potter at the pinnacle of their career or the materials would be wasted. She would not respond to anything I asked her. <br />

For the more durable poisons ye need to add a rare element in addition to the common element. He also mentioned some of the more exotic poisons would require sketchs that various masters of shadow would have. The Dark Assassin even gave Loran a book in which to place these sketchs. Overall a very nice stranger, I couldn't help but admire the mortar he had as well, black as night and smooth as marble. Too bad he wouldn't part with that recipe.'<br />

Both Raymn.  The last line indicates that the mortar may come after we get all four sketches.  <br />

Ocean Ink - Enthralled Ulthork, in SG<br />

Ocean Ink is supposed to drop in KK - but I've got no real confirm on that.<br />
<br />
Wax Flower - someone say Sebilis before, again, no confirm, except that I found it only in Bazaar, and not in PoK... which points towards an &quot;old&quot; zone.<br />
<br />
Golden Ember Power is a really common drop in PoP - you can find lots of it on vendors.<br />

What kind of poison will take up 10 slots?? Maybe serfing the boards tomorrow at work will yeild the answers I am looking for. Good luck fellow shadow dwellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sorlun</div><div class="date">10-28-02, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished figuring out the 3rd Tier 2 poison for the quest and also got 3 of the missing Tier 1 poisons.<br />
<br />
Tier 1<br />
<br />
Anger of Incapacitation:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Amber Resin + Wax Flower + Sluggish Sketch <br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
Confusing Dreams:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Amber Resin + Nodding Blue Lilly + Remiss Sketch<br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
Withering Flesh:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Amber Resin + Ocean Ink + vein crush sketch<br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
Tier 2 <br />
<br />
Dreams of Drusella:<br />
Confusing Dreams:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Drop of Mercury + Nodding Blue Lilly + twilight worms + remiss Sketch<br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
The tier 2 poison is combined with 2 other tier 2 poisons in a bone bottle to make &quot;bundle of poisons&quot;<br />
<br />
Give that to the gnome rogue GM and get the 4th sketch from the Sketch book quest (see thesafehouse.org)<br />
<br />
Result of combining 4 sketches is a &quot;Master sketch&quot; which is a substitute for the 3 notes used in the above poisons and in as yet undiscovered poisons! <br />
<br />
Whew.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Bayler 59 rogue Xev for support.<br />
Extra Special thanks to Shamu, 57 Shaman, Xev who helped me crack the poison recipies.<br />

<br />
<br />
You are turning 2 no-drop items in for a third no-drop item.  So, since NPC's eat no-drops (ie: giving a pair of j-boots to a firebeetle to transfer doesnt work)<br />
<br />
My guess is that the quest code catches the hand-off of the 2 items and creates the sketch on the fly.<br />

<br />
  &amp;lt;rant&gt;<br />
<br />
  You want to know what cheapens a quest?  You want to know what cheapens the experience of being a rogue?  I'll tell you.<br />
<br />
  What cheapens the experience of being a rogue is having one of the first burning rapiers in-game.  Being pivotal in discovering the BB part -and- getting the recipie.  Hauling ass to learn Gnoll, camping it for 12+ hrs straight.  Being in the right place as the right time and dutifully unemployed when that quest came out and handily informing the rogue community of what was found, so no one else had to camp the recipie.<br />
<br />
  Then finding out it was junk and within 2 months the quest was forgotten.<br />
<br />
  Confused yet?  Keep following me.<br />
<br />
  Then, lo and behold, Kunark... Level 60... Epic time.  Also, again, dutifully unemployed, right place right time.  First epic on my server, costing me dearly.  A kedge robe... the weapons... massive donations given to me by my guild at the time.  All those items burnt in a flurry to then discover again, guess what, people who want an RB nowadays simply skip it all.<br />
<br />
  Confused yet?<br />
<br />
  Where's my BR?  That's right, burnt for the RB.  Why?  So you don't have to.  Where'd my time go from camping BB for BR originally?  Into a PoS weapon that wasn't even good when it was implemented.  Why?  So you don't have to.<br />
<br />
  I like your rogue quests, VI.  They have some funny dialogue, interesting NPC's, use our rogue skills, and have overall good rewards.  But where the hell do you get off taking the BR and requiring it YET AGAIN simply because everyone else skips it?  What the hell are you thinking by putting Renux back into the equation again when some of us had to kill her two+ years ago to do the FIRST cool quest?<br />
<br />
  I don't complain about being a rogue, we're damn lucky, but this is ridiculous.  It's not the time sink that I'm furious at, it's the fact that you are making me repeat a timesink which I completed in the first place YEARS ago and was already required to be burnt on an RB at the time.  Using the BR at this stage is a huge cop-out admission that you know everyone just skips it so you decided to force it upon us again.<br />
<br />
  Well guess what, I *did* do it and you've decided to make me do it again?  That's what I get for being amongst the earliest BR/RB owners?  Thanks alot.<br />
<br />
  I did nothing but follow your dialogue and your quests.  Now, you backassed it all up.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KhalenSilverThorn</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maeghant,<br />
<br />
I do agree with you to a large degree... and I did read the spoilers and I did skip the rapier/sword portion of the epic.  However, I do have a unique perspective on the whole thing being from a server that got i-wiped.<br />
<br />
I did the BR twice (once I used it then banked it, the second I did just because I felt better with it in the bank.).<br />
<br />
I also agree that adding another instance of Renux after killing her is a bit hoaky... but so is killing A_Froglock_King_239823948.  Unfortunatly its a side-effect of having a non-unique spawn system such as EQ uses.<br />
----------------<br />
All that aside, this has still been an interesting story line so far... and I think that allowing just anyone to kill the GM's to bypass the interesting subplots is a cheapening of the quest.<br />
(For that matter I wish the RB had required a turnin of the Rapiers and Swords, and this one required a new quest... but thats beside the point)<br />

<br />
Pure speculation here but I think theres more to all this than might appear at first glance.  Black Marble M&amp;amp;P has nothing to do with this quest yet it is mentioned over and over in the dialouge.  This mysterious Dark Assassin is still out and about somewhere and there is certainly more than enough here to build an even larger quest on... perhaps epic 2.0?  Given VI's recent tradeskill fetish and the nature of the quests so far it would not surprise me one bit if what we have discovered so far has been the beginnings of, or perhaps a subquest of, a second epic.<br />

I'm a Dark Elf and am very KOS there.  With Burnoose of the Halfbreed I got to dubious with the guards and apprehensive with the Rogues.  The quest NPC wouldn't talk to me while I faced her with apprehensive faction, but said all the right things when I sneaked and hailed her from behind.  I handed the spear to her while facing her, and she took it and basically told me to get lost.  I don't know if handing it in from behind would have made a difference.  I'm going to get another spear and work on White Rose faction just in case.  I have a Barbarian Mask now, but I still dont think that will get me past indiff and I don't want to risk losing another spear unless someone who has succeeded in that part of the quest can confirm that indiff faction will suffice.</div></div><hr />

At 8pm he seems to depop then repop for a total of 4 different times till he stays up at 9pm game time.  Thank god for my pegasus cloak or i'd be one dead rogue from that 10k drop while hightailing it out of there when he agro's *Grin*.<br />

First thing he says is. i don't need this item take it back. and then he does the normal speech.  I got the head returned to me. But i did get my sketch that i needed. Maybe they changed the quest so now you only have to do the Rapier part and not kill Ion. <br />
Possible reason: if everyone is killing him. Then you can't turn in the items to be redeemed. Just an idea.</div></div><hr />

This is wrong.  The spear is dropped by an abhorrent and it wields it if carrying it. So if you are in need check buildings A and B. Then look in Maestros house and see if any in there.<br />
<br />
Theres only like 10 abhorrents up at a time usually. Just thought I'd clear that up.</div></div><hr />

If you sneak behind and hail her indiff, she WILL turn to you but she will respond. <br />

Do NOT give her anything at the point because NOW your not indiff anymore.<br />

He was an easy kill for me, a 50 shaman with his dogdog, and 2 51 druids. I can only assume that he had been given something before, which affected it for the person a few messages up? (Kelethin - picked it within about 6 tries, WAY faster than for my epic!)<br />
<br />
Neriak gave me about 0.4 blue at level 54 for the turn in. Kelethin gave me about 0.2, I think. Higher levels might want 100% AAXP before they turn them in  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patofnaud</div><div class="date">11-18-02, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple things...<br />
<br />
Nimbletoe, you got faction hit that are pro-Neriak becuase you just killed the &quot;good&quot; guy that gave you your Burning Rapier. You are an assassin that did a &quot;bad&quot; thing.. You want &quot;Your faction with the Scouts of Tunare can't get any better&quot; ?  <br />
<br />
As for the sketches, I was having problems with the exact poisons and the exact number of charges to combine in a coffin bottle for the Gnome in AkAnon, until I realized they were the TIER 2 poisons. DOH.<br />
<br />
Also, I was having a hard time finding the Gnome.. There are two cleric guilds in AkAnon, one being the &quot;good&quot; with Cleric and Pally trainers, one being the &quot;bad&quot;. The rogue guild is hidden in the &quot;good&quot; cleric guilds basement. When you enter AkAnon, as you pass the first waterfall, the building in the middle of the lake is the &quot;bad&quot; guild, not your destination. Keep going until you get deeper to where you see the Wood Elf bardess. Off to your left is a bridge to the guild you want.<br />
<br />
In the Pally guild is a hidden wall behind a curtain.<br />
<br />
Now that I have my 4 sketches, I was considering getting my master sketch. Untill I realized it was going to cost me 2100pp just to save 3 bank slots.. Ummm no thanks.. Unless someone comes up with a better reason, I'll keep my four sketches.<br />
<br />
Great quests in all. And I actually made decent exp doing quests for a change..<br />
<br />
Well done.</div></div><hr />

I even sent a tell to a couple high level gnomes and even Mistle (60+ gnome rogue) we know, and she couldn't remember. I think our friend Xandapus (gnome wizard) was the one to tell me behind the curtain. <br />
<br />
I know about the exp of the different parts, I made some decent exp doing the 4 parts, the GMAS etc,,, but 2100pp seems to be a lot to pay for another &quot;hit&quot;.  <br />
<br />
And knowing me, my bank would hold 5 sketches because I am a packrat and VI will probably make a &quot;Ahhhh greetings rogue, hand me a DIP SKETCH and I will give you the uber backscratcher&quot; quest as soon as I destroy mine.  <br />

So I'll probably hold back a bit.. Till they lower the price on that combine.</div></div><hr />

Should it turn out that there is a book of some sort as a universal reagent, how is that different from the past poisons? It'd be like the need for having a mortar and pestle in the first place to make the new poisons. Unless it takes the place of poison reagents (which I would love to have it do), we'd still have to farm hours on end to get the other reagents, right? Don't get me wrong, I'm gonna get my GM items done one of these days, just curious if this foretells a fix to our poisons, or just one more hassle to something potentially useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I have a pretty good guess. How many of you older rogues ever remember seeing an NPC in Rathe Mountains, Feerrott, Everfrost, or the Karanas named &quot;a dark assassin&quot;? When I first started playing 3 years ago I remember seeing him on track all the time when I hunted in Everfrost with my ranger. I also seem to remember seeing him on track in North Karana and in the Feerrott. I haven't seen him for probably 2 years though. according to eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3717 he is now a triggered spawn, at least in Everfrost for an Erudite necro quest.<br />
<br />
Now then, considering that the barbarian rogue guildmaster mentioned seeing Iceberg chasing the dark assassin through the tundra in Everfrost, I think that might be a good place to look to find out if a dark assassin is at all related to this quest.<br />
<br />
And for the record, he is a human, not a half elf</div></div><hr />

Anyway message(what dark assassin? etc) is not required. just give lon's head and BR to NPC.  And He gives a part of sketch. And He will realize You are. And Kill u.. <br />
<br />
And Find a Rez hehe....<br />
<br />
or I can guess a way... just train em to zone line.. and A friend of your make a 1 lvl darky rog. and Hail to hold Pazin Where good spot to do quest. All NPC will go back his spot except Pazin.. now sneak and give lon's head and BR behind of Pazin...<br />

I am currently waiting for Lon the Redeemed to respawn since I couldnt solo him with healers around and the group at zone killed him instead of leaving him for me.<br />

It's been well over 2 hours and no respawn yet. &amp;lt;I gave up and came back the next day, Lon was up&gt;.<br />
<br />
Also, in Hate v2.0, I think I read somewhere that only the Avatar of Abhorrence can drop the alpheiss now. I've been up there for a couple days camping the enchanter epic drop and all the abhorrents we've killed dropped nothing. Not a good sign for those of us who've waited this long to quest the master sketch. Edited by: Sigpaos at: 6/27/03 4:50 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the two raids that I had attended to Hate, the Alphiess dropped 5 times (2 times off the Avatar of Abhorrence and 3 off regular Abhorrents).  I figure it's the same.  I doubt VI would make a drop that difficult for the quest.<br />

Just keep your eyes peeled. Should be easier with the spawn rates being upped a bit.<br />

Just took a big hit.  I got an assassinate off on Lon immediately and figured that I should go and get that sketch from neriak.  Long story short, I put my DE mask on and got to dubious with rogues.  Handed in both items and got told to go fly a kite.  Now I take it you need to be at indifferent.  Does that mean that after I hand in the items, but before pressing trade, I should sneak again?  Well off I go to do BR again -(<br />
