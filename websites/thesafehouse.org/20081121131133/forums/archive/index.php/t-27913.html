<br />
Name : Ascension<br />
Server : Flamehammer<br />
<br />
Leader : Nimyth<br />
Officers : Shiro Tenkuri, Seig Veranhart<br />
<br />
Website : http://guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=144343&amp;TabID=1226264 (Full site coming soon)<br />
<br />
Guild Type : Social and Endgame/Raiding (Yes, they can go together!)<br />
<br />
Main Time Zone : US EST<br />
(Members from any time zone welcome, events will be organized around EST prime time for the most part)<br />
<br />
About Ascension : First and foremost, we are a social, friendly group. We want to meet people, make new friends, and generally enjoy the world of Vanguard.<br />
But we also hope to meet the many challenges that VG throws at us, and we're looking forward to much of the raid content that awaits us in the higher levels.<br />
<br />
Although the words &quot;endgame&quot; and &quot;raiding&quot; may seem daunting, fun comes first! There are no attendance requirements, strict rules, or angry leaders who will kick you out if you don't come to some raids. We understand you might have a life outside of the game, although if you don't, that's not a problem either. While being &quot;the best&quot; does of course have it's advantages, we're more concerned about enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to have fun playing, leveling, and raiding with a friendly group, we may be the place for you.<br />
<br />
A Little About Us : The 3 founders have been playing MMOs together for over 3 years. We've all been crucial elements of endgame/raiding groups in other games, officers in various guilds, and have lead raids in FFXI and DDO.<br />
<br />
Recruitment : Always looking for good players!<br />
<br />
Nimyth.</div></div><hr />
