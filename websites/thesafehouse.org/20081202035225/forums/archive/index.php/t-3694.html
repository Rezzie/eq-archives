Buff self.<br />
Eat Food/Drink.<br />
Watch my willpower and focus remain at 150/900.<br />
<br />
I can't take much more of this.<br />
<br />
It has been this way for 2 weeks straight and no patch.<br />
<br />
Totally killing the doctor/chef profession as anything they do is worthless since it will lower the most important stats in the game, mind.<br />
<br />
Grrrrrrr.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 It's only wrong if you get caught.If  consequences dictate my course of action I should play GOD<br />

Like cooking, and patching people up.  They're noncombat professions, after all, though you can be healing in combat...<br />
That being said, I have stopped playing the game, even though it's going to be  a great, great game...  When they finish the beta.  It's a fun game, but I just couldn't justify paying them money every month to finish playtesting a supposedly finished product.    Varaxael loves you, and has a wonderful plan for your bones</div></div><hr />
