<br />
I mean, I only watch 3 shows.  And two of those are in fillers so I don't even bother talking about them at the moment.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I watch more than Darth, but I don't watch the fastest releases, so I usually am behind in the discussion anyway, and don't participate for fear of spoilers.</div></div><hr />

Last week I watched the first disc of Berserk and the New Fist of North Star on Showtime.  Aside from being the gayest week since Loveless finished, it wasn't anything to write home about.</div></div><hr />

Ya even I who likes catgirls will not watch loveless due to the extreme Shounen-ai in it. Plus i hear the story wasn't even too good to begin with and not many catgirl parts :P.<br />
<br />
Edit: my bad lol...i wasn't thinking :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-01-06, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Minor correction :p<br />
<br />
It was the proper term would be yaoi (malexmale sex), rather than yuri (femalexfemale sex). However, while yaoi isn't that wrong of a word to use, Loveless is defined as shounen-ai (shounen=boy ai=love so, boy love). There's also shoujo-ai (girl love). Slightly differnet from yaoi/yuri in that it's a love story, not a sex story.<br />
<br />
I really need to finish up my list of anime terms. Even though I said that 2 weeks ago. I'm almost done now (should be this weekend) and it should be a fun and informative read for newbies and hardcore fans alike. Tried my best on it so that everyone can learn something from it.<br />
<br />
(felt this was as good a place as any to mention I was still working on it if anyone was keeping track)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">07-02-06, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a sidenote, since Loveless was discussed, it seems the US DVD's were released without an english dub.<br />
 <br />
Thank god. Someone out there understands, if only a little. Even if 'niche' anime begins getting realeased sans dubs to save money, I will be a happy panda. Sick and tired of studios hiring in-house 'talent' who have never seen the series, and go in for a cold read, and that is the audio they use, to save production costs. (I'm looking at you, ADV. Bastards!)<br />
 <br />
On another sidenote, I no longer subscribe to Play magazine due to thier review of Loveless. !ny anime reviewer that lists 'no english dub' as a negative thing in a series about yaoi and catgirls need to be smashed in the head with heavy Logging equipment. Loved the game aspect of the magazine, but the anime reviews were so 'popular' it was sickening.<br />
 <br />
....pant....wheeze.... .........I needed that! :cool</div></div><hr />
