NPC's:  Short answer - DM's/Designers can assign special abilities to whatever they see fit.  Long answer - Ask a Designer how they do it. Baroness Acinonyx Lanoche<br />

<br />
Creating your own classes would be great I think for stand alone mods.<br />
<br />
More work than its worth though.  But still great if anyone wanted to put the time into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only time I played a non-standard class in D&amp;amp;D was when the monk was featured in Dragon Magazine back in the 80's.  Even then it was over-powered.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, I played the Anti-Paladin for a few weekends.<br />
<br />
Both of these classes were good enough to be featured in THE leading publication on the game, but were definately over-powered.<br />
<br />
We ended up using them as NPC's only (as the articles suggested).<br />
<br />
I just don't get it.  What skills do you want to implement that are not in some way featured in the current game as-is with either an item or another class-type skill/feat?<br />
<br />
Run(3)?  Hell, be a monk  <br />
Innate Regeneration? Get a ring.<br />
Jamfest?  Play EQ.  <br />
<br />
I'm being facetious of course,  I'm sure you can list plenty of skills/abilities your custom class would be capable of, but my question is: Is it a balanced class?<br />
<br />
If not, then why would people want to play it?  If we wanted imbalance we'd all play level 60 Wizards in EQ. (ok, back off wizzies... 50 gazzillion damage in the time my poor bard does 25 is overpowered... hee hee)<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't see the attraction of a custom class outside the current ruleset.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you made new rules I'd like it.  But then I'd be playing something other than D&amp;amp;D.<br />

ALL prestige classes are missing. Those are a major and integral part of D&amp;amp;D 3rd.<br />

<br />
 From what I've read, creating custom classes (or prestige classes) is possible, but extremely tricky.  It also involves making custom magic item &quot;creature skins&quot;.  Or something.  Basically, items that can be invisibly (to the player) equipped that grant the custom class powers you want.  Then every time the player levels up, replace the current invisible item thingy with another one possessing additional powers.  A pain and not particularly portable.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Syllestrae FV</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prestige classes were essentially separate classes that you could multi-class into after meeting certain requirements.<br />
<br />
As an example, &quot;Arcane Archer&quot; was a prestige class available to elves who had spellcasting ability, and met certain feat and skill requirements, as well as a minimum base attack value.  If you changed to Arcane Archer, you'd advance as that, and it had it's own abilities (like special magic arrows you could shoot and such).<br />
<br />
The original intention of prestige classes is that they would make you  weaker than if you hadn't changed to it, but would gain the benefit of becoming more stylized/specialized.<br />
<br />
After a while though, the prestige classes started making you more  powerful than if you hadn't taken one, which got dumb (because everyone would choose to become a prestige class).<br />
