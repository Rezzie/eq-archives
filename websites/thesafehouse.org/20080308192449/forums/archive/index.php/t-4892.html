BOUNTY POINTS AND STORES <br />
<br />
Bounty points and stores have been added to Dark Age of Camelot. It works as follows: as you accrue Realm Points, you now accrue Bounty Points, which you can spend in special stores to get special magical items. Once you spend bounty points, they go away just like money does. There are three types: healing, stamina , and spell power healing. There are a few levels of these, please see the list below. Please note that will will add more bounty store objects over time. <br />
<br />
You can find the Bounty stores in each Realm's main city. See the World notes for the precise store locations. <br />
<br />
You may have a maximum number of bounty items based on your realm rank - i.e. one per Realm Rang. To use a bounty item, the item must be your level or lower - otherwise the item will not work for you. <br />
<br />
To use the item, place it somewhere in your inventory (they do not have to be equipped). Then left click on the item to make a short cut to the item on your hot bar. After this to use simply click on the hot-bar icon. At that point the items spell will be cast and it will disappear. One bounty item may be used every 3 minutes of real time - you can use it while fighting, but you'll have to exit out of combat mode and wait for your weapon timer to expire to do so (usually just a few seconds). Then click the item to &quot;fire&quot; its effect and re-enter combat. <br />
<br />
Higher level objects have more healing power than lower level ones. <br />
<br />
The cost is as follows: <br />
level 20 - 100 bounty points <br />
level 30 - 200 bounty points <br />
level 40 - 300 bounty points <br />
level 50 - 400 bounty points <br />

<br />
This is in repsect of the announcement for the up and coming (*cough*) keeps for guilds, which will (allegedly) use BPs to upkeep.<br />
<br />
Also I found that I was always dead before I could use the stones  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eiger DAOC</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure on this, but I think GUILD Bounty Points are Accumulated separately from PERSONAL Bounty Points.  If you earn a bounty point while in a guild, they get one, and you get one.  You can spend yours, and not affect your Guild's count.<br />
<br />
Can anybody confirm this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shandray</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm inclined to agree with Eiger DAoC.  I have spent BPs and not affected the collective guild BPs.<br />
IMO they are WAY too expensive on personal points and you have to hit your USE ITEM key and follow up with the totem hotkey to activate the effect.  This can be a bit tedious in RvR fights which normally last tween 7-12 seconds on avg.<br />
<br />
Oh and for the sake of clarity, they are called totems, not globes or stones.</div></div><hr />
