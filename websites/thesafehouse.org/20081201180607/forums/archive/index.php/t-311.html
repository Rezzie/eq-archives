<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Uro the fox</div><div class="date">03-25-00, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One night, a few friends and I were hanging out getting some exp outside Splitpaw when a really nasty pk guild decides its in their best interest to cause some trouble. Anyway, we decide to smack em down. That didn't go so well. Apparently, a large portio of the guild was waiting at the zone and disperssed us rather quickly. My compatriots head for Rathe while i'm booking to NK with a mage pet hot on my trail. Unfortunately, one of my mates thinks I'm in dire straits and runs back, only to get pked. Now this annoys me to no end so I run back, pumice in hand looking for a rematch. I get the guys name and sneak into the zone. Lucky me) They weren't paying attention so I con em and find only two are in my range. I immediately find my mark, a lil enchanter nmaed Oberyom (same guy who whacked my compatriot). I land a nice backstab (about 75 or so) to wake him up. He responds with a root which i pumice. He manages to get off an entrall as I'm grinding him into mush but I resist it ( mwahaahah). He starts to run, his firnds still in shock from my blitzkrieg. He runs outside and around stops and roots me. Before I can pumice, he shocks me by doing the unthinkable---he sits to med up). Well that spell book must've blocked the use of my pumice) because that backstab made him put away his magazine. He tried to run but well as we all know, you never run from a rogue, it only makes it worse. So I dropped him like a sack of potatoes, only to find him butt naked( grrrr). Oh well, still was fun. I have never killed an even target before, felt kinda good)<br />

<br />
And, like an Aesop fable, there must be a moral here:  Learn how to use pumice. (I know you buy pumice, but can you hotkey it?)  Bloody naked casters.  On my list of impossible things to wish for, I wish you could loot spells from those naked PKers.<br />
<br />
If you could, which one would you take to discombobulate him most?  His invisibility? Gate? Root?  What?<br />

Basically, all you have to do it scroll back a hot key list, right click, and whamo. It beats going through inventory looking for it. As for a spell to yank out? I'd have a list of all the annoying and hard to research spells and tear a few of those out. It also depends on what type of caster. <br />
    Enchanter--clarity, mez line of spells, <br />
    Wizard--the biggest nastiest DD spell they have, <br />
    Mage--highest lvl pet spell), <br />
    Necro--same or a nasty dot<br />
    Druid--snare or sow<br />
<br />
Of course, I could get loony and just steal all the True North's in Norrath. Mwahahaha.<br />
