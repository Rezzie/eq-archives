ALSO keeping with tradition: Rags watch says it's the 15th, and his brain says its the 12th. But we all know as soon will he, that we meet on the 12th+1. :b<br />

I couldn't resist. The formula isn't that complicated.</div></div><hr />

A dagger and a longsword I think. We could do that maybe.</div></div><hr />

Then again he hits like a tank so maybe a sword and board will work best.  We can work on getting that sword while we wait on Jaesin, also I may have found us another recruit, he downloaded the trial but will need help leveling to catch us.</div></div><hr />

Gona have to pick up a wand or two to heal him... hmm.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, going turkey hunting at four in the morning on sunday. So what I'm thinking is I will just take a nap saturday and just stay up, that case of bawls I bought might come in handy. Stupid turkeys are so damned elusive. *mumble* *mumble*</div></div><hr />

The Healers of House Jorasco have been hard at work curing the Laryngitis afflicting the Bards in Stormreach. The Healers are pleased to announce that the Bards have been successfully healed, and their singing voices are back in order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, but wouldn't being ran through it very quickly a couple of times make up for said xp deduction? I literaly can kill everything in that dungeon now with one shot.. unless I roll a 1.. or the game crashes, or I see something shiny floating in the air, or a gong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone hit that gong.... trust me&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: Maybe I'll just roll up a new character.. no.. cause then we'd be two really weak characters... hmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retkin</div><div class="date">05-12-06, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there still a free 2 week trial thing? i have been meaning to try DDO but it would be a lot of cash since none of my friends play it.<br />
<br />
Is there any class / archetype that you guys could use?<br />
<br />
Sig is old, <br />
60 rogue on destromath WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-12-06, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure, I'll look around. Also I am almost sure I remember getting a &quot;give a friend a try out&quot; thing inside my box. If thats true then maybe someone who is playing still has one to give away. <br />
<br />
As for class/archetype, we could use a rogue at this point. We keep having to pass up locked door which almost certainly lead to treasure rooms/surprises. Then theres the traps.. we've gotten really good at avoiding those, instead of disarming them. Really anything will work, no matter the makeup we always seem to find a way to beat our enemy.. in very interesting ways.<br />
<br />
We may have another joining us soon, so we will probably spend a bit of time helping him get to level three/four to catch up, if you join anytime soon/around that we could just help the both of you catch up.<br />
<br />
On that note I have decided to physically destroy my xp gain, from now on I will run in and out of the quest door until I receive nothing. Why? Because I want you all to catch up ... I don't know how I got so far.. really .. I swear. But I can use THAT bow now so I'm good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-12-06, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here ya go, ... I love google.<br />
<br />
Free Trial Thingy (http://trial.ddo.com/)<br />
<br />
Get on go through the tutorial, then join some groups to see how stuff works/level up. Getting to level three would be awesome, four would be better(but is damn hard).<br />
<br />
Our group so far is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost Always if not Always There&quot;<br />
Rag/Troz Level 5 -Fighter<br />
Yalum/Everett Level 5 -Bard<br />
Jaesin/Jolt Level 3(I think) -Sorceror(electric&quot;zap&quot;)<br />
Effsee/Motego Level 6(Gona Stop Getting XP) -Ranger!<br />
<br />
&quot;People who don't show up very often cause life is kicking them in the pants&quot;<br />
Teannin/Marck The Redd -Cleric<br />
<br />
So that leaves two slots and a hope that we never actually all show up on the same night... (like that will happen)<br />
<br />
Also don't be discouraged by the lack of intelligent beings. 20% of groups are intelligent fun people, the rest are idiots. Our SH group falls into that 20%.<br />
<br />
What am I forgetting... oh right .. the server! That could have ended badly.<br />
Lhazaar<br />
We meet on tuesdays and saturdays at/around 8 p.m. est. Sometimes fridays.. depends on stuff..<br />
<br />
Could I have posted anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-12-06, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm lvl 5 Weee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-12-06, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh Ok, lemme fix that since I obviously have nothing better to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need a shock flametouched +1 (or +2) ghost touch greatsword of undead bane!<br />
<br />
Man that would rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would also be a 4th broker weapon. Shoulda made it greater undead bane while you were at it. <br />
<br />
So I'm ready for tonight, gota take care of a couple things but will be ready by 8 if not by 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retkin</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got 2 of my friends to download and play as well, will be looking for you in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well shoot.. hehe, that not only fills the group up but creates a line to get in, oh well, the three of you should have some fun and when you all get up to level 3/4/5 you could join up with us. A good group makeup... well you know what a good group comprises of. It will be a while till we all get to six as I am going to actively harm my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm running late, hoping to make it on around 9 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right then, hopefully rag makes it soon as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This post is to show that Effsee is looking at this thread.<br />
<br />
Plus I'm logging in now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am gonna try to get on, but I am beat... worked 5 days in a row, and I still have to work tomorrow. minimum of 8 hours each day though mind you x_x.</div></div><hr />
