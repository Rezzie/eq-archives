<br />
The setup:<br />
<br />
I'm at the Freeport  bank waiting for a friend.  Hide/sneak combo up due to many purist types in the zone.  That's when I notice a fellow wood elf, warrior I believe, who is being owned by many purists.  This elf dies, loots and scoots, comes back an hour later, and guess who was waiting...the purists again.  Knowing that I was outnumbered, and I had no hope of helping this elf in a fight, I came up with a plan, just to see how well it would work.<br />
The purist peeps had no casters among them them.  So no one could see invis.  So with a hide/sneak combo I relentlessly followed these purists around the zone.  Verbally taunting them, poking them, laughing and grinning.  Sure, I kept getting angry messages from them.  Messages calling me out to fight, calling me coward.  I'm not stupid enough to jump out to these when I know I would get owned.  I'm patient...after a time they started to jump at shadows.  Their taunts were childish, then became pleading with me...begging me to stop.  I finally drove them from the zone with a basic trick.  I had won a battle with a large group of purists, and I never had to dirty my blade.<br />
<br />
Learn well fellow rogues, some battles can be won with a quick wit, and talkative mouth.  If you can anger a foe, and keep them off balance, it just might give you the edge you need in a fight.  If one is angry, they don't think straight, and one mistake on their part, could mean the difference between life and death for you!  It sounds silly, but the above story is very true and can and does work.  Try it sometime.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this? I would love to hear some feedback.<br />

What a foolish mistake it is... *toothless grin*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Especially if ye are taunting folks who have no PvP recourse, ye could be construed as verbally harrassing them and not only may it get ye a /ignore but perhaps a /report and /petition as well.<br />
<br />
I prefer the stealthy approach as a rogue meself.  Silent for the most part though I will send congratulatory tells to someone who has slain me if they show maturity.  If I win I will never rub it in.               Fricka       of the Vallon Zek Shanks<br />

<br />
More of a note for other posters if ye will and because oft times the rules on PvP are not printed I think it best to share what little we do know exists.</div></div><hr />
