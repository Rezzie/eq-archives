This guy...<br />
<br />
Eva Killer Guilty <br />
<br />
Quote:Hiroyuki Tsuchida, the 23-year-old (he was 22 at the time of the murder) that killed his mother with a baseball bat, has been found guilty of murder by the Yamagata district court.<br />
<br />
Inspired by aspects of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Tsuchida believed that human beings are unnecessary beings, responsible for the destruction of the environment. This brought him to want to kill people and he chose to start with family members as he believed it would be easier and it would desensitize him to the process of killing.<br />
<br />
Tsuchida was sentenced to fourteen years in prison.</div></div><hr />

I was talking more specifically about the book, as I haven't seen the movie  . The book eventually moves to the point that a real &quot;all-american&quot; kid gets real messed up mentally, begins killing people, more or less for the pleasure of it.<br />
Too make it semi-on topic: I was reminded of it vaguley by the article.</div></div><hr />
