<br />
i've figured out how to beat almost every strategy but jousting with someone who has the same.. or greater running speed than I do.  Had a little confrontation with a shadow knight from DB.... he just jousted me in nro... was a good duel... he complemented me on it afterwards.. but he still jousted the crap out of me.  When it ended he had about 7%hp and i had about 10hp(not percent).<br />
He would basicly run(with me on his tail).. turn around.. and then hit me.  Jumping.. turning around.. and backstabbing didn't work because he didn't run in a straight line.  Following him didn't work because of the melee range bug.<br />
<br />
Any solutions here?<br />
<br />
NOTE: he also didn't take too kindly to my blind poison.... wore off very fast.  Failed to apply another poison mid-battle. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />

wait til he charges you, facing him charge him as well.<br />
jump over him and NOT trying to turn hit your bs as you pass over him, <br />
this works rather well for me, if you want look me up in game and Ill show ya what I mean (kinda hard to make it real clear in print) Diabalein Avidya <br />

When target passes thru you, you can land backstab without turning.  I've done it many times.  Depending on lag, you have to hit BS before target reaches you.<br />
<br />
also.<br />
<br />
A reverse circle strafe, followed by an immediate run at the passing back  and then jumping can avoid the hit and get in a BS.  Difficult manuveur using a keybaord mouse combo.<br />

<br />
so your running around, or dancing with the other guy while moving backwards.  Backing up is a very strong tool in melee vs melee fights as the server doesnt track changes of direction very well. Alternating moving forward and backwards makes your avatar appear very jumpy, and you will often times ghost off in a random direction.  <br />

My own terminology.  Maybe someone's givin it a different name.<br />
<br />
As soon as target comes even, move forward while maintaining strafe and turn until facing target's back.  If, target stops, backstab.  If, target continues to move, jump and backstab.<br />

Personally, I do not mind jousting with someone.  When moving at them in straight line turn on attack and backstab in passing.  Often you will land a backstab while still in the front.  Practice it, a friend and me lined up back to back and you can backstab your opponent this way.  So essentially in your passing point if you can hit it you will nail them.  No need to circle straffe on a Jouster.  If your still having problems with this, try moving back while they come at you jousting.  Do this right when there about to hit you and often they will prematurely hit their attack.  Then spin in place and get them in passing.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

Get them to charge into objects and you can get a few free shots in as they change trajectory.  Also take advantage of the rate of speed you have when strafing and moving foreward at the same time.<br />

<br />
You don't want to joust. Don't let him.<br />
<br />
My favorite tactic against a good jouster is to either circle right or left quick.<br />
<br />
OR throw their timing off, by stopping/sliding before they time their swing. <br />
<br />
The second one is often the most effective, but keep them off guard. Jump over them circle right/left. run through, stop/start.<br />

<br />
First off, I've never turned during a joust to hit a backstab.  Just run through them and hit backstab just before you go through.  You'll stab 'em or miss the stab almost every time with some practice.  The key is to set up a &quot;joust&quot; button which turns on both &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;backstab&quot; at the same time for you (less buttons for you to worry about).  Add disarm to this combo as well.<br />
<br />
The key to beating any 2hs/b opponent who's jousting is to play on YOUR terms.  Throwing off their timing means their death.  They have to wait for that attack to recycle, so take advantage of that.  <br />
<br />
When they charge you, charge them but stutter (stop or slide) when they get near.  Usually they'll jump the gun and use their attack too early.  Then you continue the joust and smack them.<br />
<br />
Circle strafing will really frustrate a pure jouster, so get comfortable with that.  <br />

<br />
Is it not better to keep the attack ON at all times &amp; swing out then back into range, dancing? That way the attack will hit when/if it can. In the meantime it 'waits' to swing.<br />
<br />
The argument: if I use joust button with /attack on  - /attack off, I might time it wrong due to lag/graphics etc., and simply miss the swing into the air.<br />
