<br />
One of the reasons I play online games is for the community but as I moved from game to game, as we all do, I was losing touch with all the great friends I had made. So I created Safe Haven back in '02 and we've been having a great time ever since.<br />
<br />
And now its time to move into the next great upcoming game, Vanguard. So let me tell you a bit about us so you can see if this is the guild for you.<br />
<br />
&gt;We're all about family and the person behind the character. We don't roleplay ingame because we act as we do in real life so we can get to know each other and form real friendships, we have had some gatherings in RL also. We are based all over the US and UK so no worries about location.<br />
<br />
&gt;We are the casual guild for the hardcore gamer. We raid, plan events, do all the stuff hardcore guilds do but in a real casual way, we dont ask people to do things, we aren't Uber, we work fulltime, have families, but spend a whole lot of time ingame too, probley too much : )<br />
<br />
&gt;We aren't big into PvP so we will be choosing a PvE server. We also are a very mature guild, no leetspeak and such. The quality of our members is always our top priority.<br />
<br />
My favorite MMO moment so far was putting up our town hall in SWG so I really can't wait to do the same in Van since Im sure itll be ten times the experience. : )<br />
<br />
If SH sounds like the place for you, come check out our webpage, http://www.safe-haven.us check us out, sign up on our forums and check out the community. If its what youve been looking for, make a post on our recruitment board.<br />
<br />
Look forward to meeting all of you,<br />
Jeff<br />
aka Asher, sh for life and all that</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThunderChief</div><div class="date">02-17-06, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all have to admit games will come and go. Though I am eagerly awaiting the release of Vanguard I doubt it will be the last game I pick up. Years ago I played Ultima Online and most recently World of Warcraft and yes I belonged to guilds in both. I doubt those guilds have lasted the test of time, in fact, I know they haven't.<br />
<br />
I know there are many great guilds that are currently accepting members into their ranks. So then why choose Safe Haven? Simple, it's not just about playing Vanguard but more importantly it's about getting to hang out with a group of people who you just might hang out with for years to come, regardless of the game.<br />
