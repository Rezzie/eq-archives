<br />
I think that this is a really fun show. Basically, it has two halves to the show. The basic premise is that there are two groups of girls who were blessed with the ability to be “Good” or “Evil”.<br />
<br />
But, there’s a twist where neither are really good, or evil. The “Good” group follows the slogan, “Anything can be done in the name of Justice.” Literally. Anything.<br />
<br />
The “Evil” group has five girls, all sisters from eldest to youngest likely being between 25 to 10 years old. Their parents who passed away were evil, and asked that they become the best evil there ever was. However, they are all very sweet girls who don’t like to trouble people, but want to live up to their parent’s wishes. When they try to do evil, things don’t quite go their way.<br />
<br />
It’s a cute and funny story, squat for plot, and not necessarily worth watching however it is a fun way to kill time.<br />
<br />
Amaenaideyo! - D<br />
<br />
It’s your typical Harem show. Tons of Buddhist girls and a loser guy. Only two episodes have been fansubbed so far, and probably for a very damn good reason. I could not stand to watch it. I am pretty biased when it comes to harem shows, however. If you liked Love Hina, you’ll probably like anyth – this show. :p Plenty of fanservice, at least it has THAT going for it, but there are much better shows for this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Banner of the Stars III – A+ (VERY HIGH RECOMMENDATION)<br />
<br />
This gets my highest recommendation. I can’t really delve into the story because of spoilers, as this is the third series. It’s a stand alone OVA. But, it’s a good chance for me to pimp out Crest of the Stars, Banner of the Stars, and Banner of the Stars II.<br />
<br />
The OVA was very touching and at the end, sad. I literally found myself in goosebumps and misty eyed at the end of the OVA, and I was REALLY happy to see Lafiel and Jinto together again. This series is based on the fourth book (Seikai no Senki III), and rushes through it a lot, but it was sastifactory even though I would have rather had another 13 episode series. <br />
<br />
The Fifth book might have a series devoted to it, however. To summarize what the series is about, Lafiel is part of an Abh race that came to rule the universe (or rather, to them, the Universe is their home) and Jinto comes from a planet that was conquered by them (rather easily, I might add). Through various means, Jinto was crowned the ruler of his System. So he became part of the Abh.<br />
<br />
This basically goes over their adventures together, with a heavy emphasis on developing Lafiel and Jinto’s relationship rather than the war that is going on. Licensed by Geneon, the first three series are already available in complete collections for cheap.<br />
<br />
Basilisk ~Kouga Ninpou Chou~- B<br />
<br />
In my last post, I dismissed this show as yet another ninja show. I take those words back. This show is bloody great. Not because of the story, but the fights, especially later on, are very intense. Shounen fans (Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, etc) and Ninja fans (Jubei-chan, Ninja Scroll, etc) will absolutely love this series. It is being released by Funimation, and I recommend this shoow highly.<br />
<br />
The basic premise is about two ninja clans with hundreds of years of grudges against each other are made to fight each other for a hidden reason that neither know, which got into the way of a marriage between the heirs of the clans which may have ceased their hatred for each other.<br />
<br />
Bokusatsu Tenshi! Dokuro-chan! – B-<br />
<br />
I praised this show highly last time, but I’m not as enthaustic about this show. As I predicted, but wished against, the show became very redundant. The first two episodes were awesome and well worth checking out, however the next four have been pretty much the same thing.<br />
<br />
I still like it because it’s still different than any anime out there, but it’s not near as funny as the first two episodes are. The basic premise is an Angel from the future came to kill a guy who was going invent immortality but consequently caused all women to stop aging past 12 years old, presumably out of his pedophilic wish. But instead of killing him, she fell in love with him sort of.<br />
<br />
Eureka Seven – C+<br />
<br />
I have an heavy bias against mecha, so my judgement of this show probably is unfair. I got hooked on the characters very fast, because they are very unique characters. But after 13 episodes, I don’t feel like anything interesting is happening. I can’t say much about the mecha combat, but I did not feel positive or negative about them.<br />
<br />
The characters are interesting, but too much time is spent on the main character and the black hole of personality Rei-clone, Eureka. The overall story isn’t going anywhere.<br />
<br />
Eyeshield 21 – C+<br />
<br />
I don’t find this show exceptional or bad, just average. The style of the show is funny, and it’s surely way over the top. At the very least, it’s more fun than watching RL football. But it’s way too cheesy, and a wimpy main always drives me nuts. The chick is cute, but that’s about it.<br />
<br />
Hardcore anime sport fans will probably love it. Everyone else, it’s hit and miss really. I’d highly recommend Hajime no Ippo over this, any day, if you’re looking to pick up a sports anime.<br />
<br />
Gokujou Seitokai – B-<br />
<br />
This is somewhat of a guilty pleasure. Tons of your typical harem girls… without the guy. I really like it and the melodrama is great. I find myself laughing a lot at the show, Kanade is really fun to watch. And I love how the girls just accept the puppet like it’s no big deal, even though he has a mind of his own when they are on other people’s hands!<br />
<br />
There’s about… no fanservice. Well there’s that one swimsuit episode, but the person we most wanted to see in a swimsuit was in the most de-bonerifying one possible. It’s just a fun show where you can watch a lot of girls go about their everyday (if a bit unbelievable and extreme) lives.<br />
<br />
Gun X Sword- C-<br />
<br />
I really don’t know what to say about this show. I almost turned the show off halfway through the first episode because I felt like I was having Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, etc banged into my head going “THIS IS COOL, ITS REALLY COOL GOD DAMN IT, TRULY!!!!” When it’s just cheesy and stupid.<br />
<br />
But, the third episode redeemed the show a bit for me when they had the parody of Sentai shows (power rangers, etc). I was really laughing my ass off at it.<br />
<br />
But I don’t really recommend it, it’s probably fated to run itself down into a fiery death. I’ll watch two more and see if it can redeem itself further, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Hachimatsu to Clover (Honey to Clover – B+<br />
<br />
This is a fun slice-of-life show. It’s exceptional because it is centered around college students, rather than the usual middle school or high school. It really reminded me what it was like when I lived in a Dorm, so I was amused and nostilagic. The art is wonderful and the story and development is very wonderful. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys the slice of life genre, or is looking for a more mature version of typical bishoujo anime.<br />
<br />
He is My Master – C<br />
<br />
Well. It serves it’s purpose, at least. Nonexistent story, nonexistent character development, overexistent fanservice. The main male lead is fun, anyway. He’s a pervert and a otaku thorough and thorough. So my fantasies got a little carried away. I enjoy this show to watch after a hard day’s work. It’s basically about maids in skimpy uniforms. Um. That’s it. Yeah.<br />
<br />
Ichigo Mashimaro – A<br />
<br />
Ok, I’m terribly biased. Horrendously and insanely biased. I LOVE, ADORE, IDOLIZE, WORSHIP all things cute. Ichigo Mashimaro is exactly that. It’s about a group of 10-12 year old girls acting cute. That’s it. The girl in my avatar is from Ichigo Mashimaro. She’s cute. Very cute. Absurbdly cute. So is everyone else. If I was in the show, I would be almost exactly like Nobue. If you watch it you will understand. <br />
<br />
All the show is about, is them being cute. Got it? Nothing else. There’s no story. They JUST ARE CUTE. God damn it, get it? You better.<br />
<br />
Kamichu! – A+ (Highest Recommendation)<br />
<br />
Ok, the crowning hit anime of the season. No four ways about it. This is what would happen if Studio Ghibli did an TV series. The animation is super high quality, and the story is very wonderful like a Ghibli film would be. If you liked Spirited Away, you’ll love this show.<br />
<br />
The premise is that a middle school girl, suddenly became God. But she doesn’t know what she’s the God of. (we’re talking about the, “there’s a god of everything” type of god in Buddhism I believe,. God of Luck, God of Water, etc, not the Christian version) It’s a refreshing change of pace from your typical anime.<br />
<br />
The story is episodic, with a running theme of finding out what exactly is she the God of, and what she is supposed to do as a God. She is absurbdly cute, too, which scores points with me. One of the things that strike me as very fascinating about this show is how everyone just accepts that she’s the God. She just walked into school one day, and said… “Hey… guess what? I became God last night” and that was that. The Prime Minister asks her to deal with UFO’s. Literally. She had a tag that said, “God” on it.<br />
<br />
MaRChen Awakens Romance – C-<br />
<br />
I am not a big fan of Shounen in general. And MAR is your general shounen. Nothing that stands out about it at all. If you really love the genre, you’ll like this, as it’s the same fundamentally as all other shounen in existence. The execution is not as well done as Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach. Recommended for Shounen fans, all others avoid unless you have time to kill.<br />
<br />
Monster – A+ (Highest Recommendation)<br />
<br />
Probably one of the most intelligent, if not THE most intelligent anime to ever grace television. In fact, probably one of the most intelligent of ANY show in the world to grace entertainment.<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend it, without a doubt. I can’t really put the premise into words. It’s so complicated. A doctor saved the life of a child who got shot in the head, only to find out he is a person horrible beyond all imagination. To atone for the sin of bringing him back to life, he hunts down Johan to kill him.<br />
<br />
VERY highly recommended for ANYONE. A must-watch.<br />
<br />
Okusama wa Joshikosei (My Wife is a High Schooler) – C+<br />
<br />
A very average show. The only thing it really has going for it is the fact that the characters begin married, rather than at the beginning of a relationship. She is very aggressive and trying to get the guy to have sex with her. The guy doesn’t want to because it would annul their marriage if the father finds out.<br />
<br />
The wife is very sexy. Curves, tits, ass. Lots of fanservice. Good to watch without thinking.<br />
<br />
Okusama wa Mahou Shoujo (My Wife is a Magical Girl) – B-<br />
<br />
It’s a good show for what it’s trying to do. Ureshiko is very, very sexy and cute. I love how she talks like a kid, even though she’s an adult. That really makes her sound very sexy.<br />
<br />
Basically, the world is given to one mahou shoujo to manage the world. Once the girl kisses, or gets too old, they can no longer be a mahou shoujo. And the new one will remake the world. But the current mahou shoujo who manages the world does not want the world her mother created to be changed for a variety of reasons. She is not allowing the heir to the manager position to take it, against the council’s wishes.<br />
<br />
It’s very erotic in many ways. The girls get their mahou shoujo uniform when they are 12, and they don’t get new ones. So uh, put a 12 year old girl’s skintight uniform on a very sexy 20+ year old woman, what happens? Fortunately, you DON’T have to leave that to your imagination :p<br />
<br />
Petopeto-san – B+<br />
<br />
It’s a moe~ anime. Very, very cute. Petopeto is wonderful, and I love how she thinks of herself. She’s an eroero monster! A race of perverted monsters! It’s so fun and it makes her so adorable. <br />
<br />
The world has monsters and humans coexist with each other. Monsters have the form of a human, unless I presume they choose to go back to their monster form. A school recently made it so that Monsters and Humans go to school together. It’s currently a story about how both try to live with each other and how to deal with each other.<br />
<br />
Petopeto has a problem. If people touch her skin, they stick to her. The only way to unstuck, is if both go to sleep. *cough* see where this leads. EROERO MONSTER! She catches people and make them do suki suki things :p<br />
<br />
It’s very cute and enjoyable. I would say it’s something of a cross between Ichigo Mashimaro and Kamichu! Recommend this a lot.<br />
<br />
Pani Poni Dash! – B+<br />
<br />
Becky!!!!!! <br />
<br />
Ahem. Sorry. Cute things. *.* Becky is cute. :/ Broken record. Very Azumanga Daioh and Sensei no Ojikan (Doki Doki School Hours)-like in nature. Don’t think anyone doesn’t know what Azumanga is already. Just a slice of life about girls having fun.<br />
<br />
Shuffle! – B<br />
<br />
Well, a Ero-game adaptation. No actual ero in it though, but some panty shots. Pretty girls, pretty much a harem. A male lead that’s actually interesting. If you like Kanon, Air, KimiNozo, etc, you’ll like this. I can’t really say much more because it’s pretty generic ero-game.<br />
<br />
Zipang – A<br />
<br />
Another high recommendation. What if the Aegis ship was sent back in time to WW2? How would the tides of war change? The crew aboard the new Aegis battleship is faced with difficult decisions. Should they take part of WW2 and turn the tide of war into Japan’s favor, or should they avoid it as much as possible so as not to change the inevitable future where Japan would get hit by the atomic bomb?<br />
<br />
It’s a difficult choice to make for those aboard it who have had families hurt by WW2. The question of morality becomes more difficult when they save a man from the past, who was supposed to die in WW2, and brought him aboard the ship. What does he think? What are his feelings?<br />
<br />
It’s a very gripping story that everyone should watch.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask me for links to any of the series, I will be happy to help you find them. www.Animesuki.com (http://www.Animesuki.com) is a good place to start on your own. I will be adding some more summaries for other series, such as:<br />
<br />
Da Capo S2<br />
Daddy Long Legs<br />
Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid<br />
Koi Koi 7<br />
Tide Line Blue<br />
The Snow Queen<br />
Zettai Shounen<br />
<br />
Sometime this week, unless someone else wants to tackle them. But, at the very least, I will say Daddy Long Legs and The Snow Queen have my recommendation, with Daddy Long Legs being a World Masterpiece Theater anime.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask me any questions.</div></div><hr />

Woot more Air like anime hehe. I find these type of anime's have very high quality artwork.<br />
<br />
Kamichu! – A+ (Highest Recommendation)<br />
<br />
Not many esp yet. Did this anime just start?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-13-05, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't really say Shuffle! is like AIR. The comparision was that they were both ero-games. It's more like To Heart than anything else.<br />

Kamichu! didn't just start, but it took a long time for people to deciede to fansub it. So the process is going slow.</div></div><hr />

Ah ok. I just really like the artwork that seems to follow the ero-games is what i was trying to lead too but failed :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-13-05, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, sorry, thought you were referring to plot. But yeah artistically it's similar to all other ero-game adaptations. One bonus is that in the anime, lots of the bishoujo's have elf-like ears. (to symbolize the difference between a God and Demon) which is almost every Fantasy gamer's wet dream come true.<br />
<br />
A interesting tidbit, albeit pointless. Shuffle! the game released on the same day as Fate//Stay Night (soon to be an anime, too, part of the Tsukihime world) which many people thought took some balls of steel.<br />
<br />
Suprisingly, it ended up selling very well, but nowhere near as well as Fate//Stay Night.</div></div><hr />

My Favorite atm. Character-based drama, and the art style is like a washed out watercolor. just badass all around.<br />
 <br />
Just watched the first 8 eps of Shuffle!, I agree that having an interesting male lead for once makes a difference. Vioce sounds familiar as hell, for some reason. Foe sure gonna follow this series.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Bokusatsu Tenshi! Dokuro-chan<br />
Yeah, I called this one. Sure enough, it got old once the novelty wore off. watched ep 5, never got around to 6. Prolly never will. 'Bad things happening to nice guy that he cannot do anything about and everyone is totally apetetic to it' just irks me.<br />
 <br />
Gokujou Seitokai <br />
hahaha... agree with stalkyr. Suprisingly good anime with no fanservice and good character interaction in a format/location where niether is usually true.<br />
 <br />
Honey &amp; Clover<br />
Other than makin' it me new avatar, and saying how much I :heartloved:heart it a few posts up.. Yeah, it's college, with tiny artists and psychopathic money-loving fools and overly romantic pottery sculptors and very expressive dogs with the odd romantic triangle thrown in. It just screams 'style' like Samurai Champloo, but instead of being action driven, the plot moves you along like in a dream.<br />
 <br />
He is My Master <br />
Didn't really like it all too much- the ending ruined it for me (saw it coming a mile away). Was hoping they'd do something else, ah well. If ya like kinky maid costumes, and a little sister with no moral code whatsoever, this is yer series.<br />
 <br />
Shuffle! <br />
Oddly, the 'lead' three females are the least interesting so far. The best moments come from the support cast, such as the Fathers, Asa-sempai, Primula, ect. Wish they'd spend more time on the guy (god why cant i remember his name!). I mean, he has the chance to become either god or satan, yet he never is shown thinking about it. Or any of the women, exept when he has to interact with 'em.... maybe he just hasn't realised the daughters of heaven and hell want him?? No, he does.. Maybe he's totally in denial????? dunno...</div></div><hr />

i on the other hand enjoyed EyeShield , and i think it made me enjoy the longest Yard more  since i had a bit of knowlage about misnammed game<br />

and about the wimpy main , its the trend now in anime it seem , its  a flood of harem anime these days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-14-05, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I wouldn't call it a trend.

Solanar, normally what you just said wouldn't help, but mentioning Firefly is for the win. Cowboy Bebop is what you want to begin with. It's availble for purchase, and to your luck, DVDPlanet is having a 50% off all anime DVD's sale until the 26th! :D<br />

Both are episodic, bounty hunters who are always broke with a crew, both like to **** up a lot and come out on top on the end, both always take on the worst jobs. It's way too alike to be a coincidence.</div></div><hr />

Heh Cowboy Bebop is a great start. It helped me get into anime really. A lot of ppl liked to watch Akira first (dunno why heh was a long time ago) but i hated it. Hope that does not make me strange :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happened to Full Metal Panic the 2nd Raid review? It rocks!<br />
<br />
Trinity Blood - not your normal run of the mill vampyres confusing story but other than that an interesting watch non the less.<br />
<br />
Never got into monster past 13 ep.. maybe I should try again heh.. I don't know about smartest anime out there but Ghost in the Shell 1st and 2nd seasons are very hard to beat.</div></div><hr />

Ya if you want different and somewhat confusing vampyre anime try Tsukuyomi ~ Moon Phase ~ :P. But the artwork is pretty good in it tho.<br />
<br />
Awww the first few esp of Monster had to be the best hehe. But it does get a lot more insteresting later on hehe.<br />
<br />
Aye the Ghost In A Shell stand alone series is great if your into the whole tech future thing hehe.<br />
<br />
Btw that avatar is nice suzuka :). Damn cat ears =^.^= :P.</div></div><hr />

What is that WIerd place you speak of? ~_~;;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-14-05, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did mention FMP TSR, just that I would review it later. I wanted to watch some more of it before I deciede to review it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call Tsukuyomi ~Moon Phase~ a similar vampire anime to Trinity Blood, well with the exception of the presence of vampires. But still very worth watching. I loved it. Neko mimi :D<br />
<br />
I love the opening and closing of it. So awesome. Been collecting the figures and gasaphons of the series.<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys didn't get the same effect from Akira. It certainly does not seem as impressive anymore given the wealth of exposure anime gets now. But for the time when I watched it, the only other anime to compare it to was pretty much the bastardized Dragon Ball, er what else was there. Not much else.<br />
<br />
Most people who praise it now look through their own feelings in the past, so it's pretty much considered a classic.<br />
<br />
The manga, however, is far, far, far better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">09-14-05, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Akira was my introduction as well, back in the mid 90s.  I didn't have a clue what was going on, but goddamn, it was fun to watch.  These days I would start someone out with a cocktail of Hayao Miyazaki, Shinichiro Watanabe, and Satoshi Kon.  If at least one of those directors doesn't blow you away, it's anime doesn't really hold anything for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who just couldn't take Honey &amp; Clover?  I watched four or five episodes, and it was showing flashes of brilliance, but Hagu seriously creeped me out.  It's proved popular enough that I'll probably give it another try if it gets an R1 release, but until then, I prefer my lolis in their natural environment, not surrounded by college-age guys.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, /second the recommendation of Kamichu.  It's gorgeous, it's sweet, it's funny, what's not to like?  Well, I did find the Martian episode to be a little outlandish and sappy, but otherwise its been absolutely fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">09-14-05, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little OT but Paranoia Agent and Gunslinger Girl are also good anime to watch. Even if these have been out awhile there worth the watch. There kinda like Monster in that they kinda make you think IMO.</div></div><hr />
