<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pearll</div><div class="date">01-07-05, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, from the clips on their site, they've got some interesting episodes of some of their shows coming up.  Super Milk Chan looks good.  Cowboy Bebop has one of my favorite episodes.  Full Metal Alchemist looks a little strange, but it has to be better than the episode with the chimera (not that it was a bad episode, but it makes me a little sick every time I see it).<br />
<br />
There is one thing that I haven't seen yet though...  What the hell is Kikaider?<br />
<br />
The beginning of the clip looked pretty good, but all of a sudden it did this magical girl transformation, turning a character into something that vaguely looks like Ultraman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-07-05, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't like Super Milk-chan.  You're better off not watching Kikaider, it's one of those shows that were brought over because it was ridicilously cheap and horrible.<br />
<br />
Fullmetal Alchemist is an anime that will make you feel sick very often. It pulls no punches. It is without a doubt one of the better anime in the last few decades, however. It's not really something I'd advise watching unless you can see it in chronological order.<br />
<br />
About Super Milk-chan, there is a small cult following of it. But it could never appeal to me, so I gave up on it.</div></div><hr />

Ditto Soulstealer.<br />
<br />
This show takes about 5 jokes and repeats them over and over until I'm ready to throw my TV out the window.  This show could easily be 15 minutes long if they'd cut out the dead time.<br />
<br />
Now Venture Brothers, that's a good show.</div></div><hr />

Oh don't get me started on Tom goes to the mayor...  Some mentally challenged 5th graders instructing a monkey on crak could make a more entertaining show with power point, and i bet it would have more actual animation in it too!<br />

<br />
Cowboy Bebop, FLCL, Trigun...those were good and fun.  Inuyasha is...eh.  Family Guy and Futurama are good, but I've seen every episode 10 times already.  Wolf Rain?  Boring and tedious.  Witch Hunter Robin had potential, but again, it was just...eh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There arent words to describe how much Super Milk Chan sucks. Maybe i just dont get it... or maybe it's just BAD.<br />
<br />
Tom Goes to the Mayor is a waste of 15 minutes. Ive never not laughed for so long watching a &quot;comedy&quot; show on AS. Even the bad episodes of Sealab get a laugh out of me.<br />
<br />
Venture Brothers is GOLD. I like it ALOT. Its the good kinda random (unlike Milk Chan)<br />
<br />
Case Closed looked bad but i watched it and i was inexplicably hooked.<br />
<br />
Adult Swim schedules are on adultswim.com  and they have episode descriptions as well.<br />
<br />
IMO Adult Swim hasnt seen anything as bad as Tom and Milk Chan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">01-08-05, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tom Goes to The Mayor is terrible.  Really, really, awful.  It needs to be gone.  NOW.<br />
<br />
Super Milk-chan, I've heard, has a ton of Japanese culture references.  Maybe it's funnier there.  I watched it once, and it dragged on way too long. <br />
<br />
I've never been a big fan of Aqua Teen.  In order for complete randomness to be funny, it has to have some sort of realistic framework.  a really flimsy one, like Futurama uses, works just fine.  But without any frame of reference, it just makes me go o_0.  Maybe it's funnier if you're high.  <br />
<br />
Wolf's Rain is just incredible.  I've missed parts, so I'm glad they sem to be repalying the whole thing.  Beautiful and heartbreaking.  <br />
<br />
Witch Hunter Robin...it just leaves out too many things, almost all of which would be a lot more interesting than what they left in.  Do they hunt all witches, or just the ones that commit crimes? If Amon only has a latent power, Sakaki's got nothing, Doujima's has Being Related To Somebody Important, and the other girl has the most absolutely useless telepathy I've ever heard of, how the hell do they do anything without Robin?  Just what happened to the person Robin replaced?  What was their power?  What's up with the Orbo?  What goes on in the factory? (these might be answered in later episodes, but I had mostly given up on it by then.) Why is half of every episode taken up by Robin staring at her cappucino? What's with all the shameless deus ex machinas? (&quot;Dum de dum, just driving around...hey!  A warehouse!  I wonder if the group I'm about to join just happens to be fighting a witch in there?&quot;)   All in all, it had some potential, but ended up sucking mightilly. <br />
<br />
Case Closed is pretty darn good, though having somebody get violently murdered every episode becomes a downer after awhile. One little thing;  YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE EVERY SINGLE DAMN NAME TO SOMETHING GENERICALLY WESTERN. AMERICANS AREN'T SO CRIPPLINGLY STUPID THAT WE CAN'T DEAL WITH NAMES WE'RE UNFAMILLIAR WITH.  REALLY.<br />
Sorry.  Just a pet peeve of mine.<br />
<br />
I'm really liking Full Metal Alchemist already. It manages to deal with some dark themes without becoming oppressive.  Wish I hadn't missed the one with the chimera.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstealer</div><div class="date">01-08-05, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">every single one of your questions about Witch Hunter Robin are answered... but mostly in the last very few episodes up to that point it seems to try and just keep building it all up. <br />
<br />
and ill try and sum them up in a spoiler of course...<br />
[spoiler:085120c87a]Pretty much every witch they can find they take, it just so happens that the essayist way to find a witch is look for ones using their power to gain power,money,respect in a criminal way. The Factory is where they take the captured witches, In the Factory they test the witches and either deem them as usable, or destroy them. When deemed usable they are put in some whacked out machine that sucks them dry to make the Orbo fluid. The person Robin replaced was killed by Amon because her power was growing and was deemed to dangerous (also explaining why everyone who is on the team has very weak to useless powers).  Yes you find all this out after Robins power starts to grow and the higher ups send Amon after her like he was sent after the one she replaced, but after he fails a few times he realizes the higher ups are whack jobs bent on getting rid of all the witches and helps her destroy infiltrate the Factory. While in the factory they find out Robin is some kind of geneticly enhanced super witch project. They set off some selfe defence thingy that sets off a self distruct reaction in in the factory, they both disappear and are labeled dead but we know better. The end. [/spoiler:085120c87a]<br />
there i summed up the entire story in one paragraph... <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they should use all the bad anime as fodder for an anime equivilent to MST3K. <br />
<br />
thats a damn good idea!!!</div></div><hr />

Friday is &quot;switch over to TBS cause they're showing Futurama, Family Guy, and Mr. Show&quot; night.   :)<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd just like to add that I also think Tom Goes To The Mayor is horrible, and I don't understand why CN thinks it's so great.  I'd rather watch the worst episode of The Brak Show more than the best episode of TGttM.</div></div><hr />

I liked Wolf's Rain alot, though I found some of the dialogs to be needlessly long and wordy.<br />
<br />
Case Closed was good as well, but alot of the supporting characters looked too similar and the circumstances were just strange.  There was a murder (or a mystery, as were the cases involving the Jr. Detective League) just about every place that they went, even on pleasure trips and the like.<br />
<br />
I'm really liking Full Metal Alchemist already. It manages to deal with some dark themes without becoming oppressive. Wish I hadn't missed the one with the chimera.<br />
It's called The Night the Chimera Cried, for future reference.  It was a great episode, but the story behind it gave me a queasy, disguested feeling.  Not that it was grotesque, but (without giving anything away) the fact that somebody could do something like that.<br />
<br />
As for Tom Goes to the Mayor...  I've made better cartoons on an Etch-a-Sketch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't eat for a few days before you watch the rest of Fullmetal Alchemist, then! :p<br />
<br />
Super Milk-chan wasn't popular in Japan either. A lot of anime you see that you thought &quot;sucked&quot; would have sucked in Japan too. They are just titles grabbed because they were cheap and could make a decent profit off of.<br />
<br />
As said before, most of the questions are answered in the last half of the series in Witch Hunter Robin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is something that happened during the story. How do I explain this. The timeline that Fullmetal Alchemist is on, it took place sometime inside of it, but was not told in the series.<br />
<br />
Like, for instance, the Naruto movie was an &quot;side story&quot;. Ha, that's the word I was looking for. The FMA Movie is a side story.</div></div><hr />

So true. Witch Hunter Robin had potential but it just isnt very good. I cant get around how clueless the characters are sometimes. The end just seems like it barely holds together to me. And after the whole series builds you up way too much for what it is gives you in the end. Not to mention that when they reveal important information its like once an episode in a flash. In the when I put the pieces together i found it hard to grasp. I liked the first episode... i think.<br />
<br />
As for Wolfs Rain, the first few episodes were awesome to me. After that, however when the story starts comming together there are alot of episodes that are just too bland for my tastes. Th stuff that happens is really uninteresting. There are some exceptions like when the story has its little twists. And then the ending... oh, the ending. It was just messed up. Moonlight Crucible was pretty cool though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? Either I haven't been paying attention, or that was a new addition to the US version.<br />
<br />
The only time jumps I am aware of are:<br />
<br />
[spoiler:bafc1e161d]In the beginning, when they were kids. And at the end, when, well, after the ending.[/spoiler:bafc1e161d]<br />
<br />
There shouldn't be anytime jumps other than those two. Which really are negligable time jumps since it does that in the first episode, and in the last episode. Everything in between should be in more or less chronological order.</div></div><hr />

Most of the new shows are garbage.  FMA is probably the best new one.  Ghost has been disappointing.  Super Milk is 5 minutes of the same frames repeated over with different dialogue for every episode.  The Adult Swim originals, all suck.  Some episodes have their moments but not enough to justify watching any of them.  I think one of the better shows on CN is actually Teen Titans.</div></div><hr />

Buy me a rocking chair over at Cracker Barrel, Henry.  I needs something to set on when I'm out on the porch to watch that the whippersnappers don't walk onto the lawn.</div></div><hr />

Overall, Adult Swim is really good, but Sunday nights have been bad lately, since they have episodes of Tom and Milk Chan taking up so much valuable time.  I wish they would show Home Movies more often, and even pick up Dr. Katz from Comedy Central, which I suspect was made by the same people.<br />
<br />
The other shows are generally on too late, so I haven't watched them.</div></div><hr />

That's like saying &quot;Yeah, FLCL sucked, but Yu-Gi-Oh is teh complete pwn&quot;.<br />

Yugioh IS teh complete pwn!<br />

Gotta watch it in subbed japanese though.  Anime elitism makes everything better.<br />

Teen Titans is also awsome.</div></div><hr />

Every time I've seen it, it has either been the episode with the girl that controls rock and betrays them, or it is the episode where Starfire has the big worm pet.</div></div><hr />

It's another one that has a story I might like if only I didn't have to endure the show to get it.</div></div><hr />

Big O feels like it was meant to be a movie, but was stretched into a series by dumping in the 'monster of the week' style of filling episodes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not saying that if its not anime I wont watch it.  Just that I never really got into the batman one either because of the art, so the same goes for this one.</div></div><hr />

They sound almost exactly alike which really stinks.  Because only Spike should have the cool voice!</div></div><hr />

First MGS2, then Pulp Fiction, then a bunch of cartoons, then the other day I'm listening to the commentary on the Invader Zim DVD I rented, and the very first episode they say, &quot;Oh, didn't Phil LaMarr do his voice?&quot;<br />
<br />
AUUUUGH!</div></div><hr />

I hated Big O, was just inane, boring, and repetitive. Besides TT I seem to watch only futurama and family guy, :( gotta go to bed at midnight.</div></div><hr />
