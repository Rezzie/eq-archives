<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vanidor Silverbranch</div><div class="date">03-26-03, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for a copy of the text or better yet screenshots of either of these books. Does anyone happen to have them?<br />
<br />
I believe the &quot;Letter to Phara Dar&quot; drops from Korocust. And the &quot;Korucust's report to the Di'Zok&quot; might alternate with the   book &quot;Korucust's report on Vraysk&quot; from Prince Selrach Di'Zok but I'm not entirely sure. Both reports from Korocust exist. Btw, the items are spelled Korucust but the NPC is Korocust so that's likely a typo VI made.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to put together all the text's details and like previous people figure out if there's anything behind it or at least provide one complete set of details for others to study.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

The face      rucust came to me in a dream last night.  Koruc     ooked at me from a mirror.  His face replaced tha      ine in the reflection.  I saw anot     ace in the shadows of the mirror.  I cou    ot make it out, but the stench of decay led me to assum Loyal ser          he Ring,                              Vra<br />

CHA2not2:<br />
Master Druushk,<br />
Several visions have come to me in my sleep over the past week.  These dreams could not have been of my own creation.  There is some force moving around me that I cannot identify.  I fear that this presence will make itself known soon.  I must assume at this time that Korucust is working to expose me.  Perhaps he has gained some understanding of my true nature.  I do not know why he would play these games rather than just expose me to the council.<br />
Loyal servant of the Ring,<br />
Vrasyk<br />
<br />
<br />
CHA2not3:<br />
Mistress Dar,<br />
I have not received a response from Master Druushk in some time.  Please let me know what you would have me do.  Is there a problem within the Ring that I am not aware of?  Your lack of a response has left me no choice but to begin preparations to evacuate this position. I have requested time away from my seat on the council for reasons of my health.  None of the Di'zok have shown any sign of suspicion.<br />
Loyal servant of the Ring,<br />
Vrasyk<br />
<br />
<br />
CHA2not4:<br />
My liege and fellow servants<br />
of Dizok,<br />
<br />
After several weeks of <br />
surveillance, I was able to <br />
discover the true nature of <br />
council member Ka'Jiq.  This <br />
person and several others were<br />
agents put in place by the <br />
Ring of Scale.  Ka'Jiq's true <br />
name was Vrasyk, a creature <br />
capable of changing its shape <br />
to match that of our own.  The<br />
couriers and other attendants <br />
that he employed appeared to <br />
be of a similar background.  <br />
Those creatures were <br />
dispatched as well.<br />
<br />
Please remember that this sort<br />
of treachery is completely <br />
within the power of the foul <br />
brood that seeks to manipulate<br />
us.<br />
<br />
There is only one way to find <br />
all of the traitors within our<br />
ranks.  I will need the full <br />
authority of the council and <br />
family Di'zok to flush out <br />
this filth.<br />
<br />
Your most loyal servant and <br />
seeker of truth,<br />
Korucust<br />
<br />
<br />
CHA2not5:<br />
My liege and fellow servants <br />
of Di'zok,<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in my initial <br />
report, the evidence of a <br />
conspiracy within our ranks <br />
has been coming to me in <br />
bloody fistfuls.  My disgust <br />
in this matter only helps to <br />
drive me forward in my <br />
investigation.  I will rid our<br />
people of the disease that has<br />
brought treachery and <br />
suspicion to our very home.  I<br />
will personally rip the flesh <br />
from the bones of any who dare<br />
to conspire against our <br />
people.<br />
<br />
I must thank you again for <br />
your generous acceptance and <br />
nomination to the council.  <br />
The opportunity to sit at the <br />
glorious feet of the Di'zok <br />
family, is a most gracious <br />
blessing.  I feel that my <br />
discovery of the traitor and <br />
his followers was a gift... a <br />
gift that now allows me to <br />
better server the blessed <br />
family Di'zok.<br />
<br />
I humbly thank you for your <br />
support in this matter.<br />
<br />
Your most loyal servant and <br />
seeker of truth,<br />

Sire,<br />
We are set.<br />
All of our elements are in place.<br />
Your servant,<br />
Korucust<br />
<br />
CHA2not7:<br />
Father,<br />
I, as well as many of our council members, do not feel comfortable with the power that has been given to Korucust.  This concern must be seen as valid.  Korucust has his expanded reach through his use of terror and false accusations.  I fail to see the conspiracy that he keeps referring to and caution you to reconsider giving him any more power over our soldiers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vanidor Silverbranch</div><div class="date">03-31-03, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I've posted your text to the Old Unsolved Quests in Everquest forum Thorvari, its very very helpful. The thread is at here for anyone interested but I'm posting to both for the moment: pub8.ezboard.com/foldunso...D=65.topic<br />
<br />
This all presumes there is at least one quest btw.<br />
<br />
Quick first note, Korocust and his courier are spelled that way, notes are spelled with Korucust for<br />
some reason. Unless there have been changes to one or the other since the info I have.<br />
<br />
Okay, Vrasyk reported to Druushk (dragon in VP), who reported to Phara Dar(leader of RoS in VP). He was<br />
on the council of the Di'Zok, presumeably one that advises the royalty of Chardok.<br />
<br />
'A Captured Message' seems to be the precusor to the Blood Stained Note. It's from Vraysk and warns his<br />
sleep is being disturbed by visions and he worried Korucust is working to expose him. Unknown where it drops.<br />
<br />
Interrogator Gi'mok has the 'Blood Stained Note' which is Vrasyk -&gt; Druushk. He spawns in Korucust's room.<br />
<br />
Korocust (spelled Korucust also) has the 'Message to Phara Dar' which might be a fake Vrasyk note. It<br />
somewhat seems to fit after the other two notes in trying to bypass Druushk who he has no replies<br />
from. However the fact that the Interrogator has the 'Blood Stained Note' which makes me wonder if Vrasyk's<br />
dead and Korocust made up a note that doesn't mention him but still links Vrasyk with the Ring of Scale.<br />
<br />
Prince Selrach Di'Zok drops 'Korucust's report on Vrasyk' which makes it clear that Vrasyk is exposed and<br />
that he and his couriers/attendants were disposed of.<br />
<br />
'Korocust's report to the Di'Zok' seems to be set after 'Korucust's report on Vrasyk' in that he is trying<br />
to link a traitor he found to a conspiracy of traitors he's tracking down. He's thankful of being elevated<br />
to the Council, likely in the spot Vrasyk had. Unknown where it drops.<br />
<br />
Overking Balthezid drops 'Note from Prince Selrach' warning about Korocust gaining power through hunting<br />
traitors.<br />
<br />
Courier of Korocust has 'Korucust's note to Venril' which says all elements are in place, he's ready,<br />
and that Venril Sathir is Korocust's master. He has a potion with an effect of gate to Overthere. He spawns<br />
somewhere in Korocust's room.<br />
<br />
Accused Traitor spawns in Korocust's room on 20min? timer but is killed by others. He was KoS to someone<br />
on good Chardok faction I believe. No faction hits for killing but might only be receptive to Ring of<br />
Scale or Minnons of Scale faction (god I hope not Minnons). He doesn't seem to have any drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
Todo list:<br />
1) find out from who A Captured Message, and Korocust's report to the Di'Zok drop.<br />
2) charm the traitor and hail him and see what happens, will enchanter automatically be attacked by others?<br />
<br />
Possible solutions:<br />
1) hand in 'Korucust's note to Venril' or 'Blood Stained Note' to Accused Traitor (check if he'll return<br />
an unimportant item first) and see if he's happy that Korocust is a traitor.<br />
2) hand in 'Note from Prince Selrach' to Korocust<br />
3) hand in 'Korucust's note to Venril' or 'Blood Stained Note'(they might realize Vrasyk's hint on VS)<br />
to each of the Royals<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
1) It's not clear if the Courier of Korocust's death lowers Sarnak faction but since everything else in<br />
that room does except the Accused Traitor I would assume so. Meaning a KoS group can kill him and hand over<br />
the note to a non kos person.<br />
2) Similar things can be done with the other notes</div></div><hr />

About Korucust report to the Di'Zok, after a dozen of royal family raids, I saw only one dropping. If my memory is good, it was in the royal library area. I am pretty sure it was not in Korocust room, because we usually don't clean it on royal family raids. If you are looking for this report, you could try to investigate in the library area.<br />

I wish you best luck on your quest  ,<br />

<br />
Quote:a goblin traitor says 'You stand before Charayan, Crusader of Veeshan. I am the talon that justly strikes down our enemies and shall fulfill our destiny in the trials of blood and vengeance.  I sense that the loyalty you bear toward the children of scale is strong but the siren voice that has called you to us is still a whisper upon your mind, and it is a song of curiosity and greed that fuels you yet. Since the dawn of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without tangible reward to do otherwise, your blades would be aimed for our hearts. But do not think we fault you for merely this -- such shallow lusts have become a definition of your kind, and we do not bear you ill will for it. However, the [champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and your past deeds shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us.' <br />
<br />
He wouldn't talk to me about champions or deeds not bearing fruitful.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, I'm not sure the traitor is involved in the above notes.  I'm just working the RoS angle here.<br />

The goblin traitor's text you quoted is just a mistake. That's from a Crusader dragon in Skyshrine for the Sleeper Tomb quests I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can tell from personal experience that charming the traitor in Korocust's room results in no response (no response to my Ally to chardok bard, or my Kos to chardok druid). <br />
<br />
As for the agro part, I honestly don't know, the room was totally clear at the time.</div></div><hr />

After we had done so, inside that room a mob popped that said something about &quot;needing to escape to the Outpost&quot;. Unfortunately, before we had put two and two together, a few sarnaks popped and immediately killed it. Our suspicion is the Courier's potion is intended to be given to this mob (which is on VS faction, we think) when it pops. <br />
<br />
<br />
Would be nice to know which mob needs to escape and give him the gate potion to Overthere and the note to Venril Sathir<br />

When I sit down on his pop spot it attacks me and the other NPC do not attack it. Even after the enchanter faction spells it is kos to me.

<br />
So not the mobs attack the accused traitor, but the accused traitor attacks the mobs. I am kos to Venril btw.<br />
<br />
When charming him and given the note to Venril and the Courier's potion with a gate to Overthere he takes both items without any response. Also no line from him about Overthere, just that he has done nothing when killed and the prince will know about this when he attacks.<br />

I have mezzed the Accused Traitor when he pop'd (mobs don't attack mezzed things) then faded, the golems do not reagro after mez breaks, the traitor is on standard chardok faction and paths from Koro's room to the royals (all the way down to king) and back saying nothing..... don't remember if he responded to hails but I don't think so.<br />
<br />
Got bored of his after several complete pathings and nothing happening so I killed him. I have the note from Koro to VS i'll mez him again and try handing it in maybe even the courier pot my brother has if he gives back the note. (can't lose that if he doesn't return things thats my brothers &quot;get outta the bards mess&quot; potion  )<br />
<br />
also there is a gnomish slave in the mines under the 1st bridge going down can't remember name says something about getting beat if he is caught talking to you, DOES NOT RETURN items (least not my 2nd ring :&quot;&gt;  ) seems new but maybe I've just never noticed him before</div></div><hr />

After charming the accused traitor I gave him the note to VS and the couriers potion. He took both items without saying a worth.:&quot;&gt; <br />

Sitting at his spawn point as an ally to chardok let him attack me while all the other mobs leave him alone. After a mezz and a mem blur he did attack another mob and got killed. <br />
