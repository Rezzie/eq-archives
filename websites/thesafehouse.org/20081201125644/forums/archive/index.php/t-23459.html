<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-19-06, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are the series I am looking foward to, and why.<br />
<br />
Fushigi Boshi no Futago Hime Gyu!<br />
The second season of Futago-Hime. It's an cute and adorable anime about twin princesses of the Sun Kingdom who wish to change the world. I loved the first season, can't wait for this one.<br />
<br />
Black Lagoon<br />
Looks to be a dark and gritty anime with a lot of gunfights and action. The animation is reportedly INCREDIBLE. It'd be a good change from the lighter anime I've been watching lately.<br />
<br />
Aria the Natural<br />
Can't wait for this one, it's very sweet and calming. It makes me feel very relaxed when I watch it. Watching Aria in it's animation form is wonderful, it gives a deeper appreciation for the slowness than the manga.<br />
<br />
School Rumble 2nd Semester<br />
I found the first season to be full of great (and hot) girls, and I'm a sucker for this type of anime. It had it's funny moments. Can't wait.<br />
<br />
Utawarerumono<br />
It'll be nice to see this series. I don't know how many episodes it is, but the game was wonderful. I really can't wait to see it animated. The story is incredible and very engaging. It's made by Leaf. Can't wait.<br />
<br />
Strawberry Panic!<br />
Yuri, school, making out? Sign me up!<br />
<br />
Makai Senki Disgaea<br />
This should go without saying. Etna and Flonne *_* For the sake of love, please die!<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku koroni (Alternative title, WHEN THEY CRY...)<br />
Oh man, I don't know what to say about this game. To call it a thriller isn't enough. It's ******* CREEPY. I mean, beyond ******* creepy. It's about serial murders. Oh man, I don't know where to begin. People die bloody deaths here. I cried a few times :( Man I really really really can't wait for this anime.<br />
<br />
I'll watch anything that gets fansubbed, as usual, and give reviews, but those are what I'm most looking forward to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've also heard the same thing about Air Gear, Shebab. Apparently, it's considered better than the Tenjho Tenge manga (note, not the anime. The manga is a crapload better.) <br />
<br />
Also, his artwork is incredible. It may not be shown in the anime due to different formats, but anyone who has seen Oh! Great's artwork have to love it. I can't wait.</div></div><hr />

See he's actually under the witness protection program. Unfortunately, the agent handling his case is actually on his first day and is the boss' cousin's retarded brother that the boss hired as a favor to his mom. Hence the name change. :smile</div></div><hr />

That is so not allowed. If you get your name changed it has to be to something stupid like, The_Rhubarb_Warrior, not just shortened. :(<br />
<br />
And I liked your first thread better. It was nice with the info just there,and no linkage to follow. Linking is for the birds man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-20-06, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is the first of many articles I will be doing from now on. I will start doing major news reports such as announcements re: Studio Ghibli movies, titles licensed for USA release, and perhaps general news updates.<br />
<br />
So I am open to any ideas on how I should format this. I also had the same feelings as you, Greldek, about how the information is not in this post anymore but in the news article.<br />
<br />
But I realized later that the information is gigantic. We can see how much of the old thread was packed with information, and its only going to get bigger from now on. I felt since most people would only reference to it occassionally, and most of the updates would be within the thread, it would be better to minimize it a bit.<br />
<br />
For instance, I don't know how many people do this, but I read threads from my Blackberry often. Having huge posts to scroll past every time may be annoying. Kind of distracts from the actual discussion.<br />
<br />
However, we could find other solutions to this.  Also any input on how I could improve further quarterly anime info or what types of news posts I should do. What kind of things do you guys want to hear about? I don't really have any intentoon of spamming logged out with misc. News info that nobody particularly cares to hear about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as news goes maybe you could do some updated reports...Like have your initial review then a few eps later have a final review or something. <br />
<br />
Edit: Also do previews like you just did for up and coming anime etc..thats a good thing :P.<br />
<br />
ell, this is the first of many articles I will be doing from now on. I will start doing major news reports such as announcements re: Studio Ghibli movies, titles licensed for USA release, and perhaps general news updates.<br />
<br />
This too is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh and as far as format goes. Maybe you could put each anime under some type of classification. That way ppl can easily scan though it and know what type it is.<br />
<br />
Edit: I know it is hard ehhe. But 2nd post wan't too bad but it would also be nice to know what some anime in the first list are classified as also. <br />
<br />
Edit: I mean you can leave the stuff at the end but maybe try to classify it as what the anime focuses on the most. Heh I dunno just tryin to think of something :P.<br />
<br />
Edit: I know its kinda americanizing things but would be kinda easier to read if your just scaning the list. I would leave the other sub parts in the end like you do tho so ppl know what other kind of events the anime contains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-20-06, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you mean by classification? The whole Shounen, Shoujo, etc thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-26-06, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well while it's not a TV series (the reason I didn't list it above) it's a recently released OVA.<br />
<br />
Kyou no Go no Ni A- (Also known as Kyou no Gononi or Kyou no 5 no 2 and so on.)<br />
I found the episode to be insanely funny. It's described as &quot;The 5th grade you wish you remembered it as&quot; or &quot;The 5th grade that never was&quot;. There's a lot of sexual humor in this (prudes, be warned :p ) especially considering the cast is in 5th grade. But I didn't find that a &quot;downside&quot; because it actually made it way funny.<br />
<br />
For instance, the collarbone episode was crazy funny. Oh man the humor is so out there I don't know how to explain it. It's a must-watch for some adult humor (this is a seinen comedy...). The manga is funny as heck and has many adult situations that the 5th graders get themselves into, which makes the reactions to it hilarious.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for the rest of the OVA's to come out. Supposed to be 5 episodes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-02-06, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another OVA to review.<br />
<br />
Dai Mahou Touge - B-<br />
<br />
So, I've watched the first two episodes of Dai Mahou Touge. I'm immediately reminded of Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan. It's a comedy and a parody of mahou shoujo genre. The Magicial Princess of Magicial Land, Punie, has to come to earth for X amount of time before becoming the Queen (where have I heard this before?)<br />
<br />
I found this equally as amusing as the first two episodes of Bokusatsu Tenshi! Dokuro-chan which I also thought were hilarious. However I'm fearing that it will also go down the same fate- being a one joke show like Dokuro-chan was. As it is, if you liked the first two episodes of Dokuro-chan, you're guaranteed to like the first two of this show at least.<br />
<br />
Her transformation scene is funny, where her catchphrase is &quot;Kill them all!&quot;. There was also a funny part about how she obtains her &quot;mascot character&quot;. I almost had a heart attack, it was too funny. People who watch Mahou Shoujo are more likely to be entertained by this, or at least, those familiar with elements that makes up your typical mahou shoujo show.<br />
<br />
It's got some raunchy humor and ecchi scenes, but nothing too extreme. It's not as in-your-face as Dokuro-chan was, it draws it's humor from being a parody more than it does from over-the-top violence.<br />
<br />
Typically I'd give it an A, but i decieded to step it down as I'm sure the next OVA won't be as funny, however I've been suprised before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-03-06, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the first new episode of the Spring season just got fansubbed. KIBA is out now. My impressionsL<br />
<br />
KIBA D-<br />
<br />
A very generic shounen show. Nothing about this show stands out from what I can see. You've got your typical angsty main character, Zed, who is mad and apparently running around destroying gates randomly because they make him feel confined. I'm not talking about gates surrounding a city or anything. Like, a gate to a store, he destroys it to feel free. W....T....F....?<br />
<br />
And the best friend of the guy who's protecting him for absolutely no reason, other than to keep him free.... apparently to destroy more gates. Ok, I admit I'm being harsh about the gate thing, but I really don't see any redeeming qualities of this show. Your generic &quot;suddenly I'm a badass&quot; guy, a mother who was a looney until it was time for her son to &quot;awaken&quot; and becomes a badass mom, apparently omniscient bad guys who can predict the future for no particular reason (no, they don't really predict the future, they just &quot;know&quot; he's a person to kill before he becomes strong, I guess.)<br />
<br />
It's trying to create a dark world (oh my god, there's no wind in this city! waaaaah) with a grim atmosphere, and ends up looking stupid because of all the things they could deciede that makes the city horrible, it's the lack of wind. W.....T.....F.....????<br />
<br />
Steer way, way clear, for now... I'll put up with another episode, for the sake of being as accurate as someone who hasn't watched the whole series can be, but.... I'm not expecting a grade improvement, that's for certain.</div></div><hr />

Patience, young padawan. It's not even one week since Spring season began! Most of the good ones will have a release within the next two weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-04-06, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ARIA the NATURAL B-<br />
<br />
After last season, I had the same expectations for this season. While the story is entertaining as always, and it never failed to bring a smile to me, and despite the fact I don't put as much emphasis on animation usually... There were a lot of animation issues in the first episode. <br />
<br />
It was stupid obvious they were cutting corners. Missing frames, cheap background art and character loops, jerky animation, etc. It was really bad. With any luck, it's only going to be for this episode.<br />
<br />
However, that aside, the story continues to be heartwarming and lovely. I really, really love Akari's uniform, it's made out of moe and win. If you're looking for an anime to relax to, pick up the first season, ARIA. You don't need to watch ARIA to watch ARIA the NATURAL, but... there's no reason to skip ARIA, it's the same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well, well.. I normally wait for the fansubs, but since so many are looking forward to it... suffice to say the first episode of Disgaea's animation was... not nearly as good as the promo led us to believe. Disappointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-05-06, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah! NOW I can finally recommend something great!! I'll start with the lesser one, Soul Link.<br />
<br />
Soul Link B<br />
<br />
Soul Link is an eroge by Navel, the creators of Shuffle and Tick Tack. It predates them by quite some time. The animation is decent, and character designs are nice.<br />
<br />
The setting is in space. Ryouta entered into the military school and went to the Aria station for training. Accompanying him is his childhood friend (let's play spot the cliche), classmate, rich snob, mysterious tough girl, big breasted commander, and so on. Yeah, harem.<br />
<br />
But it's not a true harem from what I understand. The character pairings become very clear early on. Plenty of bishoujo's to look at, however. The story seems to be pretty good, as it looks like the emphasis is on the story, not the girls.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to more episodes, especially if they put more emphasis on the storyline. There's some suspense of disbelief here (wearing miniskirts in zero-g environment?) and much to our luck, Masato, the skirt-lifting boy makes his appearance here! (Masato appears in all of Navel's games, for the sole purpose of lifting skirts of the girls. He's my hero)<br />
<br />
I don't know who to recommend this to, i'll probably know for certain next episode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuto (The Melacholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) A+ HIGH RECOMMENDATION!<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe I'm jumping the gun here. This is animated by Kyoto Animation of Air fame. This anime completely slipped under my radar. It's also based on a novel by the same name.<br />
<br />
Watching this first episode, I was totally confused in a awesome way. Kyuto's  monologue tsukkoki was AWESOME. The animation is GREAT. Don't let the first 17 minutes fool you, I was completely thrown off by it in the beginning.<br />
<br />
Subtle things should be looked for- the wind blowing through capes, he constant smooth motions all over the place, backgrounds, etc. PLEASE watch until the end, no matter what!! If you still don't like it, feel free to kill me, but you won't, so ha!<br />
<br />
I was in constant tears. I had to pause so many times and I kept telling Sollon what I was seeing. I was just so dumbfounded and laughing too hard that I just HAD to tell someone about what I was seeing. I totally don't know how to explain how hilarious this show is. Just watch it. I promise you'll love it, no matter what. I don't know how the rest of the series will pan out, but this first episode can be watched by ANYONE without any cliffhanger or desire to watch the rest, it's just worth it. If it doesn't have you in tears, you need a sense of humor.<br />
<br />
There's too much to spoil here so I'm not going to tell anything about the story until the second episode review, which will probably be spoiler-tagged. But basically, it revolves around a group of high schoolers called SOS-dan, and as the title tries to say, is about the life of Haruhi Suzumiya. <br />
<br />
Watch it, if you watch only shonen and not interested in expanding your horizons, it's not for you, but if you ever step outside of shonen, even once in a blue moon, watch this. It's so awesome.<br />
<br />
This is Stalk signing out (cue camera pan to the sunset)</div></div><hr />

I finally got around to watching the first episode Of Ah! My Goddess: Sorezore no Tsubasa (A!MG:SnT from here on) I enjoyed it, it was like coming home to a home-cooked meal after being out in the cold rain all day. Belldandy is still one of the sweetest characters in anything, ever. <br />
 <br />
Hell, they even managed to get a little progress going with Keiichi 'n Belldandy's relationship. Hopefully, there will be more actual progress as the series continues. I wanna see Belldandy even MORE happy, damn it.</div></div><hr />

I finally got around to watching the first episode Of Ah! My Goddess: Sorezore no Tsubasa (A!MG:SnT from here on) I enjoyed it, it was like coming home to a home-cooked meal after being out in the cold rain all day. Belldandy is still one of the sweetest characters in anything, ever. <br />
 <br />
Hell, they even managed to get a little progress going with Keiichi 'n Belldandy's relationship. Hopefully, there will be more actual progress as the series continues. I wanna see Belldandy even MORE happy, damn it.<br />
<br />
What you watched a first eps of something!!! :P.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-15-06, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the delay. I've been busy as hell lately, with work, my diet/exercise, and other matters.<br />
<br />
I know I'm far behind, I'll catch up as much as I can as the week goes by.<br />
<br />
Joshikousei (High School Girls) - C+<br />
<br />
The premise was interesting in that they are trying to give a realistic view of what all-girls high schools are like. It may be a bit excessive but the general concept is the same. It's somewhat fanservicey with a lot of suggestive positions and pantie shots.<br />
<br />
The animation is not much to look at, generic would be right. Not a turn-off, however. Despite the unusual scenario, it's actually a pretty generic storyline. Two groups of friends meet, get off on the wrong start, and become friends in the end.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything that sticks out about this series yet, that makes it worth watching. If there is something, it wasn't introduced yet. If it's a episodic humor, then it failed from the onset, if there's a storyline, I'm completely missing it. One more episode for this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Makai Senki Disgaea - C+<br />
<br />
I'll be honest and say I set myself up for disappointment with this series. The promo was 100x better than the actual episode itself, which says nothing good about the episode. Flonne wakes up Laharl this time, only half a minute of Etna, etc.<br />
<br />
The animaiton was plain, and I felt they took away a lot of what was fun in the game. I'll give it a few more episodes for the novelty of it, but my hopes went from high to low in only 4 minutes into the episode.<br />
<br />
The story is about a demon prince who's father died, an assassin from heaven, and the servant of the prince, and their adventures to retake the demon world.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya A++ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br />
<br />
With the second episode, and everything going back to the feel of a normal series, the brillance did not change one bit. This is mind-blowing incredible. The animation is... there are no words. It is INCREDIBLE!<br />
<br />
The story is funny as hell. There is something about Suzumiya that just makes you want to keep watching her antics. You know there's something unusual about her (given the title can also be translated to &quot;The Depression of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;) but what could be depressing such an awesome girl?!<br />
<br />
The way she created the SOS-dan was awesome. The guy she's with (forget his name, sorry) is also super-duper-awesome. Loli-boob girl is awesome. Sometimes it's hard to take comments like &quot;anime should be all about the story, not art!&quot; after watching a series like this. It has a funny as hell story, but the animation only makes it so much greater! <br />
<br />
In a normal anime, the &quot;reactions&quot; of a girl, i.e. from getting her boobs suprise-massaged, would be a static image and maybe her face turning red. But there's always motion, always facial changes, that makes it so much cuter, funnier, and simply awesome.<br />
<br />
KYOANI~ I LOVE YOU~<br />
<br />
<br />
Utawarerumono B+<br />
<br />
I'd like to give it a higher rating, but I'm still not sure what to think of the series. For one thing, the animation is awesome. Nothing like Haruhi, but it's still nice. There are a lot of things I really like about the world the story takes place in.<br />
<br />
The animal-people is pretty cool, and the story seems mysterious. A man awakens in the middle of the forest, and is found rescued by a young girl who's a dog-girl (dog ears and tail, like neko) He has forgotten his past and why he is where he is. He begins his journey to find what he must do with his life, why he is there, etc.<br />
<br />
The game was pretty engaging and enjoyable, I am looking forward to more.<br />
<br />

<br />
Strawberry Panic! C-<br />
<br />
Ok, depsite the whole yuri harem, it's so generic it's not even funny. I was playing spot the cliche, something I don't often do. I stopped counting. It feels like Maria-sama ga Miteru meets Negima meets Shuffle. Mostly the worst of all three if you ask me.<br />
<br />
There's no real fanservice, except a brief shot of her getting her measurements, and some girl looking orgasmatic having the other girl's measurements. A &quot;mature beauty&quot; charater who's kiss sent the lead to the infirmary from fainting.<br />
<br />
Story is, lead gets sent to all girl school, coincidentally, there are three all girl schools in the same general area, on a hill in the middle of a forest, with no houses surrounding for miles. No wonder these girls are lesiban, so much sexual fustration! <br />
<br />
I'll watch another because, despite all that, what can I say? I like seeing girls make out and flirt with each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BLACK LAGOON A+ HIGH RECOMMENDATION!<br />
<br />
Shounen fans, this one's for you! The action is awesome! The female lead is the coolest thing since Motoko Ksunagi of Ghost in the Shell! The animation is sweeeeet~<br />
<br />
Guns, mayhem, mercilessness, blood galore! I had so much fun watching this. The story is, a typical japanese businessman who got his nail struck down and lost all hope of a happy life happens to carry a disk for the corporation he was working for. His boat gets hijacked by pirates of Black Lagoon, and he ends up kidnapped.<br />
<br />
Turns out there was secret information on the disk, so his company wants to kill him now! They send assassins... no wait, assassins? Who am I kidding, they send the ******* army. A gun-toting chick with a taste for aerobatic gunfights? Sign me up!<br />
<br />
The lead guy is pretty pathetic, but he's got this.. Office Space thing to him. Where you're stuck in pathetic corporate life, and when you see the light, you suddenly become an awesome guy. It's so ******* great.<br />
<br />
Shebab and Darthender willl definitely enjoy the hell out of this. But anyone who liked Ghost in the Shell for action, not the talk, will love it. It's just brawn and murder and mayhem, and nothing more. It's a nice release in this moe-filled season.</div></div><hr />

I give it A+ after seeing 2 episodes.<br />
It's a comedy series. I adore the lead and quitea lot of other characters as well as laughing throughout the 2 I watched.<br />

And it's not Yaoi at all, if that's what you were afraid of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok final review with the third episode. This is the hit of the season. Must watch this, no matter what kind of fan you are. If you're not laughing your pants off, you need a sense of humor.<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni A+<br />
<br />
I'd like to give it a high recommendation, but for now it excels with what it's trying to do. For one thing, the animation is not that high quality even if it's unique and intentional. The character designs are nice, the atmosphere is awesome. It's CREEPY AS ****.<br />
<br />
It's set in old Japan 1983 in the country. There was an indicent during a dam construction that threatened to destroy a village.  Who's the serial killer that's on the loose? Why doesn't anyone tell me about it? What's with everyone's seemingly split personality?! What the hell is going on?!<br />
<br />
This is so ******* creepy from the art, scenes, facial reactions, and how everyone seems to be just ******* LOONIES. It's so awesome. If you're looking for a good mystery/horror, look no further. This is not a very common genre, but I'd like to compare this to Kakuri Zoushi no Ayatsuri Sakon. I'm sure that most of you are unfamiliar with this one, but for those who do know it should understand the type of anime it is.<br />
<br />
It's based on a smash hit doujin-game that took Japan by storm this last year, and which recently got a sequel. I recommend anyone to try it out.<br />
<br />
Gakuen Heaven C+<br />
<br />
Shounen-ai. Not my thing, obviously. But I tried it anyway. Maybe I'm missing it, but I guess it's a women's version of harem anime. Lots of pretty boys doing their pretty boy stuff. Nothing really stood out to me. Final review. You'll know if you're into this or not, so nothing I can say will tell you otherwise.<br />
<br />
Himawari B-<br />
<br />
I kind of enjoyed this first episode. It was somewhat funny if not cliche. The female ninja thing was a first for me. Well, not quite, but as Sollon has said, it's like naruto with females. But a lot cheesier and lacking in substance than Naruto, if that's even possible.<br />
<br />
The animation is nice and it's somewhat cute. I really liked the main lead, though. He was pretty fun to watch, so I will watch a few more. However, the girl ninjas were pretty dumb. I don't like their designs either. <br />
<br />
Nothing really stood out other than the unusual premise, so I'll give it a few more.<br />
<br />
Magicial Pokan B+<br />
<br />
The premise is there's a vampire girl, android girl, werewolf girl, and magicial girl who are all princesses (of what? beats me) and moved into the world. They are working together to understand how common earth people act and the things they do (for what purpose? beats me). However, it was mildly funny. And pretty damn sexy.<br />
<br />
The designs are nice. Were-girl was awesome with her mini-jean shorts, and top that reveals her underboobs (this is my weakness). The vamp-girl was cute and her bishie fetish was funny. Magicial girl was cute to watch. I didn't like android girl. It's cliche, obviously, but somewhat well done I suppose you could say.<br />
<br />
It basically goes through their daily routine, so you'll get an Azumanga Daioh type of scenario.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-24-06, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NANA A<br />
<br />
By the same person who created Paradise Kiss, this classic Shoujo anime finally gets it's own anime. I watched the first episode and it was wonderful. It's high on drama and has a very strong feminine feel to it, as is to be expected. The animation is nice, and the character designs are wonderful.<br />
<br />
I really like the clothes. Just as with Paradise Kiss, the clothes in NANA stand out and is very detailed. The people look interesting and the style is very fresh. The story is based on two women named Nana meet on a train by coincidence, and eventually get an apartment together also by coincidence.<br />
<br />
It's obviously a very character-driven series. There will be a lot of drama, crying, talking, and such. But it's a nice change, if you ask me, from superficial slice of life shows which are all too popular nowdays.<br />
<br />
If you've seen Paradise Kiss, you'll love this. If you enjoy, like, or are interested in Shoujo, this is an great one to start at. It was somewhat slow and the direction didn't get set, which is likely the only reason it's an A. I'm expecting this to be another high recommendation after I see the second episode.<br />
<br />
It was like a breath of fresh air, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Black Lagoon A+<br />
<br />
The show is still somewhat amusing, but it wasn't as intense as the first episode. I've learned some disconcerting things about the manga- well, that it sucked horribly. The first episode is great, the second is pretty good, hopefully it doesn't drop off and bomb like the manga does, but it doesn't look like that given the high budget it's getting.<br />
<br />
There were definitely some humorous moments, i.e. the way Rock and Levy stopped a huge cruiser in their teeny bitty boat. The action is still nice, but the climax to the helicopter fight at the end of the first episode was cheesy as ****.<br />
<br />
I'm still strongly recommending it.<br />
<br />
Ouran High School Host Club B-<br />
<br />
The show's first episode was mildly amusing. The fact that the main character was a girl, and that she's surrounded by guys, is something I don't see often. The only other show that really sticks out (not that there aren't any others, but..) that reminds me of this premise is Fruits Basket.<br />
<br />
It had a lot of amusing moments, and the fact that they seemingly were making fun of their own stereotypes was kind of fun to see. I'm not sure if I'll watch much more of this, but it at least warranted a second episode.<br />
<br />
The premise revolves around five bishounen (pretty boys) who have a host club where they provide a &quot;service&quot; for girls in high school. One day, someone comes in and breaks a vase. Since she could not afford the 8 million yen price tag, they make him work it off. Finding out he could actually be a bishounen, they dress him up and make him a Host to pay the price tag off.<br />
<br />
But they are in for a suprise when they find out it was actually a girl. I think I might enjoy this, but it's not for everyone.<br />
<br />
Princess Princess C<br />
<br />
Another bishounen show (is it just me, or are there a lot lately?) and this one is pretty cliche. When I watched this episode, (I had, at the time, forgotten it was a bishounen show) the first thing that came to mind was the scene in the &quot;outtakes&quot; of Serenity where Captain Reynolds was screaming TRAAAAAAAAAAP.<br />
<br />
It's basically an excuse for girls to dress guys up like women. In this all-boys school, in order to quell the male hormones, they designate &quot;Princesses&quot; of the school - pretty boys who dress up like girls in order for the masses to idolize them and release their sexual fustrations of the lack of presence of women. Or something like that.<br />
<br />
It's cliche as it gets, but the only thing that saved this show for me was the lead. Instead of being shocked, shy, ackward, clumsy, or any stereotypical lead would be... his reaction was &quot;OMG this is some ****** up **** yo&quot;. That just had me rolling. But I don't expect that to keep up. <br />
<br />
Utawarerumono A<br />
<br />
This series is still going strong. I'm highly enjoying it. The thing that impresses me the most, as of episode 2, is how they are not sacrificing story for service. The tail-grab of episode one and a few others were moe, but in the second episode it was completely character driven and had a lot of content and story. It reaffirmed that it had a story to tell, and was not all about the animal-girl cliches.<br />
<br />
If people want to see a series with strong roots in mythology and old japan, where people worship Gods of the forest, Gods of whatever, and those Gods actually exist... you'll probably enjoy this. It had something to say, a lesson to teach. It may seem like it has an agenda, and it probably does, but it's something worth seeing.<br />
<br />
Anyone looking for something unique will probably enjoy this one.<br />
<br />
RAY the Animation C<br />
<br />
A lot of &quot;what the ****&quot; moments. When Ray was a little girl, she was kept in a research facility as a &quot;body&quot; to harvest. Many people were born and kept there for a fresh supply of body parts, or test subject to research, etc. Ray had her eyes removed, and was eventualy rescued from the place.<br />
<br />
Black Jack (yes, the guy in those other anime with black and white hair) gave her new eyes that allows her to see with X-Ray vision. She appears to work freelance now saving lives as a genius surgeron who can see what's wrong with a person's body with her X-Ray vision.<br />
<br />
But, here's the what the **** part. The nurses are martial artist masters, the director of the hospital is a guy with a peg leg and eyepatch, whose special move is apparently spinning on his peg leg like a top with his fist extended to knock out anyone within his radius.<br />
<br />
Ok I don't watch Black Jack and it's various incarnations, so I'm probably just not used to this. I suppose any Black Jack fans would enjoy this. Nothing really stood out to me.<br />
<br />
Saru Get! You D<br />
<br />
It's like Cel animation but 3D. What do you call that anyway? Monkeys who got a cap with a siren on top to increase their combat prowness by 300 times have invaded Earth, and it's up to some kid with a magicial baton- er, i mean, a net to catch all the monkeys and save the world. I think.<br />
<br />
Simoun D-<br />
<br />
This was like the women version of KIBA. I don't even understand what the **** was going on in this show. Half the dialogue was some girls saying &quot;I want to be stronger&quot; for no particular reason, we're suddenly put in the middle of a war because they want the secret of Simoun because those machines are very powerful... Oh wait, they just invented something to beat Simoun anyway so why care anymore?<br />
<br />
Why are these girls making out on their airplanes? Does that grant them some superpowers? If they draw pictures on the sky, things blow up? If you interrupt the picture, it doesn't blow up? If they have hot sex with each other, the world blows up? They want to jump in a spring to become a man?<br />
<br />
Come again? I didn't quite hear you clearly enough.<br />
<br />
The Third - Aoi Hitomi no Shoujo B-<br />
<br />
It was somewhat average. On the plus side, the world got destroyed 3 seconds into the episode. At least they got that over with instead of cockteasing us with it for 20 episodes like most series do, before destroying the world.<br />
<br />
The setting is a barren world where insects have grown huge and are extremely deadly. A girl is a bounty hunter of sorts- she does jobs for money which usually involve killing local insects that threaten humans. She wields a sword, but isn't afraid to use a gun.<br />
<br />
She also travels around in a tank. Not much of the direction is set, but it did have some halfway decent fighting scenes. There appears to be an underlying story where it would get serious, but it hasn't been revealed yet.<br />
<br />
I can't really say much more until I know what direction is going to be set in the second episode.<br />
<br />
TOKKO C+<br />
<br />
Not sure what to think of this. Apparently, the main lead thinks about naked women covered in blood who kill zombies and demons frequently. I mean, who doesn't?<br />
<br />
The guy's parents got killed by demons, and since then his dreams has been haunted by a woman. He became a police officer in order to find out who killed his parents (he doesn't know it was demons) and soon after joining the police force, a gate to hell? has been opened and demons come out looking for him.<br />
<br />
He finds out about a group called TOKKO who specialize in using swords and slaying demons. They save him from face-bugs or whatever, and he, I guess, will search for the truth behind the murders of his parents.<br />
<br />
A good way to explain this is a dumber, bloodier, and fanservicer version of Blood+. Monsters and sword wielding women, if that's your thing, you'll enjoy this. Only giving it one more episode myself.<br />
<br />
Yume Tsukai C<br />
<br />
I remember reading the manga a long time ago, only a few chapters though. The premise is set around three sisters who are dreamcatchers. Sometimes a person's dreams may cross the border between dreams and reality into reality, it is the job of these dreamcatchers to find the dream and send it back to where it came from.<br />
<br />
There wasn't much substance, but it had a somewhat interesting story in the first episode. A young girl is in love with another girl in her grade, but is afraid to reveal it in fear of rejection, and that dream came into this world and kidnapped the object of her affection.<br />
<br />
It seems somewhat okay, but I did drop the manga, so I don't have much hope for this one.<br />
<br />
Zegapain No Rating<br />
<br />
It's a mecha. I couldn't understand anything about this episode. A bunch of jargon and an ordinary high school boy who became a robot pilot for no particular reason. Uh, if you like mecha... I guess you could try it out. If a mehca fan wants to give it a better review, knock yourself out, I know I'm ill-suited to review those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I'm bored, I figure ill explain how I review things. I am not comprehensive nor detailed, and I don't cover all points. The content of my review are light and don't have much depth. I am not trying to review things to show its strong suits and weaknesses. I'm trying to give people a basic idea of what to expect so they don't have to watch 25 new series they don't care for.<br />
<br />
For that purpose, I think my reviews are sastificatory. And the grades I give them are even more open with no strict definition. I don't grade them against other anime, for instance, Ouran High School got a B-, and Utawarerumono got B+. Are they almost equallay as good? Not really. If it was by my personal opinion, it would be A+ for utawarerumono, in comparisoon.<br />
<br />
The rating instead turned out like: Ouran High got a B- for its type: not genre, where similar anime would be Fruits Basket. So where Fruits Basket is an A+, Ouran would be B- in comparision. Utawarerumono doesn't have much of a direct comparision, so it is by its own merits that I graded it. It got a B+ because there were weaknesses such as no clear plot or strength of storytelling, which got changed in episode 2 and turned it into an A.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that makes some sense. Now I gotta work again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">04-25-06, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NANA A<br />
<br />
I'm still enjoying Nana, but I'm a bit disappointed with the direction they went in the second and third episodes. I was hoping they would be talking more about both the Nana's and their relationship from then on, but instead, we got a flashback to one of the Nana for two episodes.<br />
<br />
It looks like the flashback will continue onto the fourth episode. However, that aside, I found those episodes very enjoyable and fun to watch. The character designs as always are interesting and fresh. It's not a level of clothing detail you often see in anime.<br />
<br />
In any case, it's a good watch for fans of Shoujo and ParaKiss.<br />
<br />
Ouran High School Host Club A<br />
<br />
I kind of liked the series with the first episode, but the second and third episodes were nice. I liked how they managed to avoid some very annoying cliches, such as the obessive girl who wants nothing more than revenge. That was clever. When I saw her introduced, I almost thought to drop the series, if that's the way it was going to go. But what a pleasant suprise.<br />
<br />
Haruhi is really cute and I enjoy watching her. She doesn't seem extreme, but rather, is very down to earth. An aspect of her I really enjoy. I like her remarks to the extremes the King is going. I also like how they made fun of themselves, calling the others the &quot;homo characters&quot; of the show.<br />
<br />
I keep feeling as though they are swiftly dancing past many cliches, because so many times I'm thinking, &quot;ah, it's going to be like this... huh? that's a suprise&quot;. It's also a pleasant thing to see Haruhi dressed up as a girl occassionaly, as a reminder. It's almost as though they are saying, &quot;It's okay to love her!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's hard not to draw comparisions between this and Fruits Basket, but I have high hopes for the series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The series continues to be good. As with last season, it revolves around Keiichi and Belldandy, a Goddess that came from heaven to grant Keiichi's wish. After the events of last season, the contract has broken. They must renew their contract or Belldandy will go back to Heaven.<br />
<br />
We got to see some progress in their relationship this episode, where they actually hugged! And went out on a date! Slow down now, I'm going to get dizzy~ But much to our dismay, that's probably the last of relationship progress we will see for the rest of the season. Ah~ someone's missed the springtime of youth~<br />
<br />
It's a romance series, one of the better ones out there disregarding the slow progress of their relationship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Air Gear B<br />
<br />
With the third episode, I think this is decent. The animation is good, the action is mildly interesting, the story... well, what story?<br />
<br />
It's a nice action series, as one would expect from the creator of Tenjo Tenge, Oh! Great. I'll mostly watch it as filler to what I avidly watch. I really like the designs of the characters (oh, but of course) Ringo and Simca are cute.<br />
<br />
If you want rollerblading on speed, this is a nice series. It's got a strong shounen feel to it.<br />
<br />
Glass no Kantai (Glass Fleet) C-<br />
<br />
This shone at some points, blew at mostly everything else. The 3D space battles are plain and boring without any strategy to it at all, people breathing in space is stupid (don't give me that artistic license thing, this IS a sci-fi anime), the 2D art was plain and uninteresting with the exception of a couple characters.<br />
<br />
I didn't feel like there was some epic story at hand. Ok, the poor people are revolting against the aristocrats. In space. Feels ordinary. Some parts are so overdone that it's pathetic. I really can't recommend this to anyone. The only thing that keeps it from failing is that there is SOME potentional for the series in it's plot, but from what I hear on 2chan, it didn't deliver.<br />
<br />
I won't be suprised if it bombs.<br />
<br />
Good Witch of the West - Astrea Testament B-<br />
<br />
I found this episode mildly interesting. It managed to avoid a few cliches, but that's all. The scene with her necklace when they confronted her about it was well done, in my opinion. They could have made that much worse.<br />
<br />
I'm uncertain what direction the plot intends to take. A young girl who lived a peasant life attends a ball on the Queen's birthday, and her necklace catches the eyes of the aristocrats, a necklace that belonged to the Queen.<br />
<br />
In this world, knowledge is banned. So books of fairy tales, science, etc are not allowed. The girl's father is a scholar, and he flees to the north without his daughter.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the story has in mind, but it didn't completely fail it, and didn't try to shove the story down our throats either, so i'm interested in another episode.<br />
<br />
Joshikousei C+<br />
<br />
With the second episode, the story is pretty mediocre. A bit of fanservice, but it wasn't really funny at all. The episode revolved around physical checkup, so the nice thing was seeing half naked girls walking around all day taking tests. But that aside, there wasn't much to it. It works as a fanservice show, though.<br />
<br />
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni A+ HIGH RECOMMENDATION<br />
<br />
Another hit episode. The story is intruging, and doesn't insult your intelligence. The pace is fast, and there's no short supply of clues. Who is Oyashiro-sama? What kind of God is he? Is Oyashiro-sama making people go crazy? Or is everyone crazy? What is really happening in this city?! Is this real, or a dream?<br />
<br />
Definitely the sleeper hit of the year. Everyone's all over Haruhi, but this one gives it one HELL of a run for it's money. It's too bad it's not making much waves in the USA, because everyone in Japan is nuts over this because of the game.<br />
<br />
When the girls go into Oyashiro-mode, it's ****ign creepy and awesome. Everyone should watch this.<br />
<br />
Inukami! C+<br />
<br />
Pretty average. Nothing to the story, really. A boy summons an Inukami, a dog god which takes the form of a human. No dog ears, but there's a tail~ A lot of nakedness in this episode, and not the good kind.<br />
<br />
One nice thing about this episode is that the inukami girl is hot, and she knows it. She's toying with the guy's sexual fustration. But refuses to give it up unless he goes out with her. The guy's reason for not going out with her? Because she's a dog. Ok, What's not hot as hell about screwing a hot girl with a tail?<br />
<br />
Hmm. Maybe I've been watching anime for too long~ I'll continue watching it as filler, it's mildy amusing and kills the time. Too bad the perverted old guy had it wrong in this episode :(<br />
<br />
Jyu Oh Sei B<br />
<br />
The shoujo shounen?! So, what's it like? Pretty boys everywhere. EVERYWHERE. But, it had a strong shounen basis. Twins have had their parents killed by some unknown group, and the twins get sent to a prision world which is separated by four factions. In order to get off the planet and solve the murder of their parents, they have to fight their way up to become Jyu Oh, the Beast King.<br />
<br />
It was pretty interesting how it was done, and I wasn't completely turned off. You're already places by a moral dilemma, abandon  your twin and live, or save him and die. What will he choose? It's a harsh world where water is hard to get.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I recommend it, a lot of people will shudder at the thoughts of bishounens, but the story was actually a little interesting.<br />

Ok, I feel ripped off by this series. What happened to the promo, anyway?! The animation is crap, the story is crap, almost nothing interesting about this show. I'm just watching it for Etna and Flonne, but that's all.<br />
<br />
School Rumble Second Semester A-<br />
<br />
Still a fun slice of life school comedy. A lot of pretty girls, the guys are cool too (Harima FTW). Anyone who likes slice of life comedies will be sure to enjoy this easily.<br />
<br />
Simoun B<br />
<br />
It actually got better, if only a little. The story became somewhat more sensical. Turns out they were talking gibberish because they were making religion out of everything. As explained, to sortie, is what they call &quot;Praying to the Sky&quot;, etc. They have fancy names for everything, to make it sound religious and pure.<br />
<br />
I liked it because they put someone who is completely different from the rest of them into the cast int his second episode. The new girl KNEW war, had no stupid illusions about it. I was so annoyed that they made war sound so artsy-fartsy in the first episode. Ohh, I saw who I was klling, WAAAAAAAH~<br />
<br />
No kidding woman, those are human beings you are killing. Drawing artsy pictures in the sky doesn't change that. Calling it praying to God doesn't change that either.<br />
<br />
The new girl was like, oh ****! The enemy's here! I'm going to sortie out! Every other simula was like... &quot;What a crude woman! We can't fight! Our precious simula is emotionally distraught!&quot; so what does she do? She gets in her pratice simoun and kicks the enemies ass. Without weapons!<br />
<br />
She's awesome. I see some decent potentional here.<br />
<br />
Utawarerumono A+<br />
<br />
Definitely a must-see. Not something &quot;everyone&quot; will enjoy, like I think Haruhi and Higurashi are. But it's an very intelligent anime, the animation is very nice, and the characters are well-done. Hakuoro is an awesome main character. It's nice to see that everyone is not being stupid and rash, and actually listening to logic.<br />
<br />
The series continues to shine.<br />
<br />
Witchblade B-<br />
<br />
Ok, HUEG TITS and HUEG ARSE. Skimpy battle outfit.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to say. A mother and her daughter are surviving in an post-apocalyptic world, and her child gets taken by the Child Wefare Agency. She tries to hunt them down and gets sent to jail. There, she encounters a human that turned into a killing robot machine thing upon sensing her. Upon being confronted, she turns into one herself. Apparently she's special, posessing the Witchblade.<br />
<br />
It's mostly tits, ass, and murder. I'll have a more solid idea of the story next episode.<br />
<br />
xxxHOLIC B+<br />
<br />
It's a pretty enjoyable show. The art style is definitely hard to get used to. If you saw the movie, you'll like the series. And vice versa. A young man who is haunted by spirits finds an temple, where the woman who resides inside it can grant anyone a wish, in return for a equal price.<br />
<br />
The guy deciedes to wish for the spirits haunting him to go away. In return, he must work for the woman until he has done enough to pay for that.<br />
<br />
It's a very interesting show with an unique art style. It's based on a manga by CLAMP, so you know what to expect mostly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That eps was creepier then the last 3 combined....<br />
<br />
What'd I tell ya? huh?! huh! Awesoooome</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another hit episode. The story is intruging, and doesn't insult your intelligence. The pace is fast, and there's no short supply of clues. Who is Oyashiro-sama? What kind of God is he? Is Oyashiro-sama making people go crazy? Or is everyone crazy? What is really happening in this city?! Is this real, or a dream?<br />
<br />
Definitely the sleeper hit of the year. Everyone's all over Haruhi, but this one gives it one HELL of a run for it's money. It's too bad it's not making much waves in the USA, because everyone in Japan is nuts over this because of the game.<br />
<br />
When the girls go into Oyashiro-mode, it's ****ign creepy and awesome. Everyone should watch this.<br />
<br />
Lol lack of clues in this series lol? More like clues overload till you pop with confuseion :P.<br />
<br />
Also the sound they use just REALLY adds to the creepyness of the series. Esp when they go into Oyashiro-mode.<br />
<br />
 Omg when they laughed in eps 4.....damn....<br />
<br />
I like Haruhi a lot but this show is prob #1 on my list. <br />
<br />
Inukami! C+<br />
<br />
Pretty average. Nothing to the story, really. A boy summons an Inukami, a dog god which takes the form of a human. No dog ears, but there's a tail~ A lot of nakedness in this episode, and not the good kind.<br />
<br />
One nice thing about this episode is that the inukami girl is hot, and she knows it. She's toying with the guy's sexual fustration. But refuses to give it up unless he goes out with her. The guy's reason for not going out with her? Because she's a dog. Ok, What's not hot as hell about screwing a hot girl with a tail?<br />
<br />
Hmm. Maybe I've been watching anime for too long~ I'll continue watching it as filler, it's mildy amusing and kills the time. Too bad the perverted old guy had it wrong in this episode :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Awww come on! If you going to have a series about a dog girl you have to do the tail AND the ears =/.<br />
<br />
I feel so riped off =/ heh.<br />

Ya I was turned off by the art style at first but after awhile i got used to it. And IMO seems to fit the series well.<br />

Im sure your not the only one either.  Just not something I took a liking to.  Checked it out initially on your suggestion anyway and youve been spot on for a lot of them. :D  Keep up the good work, I appreciate it at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
.hack//roots is a very interesting show. The last .hack// was pretty much a horrible take on the world but now they have reverted back to the .hack//sign style of story telling. While i say that it is not a total talk fest that most of .hack//sign was but they do toss in the funny stuff here and there. Overall I was very impressed by the visuals of the show...they are very stunning to see.<br />
<br />
Basically my impression form eps 1 is that the world has turned into a horrible place because of people known as Player Killers. It seems that these PKers have a hold on the &quot;world&quot;(the game they play in) and seem to run the show. Can anyone stop these PKers?<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of .hack// series you will def like this show IMO.<br />
<br />
The new &quot;gateing out&quot; graphics are awesome hehe.</div></div><hr />

I give it a C, I barely managed to give it fair 4 EPs before dropping it. It was too generic for my tastes and characters had something stuck up their @#$. The girl from guild was obviously copied from Madlax~ and they all talked too much nonesense for my interest to hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-13-06, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a difficult time watching .hack/roots ep. 2 myself. Just not up my alley, I guess.<br />
<br />
Tales of Saiunkoku (Saiunkoku Monogatari) B<br />
<br />
I rather enjoyed this a bit. It's got a very formal style, if one were to take a glance at it, they would think it was a very serious anime about medieval China politics and history.<br />
<br />
Designs aside, it's actually very laid back. You have the three great politicans of the time acting like ordinary people, humble, etc. The story revolves around after the creation of a nation, the first emperor dies of old age. His heir, the youngest of five brothers, four of which killed each other in the battle for the throne, does not care about his position as Emperor.<br />
<br />
The three advisors, fearing that someone would attempt to overtake the throne based on the emperor's attitude, ask a noble girl, yet dirt poor, to become an High Imperial Consort in order to change the emperor into a respectable man.<br />
<br />
It's another show where the lead is a female (is this getting popular, I wonder?) and is surrounded by Bishounen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess. .hack//sign was good b/c everything was told to you but in .hack//roots it expects you to know a LOT of background b4 it even starts. Guess you have to be a hardcore fan to understand some of it. But ya I guess most of it would be nonsense if you have not kept up with all the .hacks + games. But on the other hand .hack// isn't for everyone i guess :P.<br />
<br />
Oh and ya your right about madlax girl :P. I don't really like her role personally Out of all of em she talks the most nonsense.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh by no means am i calling it a masterpeace but the way the .hack// series has been going it is defenitly a lot better then the past few after .hack//sign.</div></div><hr />
