<br />
Have a drink..cause I did something cunning tonight.<br />
<br />
I know you lads have heard about the place where all the frogs live ! Yes GUK ! Well a barbarian woman died there last night, lost her corpse in the room where that frog lord is. She had no idea how to get it ! Now me being a small friend of hers thougt that I could get it for her. Snatching a guarded corpse is easy for a rogue like me. Well soon I went down and sneaked by all sort of frogs. All went well untill I got to the entrance of the lords, well you could call it 'castle'. Anyway before the entrance there is a small wooded board across the water and behind that there were two guards guarding the entrance ! <br />
<br />
Gronti takes a big swig of his ale!<br />
<br />
Now me being very careful  sneaking passed the guards slipped on that board and fell in the water. Darn I almost cursed ! Well cursing my clumsiness in silence tried to get out of the water. Alas sneaking and swimming made it impossible to get out of the water. Now this was getting tricky. <br />
I swam around a bit more and there was no way I could get out of the water !!<br />
I had to unhide and get out of the water while two guards where there guarding the entrance two steps away. Two guards might be much for me and the risk of running all the way to the swamp and getting the attention of more frogs was not an appealling one.<br />
<br />
I had to do something..<br />
<br />
Well getting all my guts together I took the chance. I unhided! Jumped out of the water and I hided again.<br />
The guards were too much surprised about what happened that they lost sight of me immediatly.<br />
With a fast heartbeat I went further in and get the corpse of my barbarian friend.<br />
<br />
I was proud of me skills that day !<br />
