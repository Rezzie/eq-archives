<br />
Killing a character in any of their races home town will cause you to take a faction hit. This counts for all home cities. So, if you kill a Human in any of the city zones of Qeynos (or Freeport, or Surefall Glade), you will suffer a faction hit, even if that Human was born in Freeport. All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves. There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves and Half-Elves in Greater Faydark. Killing an Erudite in either Paineel or Erudin will cause a faction hit.<br />
<br />
They tried this already. It failed. Put the dead horse back in it's grave.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
So, you think you've got the guts to play<br />
on the new PvP Server eh? Then enlist in the Screams</div></div><hr />

Can't see anything wrong with this other than high elves running things in gfay with no fear of death - since people are scared of faction hits.  Interesting that they bothered to do this.. and not implement a majority-damage-loot and not just a last-hit-loot... but oh well. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />
