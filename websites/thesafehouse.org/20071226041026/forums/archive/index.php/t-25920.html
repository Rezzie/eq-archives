<br />
My tastes are usually the 15+ age rated.  I do not like fighting stories (DBZ, etc).  I can do some mecha.  FLCL, Elfen Lied, MSAAbenobashi, and the like are in my collection.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-11-06, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well its easy to spot bootlegs. More than 5 episodes per dvd (as a general rule) is bootleg. Chinese subs is bootleg. Region-free is bootleg. <br />
<br />
That aside, Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! Which is 2nd season of the FMP series is great. 100% comedy. You may want to watch the first season, Full metal Panic! Which is 70/30 mecha/drama and comedy respectively.<br />
<br />
Excel saga is along the lines of abenobashi, but different enough that they are not that closely related. Its a comedy.<br />
<br />
Gankutsuou is one of the best anime Gonzo has ever producted, and oddly is not getting much attention. Its an adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo, and incredible one at that. The art style is an eyesore for 2 episodes before you get used to it. By eyesore I don't mean bad, its unique and awesome, just takes a bit getting used to.<br />
<br />
Ghost in the shell is great too. Fits your 15+ rating.<br />
<br />
Now for something off the wall, how about giving Hajime no Ippo (the first step in usa) an chance? Its an excellent boxing anime. Very engaging and entertaining even if you're not a sports fan. I don't watch any sports, but I ended up loving the series and rooting for him the entire way almost fully released in the us now.</div></div><hr />

less blue water<br />
<br />
If you need info on the hostess ladies, send me some money.  :P<br />
<br />
This will be my third time to taiwan, though I haven't been since 2002<br />
<br />
edit:  No!  No i won't just add another post to pimp my count.<br />
<br />
Gankutsuou looks really cool.  I do like the GITS series'<br />
<br />
I've passed by the FMP discs in Fry's and they've intrigued me but I've not seen any of them.  So did the series completely change focus from season 1 to season 2 based on what you're saying?<br />
<br />
I liked abenobashi, it was recommended to me based on FLCL, which I can see, but it was &quot;less than&quot; FLCL.  I guess what I look for is an art style that while is decidedly asian/anime style, it isn't SOOO anime..  dunno how to describe it properly.  GITS:SAC is a good example.  Bobobo-Bo-Bobobo is a bad example.<br />
<br />
Innuyasha is about as much of a &quot;fighting&quot; anime that I can stomach, and even then the battle **** irks me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-11-06, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inuyasha is really about the **** of the crop when it comes to fighting anime, though.... all of the shounen trinity going on now have better fighting than Inuyasha by miles and miles.<br />
<br />
As for FMP, yeah, there's a HUGE change in direction. But a refreshing one, since it was very well done.</div></div><hr />

Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=155) isn't really the true 'second season' to Full Metal Panic! (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=844).  Fumoffu is more of a spinoff that deals with the characters in the high school setting with emphasis on the comedic aspect of the first season.  Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4449) is the second season of FMP.<br />
<br />
FMP! and FMP! TSR have serious plotlines, while FMP? Fumoffu was done for the laughs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fumoffu may seem like a spin off but it is part of original novels, so calling it a 2nd season is appropriate IMO. Just because it deviated from more serious route, doesn't mean it's not a season :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-12-06, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is that it's kind of like taking the cast of CSI and putting them in a sitcom for one season, then have them go back to solving murders the next season.<br />
<br />
Fumoffu is a sequel to FMP! and it is a season, but I think it's meant more of a fun tangent to complement the serious storylines that Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid are based upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">09-13-06, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is my tip<br />
<br />
when buying very cheap bootleg buy by cover art ...<br />
<br />
a friend of mine went to Hong kong and just did that , yes he got some bad anime but he got a truck load of gems ( a DVD Was at 2$ , he spent 400$ )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-13-06, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my tip - don't buy bootlegs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
helloooo he is going to taiwan and want to buy DVD<br />
<br />
why would they have orignals that the USA doesn't ?<br />
<br />
i'm sure he doesn't understand japanese fluntly else he would buy from japan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-13-06, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever he is doing, and fansub/bootleg/r2/tv/r1 aside, discussion of bootlegs is not allowed in the anime forum, that includes advice. So best not to tread into shaky terrority.<br />
<br />
I am a big opponent of bootlegs but I don't particularly care what others do as long as I don't see or hear about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">braincandy99</div><div class="date">09-13-06, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I appreciate the advice on bootlegs, I understand the pitfalls and as I said I understand the market situation out that way.  I do not want to tempt the moderator gods (don't taunt happy fun ball).<br />
<br />
I would think there would be titles available there that aren't available here, whether bootlegged or not.  Fry's is good here, as is our local anime specialty shop and of course there is the series tubes we call the intraweb, I just was looking for some shopping ideas :)</div></div><hr />

Why does everyone get a local anime specialty shop but I don't =( *cry*.</div></div><hr />
