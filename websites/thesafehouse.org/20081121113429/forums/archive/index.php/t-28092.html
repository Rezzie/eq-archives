<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbwin</div><div class="date">02-02-07, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm a halfling who worked through all of the newbie diplomacy quests and got all of the initial items and cards.  I was on the quest to move to the Tursh area, but kept getting trounced by Rupert(sp), I know he was recently fixed, but I had already moved out of the area.  During the time that he was broken, I was only able to do a few parlays with random guards who awarded me with random gems and bits of blackmail/hearsay/something else w/ the same graphic.  I tried to sell this to a hearsay vender but he kept giving me the same script about returning to him when I got something 'good'.<br />
<br />
I managed to get my diplomacy skill around 50 before moving to Kojan (all my friends were based out of the wood elf city, so I followed).  Currently, I have enough soldier faction to talk w/ them, but nothing else.  Additionally, virtually every civic parlay I've entered down there, they start out needing only one point (I need 17), so they win every time.  I did pick up a few quests, but don't have enough merchant or priest presence.  I'm planning on heading back to the Tursh area this weekend for some vengence on my former nemisis and to continue that quest line.  However, I was wondering if there was anything I was overlooking in the wood elf area or another other tips/suggestions that could be offered.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Rupert was a prime example when he was broken.  I beat him by moving my parley down 2 spot then blocking him as best I could from getting the points he needed to play his cards.  Took about an hour to figure it out but I finally did it.  As for our other question I cant help there,  as I never tried diplo outside Rindol field/ Tursh area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before you click to accept a parley with any of these folks, check the number that's shown. It's their skill level. My guess is you are &quot;fighting&quot; NPCs with 150 to 400 skill level, which explains the handicap they get.<br />
<br />
Find someone with 50 skill . . . they *are* out there . . . and try again.</div></div><hr />
