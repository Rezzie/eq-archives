<br />
From what I've seen and heard about it, FFXI sounds like it could be a lot of fun. But, I'm in school right now, jobless, and slowly chipping away at a savings account, so I want to make sure any time or money I invest with a game is going to be a worthy return. <br />
<br />
So, when you've played to the point you feel confident in writing a review, do so! &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />

The 2 things that seem to initially be really a bummer:<br />
1) Not being able to choose your starting server.  <br />
I guess you can just keep deleting and re-rolling your character untill you both wind up on the same one, but what a pain.<br />
However that I can live with and work around.  But the second...<br />
2) No new U.S. servers.<br />
WTF?!  That would be like me going back and starting up EQ right now.<br />
Not only can I not start on a server with friends who can help each other out, but when I do start.  There is already this hugely existing economy.  Nobody will speak english.  And the poor Japanese! All these newbs coming in that they wont understand...<br />

<br />
if you want to pick your own server, find one of the many message boards that have a forum for world passes.  Just find someone who is getting a worldpass for XxxX server and ask if they have a spot they wont be using on the worldpass. kind of a pain in the ass but if it really means that much to you its possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During the beta for Final Fantasy XI, we felt the exquisite new pleasures that had been designed by SquareSoft. Yes, it's pretty much an MMORPG, no, aside from fantastic art direction there isn't all that much to distinguish it, but as I said in a related post I play these games basically as a way to hang out. Once I learned that <br />
<br />
<br />
your starting server is completely random, <br />
<br />
that people must earn money in game to bring friends to their server by buying a World Pass, <br />
<br />
that the amount of money you need to earn depends on how populated your server is, <br />
<br />
that they aren't opening any new servers for the US launch which will inflate the price across the board, <br />
<br />
and that even once you do get a World Pass from a friend it doesn't let you bring an existing character, you have to create a new one who won't be of comparable level to the person that brought you over there in the first @#%$ place, <br />
<br />
the whole thing is stupid and I'm not their accountant, they can come up with some other way to load balance their servers if we're going to pay thirteen dollars a month for the privilege of frustration. <br />
The US release apparently allows you to bring five people over instead of the original one, which doesn't really fix the problem - it just downgrades it from &quot;absolutely insane&quot; to &quot;pretty ridiculous.&quot; In our rage, we even produced a comic on the subject. If I wanted to play with myself, I have a game that doesn't cost anything. <br />
<br />
The thing is, at this very moment and realistically up until next year I don't have to put up with decisions like that. Have you looked at the @#%$ release list for the next seven days? The new Tony Hawk hits, kill.switch, Gladius, Top Spin, Rainbow Six 3, um... Quidditch, Call of Duty, Thief III, Fire Emblem, and God knows what else. I don't have to tolerate things like World Passes if I don't want to. I can simply amuse myself with the eruption of holiday titles and someone else can maintain the price of SquareEnix stock. <br />
<br />
I was up pretty late playing Rainbow Six 3 last night, I'll post what I have here so far and then immediately start writing about R6. <br />
<br />
(CW)TB out. <br />
<br />
cookies are all spies<br />
<br />
<br />
And a comic to go with it.<br />
<br />
Hmm I can honestly say, with all the crap they are doing to make it suck. FFXI doesn't interest me at all. ~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Emmrys</div><div class="date">10-30-03, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, since no one who's actually played it has written anything so far, I'll give my impressions based on about 4 hours of play so far.<br />
<br />
After an install/patching process that lasted about 2.5 hours on cable, I finally fired up the game.<br />
<br />
I knew that I wouldn't be able to choose my server. FYI, here's the deal with it.<br />
<br />
Apparently it's this way in the interest of load balancing on the servers. You are randomly assigned a server upon character creation. Your assignment I'm sure depends on the populations of the servers.<br />
<br />
If you want to join friends on a different server, you may do so in two ways:<br />
<br />
1) Have your friends purchase a world pass on their server. The WP gives you 5-6 or so slots, and expires after a week. You give out a password to your friends, and upon char creation, they type in that password, and it starts them on your server.<br />
<br />
Caveat here is that whenever you move servers, you restart at lv 1.<br />
<br />
2) Create/delete new characters till you're randomly assigned to the server you want. Could take a little or a lot of time, but probably the best option IMO. The char creation process is short enough that it's relatively painless.<br />
<br />
As far as Japanese vs North American things go, IMO it's not a problem at all. All the Jp players I've met have been super nice and helpful, and the ability to select from a common word list which is translated to jp is nice. The thing is, time differences will be the real separating factor. When I get on at 8EST, there simply aren't many Jp players still up.<br />
<br />
It's been my experience that the Jp players are far more polite/helpful than the NA players have been.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I installed the game, used the config tool to set my graphics options, then started it up. I watched a nifty opening movie (Square's always rock), and went on to create my Elvaan warrior.<br />
<br />
Elvaan's are...elves, but not your normal elves. They are more a warrior race in FFXI than a &quot;one with nature, attuned more to magic&quot; type race.<br />
<br />
The character creation process is smooth, and as you select male/female from races, you get a little 3D preview thing of your character...it's funny, when viewing females, they strut around with fashion show techno music playing. The cat race is female only, and apparently they roll around suggestively on the ground amd stretch and so forth.<br />
<br />
So I chose my race/gender, face (8 to choose from for Elvaan), hair color, body size...think that's it.<br />
<br />
Got the name I wanted right off the bat, which was cool. (Emrys). Then it placed me on leviathin server, and opened with a scripted scene involving some of the big wigs in town interacting with my new character.<br />
<br />
Once all the opening stuff was out of the way, I went on to stand still for 20 minutes while I consulted the manual/quick guide to see how the hell to move around and deal with the horrible interface. When I say horrible, I MEAN horrible. You have two configurations to choose from, the default one being completely annoying and un-intuitive. It consists of using your mouse to drag a cursor around that you follow, but if you left click on anything but a valid target, this little menu comes up in the lower left of the screen. Honestly I don't have the energy to explain the default configuration, but it involves a lot of terrible mouse control, using menu that pops up with the numpad &quot;-&quot;, and is nothing like any other MMORPG or FPS out there. Clearly it was designed for the PS2, and they did nothing to ease PC users into it.<br />
<br />
The alternate one being more like what I'm used to in EQ with WASD movement, and I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds better.<br />
<br />
You may not remap anything, and you have zero control over the UI. Your only recourse is to choose between the 2 control configs, and program macros to get around the clunky interface.<br />
<br />
The camera, while easy to manipulate, appears to not do so well on its own. I find myself constantly numpad &quot;5&quot;ing to switch to 1st person and back to 3rd to reset the camera. Moving around in 1st person mode doesn't seem to be a good option as the mouse is super sensitive...at least in the default control config. Maybe that will improve under the WASD control. Using the mouse drag scheme to move about just plain sucks. Works for isometric and top down games, but NOT for 3D games, either in 1st or 3rd person.<br />
<br />
So those are the sucky things, now for the good things:<br />
<br />
Graphics are great, I have everything turned up, bump-mapping, etc, and it looks great and runs pretty well on my system:<br />
<br />
Athlon 1.4GHz, 640 PC133 RAM, GF4Ti4600 128.<br />
<br />
The art/stylization is wonderful as you'd expect from Square. It's taking time to get used to my Elvaan characters body shape, with longass arms, a long neck, small head, etc. I took screenies last night but can't get to them from work.<br />
<br />
The job system rocks, I've loved it since FFT. I'm only lv 4 in warrior job, so I can't say much, but it appears that this system is VERY similar to FFTactics. <br />
<br />
Weapon skills raise with use, and grant you with skills you can use in combat as, say, your Sword skill rises. You get inherent job traits and skills as you level up.<br />
<br />
I've not done much, but it appears that there is MUCH to do aside from fight: mine, harvest, Blacksmith, cook, bonework, leatherwork, fish, grow plants in your &quot;Mog Home&quot;, which is a private residence everyone gets, complete with moogle who can change your job, tend your bank, tend your plants. You can decorate your home as well.<br />
<br />
There are trade-guilds for the crafting types. The equivalent of EQ guilds in FFXI are called LinkShells.  Kind of strange but similar.<br />
<br />
Mob types are varied and all look neat. Pretty much everything from the FF world is in FFXI, from mobs to skills to magic to weapons, etc.<br />
<br />
There is so much more to talk about, but I've only experienced a tiny bit so I'm not qualified to talk about it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the UI/controls are a major stumbling block, as is the world pass/server deal, but there seem to be a TON of good things about the game, and I've enjoyed my brief time so far.<br />

Apparently you can customize the keymapping on the &quot;Compact Keyboard&quot; configuration, making it a much more &quot;normal&quot; control scheme. I think you're still rather limited in your control though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aenamae1</div><div class="date">10-30-03, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got used to the interface fairly quickly.  I always used the arrow keys to move my character around in EQ so moving to the 8 4 6 2 keys on the numerical pad wasn't a big deal for me.  I hardly even used the mouse when playing.  F8 targets the closest NPC, and the tab scrolls through the nearest targets.  If you are facing the thing you want to target, just hit enter to target it and enter again to interact with it.  I do agree that the camera needs some work.  There needs to be an option for how the camera will follow you.  I'm still trying to remember the keyboard shortcuts, but I got 2 of the important ones down, alt+a for attack and alt+c to con mobs.  Macros I haven't messed with yet, but I'm only level 3 so I have time still.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love the little scripted events that happen when you go through a quest.  It really gives the game a Final Fantasy feel.  Plus, all the npc's I talked to had distinct personalities with definate squaresoft FF flavor.<br />
<br />
For a mmorpg the graphics are top notch and ran smoothly on my machine.  I haven't seen many spell effects, but what I've seen have been nice and colorful.  Definately a step up from eq spell effects.  Probably on par with daoc effects so far.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is I'm having fun with it.  All the Japanese players I've run into have been extremely polite.  One of them actually followed me around when I went exploring in an area to high for me and healed me whenever I got agro from a mob.  He never said anything, but I got the meaning of what he was trying to say with all the emotes and ^^ stuff he used.  This game will be staying on my harddrive a while I think.  Its a nice break when my guild isn't raiding.</div></div><hr />

I could not agree more. I was in a group with three other americans last night and between the ^^ and the kanji translator we managed to interact pretty well with the Japanese players. Just remember, they really frown on begging for items or money and twinking. If something is offered or they just follow around healing it is because they want to vs being pushed into doing it.<br />
<br />
Oh, I play a white mage and one of the Japanese WM I ran into told/translated me that it is considered bad form to ask for a donation to heal someone. If a WM sees someone in need they should try to help that person out of a sense of class duty. Apparently I had pleased a few of the WM's friends in the starting town by just casting cure on any pc I could find, waving and then running off to the next person without asking for anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: While it is kinda fun being the minority on the server in terms of languages, the translator interface is kinda clunky to be used in quick group situations. I forsee a bunch of ascii signlanguage being developed in short order.<br />

I spent a good two hours trying, and gave up. I tried for awhile again today until they had enough to buy a world pass. It's annoying not being able to play for the first day because no one can afford the 1000+ gil world pass fee yet. <br />
<br />
The interface is really terrible, I always use the arrow keys to move, so its hard to get used to the WASD/numberpad. I use the compact keyboard, and there's not really many hotkeys for things, just ALT+M for some menu options.<br />
<br />
I made a black made, and magic use involves WAY too much clicking. I have to target a mob, left click to open my magic menu, click the spell, click the mob. Macros are only able to be made for the CTRL/ALT + number, which are a pain to use because I have relatively little hands. Using the ALT/CTRL keys is always hard for me.<br />
<br />
The camera angles are terrible and it's really hard to play in a third person point of view. Right now I just keep it in first person so I don't have to mess with it.<br />
<br />
If the interface was better and magic use wasn't so tedious the game would be pretty fun. The graphics are very nice, and the gameplay is okay so far. It looks like there's plenty of content - quests, tradeskills, and missions. The moogle houses are also pretty neat.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to get an adapter for my gamecube or ps2 controller and use that to play with, because it seems like it would be a lot easier with a gamepad. I'll also probably switch to a melee class so it's not quite so much clicking to cast one spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok after another night, I'll write a little more.<br />
<br />
I ended up switching to the compact keyboard control scheme, and it makes ALL the difference. I once again have WASD movement, and most of the time I stay in first person mode. The camera simply isn't good enough to deal with in 3rd person IMO.<br />
<br />
The one bad thing about 1st person mode is that the mouse is SUPER touchy when right-click looking around as you run. It might start panning slowly, but then ZOOM all the sudden you're looking up at the sky or the ground.<br />
<br />
I've gotten my elvaan warrior up to level 6, and saved up about 1200 or so gil. Most of that gil has come from quests. The quests can pay pretty well, but can take a while to complete as well. I haven't found any quests that are quickly completeable for good money yet, not that I really expected to.<br />
<br />
In terms of gear, I'm much more limited by level restrictions than gil now. Anything within my level range is rather easily affordable (from NPC merchants anyway). I've looked through the auction houses, where PCs put up items for bid, you bid on them, and you might get them. People will put up what appear to be customized or improved versions of the basic NPC vendor stuff, such as Bronze Sword +1, which will just add 1 dmg. Those items seem to get bids that are rather high.<br />
<br />
I'm still in my starter gear/onion sword, and I'm really hoping to try to improve on that soon. I joined the Blacksmithing guild, but was too poor at the time to afford some of the smithing raw materials, so I haven't worked on it yet at all. The guild is kind of neat though, complete with NPC guildmembers working away, clanging and banging on things at the furnaces/bellows. If you talk to them they'll share a recipe, and even cast some kind of &quot;spell&quot; on you that may or may not raise your skill temporarily.<br />
<br />
For Halloween there are all kinds of skellys/ghosts running around the towns, trick or treating. Apparently you can buy candy/crackers and give them to certain ones and they'll give you fireworks, or rarely a pumpkin shaped helm, or a staff with a bat on top. <br />
<br />
The fireworks are really cool too. I saw one last night, when the player lit it (it was called Airman or something), it appeared as a pot on the ground, and the top blew off and fireworks shot into the air, and a little miniature goblin floated down on a parachute back into the pot.<br />
<br />
So the atmosphere is very cool, attention to detail and style on art/models is wonderful. I have yet to group with anyone, but I wanted to get a handle on things before I &quot;go social&quot;.<br />
<br />
So far, I'm really enjoying myself. Oh, and because no one has mentioned it, the death penalty is losing 10% of the exp needed for the next level. At lv 6 it's about....200 exp? Which is equal to 2 even con mobs, or 4 &quot;decent&quot; con (even=white con in eq, decent = dark blue) So far, even's are giving 100exp, decent's are giving 50-72.<br />
<br />
Damn goblins, which have GREAT models btw, have killed me so many times now. They are KOS types. Can't wait till I'm old enough to reap revenge.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's all I can think of. Now that I'm mostly past the UI challenges, the only thing that bothers me is the server issue. I can see it being very difficult to want to switch servers and lose everything on my char.  Emrysx and Lucy - Feral Lord<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Squink McPoke</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those complaining about the interface with regard to the mouse, I can say with 100% certainty that you never have to use the mouse for anything, ever, ingame.<br />
<br />
The - key on numpad opens up main menu, the arrow keys manipulate it.  8 6 4 2 on numpad move you around (default keyboard setting), 0 on numpad cycles through all targets, F8 targets nearest NPC (this includes doors, auction counter, interactive objects for quests, mining/harvesting/logging points, etc)<br />
<br />
Enter key is the &quot;use&quot; or interact key, hit enter when an NPC is targetted and you talk to the NPC, if it is a shopkeeper they open up a buy/sell menu which you can manipulate with the arrow keys.<br />
<br />
Combat, alt-A initiates combat with your current target, the combat menu is brought up automatically once combat is initiated, and arrow keys are used to traverse that menu (and in fact the menu is already the main focus of the arrow keys at that point once combat started).  ALT-M to open up magic menu to cast spells.  ALT-D to fire ranged weapon (I think that's it, going off memory here at work)<br />
<br />
Using the mouse is actually probably the worst thing you can do cause it sucks, there is zero need for it, you can play the entire game without touching the mouse once, from the time you double click playonline icon to the time you log out back to windows desktop.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give another side of the picture to those complaining about the interface.  The interface is actually GREAT if you start using it with a fresh outlook (i.e. stop thinking EQ)<br />
<br />
I play in first person most of the time, third person when I need to look around me or want a wider view of combat (I play a white mage, so I am not usually in combat directly, third person camera angle is restricted while in combat, to only seeing what's in front of you, you can't swing the camera all the way around).</div></div><hr />

<br />
/magic &quot;spell name&quot; &amp;lt;t&gt;<br />
<br />
You hold ctrl or alt and the number of the macro.  Need to remember to capitalize the first letter of the spell or it wont work and &amp;lt;t&gt; is for the target you currently have.  You can use &amp;lt;me&gt; to have the spell or ability cast on you.  The macro system is quite powerful and it would be best to get to know it.  200 macros can be set as well</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_SejinEQ</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its pretty hard to get around at the lower lvls, like how EQ was before the PoK ports, Nexus etc.   You need to be a certain lvls before you use boats, you need a license to ride the Birds as well.  The are Airships in the towns but you need to pay a fee and need a certain rank (rank is gained by doing missions).  <br />
<br />
There is a story line for the cities that you start in.  I can't comment on the high end stuff but the Prologue is interesting as well.  Better then EQ as for as story line atm.  One quest i really liked was in Windhurst.  The Hat story owner has a new model hat and your job is to advertise for him.  If you talk to NPCs there is an emote that you show off the new hat.  Certain NPCs will respond and the more you get to respond the better the reward<br />
<br />
The World is pretty big to me atm since i am still starting and i have ventured too far out but there seems to be quite an amount of zones and sub zones<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Deranged Gnome</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have really been enjoying playing the game. The worldpass thing does suck though. Luckily, we had people who had played in Beta, and they made the money to get myself and other friends in. 4 people actually got on the same server by sheer luck. That was where we named home lol. The WP has 5 charges. It wound up being 220 gil per person.<br />
<br />
It was odd. I have played 15 minutes of FF VII..I think that was the one. So I was lost in the world. I was screamed at by a guy at the Gamestop when I called a Chocobo a 'Giant Chicken'! &amp;lt;shrugs&gt; It took me some time to get used to the controls and such, but it was good. It was funny. I was deja vu-ing the whole first night back to a summer night in 1999 when I first ventured into Norrath. &amp;lt;I don't expect anyone else to, but I did because I'm weird :P&gt;<br />
<br />
Lots of quests, I like the fighting system, which IMO is the best for a Rogue/Thief yet. I have heard the casting system is not so hot. I can't really comment on it.<br />
<br />
Sure, it has weird stuff, and stuff I would change in a heartbeat if I had the power. But I don't, so I take the good with the bad. &amp;lt;the former FAR outweighs the latter&gt;<br />

I made a thief on the Sylph server named Sudian if anyone happens to catch me on there btw.  Overall I like the game, havent experienced it much, but I like the combat as it lends a sort of old Final Fantasy look.  With menus on the side of the screen and such as you fight.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ZoldenShadowhunter</div><div class="date">11-02-03, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some amazing points:<br />
<br />
The Music. Just about every zone has its' own excellent music. Every piece of music I've heard is so fitting, so wonderful, and adds to the immersion.<br />
<br />
The Intuitative quest design. Quests in this are the greatest I've encountered so far. While the rewards sometime's aren't the best, the use of static in game objects in the world like a fireplace that you need to cook something on, or leave a fish in a bush make them unique. Some quests, or all missions even, have their own cutscenes. Cutscenes are also on things like passing through major gates, getting onto boats and the like.<br />
<br />
The Artwork. Fantastic character models. The best armor designs and detail I have ever seen. While the face and hair styles are lacking, your character is quite real looking. You blink and move wonderfully. The animations themselves are fantastic. You can even clap while sitting and such, and I wouldn't be surprised if new emotes were on the way.<br />
<br />
Overall Uniquity. Both you and monsters have 'limit breaks' basically, where you use your special skills once you are full of TP. Mobs like goblins toss bombs at you and they explode. Really cool combat moves, and the animations of hitting the monsters themselves is a cool thing. I've also heard tales of boat rides where you get attacked by sea monsters that npc's fish up. Things like that, and a ghost ship boarding your ship with skeletons is just cool.<br />
<br />
There are alot of great points to this game. There is, however, some major bad points.<br />
<br />
Communication Devastation. More than a high percentage of the people on any server speak Japanese natively. You're going to encounter a whole lot of people that can't even communicate with you at all. This, in turn, makes it difficult to find groups. I haven't even had a real group yet.<br />
<br />
Worldpasses. Once you get by this, it's no sweat. However getting alot of people on one specific server is a damn quest in its own. A very nice japanese player gave me the exact gil for a wp the second I got on however, so I was good.<br />
<br />
Leveling Unconventional. In your starting area, the surrounding 5 zones are all the same damn things at the same strength. I am having the most incredibly difficult time getting by level freaking 10. I play a thief, and they suck so bad until later on levels it's crazy. I'm at a point where I can't find a group but can't solo.<br />
<br />
You get raped by means of quitting. If you quit for 3 months your account becomes deactivated for good. You can't use your registration keys anymore either. That means if you play for 3 months, and then feel like quitting for 4 months you can't come back. I've done that with more than 3 mmorpgs so that kind of sucks. <br />
<br />
Overall though, it is a fantastic game worthy of a mere trial at least. I know I will get through the rough area here and most likely will be playing until the next best thing comes along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">11-02-03, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:You get raped by means of quitting.

<br />
not so.<br />
<br />
if you quit THE GAME, nothing happens. they can threaten character deletion but I doubt they'd do it.<br />
<br />
it's only when you cancel your PLAYONLINE ACCOUNT, which is completely free and which you have no reason to cancel, and leave it inactive for 3 months, that you need to buy a new cd key (thus a new copy of the game).<br />
<br />
so I repeat: you can quit the game and stay gone for a year and come back and re-subscribe and your character should still be there. but, if you quit the game AND cancel your PlayOnline account (again, no reason at all to do this) and don't re-register within 3 months, then your cd key becomes void.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. I speak VERY small amounts of Japanese.  Any way to switch between English and it on-the-fly for better communication?<br />
<br />
2. Whenever I go to the Create Character Screen, I hear the sound effects and can maneuver the menus, but I have no visual.  Now I know this worked at some point on my machine, but I was ... err, not the most attentive individual at the time.  Between creating my first character and now, I've updated video card drivers.

<br />
As most of you know, there is the job system in this game which you can get a subjob and such, mixing and matching classes.  What alot of people do not seem to know is, that you can switch your MAIN JOB at any time to any other job availible and not lose the experience and/or skills gained in the other jobs you used(like in Star Wars Galaxies)!<br />
<br />
E.G. I am a thief, level 5.  I decide I dont want to be a thief, so switch my main job to a red mage.  I become a level 1 Red Mage, but I KEEP THE EXPERIENCE AND LEVEL in the thief job, and have the option to switch back to it at my mog house at any time I please.<br />
<br />
I know some of you might already know that, but last night in game it seemed ALOT of people were really really surprised when I told them.  Makes it so much fun, switching your main job when you get bored or want to be level 1 again to hang with a new friend on the server and such!  <br />

Finally convinced myself to finish the two games Im currently playing first, and that I was there christmas shopping for others not myself.  Besides, I had already spent close to a grand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm enjoying it, it's like being back in your first days of EQ all over again. My only gripe is the window system is kind of obnoxious, how 1/2 the keyboard commands dont work if you have a menu open somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been getting it since I installed, and I don't think the servers are down. I didn't see anything on it in their FAQ, and the only thread about it on FFO Warcry had no solution either. I've tried connecting with my router, and also disconnecting that and going straight through my cable modem.. still no go.<br />
<br />
anyone have this problem and manage to fix it?<br />
<br />
edit: well I apparently fixed it by turning off DNS in my network settings. no clue why that would've worked, but oh well :P<br />
