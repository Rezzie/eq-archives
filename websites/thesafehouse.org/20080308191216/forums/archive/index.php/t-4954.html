Don't think anyone has a formula for it. You won't be using your xbow enough for it to really matter I'm pretty sure. =)</div></div><hr />

THey are nice to have both attacking or defending keeps.  On the defensive side they are nice for slowly chipping away at casters and healers outside while waiting patiently for other assassins to attempt climbing in at your guard station.  On the offensive side I have had many occasions where there will be defenders in the courtyard after we have cleared the wall of archers.  Going down into the courtyard and attacking would be suicide in many cases, but a couple infiltrators on the wall can make people miserable in the courtyard by plugging away with crossbows.  Just be ready to bail over the side if that nuker draws a bead on ya.</div></div><hr />
