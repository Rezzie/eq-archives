<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to decide if I want to adapt Crit and Fumble rules to my system. Currently, on a 20 or a 1, player or me rolls a d10, 1 being exceedingly minor, 10 being major. For Crits, a 10 is an extra die of damage. For fumbles, 10 is loss of weapon, resulting in either loss of attack that round, or the next.<br />
<br />
I'd like to make it a bit more in depth, like 8 on a fumble is a stray shot that could hit someone else, or 9 being you hit yourself ect.... But I don't want it over powered, because I think Crit tables inhereint unbalance systems that weren't designed for PCs to take hits like that. So I want to strike a balance.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Crit systems you've found that work well?  &quot;It's like every chatroom cliche crawled into Safehouse to die&quot; -Caowyth<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was about to say that theres a crit system in the book but then I rememberd you pay 2ed.  <br />
<br />
Check your local gameshop for a &quot;Fumble Die&quot; its a 6 sided die with a variety of effects.  We have two different ones.<br />
The common results are Trip, Fall, Drop Weapon, Break Weapon, Strike Self, Strike Ally.  The difference between the two is that one of them replaces Strike Ally with something else, Think it was Stun Self but I cant remember exactly.<br />
<br />
As far as criticals...  the d20 systems method of criticals is fairly simple and straightforward.  Roll a natural roll within critical range (Normally 20) then you roll a second to hit roll.  If you hit then you do a multiple of damage based on the type of weapon.  Otherwise its just a normal hit.<br />
I remember in more than one dragon magazine (dont know the issue off the top, not that big of a geek) there was critical hit tables.<br />
Or if you get the Players Option: Combat and Tatics they have a whole critical hit, critical fumble system.  That is more cumbersome than Rolemaster critical tables however.  (Though I honestly kind of like the Rolemaster critical system)<br />
<br />
Not sure if any of those sound appealing but its something at least.</div></div><hr />

Heroes don't fumble.  The worst they do is strike a glancing blow, best they do is chopping someone's head off in one shot.<br />
<br />
But then again I'm an idealist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 reasons I chose not to endorse the 3e crit system<br />
<br />
1-I'd have to make crit values and threat ranges for all weapons. I could do it, but it would be time consuming, and obnoxious.<br />
<br />
2-Having a damage multiplier as opposed to extra damage dice results in Crits that are massive, massive, massive. I don't care if my players can hit for 20-25 points of damage on a crit, monsters are a dime a dozen. PCs on the other hand will die with great frequency under those rules, especially considering(within the 2nd ed. system) that monsters will almost always be doing more damage than a meele character, because on average they have more attacks, and have damage bonuses, where as only magic weapons and fighter specialization gives players damage bonuses. I went with my system for crits because it allows at best for 2x base weapon damage(players don't add weapon/specialization or strength to the second die), allows for some variablity in the strength of the crit, and won't gut players when it happens to them. The failing of the system is that sometimes, players do less damage on a crit then they would on an optimal regular attack, which is ghey.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Llabak, I'd agree with your ideal of heroic PCs, except more often that not, my PCs behave like thugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One second edition fumble/crit system I saw went as followed:<br />
<br />
If you roll a natural '20' to hit, that attack hits and you get another attack upon that person.<br />
On this second attack, a natural 20 does NOT grant another attack, nor is a 1 a fumble on this second attack.<br />
<br />
If you roll a natural 1 to hit someone, that person gets an immediate attack against you. Further 1's or 20's on this roll also do not crit/fumble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is kind of intresting...but, were I player in this instance, I'd want the guarenteed extra damage from a nat 20 anyways, not another chance to do more damage. Still, it is just as good as having 2/3 or 3/2 attacks. I disagree with the fumble rule though, I could make that a function of my d10 severity of fumble.... Hrm hrm hrm......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I DM, only players and &quot;important&quot; NPCs use crits.  Normal NPCs are the only ones subject to fumbles.  If a player gets kills by a group of orcs in my game, it won't be due to a random crit that just happens to do 30 points of damage, it'll be because he was overwhelmed by numbers.<br />
<br />
As for PCs that act like thugs...well, thugs rule the roost until someone bigger and stronger takes them down a peg.  Usually, thuggish types end up in prison or dead in my games...typically dead, since PCs hate being captured even more than being killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:PCs hate being captured even more than being killed. <br />
<br />
God isn't that the truth. Problem with my players is, I can throw situations at them they know they can't use brute force, or shouldn't use, to get through. But, depending on how the group is feeling that day, they must just say @#%$ it anways and start laying people out. It gets really old sometimes, because there are just days where they don't want to behave even mildly rationally, they just want to use the first instance they can to shed blood. <br />
<br />
Maybe I will just subjectively apply monster crits. If I think the PCs need to get shaken up a little bit, I'll let a crit go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In 3e, crits don't multiply damage, they multiply dice.<br />
<br />
a 1d8 20/x3 threatens only on a natural 20, and if the second attack roll (with all bonuses added) hits, then it rolls 3d8 for damage.<br />
<br />
Rolling 1d8 as an 8 is significantly easier than rolling 3d8 as a 24, but if you roll a 1 on your d8, your final hit probably won't be for 3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that is kind of like my system then, excepting threat ranges and the second attack role. I could do both though, and make the 3e system work within my d10 system, and rather than doing threat ranges for all weapons, simply do it by weapon size(I believe 2 handers, spears, battle axes, polearms ect.. all classify as Large Weapons) and do multipliers accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-13-03, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nah, they are just really inconsistent. Some days they want story development, others they want to hack @#%$, and most of the time they needle me because they know I'm still untested in the DM field, so they try and @#%$ with my setup and see how far by the nose they can lead me. I've been gearing up for the next session for 2 weeks, and it is their turn to be against the ropes. MUWHAAHAHAHAHA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">05-14-03, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnome hooked hammers are a double weapon that is 1d6 20/x3 and 1d4 20/x4, the only standard weapon other than the scythe (2d4 20/x4) that crits for x4.<br />
<br />
And great axes only threaten on a 20 (x3), while daggers threaten on 19 (x2).<br />
<br />
So, it's really not a matter of weapon size that effects the threat and multiplier, it's really weapon specific.<br />
<br />
A spear threatens on 20 and crits for x3... it makes since, because of the way you fight with a spear, and impaling someone in a vital area is gonna do serious damage. Daggers threaten on a greater range, presumably because they are good at slipping between pieces of armor. Though, the large weapons tend to have higher multipliers. Swords also tend to threaten on a larger range than other weapons (why the hell does every game cater to swords?)<br />
<br />
You don't have to do up an entire weapon table. Just a table for the weapons your pcs are using, and make adaptations as necessary as weapons are introduced. There's very little need to convert katanas if the orient doesn't exist in your world, unless you decide they're just well made swords.<br />
<br />
If you're interested in the 3e version of certain weapons, there are a few hundred of us reading this forum that have PHBs.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: replying in mid math homework, i misread your bit about threat ranges but I'm too monofocused and braindead right now to change it without rewriting the entire post. <br />
<br />
That's actually pretty logical. I think, to clarify the above 3e system, that weapons that are easy to wield and that can be used to bypass defense threaten higher. Sword slashes can still be aimed between plates, and rapiers pierce sort of like daggers. Great axe blades are too large to fit between armor plates, so instead they simply shatter the plate...<br />
<br />
In other words and possibly contradicting what I wrote above, since I'm braindead due to homework procrastination, large weapons definitely should crit for more, but not necessarily have an increased threat range. You can swing with all your might at a granite door as long as you want with a hammer and won't break it (regular attacks made with a great axe on someone in magical splintmain), but if you target the copper hinges (critical hit with a dagger in the ribcage between the sheets), you'll take it out of order quickly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">05-14-03, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just making sure people realize under 3e when you score a crit, you also multiply any damage bonuses (except for damage bonuses represented as extra dice, such as from a sneak attack or flaming sword) on the roll.<br />
<br />
For example, if you crit with greataxe (X3) and normally have a +4 damage with it, you would roll 3d12+12 (1d12+4 three times).<br />
<br />
That is a summary of Players Handbook pg 119 under the Multiplying Damage section.<br />
<br />
I like the crit system they have in place, and as a DM you can always fudge a roll here and there if you do not like the results.  However, at least for me, as the players get higher level, the gloves come off.  Especially on the main NPCs.  At lower level the crit system is pretty brutal, both ways.<br />
<br />
Just a bit of clarification.   <br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-15-03, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, problem being with the multiplied damage bonus, and dice multiplication on weapons like that is.....any player in 2nd ed. under lvl 3 that gets critted with a weapon like that is dead, just dead. And reflexively, most comprable monsters are dead too. Too much power in the crit there. I don't want damage bonuses stacking up, because that is were the really massive base damage builds up. I want crits to be a sort of &quot;Yeah! I rolled a 20!&quot; minor reward thing, as opposed to &quot;oh god give me a 20 so I can wipe this thing off the face of the earth&quot;. I see it this way. Threat ranges are a nice explanation for why great swords or daggers crit better than clubs or swords, but it is making my crit system more complex than it needs to be. Damage multipliers are a good way of explaining why some weapons like 2 hnd axes or lances do massive crit damage as opposed to a stick, but under the 3e rules they just deal out too much damage for my taste. <br />
<br />
The fact a great sword rolls a larger damage die than a dagger is explanation enough for me for why the greatsword has better damage potential than the dagger, and why when it maxes out, it will blow the dagger damage out of the water. Sure, you lose the guarentee of having overall better damage on your greatsword as opposed to the dagger, but with my group especially, I don't want to guarentee them anything. I have enough of a time dealing with how they build their characters, I don't need them banking on a crit system so they can build characters that will crit high enough for system shock checks at 3rd level.</div></div><hr />

Best way I've found to deal with them is to change things in your campaign just enough that it's not the quite same rules as the core rules, but that takes a lot of time on your part.<br />

<br />
That crit system was beautiful for the sadistic at heart.<br />
<br />
Like I said in my post for 3e crits, as the DM you have the right to fudge with rolls.  At low level crits are overpowered to an extent that is unbelievable.  One thing I would suggest (sticking with the 3e system) is the infamous mulligan rule or just ignoring crits below level 4 or so.  Probably just ignoring crits until level 4 or so is best, or not allowing a crit to push a player/NPC below -1 hp is another option.<br />
<br />
I understand why they did the system as they did.  Since hp are an abstract, it is best to keep criticals the same.  Called shots are completely different, though.  One book (I forget which) suggested having to roll a successful critical AFTER announcing a called shot.  If it did not crit, you miss all together.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the thread drift.  Just trying to throw some ideas out there.<br />
