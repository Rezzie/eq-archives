<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheCountofThree</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the game fine as it is now (other than the crashy stutter bug 1.20 introduced for me) but these are a few things I would like to have in the inevitable expansions.. feel free to add your own ideas!<br />
<br />
1.More PC customization... more heads, body types, sound sets(maybe racial soundsets) sub races (elven vampire, human werewolf etc) that give bonuses/penalties and other abilities or restrictions.<br />
<br />
2. Prestige classes (no brainer)<br />
<br />
3. Change the level limit - 15 would have been ideal and then up it to 20 for an expansion.. people dont seem to realize how powerful level 20 is. Half the people playing NWN would not believe that Drizzt is only 15th level..<br />
<br />
4. Maybe a city pack with several cities all over faerun that could be added easily into custom mods<br />
<br />
5. A character pack with famous (and lesser known) npcs that can be placed in mods, uniforms for some of the various factions, generic NPC's (red wizards of thay!) and items from some of the other places in the realms<br />
<br />
6. An Evermeet campaign! Underdark, Icewind Dale, Mithril Hall are all expected as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just reviewing what you posted up here...a few comments:<br />
1) Can currently be done with custom code.  However, there is no way to enforce the ECL rules for some of the tougher sub-races (that I have been able to figure out).<br />
2-3) I agree fully - also include the ability to add new feats, etc.  Let's get the epic rules programmed as well.<br />
4-6) I think they are waiting to see what the players are putting together.<br />
<br />
Now, some of things I would like to see (out of scope of the current code - to the best of my knowledge)<br />
a) More animations for the models (social type stuff)<br />
b) Add negative energy/positive energy/prismatic effects on weapons<br />
c) Get more of the game closer to 3rd Edition PnP (feats, equipment usage, etc.)<br />
d) Ability to add classes, races, feats, and skills to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-17-02, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah prestige classes is a no brainer, as is monster races for PC's<br />
<br />
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get rid of the assigning stats for attributes. i have NEVER played tabletop in any campaign and had anyone ever use this or want to use it.<br />
<br />
need more skins! (I'm sure there's a way to add them but I don't know how yet)<br />
<br />
basic cities from different worlds (forgoten realms, greyhawk, etc) even if they were unpopulated just the designs would be nice. <br />
<br />
and again I'm sure there's already a way to do this but I haven't figured it out yet, someon let me add new portraits and sound sets. heck if baldur's gate 1 can do it NWN must be able to at least.<br />
<br />
also I'd like to be able to go to a first person view but that's probably just a personal pet peeve that's not likely to ever go in.  <br />

<br />
DMs: enable switches to turn off maps, force first-person camera and/or disable Tab-key (or mouse-sweeping)<br />
<br />
Toolest: confirm that CRs are functioning properly so level-appropriate modules can be made &amp;amp; add a pull-down-menu system in the script program<br />
<br />
Almost everything else can be fixed or added to by scriptors, modelers, module builders (e.g., HCR scripts... if you don't have them your missing out).<br />

<br />
I would like to see them convert everything over to the 2nd edition rules. nuf said! haha<br />

<br />
My main problems are in the toolset too, I'd like to be able to add a stinkin hill or maybe a stream that doesn't have to go in a straight line.<br />
<br />
The scripting stuff could be simplified quite a bit too, to where you don't have to write your own scripts but they could provide tools to let you build them even if you weren't sure how to do it.  Sort of like how programs like GoLive help you build webpages even if you don't know jack about HTML.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside of that:<br />
<br />
-Definitely more skins.  I hate all the 3rd edition character models.  Everything has to be spikey, I can't even have a freaking fluffy beard on my gnome.  Its got to be spikey. Grr.<br />
<br />
-And gnolls! How can you not have gnolls!?</div></div><hr />

!!!!!!!!!! You can't do that?! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Curse them! Curse them all to hell! I don't want to be like the everyday gamer and use premade stuff for my D&amp;amp;D conversions! I want to look like I picture myself in my mind!<br />
<br />
  Rage!!!<br />
<br />
...oops wrong forum.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you really can't at least import your own portrait, it really really blows.<br />
<br />
Back to topic.<br />
<br />
The attributes thing Kroe mentioned is a necessity to keep the min/max'ers out there happy, and it has been in most D&amp;amp;D conversions I've seen to this date. It doesn't really irk me too much, I simply bring up my trusted d6's and make the final result as close to that as possible.<br />
<br />
2E rules switch would be amazing (as if it's going to happen  ), as would more PC skins.<br />
<br />
And of course, the lack of a &quot;moon&quot; emote is a severe shortcoming   <br />
<br />

Its just a matter of the right format.  I found a couple of websites out there that actually had step by step instructions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would just like to chip in that I really like the way that the charater design system means that you can produce the character you want instead of the one you get given, and that all characters are now balanced. I appreciate, but do not understand, that some people are welded to random characters, but would ask them to remeber that not everyone who prefers design is a minimaxer. I might just as well say that we should have a BG style random system for all the '6 18s after only 300 rerolls!' crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah there will be those out there that would rape the dice rolling system, but lets face it you'll see them anyway with the plus 5 vorpal longswords of shocking flaming burst.   those people will find a way around it anyway so weshould be given the option to do point placement or roll it.<br />
<br />
eh pet peeve. <br />
<br />
onto the other point could you give us the link to any sites showing how to do portraits? it really erks me having to pick fromt he few they gave us.</div></div><hr />

And that's without saying he is using the scimitars he ends up getting on the Surface...and later those bracers/anklets...Bleh, what can I say, I liked those books...Drizzt = one bad mutha...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheCountofThree</div><div class="date">07-23-02, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing your critique of Drizzt was meant for a different thread, but anyway..<br />
<br />
His scimitars are actually +3 (frostbrand, hates demons and makes you immune to fire) and +5 (defender, adds to ac bonus when used to parry)<br />
<br />
I never got into that crazy negative ac stuff with 2nd edition, but for 3rd edition I believe Drizzt's AC is around 24.<br />
<br />
I can't tell if youre saying 19 dex is bad because its too low, too high, or if it doesnt matter because its dex or what, so I wont say anything else about that</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-24-02, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually third edition I think his dex would be 20 now because they changed the stat adjustments on elves I think. I'm sure a suplpiment dealing with him will be released eventually hehe.</div></div><hr />
