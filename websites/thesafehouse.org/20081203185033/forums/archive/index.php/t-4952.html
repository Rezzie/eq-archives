Is stealth usefull for anything other than RvR or should I just ignore it until I'm gearing up for pvp?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I reccomend ignoring stealth for at least your first dozen or two levels. That way you can have tons of points to mess around with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also enjoy sneaking up on friends, however. Aside from my own mischievous nature, stealth is much more valuable in realm warfare so if you want to wait a few Winters then having a low stealth skill shouldn't hinder you too much. <br />

Is this just a matter of hitting the stealth button, or must you in fact be hidden? How does this work in RvR?<br />

<br />
I think it is good training to deal with low stealth. If you are good with low stealth you will be great once you have high stealth. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In RvR it works the same; however, if another player is far enough away from you they will not see you as a &quot;ghost&quot; but they won't even see you at all.<br />
<br />
The normal constraints apply though. You can't hide if you're too close to an enemy, if you've just been in combat, how high the person / mob is in relation to you, etc.  These factors are influenced by your skill level in stealth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aunoa Pyrotechnica</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After playing in the new 20 to 24 Battlefield zone, I am truely convinced that high Stealth skill is a huge advantage.  I am a 23 Infiltrator with 22 steatlh skill and was scouting the battlefield up to Midguard's fort.  I was hanging stealthed out near the ruins and turned around to see two full groups of Middies running towards my area.  I gulped and thought I was dead.  The hoard of players ran right through me, tanks, archers, and casters.  They NEVER saw me.  I told the chat channel about the advance and how many. Our side was truely ready for them, we beat them back fiercly.  I came in behind the battle stealthed and took out casters and archers that backed away from the fight to sit and med.  Even after backstabbing and killing the caster, a couple tanks came to help the caster. I was able to re-stealth stood there and the tanks ran around in circles, crossing in front of me and couldn't find me.  I for one will keep stealth at or real close to 100% of my level.  I'm telling ya, you won't see me coming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dragoonkain Of Hayl</div><div class="date">03-22-02, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good point...just pointing out however that for the high levels stealth becomes &quot;capped&quot; in a way.<br />
<br />
If you're a lvl 40 stealther and with items that have +stealth on them your stealth is 45, a lvl 43 searching for you will have the same chance as a lvl 45.<br />
<br />
i.e. the game compares your total stealth lvl with the character lvl of the searcher. At lvl 50 the most +skill you can have on any one skill is +11 so if your stealth is 39+11(50total), you're as hidden as you can be. A lot of people rely on the +11 so they can stop training stealth at 39 and put the points into other things.</div></div><hr />
