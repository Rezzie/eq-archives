<br />
I have played assassins in the past, but never played a shadowzerker. I would like to roll one up.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not sure exactly how to spec one. I am shooting to spec one out for around 30th level as I dont play a ton, and speccing for 50 makes no sense to me.<br />
<br />
My question is this :<br />
<br />
With envenom, does the level 22 enervating poison take effect before or after your backstab/perf damage? (This is just to see if maybe its worth doing enervating as a standard CS blade...). And is it worth getting envenom to 22 as a shadowzerker?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a decent spec out for a level 30 SZ that I could look over? Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time</div></div><hr />

(It does get tiring answering the same question dozens of times.)</div></div><hr />

Sorry to have bothered you, I wont ask anything again.</div></div><hr />

if you read the poison faq and rogue faq before asking, then no worries. Dither Disgustipated<br />

Hey Iriki, this is a QA forum. If you don't like answering questions, don't come here. <br />
<br />
Clonexx,<br />
Welcome to our rogue community. Ask anything you'd like. Someone has already probably asked the question and someone will probably ask it again. So don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Clonexx Dorfxx</div><div class="date">02-27-02, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Tak...I do have a couple of questions just because I would really like to make ONE blade, and leave it at that. Ive never gotten to a viable RvR range with one, so I don't know how they would work out.<br />
<br />
What I am thinking of doing is getting CS to 10 for BS 2, so I can punch through bladeturn on my opening shot. I would have DOT poison on the mainhand weapon and snare poison on the offhand. With the initial backstab, the first tick of poison should happen (and break the snare) about the same time that I am taking my 2nd swing I believe. Keeping LA and Axe fairly maxxed with stealth not far behind and the rest into Envenom was how I am planning to go.<br />
<br />
My big questions are these :<br />
<br />
1) How many shadowzerkers out there are specced like this, and how do you do in RvR?<br />
<br />
2) Does a shadowzerker do comparable damage with the LA styles, compared to a Berserker? (Obviously it will be less due to STR, but are there any other diminishing factors?)<br />
<br />
Thanks for everyones time.</div></div><hr />

Your spec plan is much like mine. Looks good. I recommend you plan where you want to be every five levels or so. This will help maximizing where you want to be... particularly when you solo.<br />
<br />
Keep your gear yellow to orange.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 10 Norse Shadowzerk and I'm outdamaging warriors a lvl higher then me frequently. However, I have a ways to go. I do not want to outdamage warriors when I hit the 20's and 30's in my pajamas (leather armor). I must assume that if you keep your axe, left axe near max then your damage will curve well with levels.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any shadowzerks on my server. Most are twink crit strikers or original hard nosed assassins from day one. <br />
<br />
But that is half of the fun I've noticed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are there any Shadowzerkers out there that can share some RvR stories about themselves? How thing work out?<br />
<br />
I know critblades fair very well in the right situations, just wondering if shadowzerkers do as well.<br />
<br />
Another thing I always wondered was if the LA chains do more damage then the crit anytime chains. (Ravager, Atrophy, Scathing Blade as opposed to Garrote then Achilles). Or whether or not those LA styles do as much damage as Creeping Death.<br />
<br />
I know, a lot of questions =P But I'm really struggling with how I wanna spec out my assassin so I dont end up gimped.</div></div><hr />
