<br />
I've been playing since alpha 2 and still really enjoy the game. The constant addition of content and new features has really been a great thing... not to mention the stability and beautiful world.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I'd love to start a little theorycrafting here as I'm interested in other Burglar's experiences. Obviously, there's really two separate roles, as a solo player and as a fellowed player. Seems in a fellowship Agility would play a much more significant role than might, since the more free conjunctions, the better. But as solo I find a much closer blend of might and agility is best. For weapons I tend to choose a mace for my primary (slower speed, bigger damage range, chance to stun) and a nice fast high &quot;dps&quot; weapon for my offhand.<br />
<br />
I've not done any math or anything like that, just kind of makes sense to me. My skills are mostly mainhand based and are a significant source of my damage, so it would seem that a high max damage weapon would out-damage a faster, but lower max damage weapon.<br />
<br />
Well, I hope there's some Burgs hangin about. Also interested in what you guys think of the current Legendary traits and the new ones coming in Book 12.<br />

Oh well.  Has it gotten better?  I hear they are doing relatively well with subscription numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Worelorm</div><div class="date">02-29-08, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had no interest in the game when it first came out but have been utterly bored with my current game(s) lately. So, I decided to give the game a shot and downloaded their 7 day free trial last week. <br />
<br />
Much to my surprise I have really enjoyed myself. I've had the most fun with my Burglar but have also found the Minstrel to be a kick. Anyway, I officially purchased the game today because I definitely want to see more. :kroe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Algernon</div><div class="date">04-22-08, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not currently playing -- my guild is taking a break -- but, I'm going to start recruiting very soon. <br />
<br />
We're on Silverlode, guild is Afterlife (yes, that Afterlife, Thott is leader, Tabin is raid leader) and we plan to be resuming our raid schedule a month or 2 before Mines of Moria. However, some of us -- likely myself included -- will be playing at least part-time when 13 goes live. <br />
<br />
We're very competent, but we're not necessarily hardcore. About 80% of the guild plays WoW full-time and pops in for events when they're not raiding there. I'd say half the guild has multiple 50s (I'm not one of them, by choice), and we've done the Balrog a couple of times, but we usually didn't have the numbers so he wasn't on farm mode when we stopped raiding a few months ago. <br />
<br />
If you're not on Silverlode, but have the time to reroll, we can offer some powerleveling ... but, of course, we'll have to talk to you in Vent for a bit to make sure you're in this for the long haul. <br />
<br />
Hope at least 1 or 2 of you are interested. <br />
<br />
My burglar on Silverlode is 'Toffi'. <br />
<br />
Oh, and if you don't want to join the guild, but you're willing to do intance runs with us, just let me know. <br />
<br />
Thanks and take it easy. <br />
