Tharridon Server<br />
<br />
Are you still looking for a place to call home, to hang up your swordbelt after a weary days adventure? Or, a place where the action is hot and the comradity heavy? We invite you to check out our guild website and see if what you see there lines up with where you envision yourself years down the road - with a leadership team boasting nearly a decade of experience in the genre, and a drive towards attaining something to set us apart on our server, we are putting out the call for mature, community centric folks to pay heed.<br />
<br />
Our Goals:<br />
Our goal within Vanguard is nothing other then to have fun, and to put ourselves on the front lines of PvP &amp; PvE combat as a known foe with reknown and acclaim - our name should stand for something, and our membership base epitomize this.  <br />
<br />
If one was to put  a name to the niche style of play that we at Bladesworn choose, that would be FFA (Free for All) PvP (Player vs Player) Casual Raiding, Family Based Guild.    IF you have something you feel you can bring to the Bladesworn team in a positive, dynamic way, dont be bashful, you are more then welcome to drop us a line on the site, or shoot any of us a tell ingame directly, we would *love* to hear from you!<br />
<br />
May your journeys in Telon be laden with prosperity and prospect,<br />
Regards,<br />
Kerwyn Silentblade</div></div><hr />
