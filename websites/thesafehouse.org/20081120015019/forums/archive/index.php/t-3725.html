Just link your strat section on your web site and stop spamming this board. KKTHX !</div></div><hr />

You can see this when you first click on &quot;The Back Alley&quot;. <br />
<br />
Just because you two think its cool to attack someone who is adding to the forum or insulted because you know how to do an event for that he has posted, doesn't give you the right to degrade his efforts.<br />
<br />
And for spamming, I could understand that if he actually kept posting the same information over and over again, but his topics, posted, have been different.<br />
<br />
As for soupypoopy, you are doing a great job gathering information for raid encounters and relaying it in a clear concise fashion. <br />
<br />
Though, I must admit, the debate about learning an encounter via a spoiler versus hands on experiance has given me seconds thoughts to reading some of the posts on this website, but thats for a different forum. <br />
<br />
Keep up the good job</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Saroumane</div><div class="date">07-19-03, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice job ,but there something really false : Quote:Here's another one of those events with crazy risk versus reward.<br />
<br />
     Everytime we have kill him ,he just drop junk...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tanise Manasponge</div><div class="date">07-19-03, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye good point.<br />
<br />
Risk vs Reward is only screwy cuz he usually drops crap for you 20ish minutes invested. They should flag his loot good (war bracer, dagger, ft4 gloves) and bad (robe, etc) maybe even have a crap flag too for the 2hs. The he could drop 1 good item and 1 bad =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why SoS as opposed to simply hide/sneak, unless I missing something with SoS its simply a more reliable hide/sneak; and from what I could tell (only did this encounter once) nothing on this route see's though it ?<br />
<br />
Is there some specific referance to 'toss a dart' im missing; or is simply stick an arrow in him, rehide and walk back to fight spot staying out of range of him ?.<br />
<br />
This is from the perpective of a 61 rogue who hasnt done to much pulling recently baring the occational sneak pull, so I may just be missing something.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the MR requirments, may have just been lucky but with 200 MR at lvl 61 I resisted the AE 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the mob is underwater. Have you tried to hide/sneak underwater? He'd catch up to you and smack you.<br />

<br />
The latter (hit him with a ranged item and run).</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoS allows you to move at full speed underwater ? I can't remember seeing this mentioned anyware before hence the question, also checked out all the SoS related topics I could find in the training studio before posting this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Futumsh</div><div class="date">07-23-03, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, SoS does not affect underwater sneak speed.  Unless a named fish / slime is up, there should be no difference between normal sneak/hide and SoS for the purpose of pulling in this area.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ishwar2</div><div class="date">10-23-03, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After revamp some regular fish see invis. This means you need a SoS rogue to check spawn.<br />
<br />
The trigger is in the back of the green pool. There will be 2 blobs sitting on top of each other when its up.<br />
<br />
I belive the spawn time is less than 5 days. My guild failed it on sunday, and it was up again wedensday. Migth have changed with rewamp who knows, but i am pretty sure it was less than 5 days in the past as well. Edited by: Ishwar2  at: 10/22/03 11:37 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe you went to the &quot;Sewers&quot; area, where there are plenty of mosquitoes and all of them DO see through regular hide/sneak or invis.<br />
<br />
The Acid Mass Ring is in the area that used to be called the &quot;Gator Pits&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just a helpful tip from a rogue who frequents CT... :)<br />

If a mob chases you to the zone - thats one thing.. but what your telling people to do in your strat guide will get them warned or banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have used my druid to scout the green pool many times. Have only died once. There are fish that can see invis but not very often. Theres also a named lizard that can spawn in the goo tunnel that does see invis.</div></div><hr />
