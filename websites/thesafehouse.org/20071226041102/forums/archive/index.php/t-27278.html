I watched the first episode.  I think it might have potential, and when the '12 assassin girls in frilly dresses' arrive, I'm thinking 'WTF?!' but chuckling at the audacity of the situation.</div></div><hr />

Well I thought so too at first but I dunno. Action fans might eat it up but overall it seems to be a clone of all the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's only a three disk, 12 episode series so not a huge investment, I don't mind a Cowboy Bebop clone so long as they have fun with it and entertain me, and if Coyote Ragtime Show sells well it'll probably encourage ADV to try and license other shows shortly after their japanese release instead of waiting a couple years.</div></div><hr />
