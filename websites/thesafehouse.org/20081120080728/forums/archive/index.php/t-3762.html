At the moment I dual a Dagger of Distraction (type 8 slot) as well as a Sparkling Shorsword (type 4 slot), I'd like to put a proc augment on both of them but not really sure what I should put, here are the choices :<br />
-75 Lifetap proc from MM (checks on neg 25 RDisease, exists both in type 4 and  .<br />
-150 DD proc from Ruj (checks on neg 25 RPoison, exists both in type 4 and  .<br />
<br />
Dont know yet what to put, so I'd like your opinions on this, please</div></div><hr />

It almost never gets resisted and it seems to go off constantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are, lifetaps are more valuable to you. If you're not, then pure damage is more of an asset. As far as which type of pure damage DD, I recommend Rujarkin's, since so few things out there have a decent resist check against it. Permafrost/cold, while in a similar league for damage and resist modifier, suffers from so many mobs having high resist checks against it.<br />
<br />
Just my opinions, anyway.</div></div><hr />

I believe it's only type 8. There's definitely a 125 poison DD version though.<br />
<br />
That being said, I've bought the 150 cold DD from Miragul and I'm very happy with it. I've yet to see it consistently resisted in any zone. Overall, I would say that cold and poison are about equal when it comes to resists, while magic and fire are more likely to be resisted.<br />
<br />
As for the lifetap, I believe it's overhyped. You can expect two procs every minute, which amounts to 15 hp/tick regen, which is equivalent to a fungi tunic. Regen used to be nice, but in PoP it pretty much amounts to nothing. So personally, I'd rather go for more damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Let's do some math here. Since average proc time is 30sec/proc...<br />
75hp/30sec = 2.5hp/sec<br />
Let's just assume you have the same augment in your off-hander and it procs at the same rate. Now you have 5hp/sec, in a 2 minute fight, you gain 600hp... that's not even half a hit on most PoP raid bosses -- and this is not to mention you will get a lot less healing efficiency for the time when you are not getting hit/ae'd, or when healers heal to back to full hp.<br />
<br />
Lifetap is more valuable for groupers, not raiders. Edited by: Assling Hero at: 10/18/03 7:56 am</div></div><hr />

AE damage is about the only thing I can really count on hurting me, and that's almost exclusively raid-content for me.<br />
<br />
If I die in a raid encounter, it's because healers are focused on the main tank and rampage tank types. If I die, it's only by a small amount of health. 600hp is easily enough to make or break me in some POP encounters that get close. Your mileage may vary, which is why there's the caveat that this is my opinion, my experiences.<br />
<br />
Either way, procs are only about 1 DPS. 150 versus a 75 lifetap is all about flavour and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also from those numbers you can calculate the regen since lifetap dps times 6 equals regen per a tick.  giving you 15 pts of regen from those numbers.<br />
<br />
So all in all the dps camp would trade 15 pts of regen a tick for 2.5 dps. i think that camp is high~  In fact i'll make that trade all day long if you want.  I got 170dps.  How much of it do you want to trade at the rate of -2.5dps for +15 regen a tick.  Ill go all of it if you want.  I mean whats that +800hp a tick?  Lets go~  this is awesome ratio.<br />
 specially since 2.5 dps is LESS then or approximately equal to 1% increase in dps to that rogue at the top.   saying 15 pts of regen is worthless is crazy.   its a mythical game of eq that i dont play.</div></div><hr />

Unlike having 600 more max HP, the 600hp of lifetap you would have gotten doesn't all go off when you are low in health:<br />
If you are getting AE'd and dying slowly and your healers still ain't healing you, there's a problem with your healers, not you.If you are getting beat on, you are probably dying so fast that you will only have a proc or two go off, are those 75-150hp lifetap going to prevent you from dying?<br />
You guys seems to be missing the fact that you don't always stay below 100% hp. Even on Quarm fights, I'm often at full health, at those times, healthing efficiency on liftetap = 0.</div></div><hr />

What you do with procs wont swing a guild fight in time. Nobody goes to quarm going &quot;ya baby we got 150dd procs instead of 75hp lifetaps now your going down!&quot; I recommend you think about some other things when your thinking about procs.<br />

Huh?<br />
Quote:What you do with procs wont swing a guild fight in time. Nobody goes to quarm going...<br />
I recommend you to go back and read what I wrote again when you wake up, I never said my 150dd procs are the break/make of any fight, in fact, I said the heals from lifetaps won't make/break even break yourself in PoP raid encounters, so it's pretty pointless.<br />
Oh yeah, about Quarm. I wrote, and I quote:<br />

<br />
Sorry bud, I totally disagree with you. There are many times when in raid or otherwise that the 600hps+ (high dex makes a def diff), would have meant life or death and if nothing else, if I stay alive long enough to realize the 600hps, that means I could have backstabbed 10 times? and done constant dmg for x dps.<br />
<br />
Now even if not raiding, I solo allot (yeah a rogue who solos) in LoY zones. It is rough and many fights are very close to either me or him, so I fight near a zone and zone if it is him this time.. and stand if I am winning another. I remember so often soloing with dual bloodpoints in days gone by. Back then as in now, I loved the lifetap proc. I won more times just because I was the one last standing. It made me a true believer of lifetaps.<br />
<br />
I look at it like this.. If you proc, you are really doing 2x the proc dmg because not only are you hurting him, but you are healing you. Even if you are full health you still do the lifetap dmg. You might not be healing yourself, but you are still doing dmg to him. Because of the low agro of a lifetap and low resists, I would choose a lifetap proc over a dd any day of the week for my personal fighting style.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to be mean but, can you read everything before you post? I've addressed what you said already.<br />

Again, I would definately agree that if you are solo'ing, grouping, or doing some low end raiding... basically anywhere that mobs have low DPS the 75 lifetap would mean something. But even at mid-end PoP, mobs are quad'ing and AE'ing for hundreds to thousands -- that 75 lifetap proc is nearly pointless.<br />
Quote:I look at it like this.. If you proc, you are really doing 2x the proc dmg because not only are you hurting him, but you are healing you.<br />
Actually, if you really want to do 2x the proc get a 150dd, you can do math right?<br />
<br />
I, for one, am the offensive type rogue. I'm here to do damage. I value DPS more than regen, because I play a rogue to do damage. Out of all the mid-end to high-end guilds I know, rogues are always one of the last class to die, WTF do I need more regen for?<br />
<br />
I am not going to go in deepth and research everyone, but please realize that I am specificly talking about mid to high end PoP encounters, so if your hardest fight is just ie. Behemoth... you win, go for the lifetap. HOWEVER, since the POSTER wields DoD, I think my reply address to him more directly (on PoTime, like I have previously stated), than how uber a 75 lifetap proc would save your ass from Behemoth AE or when you are solo'ing in LoY.<br />
<br />
That is all.    Edited by: Assling Hero at: 10/20/03 1:42 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TaeldienWrk</div><div class="date">10-23-03, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know bud, but many times the cleric in the group is healing the MA and not paying that much attention to the group. If you dont have a backup healer in the group then that 600 hps could actually save your ass even in a behemoth fight if the cleric just missed one heal. <br />
<br />
I understand your point and it is quite valid. The proc gets trivialized according to the dmg you are taking. It isnt always about the dmg you are taking though, and for those fights it is more about staying alive. Many times the mob may turn around just to hit you for a few 1000k and then then turns back around to the MA or to someone else while you evade. <br />
<br />
A point just as valid however is agro. DD proc is an attention getter while a lifetap proc doesnt have near the agro attached to it. You have to remember too, that his weapons are not used JUST in raids, but also just in groups and it is never in the best interest of the rogue to attract attention to himself through a dd proc. I used stanos wicked greeves and it is a right click poison that I can apply to my blade. Only thing is, that is pisses the mob off when it procs. In most encounters I can take the dmg when he turns around to smack me, but in raid fights I remove it all together because I dont need thunderclap, or some other named turning around to beat on me cause he didnt like the proc.<br />
<br />
I still repeat, for my personal fighting style I prefer to have a lifetap over a DD even if in raid encounter and it means a marginal decrease in my overall dps during the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Windaria</div><div class="date">10-23-03, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go for the 125DD poison proc.  <br />
<br />
First it's pretty cheap at 510pts.  So if you have to buy it again after you get a weapon upgrade its not that many points.<br />
<br />
Second.  If the extra damage causes the mob to die before it strikes 1 additional blow, then you've saved that much life by not taking that damage.<br />
<br />
Third.  It's the coolest looking proc in the game, and looking cool is really the most important thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sdaasiil Gladeborn</div><div class="date">10-23-03, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are looking to survive AE damage during raids, then lifetaps are not the right chioce. Get the spell damage prevention procs, they will block more damage than you would heal with the lifetap.  Its better to prevent the damage than to heal it afterwards.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to DO more damage then get the pure DD proc. <br />
<br />
Don't half-ass it with lifetaps trying to do both. Lifetaps ALWAYS deal less damage than the pure DD, and sometimes the heals do nothing. Therefore they are less efficient at those times.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps, get one pure 150DD and one Spell Guard 4 on the offhand. That way you do more damage immediately (main hand procs more) and block more damage. Spell Guard blocks damage over time, not all at once, therefore even with the reduced off hand proc rate you should have it up at all times.</div></div><hr />

AP/DD is Adventure Points / Direct Damage (fewer APs to aquire to get more dmg is better)<br />
