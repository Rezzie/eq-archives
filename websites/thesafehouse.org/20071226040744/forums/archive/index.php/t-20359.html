<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-12-05, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, may as well start with a summary and then comments on the lastest episode.<br />
<br />
One Piece mainly your typical Shounen anime. In terms of popularity, it has been the highest ranking show almost every week for the last five years, trumping shows like Naruto and Bleach. A large part of the reason is that One Piece is not centered around the action, like Naruto and Bleach are. It puts more emphasis on the story than the other two, and on the concept of &quot;adventure&quot; rather than fighting.<br />
<br />
Due to this, it's become a hit family show that families get together to watch, rather than being a hit among younger children and Otaku in their 20's. <br />
<br />
The basic premise of the story is about Monkey D. Luffy, (Nickname, Last name, Given name in that order) and his quest to become the Pirate King. When the first Pirate King, Gold Roger died, a era of pirates began as everyone set on a quest to find the vast treasure he left behind in the Grand Line.<br />
<br />
Along the way, we see him pick up characters, the first two and most notable being Roronoa Zoro, a pirate hunter, and Nami, the Navigator. Along the way a few people join the crew, bringing it up to a current total of 8 as of the current fansubbed episode, 160.<br />
<br />
One thing that is different about One Piece is the heavy emphasis on character development. I'll bring up the story arcs to explain how strong the developments are.<br />
<br />
Captain Morgan Arc: Episodes 1-3.<br />
<br />
Buggy Arc: Episodes 4-8<br />
<br />
Kuro Arc: Episodes 9-17 (Ussopp Backstory)<br />
<br />
Don Kreig Arc: Episode 18-30 (Sanji Backstory)<br />
<br />
Arlong Arc: Episode 31-44 (Nami Backstory)<br />
<br />
Buggy Side Story Episode 45-47 (manga filler)<br />
<br />
Logue Town Arc: Episode 48-53<br />
<br />
Warship Island Arc: Episode 54-60 ( anime filler)<br />
<br />
Whiskey Peak Arc: Episode 61-67<br />
<br />
Coby/Helmeppo Side Story: Episode 68-69 (manga filler)<br />
<br />
Little Garden Arc: Episode 70-77<br />
<br />
Drum Island Arc: Episode 78-91 (Chopper Backstory)<br />
<br />
Alabasta Arc: Episode 92-130<br />
<br />
Filler Arc: Episode 131-143<br />
<br />
Jaya Arc: 144-152<br />
<br />
Skypeia Arc: 153-195<br />
<br />
As can be seen, a good amount of time is spent on character development, the only exception being Luffy and Zoro who have their story developing all throughout the series in little bits and pieces. And one current character that is being developed in the current Water Seven arc.<br />
<br />
Links to torrents can be requested via PM. Please don't post it directly on the thread.<br />
<br />
Discussion can begin on episode 160 in spoiler tags, I suggest anything relating to the Skypeia arc being in spoiler tags, and unspoilered for the rest of the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you're just a horny little kid. :p<br />
<br />
Water Seven arc is what is being currently aired in Japan, which goes into Nico Robin's backstory. I decieded to avoid saying her name because it's a massive spoiler for the smarter folk among us who haven't gotten to Skypeia yet.<br />
<br />
So I didn't want to say it in the first post.<br />
<br />
But the later arcs will be:<br />
<br />
G8 Arc: 196-206 (filler)<br />
<br />
Davy Back Fight Arc: 207-219<br />
<br />
Water Seven Arc: 227-current.</div></div><hr />

Ok the Balls guy really annoys me just as he did in the manga. It should be illegal to make people as annoying as him. I'm a little annoyed that Luffy's being played around so much so early in this, especially considering we haven't heard anything about Enel yet. Other than he makes some very bad things come out of the sky.<br />

Provided we don't discuss things that are in the anime or haven't been subbed by KF yet(KF is the only one who subbed from the beginning and is still over a year behind the current japanese episodes).  At least until KF catches up with the new guys at Gama.<br />

<br />
I do. School began for K-F that's why they are slow. One of them is going for their Masters, I think the main translater Dythim is. And anoother is going for another degree.<br />
<br />
Although, I am pretty thankful in general. Because of Gerusama, I'll have like, 60 episodes to sit through once K-F gets to around 210. I still love K-F, but Geru does a good job, especially on the animation since it's HDTV. I'll probably do that over 1 day :D Lots of coffee and a tube attached to my ****.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Like to mention I actually like the anime better, though. Seeing them in action feels much better. But, the manga is very good still, anyway. Especially when they are showing poses and emotion.</div></div><hr />

You too huh.  Man, thats gonna be like the greatest week ever.  Getting 60-80 episodes all at once.  Man, I can't wait.  Long way to go for KF to get there though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spoiler episode 162<br />
Well, for 161 too, but man, chopper slow-mo blowing the whistle with instant replay is the win. I'm having a tad suspense of disbelief in this episode (even as far as One Piece logic goes) that Gan Fall was able to kick around one of the priests, where luffy can't even land a hit. It's a little fustrating seeing Luffy so helpless and being played with.<br />
<br />
And most importantly... NAMI FANSERVICEOMGERZWOOTERS!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
After K-F, because that's what most people follow. Make sure to clearly differnate between manga, raw, and K-F recent release spoilers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-13-05, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Starting with episode 162, we at #K-F will start using X264 to encode our episodes.<br />
<br />
For those who don't know, X264 is a new codec which will eventually completely replace XviD. You can think of it as being higher quality for the same size file or lower file size for the same quality. There are several sites of comparison, but I won't list them here. Use Google.<br />
<br />
X264 is harder to decode than XviD. If you cannot play the file without experiencing lag, you may need to upgrade your computer. One site recommends at least a 1GHz computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do I have to do to watch X264 episodes?<br />
First, install ffdshow.<br />
We strongly recommend that you do NOT use the default options: Uncheck VFW interface on the first screen of options. Uncheck EVERYTHING except for the [ ] H.264, X264 choice on the second screen of options. Uncheck everything on the third screen of options. Uncheck everything on the fourth screen of options. Uncheck everything on the fifth screen of options. The rest of the installation you can decide options for yourself (it won't affect the playback).<br />
<br />
Next, install Haali's Matroska Splitter.<br />
This will enable you to play MP4 files in most media players (WMP, VLC, MPC have all been tested).<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are you making me install ffdshow?<br />
ffdshow is currently the best implementation of X264 decoding. It has several other very annoying quirks when playing other files, which is why we recommend against the default installation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is there so much lag in the playback?<br />
Chances are your computer simply cannot handle the additional processing load of decoding X264. You can probably get a better computer or upgrade pretty easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I know which version is which?<br />
The X264 version is an MP4 file, and the XviD version is an AVI file. X264 can be placed in an AVI container, but it's easier to distinguish this way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I have to install X264?<br />
For now, we are releasing two versions of the episodes. This is only [i]temporary[\i]. In the near future we will begin releasing X264 exclusively, so you should take appropriate action before then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why did you decide to use X264?<br />
This codec makes it much easier to make high quality encodes. Most people don't know this, but XviD often gives files which are too large because of the way it handles compression. I won't bore you with details, but if we set the target file sise to be 230MB, it may come out to be 240MB, which does not fit on a CD. This means we have to reencode with different compression settings. Using X264 will save us a lot of trouble.<br />
<br />
Is X264 the same as H.264?<br />
Not quite, but mostly. H.264 is a closed source codec produced commercially and not available to the public in general. X264 is the open source, public equivalent, a lot like XviD. ffdshow decodes both X264 and H.264. The current commercial H.264 decoder is extremely slow and would be illegal to distribute.<br />
<br />
For some, this may prove to be a headache. But, so our saviors say, so it shall be. Fortunately, 162 is still availble in XiVD, but you might as well download the mp4 and **** with it until it works now because I doubt K-F will keep releasing it in avi for long.</div></div><hr />

EVERYTHING works with this. EVERYTHING. This is coming from a guy who watches 2000000 versions from 8000000000 groups, and I've never seen codecs better than this.<br />
<br />
Use http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?t=17669 guide to uninstall K-Lite completely. And I advise this of everyone here who watches anime, regardless of whether or not you follow One Piece.</div></div><hr />

The uninstall guide I linked to will reset all your codecs to a &quot;format&quot; state without actually formatting.<br />
<br />
And Darth, that guide took me like, 8 minutes, maximum. Including download time -.-</div></div><hr />

The CCCM codec is widely considered the best codec pack there is. With that and MPC (which is one of the two programs they endorse working fully with CCCM) I can play any file. I gave it a harsh testing and everything worked.</div></div><hr />

These two links show the difference between the two formats. For the equal size. Difference is day and night. Much, much, much better, and maybe my eyes won't shut down for a change when watching this stuff.</div></div><hr />

I'm very, very scared. I think I might've had a hiccup during install tho, so I'm gonna give C3P another go.<br />

edit: unistalled K-lite, installed CCCP, everything seems to be workin' a lot better. Just gotta re-associate my files, and everything will be O.K.</div></div><hr />

Man, about ******* time annoying ball guy got his ass handed down to him. I felt the method was a little dumb, ok I'm going to jump and accidently find a string to beat him. -.-<br />

But man, Sanji's speech made me happy. Stop! It'll hurt! please stop! it'll hurt!<br />

I loved how he explained his move. I'd pee my pants. A good episode!<br />

The Gan Fall vs Ordeals of String was disappointing. I didn't expect Gan Fall to lose, just escape. We'll see how he and Chopper survive this, with the bird and Chopper being dead in water.<br />

Overall, a excellent episode. Even though everyone pretty much sucked for the last few episodes. Here's to hoping it gets better.</div></div><hr />

After a month of no releases from KF my will finally broke down and I went and downloaded all of Gerusama's subs of the Water 7 arc.  And while I felt bad about what I skipped at first, after seeing the new arc, I have no regrets at all about my decision.  It's just sooooo good, I couldn't believe it.  Anyway, if anyone else wants to talk about it, feel free to start up the conversation using spoiler tags.  <br />
<br />
But be sure you WARN THEM AS WATER 7 SPOILERS!  I don't want to spoil anything accidentally for the ones who are staying true and not skipping ahead.  I'm actually wondering if I shouldn't start a new thread.<br />

On the subject, does anyone know a site where I can just go DL tranlated versions of the manga between where KF end and GS begins?  And if so, what chapters is that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, that one wolf was totally trying to get into Nami's pants.  Totally.  Disturbing.  <br />
<br />
Water 7 Episode 247<br />
<br />
Franky?  I think he's funny as hell.  But some people are saying that he, and not Paulie might be the Strawhat carpenter.  And while I like him as a badguy/secondary character, I'd much rather he wasn't part of the crew.  Paulie's much better.  Especially since, unlike Franky, he just pretty much lost all his nakama.  I mean, I don't like Paulies powers too much, but at least he's better than Vivi.  Besides he LOOKS cool.<br />
<br />
I still gotta say the identities of CP9 totally blew my mind.  I mean, I suspected Califa was a spy before because she's behaved funny a couple times, but the other two, I didn't see that coming at all.<br />
<br />
One thing that bothers me about CP9 is they all have the same powers.  I don't like that.  I mean, they all have devils fruits too, but most of their power comes from their 6 disciplines.  And they are just SO overpowers.  So, they all fly, have invulnerability, super speed, slicing kicks, bullet pokes, and DBZ dodging.  At this point, I don't see how the Strawhats can possibly beat them.  Unless CP9 takes the blueprints and then leaves and don't become fightable enemies till a later arc.  That or Robin switches back to the Strawhats and knows some weakness they might have.</div></div><hr />

It's hard to resist. :( By the way, Chapter 388 to 390 were incredible. The last page of 390 is amazing, finally another pose like after Arabasta when they raised their hands to Vivi while showing their backs. Only much cooler.<br />

I can't wait at all.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I thought for sure there was gonna be some arcs between Water 7 and the next time they fought CP9, but now it looks like they are gonna go right to Enies Lobby.  But I don't know how they are gonna do it.  I mean, CP9 just OBLITERATED them.  What they hell are they gonna pull out of their ass between here and Enies Lobby that's gonna make them able to win?</div></div><hr />

Well I mean, Gerusama is at 252, you're at 254, there's no 253 yet. Not the K-F -&gt; gerusama skip.<br />
<br />
It's probably as Nami says. Everyone becomes weak when they hesistate. Looking back to past arcs, this holds true. Not until they have no hesistation in what they do that they start kicking ass.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, there's a LOT to look forward to. I mean, Luffy must have learned something after the Ao Kiji fight, for instance. If he plans to take on the world, he must become at least that strong. If he plans to carry Robin's will, he must become stronger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, I'm in no rush as I'm following the manga. No worries, I'm only posting the thoughts I had when I first read the story, not what I know now.<br />
<br />
Although the anime is about 10-15 episodes away from the manga now. I'm starting to wonder what is going to happen after this arc. Will they reduce the count to once per month or twice as they have done many times lately, or will they end the series altogether?<br />
<br />
Guess we'll find out in about 30 episodes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-29-06, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reduce what count?<br />
<br />
You mean number of episodes per week?  I didn't know any series did that.<br />
<br />
I figure when they are gonna catch up, BAM, filler arc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-29-06, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reduce what count?<br />
<br />
You mean number of episodes per week?  I didn't know any series did that.<br />
<br />
I figure when they are gonna catch up, BAM, filler arc.<br />
<br />
One Piece is pretty much the exception to the one episode per week rule. They have done one a month and two a month many, many times in the past. For better or worse, Japanese companies absolutely do NOT want to stop showing One Piece on TV. They probably feel the time gap with no anime will cause interest/popularity to die out significantly.<br />
<br />
There are really no other shows that do this. Not even Naruto is popular enough to do less than one a week.<br />
<br />
The thing about Filler arcs is that they have never been that long on One Piece, 6-10 episodes or so. After this arc, it's really a choice of a whole year's worth of filler like Naruto is enduring right now, or one/two a month episode airing rate which would allow it to neither catch up nor fall behind the manga.<br />
<br />
That's why I'm interested in how this plays out. At the very least, I VASTLY prefer less episodes than filler. Look at Naruto, it's all but dead right now.<br />
<br />
Eh, just thinking about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-29-06, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  I wish Naruto and One Piece shared a time slot and alternated every week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the train fight is nice , i would say it would take 10-15 episode , then the storming of Enies Lobby another 10-20 episode before the flash back , which i expect to take around 5 episode<br />
<br />
maybe they would insert filler in an arc , like the filler race when fighting foxy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean filler right now, during the arc. I meant after the arc. There's no way to add filler to Water 7 arc, at least not at this point. It's too linear from here to the final fights.<br />
<br />
It's true there is about 30 episodes of material, but that only gives Oda 30 chapters/15 episodes. Knowing Oda, he might give us a short arc like the foxy arc, but that would be it. After that, the arc probably will be just as long as Skypeia and Water 7, which would make the anime catch up to the manga.</div></div><hr />

No way dood, Shanks and Whitebeard are at the end. Blackbeard is just the guy that wanted Luffy's bounty to join the Schichubaki (gross misspelling). He can't be more than two or three hundred million.</div></div><hr />

Be that as it may, they sent Ace ALONE to kill Blackbeard and his crew. As in, 1 vs 5. When I think about it like that, Blackbeard feels significantly less intimidating.</div></div><hr />

Like Ace was only supposed to find Blackbeard, not fight the whole crew himself.  That, or Ace decided to go after Blackbeard on his own, probably because the person Blackbeard killed was his friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  You see, K-F is only subbed up to 178 so far.  Then theres Gerusama and ADC that have subbed from 219-present.  In between there's only really crappy japanese to chinese to english subs that are like read like they were run through Babelfish.<br />
<br />
Basically, a few months ago, K-F went through some problems or something and basically didn't release an episode for over a month.  So I eventually snapped and decided that, since I'd heard such good things about the current arc, I was gonna say, **** it, and skip ahead.<br />
<br />
And they were right, it's awsome, and since the current arc isn't really related to the Skypia arc, its not even spoiling the K-F subs.<br />
<br />
So now, that's where I am at.  I watch the K-F subs as they get released, and I watch ADCs subs every week when a new episode of OP airs.  It's like getting double the OP(triple even lately since K-F has really stepped up their speed).<br />

Life is good.</div></div><hr />

258Yes, the song was fight.  I LOVE how they show the big video that he's got playing in his head, then they show how Sanji and Franky just see him standing there singing to himself.  That's psychology on the level of the Gollum scenes in LotR!  Poor delusional Usopp.</div></div><hr />

Great episode. 3 minutes to go and one of those people is going down! Whose it gonna be!<br />
<br />
Honestly, I hope its one of the Strawhats. There's too many of them left. They make up half the remaining contestants, and that's not counting Luffy.<br />
<br />
Still, four on one against Enel! I can't wait!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, man, Sanji and Usopp are really getting the shaft this arc!<br />
<br />
259<br />
<br />
******* sweet!<br />
<br />
Who knew Sanji was such an awsome slicer and dicer. What's next, Zoro kicking things?<br />
<br />
I kinda like Nero. He'd be a pretty cool badguy without the whiskers.<br />
<br />
I kinda hope they aren't gonna play the Sogeking song everytime he does ANYTHING. It already getting annoying and it's only the third time. It was kinda cool when he was outside Robins window. But it was stupid when they started playing the video again and all he was doing was standing around. I mean, if he had been singing it again then fine, but he wasn't.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad Robin got pwned. She never does anything! And on the rare occasions she does, she whines a lot! So That leaves my favorite two Strawhats, Zoro and Nami. Wiper is a REJECT!!! :lol Figures he had some of that sea stone to get Enel, there's just no way in hell he could even be hit otherwise.<br />
 <br />
And yeah, I didn't like Enel at first, 'cause all he did was nuke people from a distance. Turns out that he is pretty awesome when it comes to melee combat. Zoro-Enel was fun.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and the little attack he used to take out Gan Fall. Pimp. Loved the hole melted into GF's helmet. Wonder if Enel is going to try and hit on Nami.</div></div><hr />

About F**king time Enel got kicked in the gut!<br />
 <br />
Also, Conis was totally awesome with that bazooka.</div></div><hr />

That look on Enel's face after his attacks do nothing to Luffy is one of the greatest things ever...<br />
<br />
261<br />
<br />
That episode just plain ruled.  Three fights all ending in the same episode.  I was a little dissapointed how fast Zoro's fight was, but Sanji smashing that guys face beautiful was great and the Ultimate Hammer rules!</div></div><hr />

He's a moron about everything else.  But fighting, that's his thing man.<br />

Heh, we get to see a lot of Zoro action here. It's a bit cheesier, especially the final dialogue between Luffy and Zoro in the end of the episode, but still pretty cool. Great animation everywhere!<br />

And the baseball special was awesome too, heh. GOMU GOMU NO HOME RUN!</div></div><hr />

...so Enel gets his ass kicked, coughing up blood, and a minute later he's totally OK? The one part of OP that bugs me, and allways has. Characters recover from damage way too fast. I know, I know, it's all fantasy and whatnot, but still. Kinda loses the effect if someone can shrug off pretty much any attack whenever it's convenient.</div></div><hr />

Pimptastic.  Enel is just having the most aggravating day ever.<br />
<br />
This episode was packed with memorable quotes.  Especially Luffy's &quot;I can't jerk off this testicle!&quot; line, but also:<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to me Usopp...if it will save Nami-san, then I don't care if you die.&quot;<br />

Haha, Sanji finally got to do something.<br />

Meh, there seems to be alot of unessecary moving up and down lately in the arc.<br />

But at least most of the good guys are all collected together.<br />

Nice chest-shot of Nami when she pulls Osopp out.<br />

You know, this arc can end at any time. It's just getting slightly old. There needs to be a finale, soon.</div></div><hr />

Looks like everyone on the island is pissed off...AGAIN.  I wonder what it is now?  One of Norland's crew steal something from the bell?<br />
<br />
You know what, Calgara is really just a huge ****.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the bell, that's the creepiest ring ever.</div></div><hr />

Like I said before, this can effing end now. At this point, they've dug themselves into a no-win scenerio so much, that any kinda of twist happy end is going to have to be freakin' epic to not be totally stupid.</div></div><hr />

When Luffy began falling, I was like... not again. Completely ******* owned Enel. Finally! I was bitching a lot about how long it was taking for Enel's ass to get kicked, but the reward is so much the sweeter because of that. Light the fire of shandra!</div></div><hr />
