<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-11-07, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but usally after there is not episode they at least have an announcement saying &quot;BTW, no episode this week due to: insert reason here&quot;<br />
<br />
But yeah, they had a YHBT, then the V2 was also YHBT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too bad it's only 1/3 of the movie that got released as a promo by yahoo. Hope they troll us again with the rest of the movie.<br />
<br />
5cm per second is by the famed Makato Shikai.</div></div><hr />

I like his work, very very nice way to tell a story, though i wish &quot;Voices of a distant Star&quot; was longer than 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found out 5CM per Second that was released is only 1/3 of the feature, a promo released by Yahoo! Japan. Too bad. I hope Dattebayo does the entireity of 5CM per Second when it's released on DVD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked it also, I wasted my time before I realised it on the v2 version.<br />
<br />
Stealth ninja edit: By wasted time I mean wasted time downloading what I thought was Naruto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">03-11-07, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread makes no sense. Someone enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-12-07, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well first I bitched about there being no Naruto this week, instead they released 2 fakes for fun.  Then it ended up with us talking about how good the fake was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-12-07, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The speedsubber of naruto played a prank, since there's no naruto this week. They released a torrent for &quot;Naruto Shippuuden 5CM&quot;. People downloaded it thinking it was Naruto 5. But the group name was (YHBT) which means You Have Been Trolled.<br />
<br />
As a result, there was a lot of angry Naruto fans. However for people like me, it was a even better delight. Instead of Naruto, our troll sub was a episode of 5CM Per Second, Makato Shikai's newest work. It was only 1/3 of the movie, which was released as a promo by Yahoo! Japan. <br />
<br />
That's the gist of it I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-12-07, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main group that subs Naruto, likes to post fake **** on the weeks that Naruto doesn't air because they like watching fanboys' brainstems explode.<br />
<br />
<br />
I loved that one week when they were like &quot;We're dropping Naruto, here's an episode of Pokemon!&quot;</div></div><hr />
