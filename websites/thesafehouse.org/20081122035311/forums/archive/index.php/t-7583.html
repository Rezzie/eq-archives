PS if you have multiple 50+ characters, a regen item would be good, you could bag the regen if you got into too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

The problem is actually knowing how to play a rogue and thats something I dont have a clue about hehe. <br />
<br />
Its funny how one plays for ever and makes a rogue and turns into a noob all over again hehe, oh this will be fun.  <br />

<br />
check it out  here <br />
<br />
as far as how to play a rogue, turn auto attack on, circle stafe to behind the mob, and backstab. Evade when its up, and stay at max melee range so lessen aggro.<br />
<br />
most everything you really need to know, is learnt in game<br />
<br />
-drakin<br />
<br />
PS evade isnt listed as a skill, and i just relized that no where does a GM or note or anything tell you about it in game. If a player didnt goto spoiler sites, how would he even know about the skill?</div></div><hr />

Oh....so thats what ive been doing wrong...  <br />
 I'm just someone you love to hate-Thisle Sprout, giving free ports to bind points since 1999 .Destroyer of The Highland Army  Officer of Merciless Midgets, the one and only true short pk guild of Tallon Zek.                         Centin- You are MY desire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mordier</div><div class="date">06-06-01, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@#%$.  Ignore everyone that's posted so far except Greldek.  The auto-attack/strafe/backstab/evade stuff doesn't work on Vallon.<br />
<br />
First ask yourself this question:  &quot;Do I want to actually learn the rogue class?  Or do I want to just run around owning people?&quot;  If you want to learn, don't twink (beyond banded, maybe an SBD or Obsidian shard).  If you can't resist the temptation then start the rogue on a new server like Tallon so you can't twink.<br />
<br />
You WILL NOT learn how to play the class if you run around at lvl 5 with a trak tooth, regen tunic, and BD jewelry.  And you certainly won't learn how to pvp with a rogue with that stuff on.  With a rogue, it's best to be an underdog.  Personally I still love being the underdog at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Most skills you'll learn on your own, but here are a couple to master:  <br />
<br />
Learn to joust.   There are many variations, learn them.<br />
Learn poison as soon as you can.  This skill is very time-consuming, but it IS the difference between an average rogue and a good one on VZ.<br />
Keep skills maxed (which is hard to do if you're twinked), especially backstab.<br />
You wanna twink yourself?  Buy alot of pumice instead.<br />
