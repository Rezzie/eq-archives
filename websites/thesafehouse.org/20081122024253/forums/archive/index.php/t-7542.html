<br />
I assume DoTs and poisons are calculated at same 66% rate for each damage tick, too...<br />
<br />
What happens with DoT/posion applied onto enemy pet?<br />
<br />
Can we resist necro lifetap spell based on magic resistance?<br />
<br />
Can we remove necro boil blood (300 PvP damage over 2 mins)with cancel magic or regen (like lava duck crawler effect hm)?<br />
<br />
Can we remove necro dooming darkeness (200 PvP damage over 2 mins) by any means except cancel magic? Edited by: Karlek  at: 5/10/01 6:21:26 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure too.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens with DoT/posion applied onto enemy pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dunno, never tried.  The only poisons that I would consider waisting on a pet would be poison summoned, or maybe root.  I'd much rather have any poison go off on a caster himself though  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we resist necro lifetap spell based on magic resistance?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unresistable spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we remove necro boil blood (300 PvP damage over 2 mins)with cancel magic or regen (like lava duck crawler effect hm)?&quot;<br />
<br />
All magic based DoTs (Darkness line, heat blood/blood boil, Stinging Swarm (druid dots), Splurt, etc.  Can and always should be pumiced asap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we remove necro dooming darkeness (200 PvP damage over 2 mins) by any means except cancel magic?&quot; <br />
<br />
Pumice is the only way I know to get rid of it. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

<br />
I can hire the services of lvl 22 iksar necro currently in Overthere to try these battle tactics...  <br />

<br />
Pumice effect (nullify magic) has the chance to remove 2 magic effects with one cast, and is quite efficiant.  Cancel magic sometimes takes multiple casts (depending on the level of the caster) to remove a DoT or effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the regen goes, I'm not sure what you're getting at there. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

<br />
heat blood/blood boil isnt magic based (hmmm fire based maybe?). Cancel magic still works though. Nashak level 60 Gravedigger</div></div><hr />

Or that line of spells, eating away some 800hp in due time.<br />
<br />
I remember we were cancelling it with regen from a druid or shaman, if no previous regen was active on the DoTted char. <br />

That is what they said about them in PvE, so I assume the same applies to PvP (but maybe not). If not the above case, then DoTs I think always do full damage.</div></div><hr />
