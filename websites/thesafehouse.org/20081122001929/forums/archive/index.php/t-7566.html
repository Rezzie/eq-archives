<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-21-01, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of people are critical of the no level PK limit, but consider the possibilities for a moment.<br />
<br />
   In the past, players could not enforce their beliefs on others about honor and order.  Cruel sadistic and twinked level 5s could kill level 1s nonstop at bind points, because no one who wanted to do anything about it would be a twinked level 9 in range of fighting the level 5; the same thing with characters deleveled to a lower level.  If they were a healer, they could provide some protection for as long as they had patience or mana.  <br />
<br />
   Now, they're creating a society where the players will be completely capable of enforcing their codes of conduct.  If some level 20 enjoys killing newbies, someone can kill him.  In fact, if newbie killing is so odious, he might be hunted down again and again and deleveled.  <br />
<br />
   Moreover, the fact that there can only be one character on the server will have the biggest impact.  Who will trade with the newbie killer if this behavior is condemned?  Will the newbie killer band with other newbie killers and become an organized criminal society?  <br />
<br />
  Anyway, I see this as really interesting, a chance to create a society and police it.  Of course it might fail if there is no team unity, but whether it succeeds or fails will be entertaining in itself.  And if one team consistently fails to protect their newbie members while another team does, will they lose members to other teams and strengthen the other teams as well? <br />
<br />
   Hopefully when they hardcode the teams they make the neutrals capable of buffing and being buffed by either evil or good, but keep evil and good hardcoded.  Who knows whether there might be diplomacy between the teams to capture the neutral support?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the thing to remember is that there is no limit to pvp.  Even if a lvl 20 was ganking newbies - a posse of X lvl 15s could take care of the problem.  <br />
<br />
I think it will be interesting to see how it pans out.<br />
<br />
Imagine if you will, a server with no twinks, no level 60s sitting emperiously on high mocking your noobieness.  A vast sea of level 1s - wave after wave of them flocking to the noobie areas.  The only time I ever saw anything like it was one time Vallon and Tallon were brought down for emergency maintenance, and everyone rolled a level 1 on Rallos.  There was mayhem en-mass that night...

<br />
The most significant aspect is the elimenation of of rules that require GM intervention.  If, this means that VI will address abuses of the game mechanics by adjusting the code that allows them, then they have corrected what I have always considered one of their fundamental flaws in both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
I may install the game again in order to test the new server myself. If, you can't be good. at least, be good at it.Majestyk, Rogue,Shanks,Vallon Zek!</div></div><hr />

Of course there'll be twinks if theres no item loot, level 60s cant cause xp loss pks to newbies.  The whole thing is amazingly pointless, I like the whole &quot;if a level 20 is killing newbies you can get someone xp kill him&quot; strategy, yeah, that'll be real effective, you kill him once and cuts link so he doesnt get bind camped.  Or he just runs to a zone and blizzys, and you can't snare/root because there's no item loot and everyone will be in MR gear all the time.  Might as well call it the blizzyserver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">05-23-01, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, Vehn..<br />
<br />
I hate to state the already obvious, but having no loot plays no part in the resist department. On rallos if you are a tank and dont have at least 110 MR you are a walking corpse waiting to happen. That is with item loot. Resists wont save a mage from a warrior, so it is pretty much a one way street.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-26-01, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's only one char per account, so there will be a lot less twinks around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-26-01, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe, maybe not. All that gear has to go somewhere. If not to your twink, then to someone else's, right? Unless people just destroy stuff. Then again, 1 character per account could make a very strong economy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Plep Plop</div><div class="date">05-27-01, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How fair is it to put a level 10 against a level 60? Seriously? That stuff you guys listed would be all great and merry if the game didn't have jerks. The game has jerks. Jerks will be going to the new server. Level 60s will be going through zones throwing AEs down and killing entire groups at a time. People will act like @#%$ just to be @#%$. And their opponents? They can do nothing else but sit there and die.</div></div><hr />

I know this is not always the case, but I do believe that the level 60 mass murderer will not be a common occurance.  We can only speculate as to how it will actually play out and what the rules might end up being.  I don't think anything is for certain yet, except maybe that it will be deity based.  I am certainly up for giving it a try.</div></div><hr />

You havent play on rallos. I played on Rallos for a good 6 months. My first server. If you havent played on rallos then you got no idea what type of dicks people can be in this. You think that ks'er is a @#%$? Back in the day people killed you at level 1 just to have you killed. What are they gonna take. Your guild tunic? This will be alot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_catan</div><div class="date">05-28-01, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh and by the way you can twink just wont be as easy. All you need is a second account but that doesnt matter cuz there wont be twinks for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-28-01, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this is the reason I am organizing the Screams now, not when the server comes. It's my objective to blitzkrieg Norrath, being as fast and as efficient as possible, while arming every member to the teeth! We will be ruthless. This server is about ruthlessness, and we are going to re-define the word. We will kill, main, dismember, own, and utterly destroy anyone not on our team, disregarding levels. Both RP and Powergaming at the same time, a force to be reckoned with ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_catan</div><div class="date">05-28-01, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with this be a team pvp server or like rallos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-28-01, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erm, think of it like this: They are cross-breading the servers and then taking away all the rules.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts on the new PvP are that it will be about jump start leveling, then utter dominance.  Also I have a question, has there ever been PKing on plane raids before.  One guild finding when another guild is raiding a plane and porting in and killing a few then leaving.  That sort of thing go on at all?  Anyhow back to the new server, if  lot of people choose the safe iskar route to level then invade that will be interesting.  I think I gonna try out the server as evil, I would think it will be easier to tell who is on your time that way. Chace Starym Scout of Tunare <br />

<br />
There is serious mass Pking on plane raids.  Circle Noir and Alliance of the Light used to mix it up in the Plane of Hate all the time on Tallon Zek.</div></div><hr />

Another question, when is the new server coming out, has an exact date been scheduled?  Also anyone wanna roll up some characters to see how it goes at the begining, and what I mean by that is a mob of safehousers running amuck. Chace Starym Scout of Tunare <br />
