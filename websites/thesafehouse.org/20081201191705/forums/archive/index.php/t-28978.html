<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maliphus_Iscariot</div><div class="date">03-16-07, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this the other night out of spite for a shadow that decided to corpse camp me. I managed to sneak up on him and hit him w/ the sleep dart. 20 secs later I nailed him w/ Blackjack 2 which mezzed him for another 40 secs. 35 secs later I hit him w/ another sleep dart.  Wash, rinse, repeat for about 10 mins and you get one pissed of Shaman. I did not kill him or camp his corpse. I figured it more justice to stun lock him for 10 mins and sit there and dance w/ him while he shouted obscenities and other angry words for the Rogue class. (Mainly this specific Rogue)<br />

Enjoy. =)<br />

However, due to the new update I do not forsee myself doing this again as it is now too expensive to do.  /cry</div></div><hr />

It's so much fun to sneak up on a team of 2, blackjack one of them then gank the other while the first helplessly watches ;D</div></div><hr />
