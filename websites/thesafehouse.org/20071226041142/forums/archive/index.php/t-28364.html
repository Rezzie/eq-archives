<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-14-07, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While not japanese animation, I figured I'd create a thread just to mention a new animated Hellboy movie that was recently released.<br />
<br />
I bought this animated movie on an impulse because the version I got was a two-pack which came with a comic drawn in the style of the movie, plus the graphic novel 'Seed of Destruction' which is a reproduction of the first Hellboy comic started in 1994.  I think the single pack still comes with the comic, just not the graphic novel.  Here's (http://gotohellboy.com/) the link to Hellboy Animated, though turn down the sound after you view the little teaser before you get into the actual website (the thunder cracks are pretty loud).<br />
<br />
Overall I liked the style (which you can see by browsing the website I linked above), liked the plot, and I liked the fact they used the actors from the live action movie for the animated version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">02-15-07, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saw it on Cartoon Network.  Was pretty good.  Kept my attention, which doesn't happen much with TV these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">06-30-07, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't feel like it was worth it's own thread, so I figured bumping this thread would be good enough for those interested in Hellboy.<br />
<br />
I wasn't going to buy 'Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron' because it was $20 and from what I read wasn't as good as the first animated movie, but I stumbled on BestBuy's limited edition deal and couldn't help but track one down.  For the same $20 you get the DVD and a Hellboy figure that looks very nice (in my opinion it's practically worth $20 on its own).<br />
<br />
Below is a pic of the DVD, figure, and the two extra hands that come with it.  The figure is also fully poseable.  Still don't know whether the movie is any good, but the figurine is very nice.<br />
<br />
Edit: I watched &quot;Blood &amp; Iron&quot; the other day and it's pretty mediocre.  It deals with two timelines, one present day and one from 1939.  The 1939 is in a reverse-chronological order and scattered in between the current timeline, and the current timeline had too much padding in it.  A couple of the characters seemed to be there just to pad the movie by another five to ten minutes.  At a playing time of 75 minutes about 20 minutes is of the 1939 timeline and 55 minutes of the current timeline.  Sword of Storms was much better paced and didn't have as a depressing a colour scheme.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of extras on the disk, however.  There's the option to play the 1939 timeline in chronological order, a (very) short animated story called Iron Shoes, a short comic, a 'making of' featurette, and an audio commentary.  Had I paid $20 for just the DVD I would've felt I didn't get a good value, but if you can still find a Best Buy figure &amp; DVD limited edition it'd still be worth it to pick it up (moreso for the figure than the DVD).</div></div><hr />
