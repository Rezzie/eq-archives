<br />
Do cartoon characters have the famous &quot;right stuff&quot; to be space travellers? We'll soon find out. The fourth space tourist to visit the International Space Station next October will be Char Aznable, ace fighter pilot from cult Japanese anime series Gundam.<br />
<br />
Actually, it will be his human alter ego. Japanese businessman Daisuke Enomoto wants to wear Char's red costume during his eight-day stint aboard the ISS, as well as build a plastic replica of his hero, also known as the &quot;Red Comet&quot;.<br />
<br />
Enomoto, an internet entrepreneur who calls himself Dice-K after the lucrative website he founded, will spend six months next year at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, preparing for his trip, which will last 10 days in all. Space Adventures, the company that is arranging the trip, has no problem with Enomoto's sartorial intentions. &quot;The uniqueness of our programme is that it's open to all private citizens,&quot; a spokeswoman told New Scientist last week. &quot;What he chooses to wear is up to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
But she stressed that Enomoto will have to forgo his Char persona on a couple of occasions. &quot;For launch and re-entry, he'll have to wear the usual, protective Sokol space suit,&quot; she said.<br />

CNN.com - Space tourist fails medical test - Aug 21, 2006 (http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/08/21/space.tourist.ap/index.html)<br />
<br />
MOSCOW (AP) -- A Japanese businessman seeking to become the world's fourth space tourist has failed a medical test and cannot fly to the international space station next month, a Russian space agency official said Monday.<br />
<br />
Daisuke &quot;Dice-K&quot; Enomoto, 34, was to be launched in a Russian Soyuz vehicle from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan with the next space station crew on September 14. However, Roscosmos spokesman Igor Panarin told The Associated Press that Enomoto &quot;was deemed not ready to fly for exclusively medical reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another person will be chosen to fly with U.S. commander Miguel Lopez-Alegria and Russian flight engineer Mikhail Tyurin, Panarin said.<br />
<br />
Enomoto was to have spent a total of 10 days in traveling to and from and being on the space station before returning to Earth with the station's current occupants, Russian commander Pavel Vinogradov and U.S. flight engineer Jeff Williams.<br />
<br />
Previous &quot;space flight participants&quot; to the space station were Dennis Tito, Mark Shuttleworth and Greg Olsen, whose trips brokered by Virginia-based Space Adventures Ltd. were estimated to cost $20 million each.<br />
<br />
Olsen, who was 60 at the time of his flight, also failed a medical test due to unspecified health problems, prompting Russian officials to bump him from a flight.<br />
<br />
He passed another checkup later and officials allowed him to fly last October.<br />
<br />
Would suck if it was a non refundable ticket.  :lol</div></div><hr />
