<br />
While I disagree with the criminalization of vices, where harmless, I can also understand why society might not want to allow such things free reign or approval. Moral decay can bring down a civilization.<br />
<br />
But increased tax revenue and a smaller expenditure than the billions we waste fighting the drug war. Move vice cops to something important. Fewer fatalities from swat-style raids on non-violent offenders, etc.<br />
<br />
I'd also want to keep drugs out of the hands of kids as much as possible (Same regulations on sale as alchohol?), and extremely strict penalties for those that circumvent these restrictions.<br />
<br />
But I also want flat tax rates with no deductions, prolly won't see that ever. =P<br />

I personally do not agree with legistlating morality in regards to 'victimless' crimes, but a huge portion of the US population does beleive in it. <br />

IMO - if someone wants to do meth until their brain is mush, that's their free will. However, having their care then paid by the state, no. They'd need to sign a waiver releasing the state of paying for their care after the fact.</div></div><hr />

What confuses me on this one is that you could use these justifies to decriminalize anything. If there are no crimes, then the crime rate would be 0%. The prisons would be empty.<br />

It doesn't actually count as a benefit of decriminilzation</div></div><hr />

Exactly Addicts robbing for their fix, turf wars, pimp on prostitute violence, ect.<br />
<br />
I've been doing a lot of reading on the subject and over half of all drug offenders in jail are marijuana related.  <br />
<br />
And as far as children, ect, the same laws that are on alchohol would apply, and the same for workplace usage.  Schoolbus drivers can't be drunk, so they would't be allowed to drive high either.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Both trades will need greater regulatory administration as well. They'll also have higher intangibles such as an increased healthcare burden, but that should be built into the tax and licensing structures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for what the drugs are cut with, if the FDA is controlling content that wouldn't be an issue.  Nevada seems to be a good model on how to run prostitution.  Only allow it in regulated, and sanctioned brothels.  I'd even go so far as to say increase the penalty for being and using street prostitutes since a legal alternative is available.  Of course state, and local laws could be enacted to restrict where, and who could be and use prostitutes above and beyond the federal regulations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brelkor</div><div class="date">04-04-07, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am as much of a libertarian as the next guy, and believe we should be free to eff our selves up.  However, most of the illegal drugs today are really bad things.<br />
<br />
Drugs that royally put you on another plane of existence, like meth, heroine, crack, LSD, destroy people over a period of time (some faster than others).  They destroy your health.  They destroy your ability to function as a member of society.<br />
<br />
People who become dependent on a lot of these drugs lose the ability to provide for themselves.  If the government would oversee the sales of them, and tax them, that means theres a price and these people would have to meet it.  Remember these people are mentally and physically addicted to this stuff.  They will do anything to get it.  Suddenly the government is the drug dealer that people are busting up liquor stores to pay, instead of Big Dawg James on the corner of MLK and 139th.<br />
<br />
But hey, our government cares right?  We would have to treat these people.  Build clinics to house them and try to ween them off the drugs with lower doses and substitutes.  But, what they are doing to themselves they are free to do, and will surely re-do.  We end up in a circle of dependency that is little better than what we have now, except the government is prospering instead of the drug cartel.  <br />
<br />
What if the % of people that use these drugs grows to a number that it effects our ability to produce?  Our economy could possibly falter if the numbers become severe enough.   Who wants to go flip burgers when you could just develop a dependency on drugs and be stoned all the time, with the government taking care of you.<br />
<br />
Keep the really bad stuff illegal.  Legalize pot and maybe some other minor stuff.  And treat the people who use the bad stuff instead of instantly making them unrecoverable criminals due to a overzealous law code.<br />
<br />
Now prostitution?  Should be legal.  Its the religions that really hate it.  All the safety and health concerns can be dealt with.</div></div><hr />

Possession of small amounts of drugs should be decriminalized (meaning at worst you'll get a fine, similar to a speeding ticket).  Possession for the purpose of trafficking should have prison time.</div></div><hr />

decriminalization is a nice token benefit to offer to a shortsighted public, but honestly there are very few benefits to it in terms of the societal problems surrounding drugs.  legalisation, regulation and taxation (sin tax) gets rid of a slew of drug related societal problems.<br />
<br />
If you're not doing anything illegal to get your meth (i.e. it's legal and for sale), making the jump to doing things that are illegal to get your meth is a much bigger jump.  <br />

I agree that legalizing crack, meth, pcp, and opiates for the most part would be a less than optimum idea.  I don't have the tiniest problem with marijuana, shrooms, and LSD being legal.<br />
<br />
I also don't think there would be a huge increase in usage or addiction.  After all employers would still most likely keep their current drug policies.  Just because it's legal doesn't mean my employer would be happy with me for showing up to work high.</div></div><hr />

if its just decriminalized, all of the illegal infrastructure of getting decriminalized personal use drug in personal use amounts to the end user will still be in place.<br />
<br />

<br />
well is your employer happy with you showing up to work drunk?  What about hungover?  Can you get canned for being hungover?  I guess what I'm saying is, drug testing policies are based on what they can test for and what is in your system at the time of the test, not your state of being (i.e. being high or drunk or strung out or whatnot) at the time of the test.  I've never heard of an employer saying, hey you look high, random drug test today right now, report to the nurse.  I'm sure it happens in places, but I'd think that's pretty rare.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slathe</div><div class="date">04-04-07, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was actually a really funny article in this forum about three years ago that dealt with the problems of taxing for the prostitution industry.<br />
<br />
It was based on a German policy that allowed taxation of brothels.<br />
<br />
Apparently since brothels were considered a legitimate business and were being taxed, they also demanded that the unemployment office provide them the same services as any other taxpaying business.  I think that essentially amounted to people being told &quot;there is a job available at this brothel and you must go there to work&quot;, putting (particularly females) in the position of either being forced to work in the sex trade or giving up their benefits (for refusing to take a job that they could work in).<br />
<br />
There's a non-realistic argument in the article (because the problem could easily be fixed with legislation / regulation), but I think there's also an underlying theme that hints at the difference between the sex trade and other jobs, and might make the basis for a good argument if someone were inclined to expand upon it.  I love bringing up the article when people want to argue about the subject though, it usually just leaves them standing there mouth open with nothing to say.<br />

<br />
If they are single and don't have kids, that's one thing. But once you have kids, your world changes. Your purpose in life *should* be to protect and nurture those children. But drugs changes that equation.<br />
<br />
I completely disagree with making drugs legal. I think it's a horrible idea. Every day I see a meth lab being busted, and some poor kid gets put into foster care. Her whole world is turned upside down by her &quot;parents.&quot; I was the child of drug users. My parents smoked weed and drank nearly every day, certainly at least once a week.<br />
<br />
I also think legalized prostitution is a bad idea. It furthers the objectification of women. While it provides a choice for employment when you have nothing else you can do (much like the military for many men), prostitution tends to be a choice of women who have been sexually abused in the past. I don't want little girls thinking prostitution is something normal, or a valid life choice for them.<br />
<br />
It would turn sex into a horrible experience. How could someone have a close, loving relationship with anyone after a job like that?<br />
<br />
I think legalized prostitution would also increase the divorce rate. Those men out there who are desiring variety in their lives, yet too chicken to have an affair or hire a prostitute (or, god forbid, ask their wife) would now be able to do something about it.</div></div><hr />

But I just can't see how it makes sense to continue a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; and a losing battle on prostitution when you could at least control the system and clean it up.  <br />
<br />
  Lets try and keep this logical and even keeled and shoot less from the hip and more from the brain.  I wan't to be convinced I am wrong.<br />
I think you've already hit on the most important stuff.  I'd have to research it to get the exact figures, but around 75% of the resources we put into law enforcement go towards enforcing vice laws (drugs, prostitution, gambling).  Half our prison population are participants of the drug trade.  A significant amount of violent crimes in this country are related to the underground vice trades.<br />
<br />
Again, as you point out, going from complete illegality to a &quot;anything goes&quot; type system isn't the best way to proceed.  The best system is one in which these currently illegal industries must follow the same kinds of rules as similar legal industries.  <br />
<br />
So what exactly would the benefits of such a system be?<br />
<br />
The most obvious benefit - and the one that is probably going to be most persuasive to politicians - is the potential increase of tax revenue.  Alcohol and tobacco taxes are a significant source of revenue for the states.  Drug and prostitution taxes could be also.  <br />
<br />
Another obvious benefit would be a decrease of prison populations and crime rates.  We put more of our population behind bars on a per capita basis than any other country in the world.  Most of them are convicted of drug-related crimes.  Around 25% are there solely because they violated drug laws.  If we remove the criminality of drugs, we remove a big chunk of the prison population.  And if the drug trade becomes a legitimate business, you'll see violent gang activity, money laundering and other, peripheral crimes reduced.<br />
<br />
Yet another benefit would be the ability to concentrate our law enforcement resources on violent crimes.  We could afford to focus more on solving murders and rapes.  We could improve the quality of forensics departments.  And we could improve the quality and training of our police officers.  <br />
<br />
Tax revenues collected from drugs and prostitution could be used for treatment of drug problems.  In the US today, there really aren't many options for people when it comes to drug treatment, especially for lower-income addicts.  If the industry funded its own treatment centers, that could help reduce the social costs of drug use.<br />
<br />
A less obvious result of legalizing drugs would be a reduction in the use of the more dangerous drugs.  Drugs like methamphetamine and crack are popular because they are easily and cheaply manufactured.  If the artificially high costs (both monetary and risk) on drugs like marijuana were reduced, the demand for the more addictive and dangerous drugs would go down.  <br />
<br />
I know I've kind of glossed over prostitution, but I don't have a lot to add to that subject.  I'll just note that if you ask a prostitute that works in a legal brothel in someplace like Las Vegas, you'll get a much different story about prostitution than you would if you asked one working for a pimp on the streets of Camden.</div></div><hr />

um, no thanks. CDC is for public health concerns like outbreaks and tracking epidemics.  They could barely contain E coli outbreak with spinach! lol. They can't check out sex workers for AID and STDs. I would really not prefer all those 'samples' being sent to be tested here at Perimeter. ATL is already a target for terrorism due to CDC. Next, we'd end up with the religious zealots/pyschos here because of the testing. <br />

Have the state take care of it. Whatever system Las Vegas has in place should work fine, just do it on a state level. I've never seen the feds do anything better than a state, unless it's taxing you. <br />

You say if drugs were legalized &quot;wont someone please think of the children?!?!&quot; - But whats the difference between smoking legalized marijuana and drinking legal alcohol? There is none (although I tend to believe alcohol is more detrimental). You can be against the legalization of drugs all you want - but saying that if they are legalized that parents will be ****** up all the time on drugs isn't an argument for it.<br />
<br />
I agree that bad parents will forever be bad parents. Look at mine. MJ wasn't legal when I grew up yet they smoked it all the time.<br />
<br />
I don't care if someone gets stoned out of their mind on their own time. But I firmly believe that someone else's liberties end the moment his fist meets my face. I.E. Once someone else's actions affect someone other than themselves, it is no longer a right.<br />
<br />
Drunk parents, etc, fall under that category. If someone drives while stoned that affects others also.<br />
<br />
Alcohol and MJ are different drugs. People who smoke MJ compulsively lack motivation, they eat all the time and get fat, and they have to deal with drug dealers to get their fix (which would be remedied if MJ were legal). Remember, I saw this first hand throughout my entire childhood. You can't tell me none of this is true.<br />
<br />
I would be against legalization for pot because of the motivation factor. There are enough people on our welfare system sitting on their butts doing nothing. We don't need a government to enable them to sit on their ass.<br />
<br />
Anyone who reads my posts knows I am not a &quot;for the children&quot; Nazi. However, I despised growing up the way I did. I think if drugs were legal, the problems would grow, and more people would be affected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes they are different drugs.  people who drink alcohol compulsively become physically addicted to it, to the point of being unable to function without drinking.  I've been with functional alcoholics, and if you think the 'has 4-5 beers every night' is the average alcoholic person, you haven't met the wake up and needs to drink a 12oz glass of wine before breakfast, before driving to work person.<br />
<br />
That sort of motivation is soooooooo much better than a pot smokers lack.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but while I agree they are different drugs, I disagree as to which one is worse with every fiber in my body.<br />
<br />
Oh and MJ smokers can grow their own btw.  It's a weed, its not like its hard to grow enough for personal use.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Actually I would dispute all of your enormously generic stereotypes of pot smokers.  Just because your parents sucked, doesn't mean that everyone is that way.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of pot smoking hikers.  I know a lot of pot smoking athletes.  I know a lot of pot smoking junior executives who are working their way up.  I rarely smoke pot anymore, and I'm talking about compulsive smokers, not the occasionals here.  I know very few compulsive pot smokers who are fat, and most of them I suspect were overweight from other issues before they started smoking.<br />
<br />
So again, while you had a bad experience, and I'm not saying that no one could have a similar one, that is not the be-all end-all of facts about drug users.  <br />
<br />
I win alot at Claw machines.  So I don't think they're a waste of 25cents.  Someone else might never win at Claw machines and so they hate them and think they're a waste and should be destroyed.  Who's correct?  Who's opinion effects the other person...  <br />

That's why I hate this Democracy crap being preached and taught in our schools. We're a ****ing Republic, yet everyone thinks their vote/opinion/brainfart matters, when it really doesn't. We are controlled by a rule of law ( thank goodness!) Just as the ruling elite that are controlled by campaign contributions. While not a great system, it is better than anything else out there. <br />

I heartily disagree with that. A person should have passion of their beliefs. Yes, they need to listen to opposition, but that doesn't mean bowing down to it or eventually complying to it as some portions of our culture think. <br />
<br />
Why did drunk driving laws change? MADD. Talk about not objective! They had a cause and within years had the laws changed. The problem here is that victimless crimes (drugs, prostitution, etc.) means no one cares about it and making it legal to a great extent. Libertarian party supports this cause for years to legallize MJ and it just hasn't changed the way it's perceived. Getting high is not a great grassroots movement. Honestly, I think it lost it peak time - the 60 &amp; 70s were when it would stood a chance to have been   legalized. Now, ex-hippies are CEOs and retirees. They don't care.</div></div><hr />

Kinare, I am sorry you grew up with horrible parents. Please don't blanket all cannabis smokers because of it. <br />
<br />
As far as smoking goes... I know of ALOT of weightlifters that smoke before, rarely during (have known a few) and after. Unlike beer or any alcohol there are no calories in it. Some of my crafting friends use it while making incredible glass art ( Yes art, not just pipes thank you), sculpting, metal work etc. <br />
Music, paintings, art, concepts of every shape and imagination have come to light under its use. I used to use it before I went running, its amazing how much farther you can run after a couple puffs. I seriously laugh everytime I hear the atypical potsmoker reference. I think that is more the Lazy American Attitude and not the pot that makes couch potatoes, oh btw how many couch potatoes do you know that don't use any drugs at all. I have known quite a few and it has nothing to do with drugs or beer.<br />
<br />
Let me lay it down like this. If you arrested everyone who used marijuana, the USA would have a very hard time with keeping a lot of industries afloat.<br />

Very good point, Bub.<br />
<br />
I definitely feel for you, Kinare - but I think your perceptions of ratios of users to abusers have been colored a bit by the way drugs are presented in the mainstream and also by your parents.

They should be illegal but should be made available by licensed practitioners (see:shamans) once per year to those who wish to undertake a guided spiritual experience, and never given outside of the practitioners watch.<br />
<br />
    Salvia divinorum (legal), Ibogaine (illegal) and many other naturally occurring psychedelics are actually used to purge the body of both physical AND mental opiate addiction in there native countries, and the practice is virtually unheard of in north america sadly.<br />
<br />
   Having participated in both in this context, I can most assuredly say these are nothing but a benefit to mankind in the right time and place with the right people. With a free for all, its only a matter of time before tragedy strikes, there has already been a case of a reported suicide one month after someone underage taking Salvia. I think a big problem is most people underestimate the fact that these psychedelics aren't just &quot;feel good&quot; party drugs, they provide no euphoria and only seek to put you in another dimension of your mind and let you come to face to face with your deepest thoughts, good or bad. <br />
<br />
 Because all of these experiences exist beyond normal perception, its simply you can't imagine how powerful it is until you've been there, its important to just not go overboard and remember its just an experience, not to read into it to much, and take it under supervised advision with someone available you can talk to openly about your experience and discuss it.<br />
<br />
 All of these substances should remain illegal for 'street' use, simply because the perception changes are permanent, and while my experience have all been positive, a negative experience would most like cause irrevocable damage on anyone not prepared for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkefang</div><div class="date">04-09-07, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's Arianna Huffington's take on the subject:<br />
<br />
The Other War: Democratic Candidates are Deafeningly Silent on the Drug War (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-other-war-democratic_b_44063.html)<br />
<br />
There is a major disconnect in the 2008 Democratic race for the White House.<br />
<br />
While all the top candidates are vying for the black and Latino vote, they are completely ignoring one of the most pressing issues affecting those constituencies: the failed War on Drugs, a war that has morphed into a war on people of color.<br />
<br />
Consider this: according to a 2006 ACLU report, African Americans make up 15 percent of drug users, but account for 37 percent of those arrested on drug charges, 59 percent of those convicted, and 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison. Or consider this: America has 260,000 people in state prisons on nonviolent drug charges; 183,200 (more than 70 percent) are black or Latino.<br />
<br />
Such facts and figures have been bandied about for years. But what to do about the legion of nonviolent -- predominantly minority -- drug offenders has long been an electrified third-rail in American politics, a subject to be avoided at all costs by our political leaders, who fear being incinerated on contact for being soft on crime.<br />
<br />
You might have thought this would change during a spirited Democratic presidential campaign. But a quick search of the top Democratic hopefuls' websites reveals that not one of them -- not Hillary Clinton, not Barack Obama, not John Edwards, not Joe Biden, not Chris Dodd, not Bill Richardson -- even mentions the drug war, let alone offers any solutions.<br />
<br />
The silence coming from Clinton and Obama is particularly deafening.<br />
<br />
Obama has written eloquently about his own struggle with drugs, but has not addressed the tragic effect the war on drugs is having on African American communities.<br />
<br />
As for Clinton, she flew into Selma to reinforce her image as the wife of &quot;the first black president,&quot; and has made much of her plan to attract female voters, but has ignored the suffering of poor, black women right in her own backyard.<br />
<br />
Located down the road from her Chappaqua home are two prisons housing female inmates, Taconic and Bedford. Forty-eight percent of the women in Taconic are there for nonviolent drug offenses; 78% of those in the prison are African-American or Hispanic. And Bedford, the state's only maximum security prison for women, is home to some of the worst victims of New York's draconian Rockefeller drug laws -- mothers and grandmothers whose first brush with the law resulted in their being locked away for 15 years or more on nonviolent drug charges.<br />
<br />
Yet even though these prisons are so nearby, Clinton has turned a blind eye to the plight of the women locked away there, notably refusing to speak out on their behalf.<br />
<br />
Our political leaders' avoidance of this issue comes with a very stiff price (and not just the more than $50 billion a year we're spending on the failed drug war). The toll is paid in shattered families, devastated inner cities, and wasted lives (with no apologies for using that term).<br />
<br />
During the ten years I've been writing about the injustice of the drug war, I've repeatedly seen politicians pay lip service to doing something about it, then duck and watch as the sickening status quo claimed more victims. Here in California, of the 171,000 inmates jamming our wildly overcrowded prisons, 36,000 are nonviolent drug offenders.<br />
<br />
I remember in 1999 asking Dan Bartlett, then the campaign spokesman for candidate George Bush, about Bush's position on the outrageous disparity between the sentences meted out for possession of crack and those given for possession of powder cocaine - a disparity that has helped fill America's prisons with black low-level drug users. Federal sentencing guidelines dictate that judges impose the same five-year prison sentence for possession of five grams of crack or 500 grams of powder cocaine.<br />
<br />
&quot;The different sentencing for crack cocaine and powder cocaine is something that there's no doubt needs to be addressed,&quot; Bartlett told me. But in the more than six years since Bush and Bartlett moved into the White House, the problem has gone unaddressed. No doubt about it.<br />
<br />
Maybe the president will suddenly wake up and decide to take on the issue five days before he leaves office. That's what Bill Clinton did, writing a 2001 New York Times op-ed in which he trumpeted the need to &quot;immediately reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences&quot; -- conveniently putting aside the fact that he had the power to solve it for eight years and did nothing.<br />
<br />
When it mattered, he maintained an imperial silence. Then, when it didn't, he became Captain Courageous. And he lamented the failures of our drug policy, acting as though he had been an innocent bystander rather than the chief executive presiding over these failures (indeed, the prison population doubled on his watch).<br />
<br />
As a result of our political leaders' neglect, the disparity has continued to wreak havoc on the black community. Even though the majority of crack users are white or Hispanic, 80% of sentenced crack defendants are black. The injustice is so egregious that a conservative Republican senator, Jeff Sessions, is now leading the charge in Congress to ease crack sentences.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that as a matter of law enforcement and good public policy crack cocaine sentences are too heavy and can't be justified,&quot; says Sessions. &quot;People don't want us to be soft on crime, but I think we ought to make the law more rational.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a talking point Hillary and Obama should adopt. It's both the right thing and the smart thing. Because of disenfranchisement statues, large numbers of black men who were convicted of drug crimes are ineligible to vote, even those who have fully paid their debt to society. A 2000 study found that 1.4 million African American men -- 13 percent of the total black male population -- were unable to vote in the 2000 election because of state laws barring felons access to the polls. In Florida, one in three black men is permanently disqualified from voting. Think that might have made a difference in the 2000 race? Our short-sighted drug laws have become the 21st Century manifestation of Jim Crow.<br />
<br />
Shouldn't this be an issue Democratic presidential candidates deem worthy of their attention?</div></div><hr />

   That would actually be your pharmacist.<br />
<br />
I was referring more to the idea of a sitter, since these are usually best taken in nature and not in ones home. Obviously sober for the duration of the events and  always to keep care of mental states of people involved. Its not exactly like  Viagra where you can sell them and expect everything to work out and John smith to go hammer one home for the mistress. Much, much, much much more care I hope would be taken in making sure those allowed to participate are healthy, stable and not going to go bonkers.<br />

  Although most of what he says is interpeted and not actual fact, as everyones experience is different, it gives a good idea of the intensity of such an experience:<br />

For one you start off with liscensed shamans (could you please reread that again and again). We have enough problems with big religions thinking they are the only real and true one without making it a liscensing problem. Before the Spanish came and raped the lands who liscensed the shamans, wizards and other ethenogenic heros?? No one of course, they just were and always have been (as far as collective thought goes back)<br />
<br />
Also where did you get the once a year some guy gets to tell me what, where and when I can celebrate my religion? Well if that guy is you F**K OFF don't do me any favors. I get to celebrate ONCE A YEAR who the hell do you think you are?<br />
<br />
There was a reason our Founding Fathers set things down! SO THEY WOULDN'T BE CHANGED!!!! That includes my right to choose and practice my own religion. If my said religion uses a supposedly illegal plant, mushroom or animal for sacrament then the Government has no business meddling. That is if the religion is not physically hurting other people, forcing people to do things, or using the religious status to skirt drug laws just so that a few people can make a huge drug profit, yes even I find that religions should have some limits placed on them. An outright ban on drugs in religion is not the answer either. Like anything in life it just needs moderation.....<br />

I was simply looking for a 'mild' introduction to the whole idea of spiritual sacraments in a controlled environment, and I definetly appreciate the feedback. The Native American church in Canada has a similar legislation in place currently, and I believe it extends to the united states as well. Priests are given the legal authority to grow and administer the peyote cactus in religious ceremony. <br />

    The one year idea is more of a buffer, since I would hope sincerely that any priest of the native american church with access to peyote would be wise enough not to abuse his right, I simply could not see the same coming from any new formed religion which actually encourages substance use, simply due to those who would flock to it for the cheap thrills. A once a year deterrent is a little too much dedication for captain mcstoneystoned when he can go to any bar and usually be hooked up within the hour. I think its safe to say at this point the current drug issues will never go away, but it would be nice to preserve the sacredness(if such a thing even exists today) of some very misunderstood and abused plants which can be precursors in spiritual experiences and cognitive enchancement, even if only shared by a few individuals without fear of prosecution.</div></div><hr />

 I definetly hold the same opinion true for myself, my concern is that those who would benefit the most from such a thing are most likely too fearful of the condemnation of there peers due to the current social stance and the fact these are lumped in which amphentamines and many other more destructive drugs as far as the law is concered, thats where it breaks down, for freethinkers its a non issue, but those trying to maintain a standard bob n' jane lifestyle it simply does not fit, when it could cause miles of help and virtually abolish the anti-depressant industry.</div></div><hr />
