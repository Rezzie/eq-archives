<br />
but... if I ever wanted to see a unique pet for a race it would have the be a smaller Ashenbone Drake model and would look awesome running around with a dark elf...</div></div><hr />

If the gnomes can have clockwork spiders, then I see no reason why the Erudites can't have golems.<br />
Think about it.  The Erudites are a group given to little interaction with mother nature (and who can blame them with Toxulia next door), but very skilled in magic.  Instead of summoning an animal friend, they'd magically enchant one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xyneur</div><div class="date">12-05-03, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I put a little thought into this.  I think most of us were thinking too much inside the box (ie all creatures that already exist in the game), but I dont recall seeing the Tiger Model or the Dino model prior to the addition of BLs.  So some of my suggestions do include some opptions that don't yet exist (this is a &quot;what if&quot; thread after all).<br />
<br />
First the ones in game:<br />
Barb = Wolf<br />
Vah Shir = Tiger<br />
Ogre = Bear<br />
Iksar = Dinosaur<br />
Troll = Gator<br />
<br />
Now the new races:<br />
Dark Elf = Spider (but it changes the color and markings as it gains level)<br />
High Elf = Unicorn (Too wild to ride, but a great companion, and is a rogue class (stabby horn) at higher level)<br />
Wood Elf = Bird of Prey (ie halk, eagle) after all they live in trees and imagine pathing of having a walking pet follow you with out falling.<br />
Half Elf = Griffon (Half breed pet for half breeds, and since they can start in Kelithin, they would need a flying pet as well)<br />
Froglok = Salamandar (Iksars get a lizard like pet, Frogloks get amphibian pet)<br />
Halfling = Firebeetle (some one mentioned Ember, and the Giant Firebeetles would be cool at high levels)<br />
Human = Snake (not a lot of options left for them, but a huge rattle Snake with menacing rattle sound would be cool)<br />
Gnome = Clock Work Warder (Tinkerers - nuff said)<br />
Dwarf = Bat (plenty of bats in BB, and bats are cave dwellers and so are drwaves)<br />
Erudite = Will-o-Wisp (Erudites are powerful in magic, and should have magical pet from the start, and they are night blind and have a crappy newbie zone, so the pet could act as a light source to compensate.) Zyndor Fyrmane<br />

<br />
i remember when luclin came out, i was reading the character info for beastlords, it mentioned that the pets generally were creatures taken from the newbie zone of the BL's home town. vah shir, i guess, would be the exception, altho they use tigers to guard their palace /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">12-10-03, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are tigers all over Kerra Isle and always have been.  There's a couple others scattered around in places like the Ak'anon zoo, long before Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ZynthHesperax</div><div class="date">12-10-03, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">come to think of it, the tiger model is probably just a puma/cougar model with a different texture and some added bits.</div></div><hr />
