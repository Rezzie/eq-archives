<br />
That's true now, but may not be the case when PoP comes out.  Not sure if it's going to apply to class skills like Make Poison, but there will be &quot;superior&quot; versions of tradeskills (smithing, tailoring, etc) that effectively takes you over the 250 cap.  So, I wouldn't discount it completely for future use.</div></div><hr />

Tinkered geerlok stuff seems to go around 150-300pp (give or take) but I would think this would be more since it's not as common.<br />

Anyone bought/sold one?  Or just got an opinion?<br />

At least that will give me a starting point.  Saw one for sale in /auction over the weekend (first one I've seen for sale), but the seller had no idea what to ask.

<br />
Stick a lower +% backstab item in mainhand, and a higher in offhand, and it will use the lower +%.  Stick a lower in mainhand and a higher in ranged, and it will use the higher.<br />
<br />
So it actually checks Ranged =&gt; Primary =&gt; Secondary and takes the first it comes to.  Not sure how it checks with other slots. Edited by: MarronD  at: 9/30/02 9:25:52 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it possible that it has to do with the order that you *place* the items regardless of slot?  So if you placed the highest+ first it would get overwritten by whatever came last when calculating pluses?</div></div><hr />

I tried it out last night, equiped Khal in offhand then Trident in mainhand, and you're assumption is correct.  It takes the first mod that is placed onto your character.<br />
<br />
Time to swap in the Primal and use Trident/Khal full time heh.<br />
<br />
Thanks for giving that suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't work this easily now, darnit.  Went there yesterday with hopes of grabbing a rotting one (I'm only 30).  Met a Monk (with Rogue alt already positioned in-zone) who said she had been trying to get one for two weeks now.  Also said it dropped from NPC named Zed, not his named npc wife in the same area.<br />
