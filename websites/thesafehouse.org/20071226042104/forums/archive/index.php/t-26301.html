I don't know if I can explain it any other way!<br />
<br />
The twins are some ****** up ****, yo. Episode 1 (For some reason, websites are calling it 13? It's correct, but it should be 1...) Spoilers<br />
<br />
They ******* nailed that guy's face. The way they were almost orgasmatic doing that was ****** up. Incest galore, too. Revy's up against some ****** up children this time. Not as if the Maid from Hell wasn't bad enough. I can't see this not ending in the blood of the twins, that would also be ****** up, having twin dead children shot the **** up or more likely, blown up.<br />
<br />
God, this **** is awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-06-06, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is licensed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">10-10-06, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bloody Buggers, then whos SELLING it,  I havent seen past episode 2 and I got hooked on it.<br />
<br />
Then someone went a licensed it but isnt selling.  Bastages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-10-06, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it does take time for it to show up for sale in between Licensing and release :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-15-06, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode 14 (2)<br />

Man, those twins have a ****** up origin. Child porn videos where they killed others for entertainment. That's just ******* sick. I found it amusing how they faced off with Revy and Nun. Wonder how they are going to get out of this! If the Triad guy didn't get them, it's unlikely that Revy and Nun will. <br />
<br />
So it comes down to Scarface to get them. Well, blood will fall!</div></div><hr />

I'm SO glad I watched Black Lagoon 15 late at night, so I could go to bed right after that. It was such a sad turn of events that I would have felt depressed all night had I seen it earlier. I felt bad for the twins, but there really was no other way.</div></div><hr />

Mmm, so many nasty looking characters were introduced this episode.  It feels like the rest of the season is gonna be gunfights with these people now.  No complaints!</div></div><hr />
