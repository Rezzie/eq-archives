<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vestas</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any conclusive results.  I swear my backstab does more damage then my ambush.  If that's the case then Ambush is essentially worthless as a first strike from stealth ability.  I'd rather just sneak up and backstab.<br />
<br />
Ambush seems to be about on par with Sneak attack.  Then again I have no logs to prove it just dissapointment in the 30-45 dmg I do with ambush (at level 17) vs. the 45-55 I tend to do with backstab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rooksarii</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was under the assumption that ambush was a stronger skill. Maybe the issue is that ambush has a higher ceiling for damage, but also a lower floor?<br />
These numbers are just for comparison's sake, but say the skills damage output is as follows:<br />
<br />
Ambush: 10 - 60 damage median damage of 33<br />
Backstab: 30-45 damage median damage of 38<br />
<br />
You could easily say that backstab will on average hit for more simply due to it's smaller range, and maybe that is the case here. It is not monumentally different, but it goes to show the relation of potential and average damage between the two moves MAY be the reason for your findings.<br />
<br />
I cannot speak for certain, but both are useful attacks. Remember you can (even as a rogue and not a predator) hit sneak, turn off auto attack right befor sneak completes and then hit ambush to pull the skill off during active (even solo) combat. Backstab is dependant on a position behind the target, and solo would require a cheap shot and auto attack off to work.<br />

<br />
<br />
Very strange.  <br />
<br />
Maybe Ambush was too powerful and got tweaked down.  <br />
<br />
With the time it takes to go into stealth mode, I can't say that hiding and then ambushing during combat seems like much of a tactic anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Backstab also has a long reuse time, so it is better to use ambush to start out a fight.  Saving backstab for combat is important because it can be used in a heroic opportunity chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waylander</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is backstab known by a different name?  I don't think I have it (level 12 Predator) or am I too low to have it yet?  I do have Shadow Blade (I think that is the name for it).  Is that it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Preds get Back shot or something at 10 instead of backstab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Preds get 'Shadow Blade', which is a positional stealth based attack.  Backstab is probably better early on, or at least until predators get the 'stalk' ability and can more quickly and easily stealth during combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mideon</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you do is start the fight with ambush since you're not likely to stealth again during the fight.  Then you use backstab throughout the fight, if you get a chance to use it more than once anyway.<br />
<br />
Solo you start with ambush, then cheap shot em and use backstab.  Chuck the rest of your attack skills on and that mob's long dead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bayler</div><div class="date">11-29-04, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it's worth, as a 22 ranger I still use Ambush all the time, despite the fact that it's grey.  I do a ton more damage per hit with Shadowblade (requires stealth and postion, long reuse delay), but Ambush refreshes faster.<br />
<br />
A typical fight group fight for me, assuming no heroic oportunities, starts like this:<br />
<br />
Hunter's Instinct (agi buff)<br />
Hunt (stealth)<br />
target the tank<br />
Ambush (stealthed attack for 75ish)<br />
Bleed (damage over time)<br />
Impale (80ish DD + reduces target's piercing defence for a short while)<br />
Shrouded Strike + autoattack-off (positional attack for 90ish puts you in stealth)<br />
Shadowblade (Positional stealthed attack for 250ish)<br />
Sneak Attack (positional attack for 60ish)<br />
Back Shot (positional ranged attack for 200ish)<br />
Wounding Arrow (hits for about 30 and lowers targets defences)<br />
Shrouded Strike + autoattack-off again<br />
Ambush again<br />
<br />
For soloing, Cheap Shot + autoattack-off + Stalk + Ambush is a lot easier than with Shadowblade.  But I usually focus on HOs instead.</div></div><hr />

I just use the ~ button since that's the default attack button.  I stealth (ALT 1), hit ambush (ALT 2), hit cheap shot (3), ~, then backstab (2).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between Ambush and Sneak Attack/Backstab/Shadow Blade is that it's not a positional attack. Thus, it's only really worth using from the front, or while waiting for other abilities to pop. As an Assassin, it becomes fairly useful every once in a while while killing agro: Evade, Stalk (also reduces agro), Ambush. It's fairly low agro, so Evade and Stalk more than cancel it out.<br />
It becomes a bit more useful with Shrouded Strike because of its low refresh time, between Shadow Blade and Cut Throat timers. It's never exactly won a fight for me, but it comes in handy in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped...<br />
