I use paralyze I in PvP all the time (just because I had a ton of components in the bank and its cheap), but it doesn't land 90% of the time on people my same level.  Anyone have better luck with any other higher tier poisons or what?  FYI people on PvP servers generally walk around with about ~100 PR. &amp;lt;font face=script size=6 color=red&gt;&amp;lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;u&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85164&quot;&gt;~Ceescrit Bossalini&amp;lt;/font&gt;&amp;lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;/u&gt;&amp;lt;BR&gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;<br />
