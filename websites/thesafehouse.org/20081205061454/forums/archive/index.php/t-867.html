<br />
Quote:A US woman has been charged with forgery after trying to use a fake $1 million bill at a supermarket. <br />
Alice Pike, 35, pulled out the note at a Georgia Wal-Mart store to pay for $1,672 worth of goods and asked for change, police said. <br />
<br />
The cashier immediately noticed the bill - bearing the picture of the Statue of Liberty - was fake and called her manager who alerted the police. <br />
<br />
The US Treasury does not make $1m bills, which only go as high as $100. <br />
<br />
In 1969, the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve System discontinued banknotes in denominations of $500, $1,000 and $10,000 due to lack of use. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the first time in my law enforcement career I've seen someone trying to use a $1 million bill,&quot; local police chief Almond Turner was quoted as saying by the Houston Chronicle newspaper. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was green, but you could tell it was not a real bill,&quot; Mr Turner added. <br />
<br />
Ms Pike had three of the $1m bills when she was arrested at the store in Covington on Tuesday, police said. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mr Turner said she claimed she got the bills from her husband.<br />

And even before they were removed from circulation, they hadn't been printed in something like 25 years.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was $10,000, but it's hard to remember something that long ago. Anyways, I found it in her room and was certain it was real. I took it to my mom and she never told me otherwise.<br />
<br />
I honestly wouldn't doubt that the lady thought they were real bills. XD</div></div><hr />

But 1m!!!???   I think that 500's and maybe 1,000 $ notes are still in circulation for banks and financial institutions, but I'm not entirely sure. One of my best friends mom works for a bank and er got into the discussion a while back, but I forgot what was said now.   Ooohh.. so shiney!<br />

Funniest thing is that the back of the bill had a pic of the White House with a little sign in the front that said &quot;ME LIKE BROCCOLI&quot;</div></div><hr />
