Looking at the PoD in Rivervale i though...&quot;Hmmmm, nice staff.&quot;  Well being the curious halfling that i am, i walked around back of the PoD.  Then i got ready to run, and hit DISARM, while i was running towards zone into misty.   <br />

As soon as I got Pick Pocket I ran to the bank in Qeynos. You know the bank guards? No, not the Qeynos guards...the bank guards. The one decked out in full plate. Well I picked him unsuccsessfully.

I meleed the Nexus Scion for a full 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
he hit me for 300 a few times and then 500 and then finished me off with a 2056 punch.<br />
<br />
I noticed I can attack him with Ice forged shackles right out of his melee range and he will not attack. He's perma rooted <br />
