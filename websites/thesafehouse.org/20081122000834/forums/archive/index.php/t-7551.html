<br />
I got 300p off a lvl 3 dark elf near Freeport once, obviously he was in the middle of twinking himself.<br />
<br />
I used to not have cash on me ever (b/c I didn't have any), but lately after a night of pve I routinely have around 60-100p on me.  As of yet I haven't been killed with that cash.<br />
<br />
I also don't destroy money for a couple of reasons.  In good pvp fights, if I lose then that other guy deserves my money.  AND I'm usually traveling with other Shanks so there's good chance one of them will get my money back for me.<br />

Worst loss, Runebranded Girdle to a portal camping lamer. Who of course, if his real characters were ever to be discovered, his life would turn to.. well unpleasantness I am sure. Especially being the girdle wasnt mine and belonged to one of the resident uber groups.<br />
<br />
Best gain. I duno. Robe of enshroudment from a random pk to make him go around naked was pretty nice. Couple of frog crowns. Gnome enviornmental suit. Few diamond rings. Most of a set of Timak armor and a few blue diamond items.<br />

One of my worst moments was when I was kiting guards with my druid, and some guy tried to root me (grrr!!!) Landed one and before I could cancel it the guard got me, soon as I got back and looted my corpse, he decided to attack me. I was pissed and decided that he didn't deserve the money on me (was only about a hundred plat but still!!)..Was really pissed that I deleted my plat and his dot got the last tick=(<br />

or how about a 10 slot back pack?<br />
I have a friend who we give every fighting baton we come across to, he sells em for like 2k a pair,<br />
the hard part is sitting and selling and buying, its borring as hell but if you have a book its easier.<br />
camp Gornit! 6min spawn drops up to 50 plat, and its exp up to 46th at least.<br />
I have 2 rl friends and we work together and often pool cash for the sake of making more, like the tinkers bags, gonna see if there is a market for them since carrying 5k plus is just a scarry thought on rallos.<br />
<br />
<br />
as for losing my sch its not the weapons cost(I got it for under a k) its about the same as a caster losing their latest set of spells, Im stuck with a 7 dam poker until I can replace it and it sucks. It also sucks getting ganked to the three that did it as I have killed all of em in one on one before. They all pretty much suck at pvp when you get em alone.  Diabalein Avidya <br />
