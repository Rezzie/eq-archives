I have been scanning the DMG and PHB for the changes in 3.5  One I really like is the fact Bards can wear light armor with no arcane spell failure chance now.<br />
<br />
What do I find in the DMG under the premade NPC tables?  Their bard listing has a 15% spell failure because of Studded Leather armor.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the proof read and some great QC.   <br />
<br />
I am sure I will find more, but I just wanted to give WoTC a nice fat kudo for that. /sarcasm<br />

There's a url=boards1.wizards.com/showt...adid=59043]thread[/url] over at the wizard boards for people who have found errors that they're posting.<br />

I know it works in the software industry and all, but your users aren't supposed to do your damn editing and bug catching for you.</div></div><hr />

Now all you people have a wonderful opportunity to be hard core, with errata corrections photo-copied, clipped and taped into place! I think it's kind of funny, I think it's kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">07-25-03, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is pretty silly all around.  I started to actually read in depth instead of scanning the classes last night.  I got as far as the Barbarian speed bonus before I found a paragraph that contradicted itself.  Basically the paragraph long section about the speed bonus manages to say Barbs have the bonus as long as they are not wearing heavy armor and do not have a heavy load.<br />
<br />
Then it goes on to say as long as they are only wearing light armor and have a light load do they get the bonus.   <br />
<br />
Ah well.  Make sure you re-read the Ranger class now.  It has changed a ton. d8 for hp, more skill points, &quot;combat style masteries&quot;, evasion etc.  They are truly an outdoor Rogue that looks mean as hell with a bow.  The Improved Precise Shot feat (part of the mastery line, can also take it as a normal feat) is worth the price of admission alone.<br />
<br />
Some good changes, but some not so good as well.  I just wish they would have actually done some QC  <br />

There was a game that had errata.  Their 2nd (3rd?) edition rulebook came in looseleaf binder form so switching out pages would be easy.</div></div><hr />

I played it ONCE, JUST ONCE. The rules for that game were the size of a phone book.</div></div><hr />

The boardgame makes the transition to real time sim pretty damn well.</div></div><hr />
