<br />
It is with great pleasure and lots of excitement that I announce the presence of a special guest. Sigil’s very own Cindy Bowens, Senior Manager of Community &amp; Events, will be joining us live on  MMO Renegades Gaming Radio (http://www.agrogaming.com/) this Sunday, January 15th. <br />
<br />
Show time is 8:30 pm eastern (7:30 central, 6:30 mountain, 5:30 pacific).  <br />
<br />
Cindy will be discussing the upcoming Fanguard event being held January 27th and 28th. She may even have some answers for us concerning the affiliate community and the forum closure! <br />
<br />
It should be quite a show, so come have a listen. If you’d like to participate you can hang out and even submit questions via either IRC at irc.shadowworld.net.   channel: #AGROGaming or Aim: AGRORadio. We will have representatives screening questions. We will try to get to as many questions as we can but not all questions can be answered.<br />
<br />
I hope to see you there!<br />
:)<br />
