<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">04-28-03, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious if anyone happens to have any of those RPGA cards from the player reward system (or promo cards from WF) that they aren't planning on using.  I'm gonna give Green Regent a try at Gencon, and am playing Living Greyhawk a little, so if anyone has cards that they don't plan on using, I'd love to pilfer 'em from ya  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
