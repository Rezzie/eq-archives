Not very suprised about the One Piece / Naruto / Bleach rankings. pretty much to be expected that One Piece would be in the top 5. Some interesting listings, like Tom and Jerry. Wish Uchuu Senkan Yamato was uncut, but a great series nonetheless. Doraemon, Dragonball, and MSG was to be expected also.<br />
<br />
Happy to see Hajime no Ippo on that list, but I have absolutely no idea how it's less popular than Slam Dunk. Urusei Yatsura, Cutey Honey, Astro Boy, and Galaxy Express 999 was pretty unsuprising.</div></div><hr />

That's really to be expected. Cowboy Bebop is a bigger hit in the US than it is in Japan. Berserk only has a cult following.</div></div><hr />

And being that the link is NotEnglish, you'll have to explain why something called Cutey Honey is on there twice, and why Tom and Jerry is on an anime list.  This must not be the Tom and Jerry I'm thinking of.</div></div><hr />

There was two Cutey Honey series, that's what they refer to. And Tom and Jerry is on an anime list because we are the only ones who make a difference between anime and cartoons. to them, anime means animation, no matter where it is for. To us, cartoons is USA, anime is Japan.</div></div><hr />

Heh I tried getting past Cutie Honey 1st episode and it was just too cute to watch the 2nd &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

If they're including all animation on the list, then it's particularly worthless.  I'd put Batman, Futurama, The Simpsons, Looney Tunes, and any number of others up against the stuff that made that list.</div></div><hr />

I love Tom and Jerry. what's wrong with it?</div></div><hr />

When I think of cartoons that span that particular era, it's just not one that jumps very high onto the list, so I'm surprised it's the only non-japanese cartoon on the list.<br />
<br />
What country makes Tom &amp; Jerry btw?  Was it america?  I always assumed all cartoons I ever saw were either american or japanese, and then recently I learned Smurfs was french, and I was all, 'whaaaa?!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">09-25-05, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find this list worthless. It seems to be a listing based off of viewership instead of actual quality. No way in BLACKEST hell Dragonball should be above FMA and NGE...like... at all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">09-26-05, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tom &amp; Jerry was produced by Hanna-Barabera.  It's American.<br />
<br />
Nickelodeon used to have lots of European cartoons back in the day (Danger Mouse, Little Prince, Seven Cities...), but I don't recall very many making it to Saturday morning network TV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-26-05, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most of you are confused. This is based on Japanese viewers. They don't understand things like The Simpsons, Futurama, etc because they do not understand america politics and current events. So most of the humor is lost to them.<br />
<br />
Batman -- or ANY american comic superhero is not their type of hero. What we perceive as heroes is completely different than theirs.<br />
<br />
And Aura, you feel that way because you were not watching Dragonball in that era. Dragonball is a landmark series that changed a lot of things about the shounen genre and animation. Dragonball is the influence that brought you Naruto, Bleach, etc.<br />
<br />
There's also the factor that very little of our anime ever gets shown on Japanese TV. For example, if we had the same poll here, 10 years ago, most anime won't be on the list, and anime enthaustics will be complaining about the lack of Gundam, Macross, Urusei Yatsura, etc.<br />
<br />
While things like Fullmetal Alchemist are of high quality, they are not -groundbreaking- or revolutionary. Their existence changed nothing. Neon Genesis Evangelion might be a different case because it's one of the four social-revolutionary anime made in Japan, but the overwhelming amount of people who know of and love Dragonball in their memories defeated that.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of factors as to why the list is like that. And why Americans can't really understand it. To us americans, NGE, Cowboy Bebop, etc are top ranked anime. I can only but question, why? Just because it's high quality? Then I'll question you guys on NGE. There are a lot of things lacking in NGE, which is why it is not famous for it's high quality in Japan, but how it changed social perception of anime.<br />
<br />
As I said, there's a lot of outside factors influencing people's decisions, both in Japan and here. Here, most people don't know what truly great anime is because they don't want to pay for these &quot;old stuff.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">09-26-05, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to be a fan of DBZ (not DB or GT) when that was really the only anime i knew. While it was not that great of a plot line it def showed what high quality fighting action could be heh. And I for one am glad that it helped spawn other great action shows such as Naruto, Bleach, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
Detective Conan (Case Closed) - Still good IMO even if it is old heh<br />
Lupin III - its a great show lol and it has a lot of years on it :P.<br />

<br />
To me Cowboy Bebop showed that you could have action and story with somewhat deep char interaction. It showed also that not all anime was about teh little girls *insert comment* etc. While it was pretty high quality it was more the story and char interaction that I thought where best.<br />

Yeah, theres alot of things it sucks at doing, but the things it does well, it did better than anything else at the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I find it odd that I can't find any torrents for Mobile Suit Gundam...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I support americans liking anime based on their own experience and think its a good thing that we are making our own anime culture, but I was linking to a japanese poll which is where I am setting my basis.<br />

Cause if thats what you mean, that show is NOTHING like DBZ.<br />

I used to like Robotech(I realize that its actually animes that had nothing to do with each other that happened to be done by the same animation company, and were edited together into one series here), when I was 5.<br />
<br />
I recently bought the whole series on DVD and my god, it's CRAP!<br />
<br />
That stupid bitch spends 15 minutes singing in EVERY ******* episode!<br />
<br />
The fights were also 90% stock footage and lasted about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Nothing like DBZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am talking about Macross SDF released by animeigo. There's still a lot of music, but of course it's not like DBZ. It has plot. It has content. It has a point. It has a story.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how you can even begin to compare the two. Macross, and Macross: Do You Remember Love? are some of the greatest anime to come out of Japan. It and DBZ are completely different genres, for one thing.</div></div><hr />

Well, you made that comment there right after my post about DBZ, so natually I assumed that was one of the &quot;series&quot; you referred to when you were saying &quot;macross has that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Obviously you must have been referring to an earlier post.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically what it comes down to is this.  If I want a good plot, I'll read a book.  Cartoons are for awsomely animated fightscenes.  Because books can't have that.</div></div><hr />
