<br />
Guild Website: http://vanguard.luxarcana.org.uk <br />
<br />
Main Time Zone: European (English speaking) <br />
<br />
Guild Leader &amp; Recruiter: Belteyn <br />
<br />
A short bit about us: <br />
<br />
We are a live guild for Vanguard Saga of Heroes on the Halgar server. Our focus is to provide a solid long-term home for the 'dedicated casual' player based in the UK and Europe. By 'casual' we mean players that have other commitments in real life such as their job, family and other interests, and whose play time can be fairly random. By 'dedicated' we mean players that are willing to immerse themselves fully in the game and give 110% to the guild.  <br />
<br />
We accept all races and classes, and encourage an equal balance of the Spheres to support each other. We currently have an internal Work Order system where our Crafters make sub-components and finished items that we use as member rewards or sell for profit. In addition members regularly take part in Harvesting nights to provide the raw materials we need, and more recently our Diplomats get involved in raising the City Buffs for Crafting nights.<br />
<br />
With a growing number of level-cap players we are currently assembling a casual raid force, and although we will never be a hardcore raiding guild we do hope to raid at least once a week.<br />
<br />
As a guild we are now working towards the construction of a Guild Hall. We also have a number of Safehouses throughout Telon that can act a temporary HQ's when required for guild events, and that can be used  as bases for raiding. We also operate a Subsidised Housing scheme where the guild helps guild members fund and build their houses. It is also our intention to get involved in building player-run settlements when the game allows.<br />
<br />
We hold weekly guild meetings where members share equipments and materials with each other, and where we present awards to members climbing up our internal ranking system. At least once a month after a weekly meeting we will also hold an all-guild event with various prizes.<br />
<br />
Our recruitment is nearly always open for the right players, but I must stress that we want players that are willing to make an effort to get involved with the guild and contribute to our ongoing projects. We also want players that are mature, helpful, friendly and outgoing. Above all we like to have fun, make friends, and try out everything that the game has to offer.<br />
<br />
Guild category: PvE, Mature, Dedicated-Casual, RP Friendly, Fun<br />
<br />
Recruiting members status: Actively Recruiting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belteyn</div><div class="date">11-14-06, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now only 10 places left before we will be closing recruitment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belteyn</div><div class="date">02-26-07, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recruitment re-opens!<br />
<br />
We have decided to re-open recruitment for a further 10 places. Specifically we require players that are already playing Vanguard with a Main between Adventuring levels 15-25, preferably on Qalia but this is less important. (Tanks very welcome!) <br />
<br />
Before applying please make sure you have read our Charter and agree with it. We want players that will actively contribute to our guild, either helping organise groups or working with our crafters on housing, ships and guild resources. In order to fund the various projects we have planned members are be expected to make some modest contributions. <br />
<br />
If you think we are the guild for you then please drop in and say hello!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belteyn</div><div class="date">03-14-07, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are now specifically looking for players between Adventuring or Crafting levels 20-30.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in joining a guild of very friendlly and dedicated adults from all over Europe who have a real passion for working together to have fun and progress in Vanguard then drop in and make an application. While our playstyle is casual in that our real lives and families always come first, we are however very dedicated to making our guild work in Vanguard. In particular we are all working together to build a guild house, and this will be followed by numerous other cooperative projects. Yes Vanguard still has some issues, but we are working around these and looking forward to the future, and having a great deal of fun along the way!<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belteyn</div><div class="date">04-30-07, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an update to say that recruitment is still open for European players with Mains 25-35,  Crafters 30+ or talented diplomats. We are a guild of mature players from all over Europe that are having a lot of fun with Vanguard and  despite the recent uncertainty are determined to continue to do so! <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belteyn</div><div class="date">09-05-07, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recruitment Update<br />
<br />
Like most of the community we are very pleased that the server merges went so well - well done SOE!<br />
<br />
We managed to secure our existing guild village on Qalia as well as some new Safehouses on Thestra and Kojan, and as a guild we are now moving  full steam ahead to build up our cash reserves so that we can start planning for a Guild Hall. In the meantime we continue to run organised guild groups every week to various locations, crafting nights and other fun events. But we do need more members at all levels, and especially in the Adventuring and Crafting 30+ range. Please drop in to our site, take a look around and read our Charter and see if we are the guild for you. I'm online most nights, so if you have any questions send me a tell :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belteyn</div><div class="date">11-06-07, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recruitment Update<br />
<br />
Recruiting new members 40+ who would like to try some casual raiding.<br />
<br />
As a casual guild we are never going to raid religiously 3-4 times per week but we would like to try some raiding content as soon as we are able. We currently have 12 members in 48-50 level range but would like to double that in the next month either from existing members or new recruits. So if you are a casual player with at least one character fast approaching Level 50 and think you will fit in with our guild style, then we would like to hear from you!<br />
<br />
That said, our recruitment still remains open at other levels provided you are a dedicated player that is likely to progress quickly in the game, and more importantly contribute!<br />
<br />
As always if you are part of a very small guild and are considering merging with a larger more active guild then please contact me and we can discuss a larger number of applications.</div></div><hr />
