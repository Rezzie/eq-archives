So I read bmezine alot. I recently found their personals and started iming people off of it. A few of which are girls. Most are just friends but me and one chick have started falling for each other. We talked on the phone for an hour last night. It was cool but she is in north carolina and I am in Texas. Tis suketh verily.<br />

This would be just as bad as if he met her in college/convention/etc. and found out that she lives in TX... <br />
<br />
This phenomenon is not isolated to the fact that the romance started from a personal ad and internet messaging.<br />
<br />
I guess I just got lucky that the guy I fell for while playing EQ only lives an hour away, that we were both single, and that we're still very much into each other after 2 years of being together.<br />
<br />
Hope you and your gal can develop a great relationship regardless of the distance, and then perhaps move someplace halfway between the two of you, so you're both equidistant from family &amp;amp; stuff. (Back In Black)<br />

Because I don't want to fall since its such a distance but I can't help it. I wish I could just grow up and stop falling for chicks so easily. American by birth.<br />

One you get to meet the person face to face and can judge thier characther in person, the other is a crap shoot.</div></div><hr />
