Let me also preface this by saying my post was made in rebuttal to a thread on the VZ board which in turn quoted the TZ board. I didn't post this earlier because I wasn't sure if I was getting privledged info at the time (though was never told not to talk about it) but, since this other guy obviously knew what's up...I spilled too.<br />

Assuming it's deity based, which deities will be good and evil?<br />
<br />
Evil: Cazic, Innoruuk, Bertoxxulous<br />
<br />
Neutral: Bristlebane, Duke of Bellow, Karana, agnostic, Sol Ro, Veeshan, that water one, Rallos Zek? (most ogres are Rallos worshippers...)<br />
<br />
Good: Tunare, Brell, the Tribunal, Erollisi?<br />

<br />
The Zeks surely are evil.  The Giants(hill,ice,fire,storm) and Ogres are evil, and were created by Rallos zek.<br />
<br />
If corpse camping is allowed, there must be something to offset it.  Maybe its a 'monty haul'(??) server.  All named always spawn and always drop the good gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For one, the lightie races will be battling between themselves on Antonica and Faydwer, deleveling each other.<br />
<br />
Iksar will have undisputed evil levelling grounds that no agnostic/good chars really can penetrate.<br />
<br />
Everyone will be training guards and mobs onto one another.<br />
<br />
Item loot will make nekkid caster appear anew, and grief play - mages and necros will be abundant again.<br />
<br />
And the mass-area devastate spells will wreak havoc in most newbie zones non stop - for example the enchanter earthquake spell for 300+ hp in wide area will be all time favourite.<br />

<br />
Is this really true?  Please oh please say they are going follow through on this.  It would rid the economy of camping and farming for account alternates.  It will allow characters to develop more fully without interference from said campers and farmers.  Finally, it will force characters to more fully &quot;play out&quot; their single charcater; hopefully allowing for a higher degree of role play.<br />
<br />
I can play on any server and adapt.  But after roughly two years of EQ I still have not come to accept Verant's ingrained philosopyy of playing for your alternates.  Its so anti-social to the primary game player.<br />
<br />
If they implement this one rule I'll jump to that server and give it a whirl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Neferti TZ</div><div class="date">05-30-01, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I think if they totally remove the level based resistance modifiers it wont be that bad as it is now (meaning 60 level 20's could maybe kill a 60 wiz instead of having no chance at all   well... maybe not but at least they could hit the wizzie a bit before dying).<br />
<br />
But seeing as you get like +10 or -10 for each level difference on all your resists (theres some effect of skill vs the level of your opponent too in melee combat I think)... high level people are just about immune to anything and low levels are sitting ducks.<br />
<br />
If they somehow neutralise that bonus/penalty it might make the server more or less playable, if they dont well... *shrug*.<br />
<br />
Another thing... I can see it coming, the bands of people who group with a level 5 and a level 60 where the 60 almost finishes someone and the level 5 gets the final blow and loots.<br />

The spectre pet can pretty much mow all of them down. plus with necro hp drain dots even after they die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-31-01, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is though, how long would a level 60 be standing around say, Highpass, without attracting higher levels to kill him?  Who on earth will want to make good characters if no higher levels on the good team will defend their own zones?  <br />
<br />
Because there isn't going to be one level 60 in a vacuum.  But even if there is some sort of imbalance where good or neutral cannot defend Highpass or even Freeport, then the evil team will control the zone.  Who is to say that's bad?  That's a dynamic world right there, something that doesn't exist on any Zek server.  Who knows, if the evil team controlled Freeport for a long time, maybe the GMs would have an event where Antonius Bayle would arrive and lead a crusade to retake Freeport, or maybe try to gather forces from Butcherblock to make a landing.  <br />
<br />
Note: I've seen the pictures of a ranger protest where everyone made dozens and dozens  oflevel 1 rangers flooded Crushbone to protest ranger weakness.  These rangers were able to kill everything in the zone, including Emperor Crush (D'Vinn did not spawn however).  It's entirely possible for 60 level 20s who loot their weapons and rush back in after death, to kill a level 60, especially a caster who can be interrupted.  If not kill, cause LD to such a caster.
