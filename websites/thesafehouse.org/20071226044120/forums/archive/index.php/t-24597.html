<br />
That classic opening is just &lt;3</div></div><hr />

I agree, though, MariMite is a great show.  though I still haven't gotten around to finishing the second season, heh.</div></div><hr />

Hehe isn't it like 2 yrs old :P?<br />
<br />
But ya so far it is great. Altho a bit slow but if they make it any faster i think it would lose value...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-30-06, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Marimite definitely is one of my favorite Shoujo of all time. It was one of the few shoujo that spread out to the male-dominated otaku fandom. A suprise, considering the lack of fanservice, action, deep plot, and other shonen/seinen properties.<br />
<br />
Even more suprising its success, being given an unplanned second season. The characters are all interesting in their own way, which I quite like. Most characters, you get a strong first impression of (in anime as whole, I mean) but the girls of Marimite were more.. Mysterious? Maybe not the right word.<br />
<br />
Your first impression of them would be similar, no matter which girl. But you see the subtle differences between all of them that make them who they are. I loved that. Ginko of Mushishi had the same effect on me, I had no impression of him upon being introduced to him, but during the series yoiu learn his subtle hypocrisies, passion, cruelty, and everything that makes him extraordinary, but still very human.<br />
<br />
Ah, bringing up fond memories is fun.</div></div><hr />

I agree. While the show has a female lead i do not feel she is the center of the show really. The anime does a good job spreading the feeling all around the school with all it's characters.<br />
<br />
I also like their &quot;mysterious&quot; qualities...like stalk says it is these subtle differences that seem to give the characters their own individuality. And makes it feel more real and gives the viewer a more well rounded understanding to the characters themselves.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the first season is something like 2 years old.  And yes, it feels weird to me that we now think of a show two years old as &quot;old anime&quot;. ;)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's WRONG mind you, just that there's been a relatively recent change in the fan community that holds a much shorter period of time to the concept.  I still can't bring myself to think of Marimite as &quot;old anime.&quot;  I probably couldn't bring myself to apply it to anything more recent than 10 years old, heh.  Just a shifting perception is all.</div></div><hr />

Really in this case i should have said that it has been out a long time. Old is more like DBZ(the first), Lup the 3rd, that show b4 Inuyasha was famous etc... hehe.<br />
<br />
Altho old is just easier to say then &quot;This anime has been out for awhile&quot; =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">05-30-06, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's really all just semantics.  It mostly derives from the speed at which licenses are picked up for brand new shows, and also the speed at which fansubbers produce and distro shows as well.  It still amazes me how many years we waited for certain shows, even ones that were considered hot, when now we're surprised when a halfway decent show isn't licensed at least before it finishes airing in Japan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">05-30-06, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya. I was pretty sure KimiNozo wasn't going to get released in the US but now its finally going to be released. I hope it does well b/c this is basically it i think. If this fails we might not see more of its type in the US =(.</div></div><hr />

Now on to Maria-sama ga miteru-spring! hehe.</div></div><hr />
