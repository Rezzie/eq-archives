<br />
Here it is, the much awaited announcement of the specific rulesets. We apologize for not getting this to you sooner, but there were some things we needed to nail down that took some time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Free for all server:<br />
Minimum level 7<br />
20% soft level difference (explained below)<br />
15% coin loot<br />
PvE item durability is disabled on ability activation and PvP death causes a chance for each equipped item to take a large hit<br />
Releasing your spirit after a PvP death takes you to your bind point. You will not drop a corpse.<br />
<br />
Team server:<br />
Minimum level 7<br />
20% soft level difference<br />
15% coin loot<br />
Durability is no different than a PvE server<br />
Releasing your spirit drops a corpse (with no experience loss) and transports you to the nearest altar<br />
Defensive targeting and grouping is restricted<br />
<br />
The teams<br />
<br />
Shadows of Kaerellun <br />
<br />
Dark Elf<br />
Kurashasa<br />
Varanthari<br />
Orc<br />
Goblin<br />
Vulmane<br />
Varanjar<br />
Lesser Giant<br />
<br />
Order of Alurad <br />
<br />
Wood Elf<br />
Raki<br />
Dwarf<br />
Halfling<br />
High Elf<br />
Half Elf<br />
Qaliathari<br />
Mordebi<br />
Gnome<br />
Kojani<br />
Thestran Human<br />
<br />
We have support for additional teams, but we feel this is the best initial setup that supports the content and has people able to find opponents from a fairly low level.<br />
<br />
The soft level difference means, while your ability to attack someone above the minimum level is unrestricted, if you are more than 20% of their level higher than them, they suffer no penalty and you gain no reward.<br />
<br />
The percentages are easily adjustable and we will be enabling coin banking for PvP servers.<br />
<br />
EDIT: European server will be a team server<br />

This was the last bit of PVP information they had regarding the official PVP rulesets when the Beta Boards went down. Enjoy.<br />
