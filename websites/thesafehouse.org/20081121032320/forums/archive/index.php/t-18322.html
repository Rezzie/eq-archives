Right and Left tibia/femur, and ribcage.  (chest drops.)<br />
<br />
Upon examination, each bone will go into your quest journal separately.  Once you have all 5 collected, visit Private Doopy (outside Gul'thex Citadel, northern portion) He's a wee little halfling ghost hiding behind a stone.<br />
<br />
For each bone you bring him, you recieve 15-17 silver and a bit of experience.  After you've brought him all 5 bones, he sends you on a quest to deliver his skull to his war chest.  The chest is located in a halfling camp.  from the top of N'marr's Ascent, take the western road until you reach a gate with some undead halflings.  In the back you'll find his chest.<br />
<br />
The reward for this step is 8gold,30ish silver and a minor item.<br />
all told the quest brings in roughly 9.5 gold :)  very good for a mid 20's quest doable by an exp group</div></div><hr />
