They're under the water, towards the west. Head towards the sunken ship. There isn't many of them that I saw. There is also one on the island with all the Naga but it is broken of course. I reported it but my report was never addressed.</div></div><hr />

There were chests on the lower level that were orange, and some up one level that were red. With the BI Dwarves pretty spread out, at level 51 I was able to pick them off one or two at a time to keep the area clear. I got up to 230 pretty fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is more specific info confirming what others said above about them not being pickable at lower skill levels... So with the limited information available, guessing that it's a 25 point range for each color? I have a rogue alt too, so I'll try to do some data collection as I come across them.<br />
<br />
Looks like we also have Battered Footlocker (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/object.html?wobject=412), Waterlogged Footlocker (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/object.html?wobject=420), and Mossy Footlocker (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/object.html?wobject=422). It looks like each type is found in multiple zones, and therefore different boxes of each type will have different skill levels, depending on which zone the box is in.</div></div><hr />

This is a lot farther south than any chests I found. Off the north coast (http://www.worldofwar.net/cartography/worldmap/desolace.php) pretty much ringing Ethel Rethor and those two little dot islands I found a whole lot of Waterlogged Footlockers (were orange at 158, turned yellow at 175, and green at 200) amidst some lvl 30 or so naga. I also saw 1 Mossy Footlocker that was a bit farther out and red when I first saw it, but never swam back out after my skill raised.<br />

I don't think so. It seems like there's just a selection of range available in some (or all) zones. The same boxes located in diff zones so far have conned the same as each other.</div></div><hr />

You remember what skill you were at when it was red? I'm trying to chart all these out, to make a nice easy-to-read guide of what to pick where when.<br />

I was basing that off the comments posted under Alla's Dented Footlocker entry. Someone said that the one they found was green at 250. Combined with Alla showing it in lower zones, I thought they might have just picked one of the names to use in each zone, and then each zone would be for a certain skill. Your way makes more sense, and is what I thought they'd do, until I read that comment. Then again, he also said it was green when he got there at 223, and still green when he left at 250. That seems to not match everything that everyone else has said, so he may just be clueless.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd appreciate any info anyone can post about these. Name of the box, zone and area where you found it, and the skill/color.</div></div><hr />

I was at 158 when I first saw it, it was the first footlocker I saw in the area and was a bit farther out to sea than the rest. (I dunno if that's a constant, but just in case.)</div></div><hr />

There are a few spawn locations in there but thats the only place i saw them.  Orange at 176.  The other ones in the fort are Yellow at 176.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harvey</div><div class="date">04-27-05, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For lower level rogues (mid 20s), you can find battered footlockers in Durnholde Keep and the respawn is plentiful and quick.  I was able to get from around 80 to over 125 in a couple of hours while doing the pickpocket quest.  The chests were still yellow even at 125.<br />
<br />
The next step up in the area is (oddly) back at the murlocs in Wetlands.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Though I believe maybe you can go to one of the camps in Arathi or Alturac as well, if you don't want to go back to Wetlands.</div></div><hr />
