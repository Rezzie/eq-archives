<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">06-02-06, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happy Family Planning was my favorite episode.  And that's all I'll say about that, to avoid spoilers.<br />
<br />
And yeah, there was a definite shift in tone when the series went from self-contained character studies and vignettes to actually wrapping up the story.  I thought it was still pretty good, even so.</div></div><hr />

Both hilarious and disturbing at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 That would be Happy Family Planning I believe hehe. Ya that eps was good as well. But overall ya the last 3 eps did move away from single char views but as you have said it still remains a good show. I just liked the overall point the director was trying to make.<br />
<br />
Another close fav eps was the one with the designers of the doll...how each one died to get it to the studio etc.</div></div><hr />
