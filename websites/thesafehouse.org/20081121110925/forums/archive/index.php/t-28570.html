<br />
We are happy to announce that Seren Llys Du has opened its doors in the world of Telon. Our name, in Welsh, means Hall of the Black Star and has a long, distinguished history. Seren was created in the world of Norrath on July 3, 2003 and began our journey in Telon on February 16, 2007.<br />
<br />
Our goals in Telon are to be known as an honorable and knowledgeable group of players who excel in all areas of game play. We will be focusing in the three spheres of play equally to the benefit of all guild members. A trade company, a diplomatic corps as well as a gatehouse of adventurers will be our make up. There is room for all styles of play.<br />
<br />
Seren has always had a family atmosphere and does not subscribe to the darker side of end game play. We will have events and raids in the future, but this will not be our main focus. Guild members will be expected to adhere to a simple and honorable code of conduct that exemplifies the virtues of Honor, Loyalty, Integrity, Chivalry, Knowledge, and Excellence, which are the foundations of the guild.<br />
<br />
If you would like to learn more about us, please visit our website at http://seren.guildportal.com. You are also welcome to contact Sirse, Aunraye, or any other officer in game. We are located on the Flamehammer server.<br />
<br />
In Honor and Service,<br />
