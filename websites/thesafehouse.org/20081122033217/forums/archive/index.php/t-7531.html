<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lirin TZ</div><div class="date">05-04-01, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br />
Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br />
<br />
Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br />
<br />
De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br />
<br />
There may very well be other changes in the patch, so read the patch message carefully. And this is only the first of the things that we plan to change, so don't worry that this is all that we plan to do. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can.<br />

<br />
They talked about these changes at the faire too, where they also talked about teams, so its making me hopeful.  Majestyk, sure you don't want to hang around a while and see?<br />
<br />
I absolutely freaking LOVE the con change. Gonna add a lot more situational awareness to PvP, without much impact to those of us who attack any con. Don't have to go pinging people to figure out if their in range either. Will make a major difference to me as well, in that it will be a lot easier to figure out if I can intervene in a conflict without oor healing. <br />
<br />
The deleveling fix is great too.  I'd like to see em throw a level limit on the Fungi, to help fix the same kind of uber-newbie killing problem. <br />
<br />
The sanctuary level thing is all part of a sinister plot to increase the population on the Zeks.  I guess I could live with that, though, if it meant we'd get a proportional increase in coding effort.<br />
<br />
The best idea I heard for resurrecting the team concept, came from Lady D.  Hard-code one of the Team Servers and allow movelog between all three current Zeks, while leaving the new one a fresh environment for those who want that experience.  Would leave a choice for every faction, pure-team, xteam, item loot, no item loot, ...  Wonder if he made any headway on that one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grinkle</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering what 'de-leveled' meant.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the sanctuary thing is a very good idea.  I think it will just tend to move the region of absolute chaos / undisciplined random wandering and attacking to the few levels above six.<br />
<br />
Getting to 7 is not too hard in blue land - right now, I THINK (I do not know for sure, not enough experience on the Zeks) that a lot of people come in just for a brief taste of PvP - they can get it out of their systems with a newbie char, they get to L3 ro L4 and have some fun killing L1's for a while, then they go away.<br />
<br />
I suspect we are going to see a lot more L10's / L11's playing with about the same &quot;chaos factor&quot; as a lot of the L4's / L5's do today.<br />
<br />
Since my highest char on a Zek is only 5 to date, I may be all wet on this asumption - maybe things are pretty crazy there already, and I just don't know it yet.  I am basing this on ....  At levels 1 and 2, I got PK'd a bunch.  At L3, just once, and none since then.  Seems like people to start only PK'ing for cause as levels get higher, and the causes tend to be things other than &quot;cause I felt like it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I'd prefer not to have the sanctuary rule, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shaderick</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boy. I don't even PLAY PVP and these seem like good changes.<br />
<br />
Con system: No more just picking on people who're lower than you.  (Though I hadn't even though about the 'flip side' of this where you can now actually tell which 'blues' you can attack. Nice)<br />
<br />
Sanctuary Levels: Allows characters to actually develop a few of the basic skills of their class before being called upon to defend themselves. (As far as I can imagine, the only real defense a level 3 anything has is to run.)<br />
<br />
I'm going to be watching PVP changes curiously, and following the thoughts of all the veteran PVP players for a while.  This looks like it's going to be 'interesting times' for the PVP servers.<br />
<br />
(P.S.: For the ignorant, what is a 'hard-coded' teams server? One on which you can do nothing but attack people outside your team?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grinkle</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaderick - <br />
<br />
All other things (equipment, mostly) being equal ...<br />
<br />
An L3 being attacked by an L3 can run or fight.<br />
<br />
An L30 being attacked by an L34 can run, or likely die, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Its the difference in levels that matters, not the absolute level.  Sanctuary won't change that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I gathered from the PvP Panel discussion at the SD Fan Faire:<br />
<br />
The sanctuary levels were implemented so that players from other servers couldn't just come on to the Zeks to play grief player style amongst the newbies when their server went down.  By making it non PvP up to a certain level, it allows some insurance that the player will have a bit more of an investment in the server and in their reputation.  Apparently this was a bit of a problem on all the zeks, but on Rallos Zek in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grinkle</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fricka - <br />
<br />
I'm thinking that one way or the other, I'm going to have a few levels where I have to put up with people who have no interest beyond the next hour or so in the server PK'ing for kicks, and I'd rather they be levels 1-4 than levels 7-10, cause it still isn't too tough to get past 1-4, since they are such easy levels, PvP aside.<br />
<br />
I guess the new barrier to entry (you need to get to L7 before you can start PK'ing, and prolly L10 or so before you can REALLY start picking on folks) could help things.  In any case, sooner or later I'll be into the mid-teens, and then it won't matter.<br />
<br />
Now, do I want to re-start my L5 so this time I can actually KEEP my newbie shirt?  Hmmm ....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shaderick</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; An L3 being attacked by an L3 can run or fight.<br />
<br />
True.<br />
<br />
&gt; An L30 being attacked by an L34 can run, or likely die,<br />
&gt; etc etc.<br />
<br />
Also true.<br />
<br />
&gt; Its the difference in levels that matters, not the<br />
&gt; absolute level. Sanctuary won't change that.<br />
<br />
While I hear you on both of the above, my guy feeling is that a level 1 has less chance against a level 5 than a level 30 has against a level 34.  Anyone care to enlighten me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lirin TZ</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a lvl 1 has NO chance aginst a lvl 5.  a level 30 has a pretty much even chance aginst a lvl 34.  the 34 may have a small advantage, but its not all that great at this level.  especially if the lvl 30 is the agressor, they then actually have an advantage, the agressor alwys does.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-07-01, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, however, the classes factor in a lot as well. Rogues are very good as offense, but not too well as defense (biggest determining factor for me is lag really). A druid or necro can pretty much be offense, defense, whatever, it doesnt matter they have a spell for it. Also whether or not it's just you, or a pack of folks. But straight up, a level 30 vs a level 34, I say the 34 has the advantage, maybe even if the defender, because he has 20 more points to his skills, higher AC/ATK/HP's and in some cases a higher ring of spells.<br />

<br />
For sure, non-PvP, a four level difference in me vs a mob is an almost certain death sentance.<br />

I was thinking it would be kind of the same in PvP - maybe I'm wrong.<br />

<br />
 I havent played on the Zeks much, but it seems to me (from the loot rules) that platinum is devalued compared to a blue server, as it is unreliable, meaning it can be looted.  Most trades would be item for item, with the items going into the bags otherwise naked traders on rallos.  Or they take place in a crowd of guards, but then everyone would have to have good faction.<br />
<br />
With Sanctuary Levels, though, money is safe if held by a level 6 or lower.  EC tunnel will become Mule Central, and the Great Bazaar will be stimulated by the effective invention of Coinage.<br />
<br />
Is this a good thing though?</div></div><hr />
