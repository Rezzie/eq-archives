<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep Naruto talk in the other thread, please.<br />
<br />
Since there's no Anime Forum (ahem) I don't have a desire to make a post every time a new episode comes out that I want to talk about, and about various series that are not well-known among the Safehouse Naruto fans (ahem ahem Forum ahem ahem ahem cough).<br />
<br />
I decieded to talk in a consolidated post regarding many anime I've been watching lately. And also in hopes to hear what everyone else is watching. I've lately noticed my interests are no longer as varied as they used to be, I'm starting to find genres that I find more entertainment in than others.<br />
<br />
Part of this may be as a result of my slowly dwindling time that I can dedicate to watching anime, but nevertheless I do try to watch as varied genre as I can without sacrificing what I know I enjoy.<br />
<br />
In event that this thread becomes as popular as I hope it to be, please bold the titles you are talking about so people can skip what they don't care about. And spoilers for, well, spoilers.<br />
<br />
On to what I've watched lately... (In order of whatever order my fansub folders / dvd shelf is in...)<br />
<br />
Akane Mainax Gaiden - I watched the first OVA. This title caught my attention because I had played the Ero-game, Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien, and then later watched the anime by the same title. There was a DVD special called Akane Mainax, which took place in the time that Akane from Kiminozo was in High School. It takes place at the same time as Kiminozo when Haruka was in the hospital. <br />
<br />
I disliked the episode. But I'll continue watching the series because I love Akane, and managed to catch a glimpise of Haruka and Mitsuki. The main character is annoying as hell. I don't understand this series, and am wondering how closely it follows the Akane Mainax DVD. I have yet to order it, so I'm not sure what's contained within aside from the brief exposure I had watching my friend play it.<br />
<br />
Beck- I highly recommend this anime, it's about a rock band trying to succeed. I've been following the manga since it's inception (I own the Japanese manga, and have been reading fan-translations.) I loved the Manga version because you could &quot;imagine&quot; the songs instead of hoping the music would be great, or the lyrics would be great, or the fan-translation would do the song justice.  If anyone has read the manga version of Full Moon wo Sagashite, then you know what I am referring to.<br />
<br />
While I couldn't tell you how the music is done in Anime (I know for certain there is actual music in it, and lyrics, unlike the manga) the story itself and the animation style makes me fall in love with Beck all over again. The character development is superb.<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549]It seems it will end at the &quot;Legendary Concert&quot; they had, which I highly anticipate.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549] I'm glad the recent bullying episodes have ended finally, for the most part, with the school concert being the exception[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Futakoi - This is a Harem anime. It is very highly targeted at a certain fetish, so it's suprising to me that it got made into anime. But Yura-chan, Kira-chan, Ruru-tan and Rara-tan are very moe~ so I continue to watch it. The literal title is Twin Love, so you can guess what it's about. One guy, tons of twins.<br />
<br />
The series is as shallow as it comes, but it serves a small interest of mine, so I continue watching.<br />
<br />
Genshiken / Kujibiki Unbalance - I fell in love with this anime almost instantly. If any of you know Otaku no Video, then you should be familiar with this anime already. It is an anime about Otaku. More specificially, a College otaku club. It places an group of very varied Otaku, and an ordinary Japanese woman in the midst to serve as a &quot;reaction&quot; within the group to show what ordinary Japanese find outrageous about Otaku.<br />
<br />
I instantly fell in love, and every episode since than has only made me love it more. The Manga is licensed, but the Anime is not. However, it is somewhat difficult to find the Anime as the group that represents it requested that the Fansubbers stop, and Animesuki not to list it. If you can find it, however, it is a wonderful insight into the state of Anime in Japan.<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549]The recent attempts at getting Saki-chan to cosplay has been entertaining, especially as I can emphasize with the men among the group imagining Saki in a neko-maid outfit. But Kohsaka's obliviousness has been irritating, I felt for Saki-chan when she was crying, although the Puyo-puyo cosplay was cute.<br />
<br />
I am really into Ohno-san, but it's too bad she has other interests. I was hoping that Yaoi-fangirl would make an appearance in the series (and she did, briefly, as a non-speaking cameo) but it's too bad the series would be too short for such.<br />
<br />
I am reassured that poser and singing dudes did not remain in the series, however.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Ghost in the Shell - 2nd Gig - The first series (Stand Alone Complex) was entertaining, and I am enjoying 2nd Gig. More or less, if you like Ghost in the Shell movie, then you'll enjoy this.<br />
<br />
Ghost in the Shell 2 - Innocence - The movie was thought-provoking and the animation was impressive. Not much needs to be said, this is a popular one.<br />
<br />
Kaleido Star - Another lovely one, Rosetta-tan is soo cute in the second half of the series (27+). Sora is as lovely as ever, but May is continually annoying and Leon being almost as interesting as Yuri (which is not saying much). I hoping to get the Rosetta pillow (only as a collectible, mind you).<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549]The recent plot developments regarding Leon has given some depth to the Anime, but I conute to watch it for more Rosetta and in hopes to see Sora and Rosetta do another deut as they did in the first half.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petite Cossette - I have been interested in this Anime. The visuals are superb and the story is extremely dark. I am reminded of Perfect Blue. Seeing the R2 DVD&quot;s cover, I am happy I did not have to buy this in a store. I can only imagine the odd looks I would get seeing a half-naked 12-year old girl in chains in the cover. Which in actuality is meant to be symbolic, not pornographic, as it identifies with the anime well.<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549]The second episode was gruesome and shed light on why Cossette was murdered. Lots of questions remain, and one can only hope it would be answered in the third and final OVA when it's released in the States.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Legend of the Condor Hero - This has a chinese history and has been retold in many formats. The story is wonderful, but their relationship is fustrating. It is highly recommended, if you can find the fansubs. I would advise against picking up the R1 DVD's, however, as the licensing company will not do it justice.<br />
<br />
Maria-sama ga Miteru ~Haru~ - A series that has gone deeply into my heart. I loved the first series, and Haru is no exception. Yumi still warms my heart and the deep friendship within the Rose families is wonderful. <br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549] I eagerly await the final episode of Haru, but the graduation was very touching and I am upset by the way Rose Chinesis is treating Yumi. I hope she has a good excuse, but it is fustrating for me to see Yumi feeling so horrible. I cannot wait for a conclusion.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Monster - Ah, Monster. Easily one of the greatest Manga series of all time, and soon to be one of the greatest Anime of all time when it's run is completed. Since the manga has completed, I will talk about the anime.<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549]While the story is no suprise to me, as it is identical to the anime, I have tried to watch Monster &quot;forgetting&quot; the manga. I am eagerly awaiting to see what will happen in Tenma's attempt to snipe Johan. Johan's scribble on the walls and paper is as terrifying as I remember it to be in the Manga.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Shura no Toki - The earlier episodes began brillantly, but I can't say I am enjoying the later episodes nearly as much. I would recommend this series if only for the first 13 or so episodes (Until the Mutsu vs Juubei fight). The series takes a turn for the worse later.<br />
<br />
[spoiler:3a4915f549]The whole thing about him navigating the boats, ridiculous! And blocking a bullet to the unsuprised target, please, don't make me laugh.[/spoiler:3a4915f549]<br />
<br />
Tenshi na Konamaki - Also known as &quot;A Cheeky Angel&quot;. I love this series and am glad episode 43 has finally been released by Anime-Empire. It is a story about a boy trapped in a girl's body. It is wonderful and funny.<br />
<br />
Yakikate! Japan - An anime about.. Bread! My only complaint is that the Animation is not as good as it should be, and Tsukkie's cosplay in the manga is not animated. Mind you, they are but slipcovers, but it is so cute. I watch the anime mostly to see her. The manga is amazing, however.<br />
<br />
Aishiteruze Baby - Having a sister myself, this anime touched a small part of my heart. Yuzuyu is very cute. All in all it was a decent end to the Anime, but I continue to read the manga. It's a story about a high school boy who was forced to take care of a Kindergarten child.<br />
<br />
I'll probably talk some more about various anime tomorrow. If anyone wants to talk about something non-naruto related then that would be cool. I don't really want any closed-mindedness in this thread, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm goin to talk about anime too!<br />
<br />
I found out I watched alot of animie.  Which was a shock cause I thought I was watching cartoons, but stalkyr told me It was anime.<br />
<br />
I saw Berzerk that was a good anime I think, I just wish they didnt go the demon hell monsters route.  It kinda got wierd then and I didnt understand it anymore.  But I liked how the main character wasnt really part of the main story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&amp;lt;b&gt;Midori No Hibi&amp;lt;/b&gt; - Recommended to this anime from a post here several months ago, I found it to my liking. It's a romance comedy anime about a guy who wakes up and finds a girl attached to his hand. If you're having trouble picturing this, think of a guy with a hand puppet permanently attached. He's a delinquint fighter known for his &quot;Devil's right hand&quot; which has now become a girl. He is forced to live with this girl, who is madly in love with him, and try and find a way to get her off his hand. It's very cute and the ending is quite touching. 13 Episodes long, shouldn't be too hard to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Midori no Hibi - Yeah I enjoyed the series too. I am eagerly awaiting Snoopycool to finish his translation of the final chapters of the Manga. He's been holding back on Midori and Ippo, but I won't complain. Having been reading the manga, I had hoped the series was 26 episodes, but it was crammed so badly that I could not help but having a nagging feeling that this anime falls short of my expectations.<br />
<br />
It is licensed, by the way, for those who might rather pick it up on R1 DVD's when it arrives. It's not on my must buy list, because I've been broke for a while now. But I probably will pick this up as a boxset it will no doubt come as.<br />
<br />
Kodomo no Omocha - Any chance anyone knows the release date of this anime for R1? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

how is AOI sub ? as good as LE ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yare yare~~ I was about to ask why we didn't have an anime forum just now, too. Was the whole reason I logged on, actually. Ah well.  :hmph <br />
<br />
Lessee, I've watched so much recently, let's see what stuck in my head. Some descriptions may be a bit.... dry. Gomen :oops <br />
<br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess: Poor Pacifica. Before she was born, the main oracle of the world's religion prophises that the girl born to the queen, is the poison that will destroy the world upon her 16th birthday. So, right off the bat, they attempt to kill her. They fail. Now this 15 year old girl, hunted by everyone old enough to comprehend the story, tries to simply survive just a few more months. Will she ever reach her birthday? With time ticking away, the hunt for her becomes more and more intense. And if she does survive, what if the legend just happens to be true?<br />
Kay, I loved this anime. I'm talking totally bats#$t crazy for it. High production values, great story and characters, and the main badass swordsman's name is Shannon. This is on my little .txt file of anime i will buy no matter what when i see it in a store.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gunslinger Girl: I posted a thread about it awhile back, go HERE (http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=14133&amp;amp;highlight=) to read.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultra Maniac: Magic school girl anime with a twist: the main character is HORRIBLE at being a magic girl. Funny and cute, great to watch when ya just wanna relax.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien: Starts out like a typical highscool anime. Then everything you think you know is tossed right out the window, and we get to see what happens when something terrible happens to someone, and the effect on those around them. I found myself thinking better of it after i watched it, as I thought more and more about the story.  It's a drama, and very well played.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ningyo no Mori: Dude eats mermaid's flesh, and becomes immortal. woohoo. Only bad part is, everyone he ever loves dies of old age. Desperate to die a natural death, he seeks a cure, only to stumble upon someone who has had the same curse forced upon her...<br />
<br />
<br />
Chrno Crusade (Chrono in the NA release): Buxom nun and kickass demon fight evil. Uh huh. Only thing is, everytime Chrno uses his powers, he quite literally shortens Rosette's lifespan. Add in that his former comrades are attempting to overthrown the balance of heaven and hell, and subvert rosette's brother to their cause, and you get an anime that goes from ordinary to straight up JACKED. In a good way, mind you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stellvia: Imagine your typical 'coming of age' story set in space, complete with impending apocalypse. Now imagine an anime that pulls it off with style, and this is what you get. Take impressive character interaction, add top-notch CG mechanical designs, and it reminds me kind of a kiddy looking GiTS:SAC. But in a good way. Another one i'm going to but soon as the entire set is released.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tsukihime: Our main character sees things. No, not dead people. He sees the little lines that hold everything together. With one little flick of a knife, he can cut anything to bits, using those lines. No imagine his utter horror to learn that the girl he just chopped up is a vampire, and shes PISSED about being killed. .....again. Granted, she's intrigued as hell to know how he did it, and has her own agenda regarding those abilities. Moody atmosphere, but not as much character development as I would have hoped. Series is way too damned short! Still worth a look if you are looking for something a bit different.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kanon: One of those names in anime you begin to hear if you hang around long enough. The story of a guy that moves back to his hometown, with few memories of his childhood. As he meets the girls from his past, he is confronted with what happened all that time ago. This anime damn near made me cry. It's that awesome. Watch it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Da Capo: Guy and sister living together, not related by blood and they are kinda on the verge of romance. Then a girl from the past shows up, totally unchanged after all those years... It seems peoples desires are being granted, but at what cost? Similar romantic style to Kanon, with the benefit of having some of the weirdest storylines involving a humanoid black cat. Check it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
...oh wow I think this is one of the biggest posts I've ever made.. I'm going to sleep now. Gnite~ :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amazing series, me and a buddy watched the entire thing without taking a break, talk about tunnel vision  :blink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-28-04, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last Exile i think it was called, great show from the 3 episodes i watched of it <br />
<br />
Last Exile is a wonderful masterpiece from Gonzo. I own the whole series on DVD. I would highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
how is AOI sub ? as good as LE ?<br />
<br />
Not really a fair question seeing as how Tofusensei is an amazing translator, but the subs were sastifactory. The video quality was worse, likely due to not having as good of a source.<br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess - I enjoyed Scrapped Princess, but the plot got dry at times. I am definitely picking up a boxset, however. The art is wonderful.<br />
<br />
Gunslinger Girl - Kinda been talked about alot already, but it's an amazing anime. I have a poster of two of the Gunslinger Girls in my room. Very moe~.<br />
<br />
Kimi ga Nozomu Eien - If you enjoyed the series, I would recommend sending G-Collections an email telling how much you enjoyed the series and that you would be interested in purchasing it, if it would happen to get licensed. The Ero-game is wonderful. Akane is very cute in it, if you go the right routes.<br />
<br />
Tsukihime - Called Lunar Legend Tsukihime in the USA. I loved the Ero-game of this, you could also e-mail G-Collections about it too. It has a sequel, &quot;Melty Blood&quot; which is a fighting game. I haven't picked it up yet. The Tsukihime series is a big hit among a certain otaku subculture. I have some figurines from the series.<br />
<br />
Kanon - Notice a running trend yet? Kanon is yet another Ero-game based anime, and I loved the Ero-game, so naturally I went to watch the Anime. It was pretty well done for an anime, but I disliked Kazehana. But it's really nothing special, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Da Capo- Another  Ero-game I played, so naturally watched the anime. I honestly thought that the anime was utter crap. This and Kanon are really hit or miss, it seems. I watched all of it only out of nostilaga, but felt it was time better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Fullmetal Alchemist- Funimation is doing the DVD's, and they are a good company (discregarding the Dragonball franchise). I would hope that all of you are picking up the DVD's. This is a title that deserves to be a smash hit in the US. I am most certainly picking the whole series up.</div></div><hr />

Its Takahashi so its good. :p<br />
<br />
Yes the major is still in GitS:SAC.  People have said it happens in a parallel timeline to the first movie.  Not really much of a fan of that description.<br />
<br />
Kaliedo Star - This is a really touching anime.  Ive only seen the first season so far but im waiting for the second that looks to be just as good.  Its really something to give you varied emotions from sad to happy as Sora goes through her trials.</div></div><hr />

I personally am upset by this decision, but it does not really affect me. Gankutsuou and Genshiken are still being fansubbed, so I am happy.<br />
<br />
Same basic plot as Reign The Conqueror, <br />
<br />
People watch Reign the Conqueror? :p Sorry, just had to.<br />
<br />
but im waiting for the second that looks to be just as good.<br />
<br />
You will be happy to hear that there is an OVA in the making. I am looking forward to it. With luck, the OVA will be released on a standalone DVD, which fortunately means much higher quality video to do the series justice.<br />
<br />
Ningyo no Mori - &quot;Mermaid Forest&quot; by Takahashi is part of the &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot; that is currently available. They are being rereleased.<br />
Its Takahashi so its good. <br />
<br />
Just a side note to those who might be confused, the first part of the Saga is Rumic Theater on the fansubs, not sure what it is on DVD.<br />
<br />
Chrno Cruscade - I wouldn't recommend it, but it fills a niche. Beware Bridget, however. Unless you're into that.  :blink <br />
<br />
Howl's Moving Castle - I truly enjoyed this recent Studio Ghibli film, and highly recommend anyone to see it when it's released in the states. While on the topic of Ghibli, be sure to pick up Poroco Rosso, My Neighbor Totoro (new release, not old one), and Nausicaa when they are released finally. (January, I believe).<br />
<br />
Wolf's Rain - You heard correct.<br />
<br />
Excel Saga  - All I have to say about this anime is...<br />
From that day I noticed<br />
the reason that you became close<br />
was that the tenderness of my body was to your liking<br />
How does this body reflect in those eyes enduring hunger?<br />
If you eat me now, instantly, so that the meat does not become tough.<br />
<br />
In your embracing arms, if you come holding tightly, the painful<br />
salt and pepper of the kitchen, the shining dull blade, it's so hateful<br />
More than tomorrow's dreams, this body is suited more for oil.<br />
From that day when I noticed, <br />
that there is no reason for this cursed fate.<br />
<br />
No! Really No! Life is precious!<br />
Please! Stop and think! Do you have no love for animals in your heart!?<br />
But now, I'm just right for eating.<br />
<br />
But no! Please no pain! No heat!<br />
But cook me to the centre, <br />
Don't just eat me raw!<br />
<br />
What are you saying?<br />
But honestly don't!  &quot;If you want to escape, escape then&quot;<br />
you say!?  You need to add more cabbage<br />
<br />
OW! OW! OW! HOT! HOT! HOT!<br />
There's no medium thick sauce!? NO!!<br />
DON'T EAT ME!<br />
But, you're going to deliciously eat me? GOD NO!<br />
<br />
If you eat me now, do it quick, so that the meat does not become tough.<br />
<br />
 :heart</div></div><hr />

<br />
For instance, when I was still in school, I was able to watch approx. 30-40 hours of anime per week. But now, I am only keeping up with 19 series (not all are released weekly, some once per 2-4 weeks) which amounts to a mere 6-8 hours in comparision.</div></div><hr />

Somebody please explain to me what the hell happend at the end of Wolfs Rain... PLEASE. I watched it... twice and i still dont get it.<br />
<br />
going to spoiler tag it for those who don't want to know<br />
<br />
[spoiler:fa2b1838fb]They find paradise.... just not the kind they were thinking they would find.  <br />
<br />
 They all fight Darcia and die, except for Kiba who kills him.  Then Cheza blooms, being the flower child and all, and spreads her seeds. The snow turns to rain and the moon turns to a normal color instead of being a blood moon symbolizing  the rebirth of paradise on earth... Kiba lays down on the ice loosing consciousness from all his wounds from fighting Darcia and the warm rain melts the ice and he sinks into the depths of the water.   Then Darcia's wolf eye melts into the world turning part of it dark.. symbolizing that paradise is tainted<br />
<br />
The last scene is a fast forward to the future of the reborn paradise, everyone is there again, the single lunar flower calling to Kiba starting it all over again. [/spoiler:fa2b1838fb]<br />
<br />
at least thats how i got it...</div></div><hr />

I think End of Evangelion technically comes between 24 and 25, and Death and Rebirth is just a retelling of the more coherent parts of the entire series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">12-29-04, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excel Saga should be watched last, as it is a parody anime so, the more anime you watch, the more you will understand, and find funny. The first time I watched it, I thought it was moderately funny, but the second time I watched it (a few months ago) I thought I was going to bust a rib.<br />
<br />
It really doesn't matter when Evangelion should be watched, so watch 1-26, End of Evangelion, then Death and Rebirth. That's how it was released, anyway.<br />
<br />
Shirase is funny and short, Scrapped Princess is high quality animation and a decent story, Chrno Cruscade is mildly entertaining, Flame of Recca is your typical shonen (Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, etc).<br />
<br />
That about sums it up. Many American viewers seem stunned by this, so I'll answer the question about Shirase in advance: yes, he has a lolita complex.</div></div><hr />

Just be glad I don't have my Japanese language pack reinstalled; else, I'd hit all the anime elitist notes!<br />
<br />
NOTE:  Some of these descriptions may have minor spoilers.  I can't help myself.<br />
<br />
Paranoia Agent Mousou Dairinin<br />
Watch this series.  It's thirteen episodes long with the first set of four episodes already released on US soil.  Directed by Satoshi Kon, the same guy who made Millennium Actress, Perfect Blue, and Tokyo Godfathers, the influence is obvious.  A young boy is attacking people, leaving the cops baffled.  However, a pattern comes out soon enough.  On a side-note, Shounen Bat has to be one of the most creepy-looking anime characters ever.  Stick your giant robots, extraplanar demons, and insect-inspired aliens.  Gimme a kid on roller skates with a bent golden bat and a psychotic smile any day.<br />
<br />
FLCL (Furi Kuri, Foolly Coolly, etc.)<br />
If there is an afterlife, they better let me bring my anime.  If not, I'm possessing a Japanese kid and watching this show for the rest of my (un)life.  Some love it, some hate it.  Don't dive into this anime immediately; enjoy it and let it suck you in.  Only in this way will you find meaning.  Wonderful soundtrack by the pillows, an otherworldy Vespa woman, and a robot that cooks, kicks ass, and flies.<br />
<br />
Full Metal Alchemist Hagane no Renkinjutsushi<br />
What can I say that hasn't already been said?  The series is amazing.  Excellent visuals, fine casting, and an adored main character.  If you've never watched it, start ... NOW!  If you have, take a look at the first and last episodes one more time and realize how far the anime went.<br />
<br />
BECK<br />
I love music.  I love anime.  I'd sell a loved one's body parts for more musical anime.  That's that.<br />
<br />
FLCL<br />
It's no mistake.  I love this show.  Six episodes of goodness.  And I've listened to Carnival by the pillows for about forty-five minutes straight now.<br />
<br />
Bleach<br />
Yea, yea.  It's straight from Shonen Jump.  I should be wrinkling my pig-like nose and poo-pooing this anime until my head explodes, but it's fun.  It's not exactly new or amazing, yet it's enjoyable.  A brooding high-schooler (never seen one of those in anime!) becomes an angel of death fighting &quot;evil&quot; spirits all while balancing a batshit insane father, the memories of his dead mother, and a high schooler's typical concerns.  It's not deep, it's not cutting-edge, but it does have a talking stuffed lion.  And for that, I give Bleach my approval.<br />
<br />
Hellsing<br />
The first anime set I ever actually bought.  THEN I got into the manga.  Don't get me wrong, I love the series.  Those books, though.  If they don't start releasing any faster, I'm going to have to just start ordering them from Japan and stammering my stupid way through them.  Either that or storm into Hirano-san's studio and hold him at bayonetpoint.  So many great fights, the most badass anime character ever (Friend of mine tried to argue that ... Logan(?) from Priest was the most badass manga character ever.  The fact that Priest is actually manhwa notwithstanding, I showed him the series and gave him my manga.  A couple of days later, he came back, handed me my stuff, and said, &quot;Alucard.  No question.&quot;  Then he said, &quot;But what about Vash the Sta--  Nah, Alucard.&quot;  'Nuff said.), and plenty of gunfighting.  Alexander Anderson's voice actor (Nachi Nozawa) gives the character one of the best laughs I have ever heard.  You'll laugh, you'll cringe, but most importantly, you will be afraid.<br />
<br />
Samurai Champloo<br />
If for no other reason, I have looked forward to January so that this series would start airing again.  They stopped airing for a couple of months, and I thought I would go berserk.  Slick visuals, Watanabe-and-crew style, and Kazuya Nakai as the voice of Mugen (also voice of Zoro in One Piece).  Side-note: Anyone who has or is studying Japanese should watch episode six.  ANYONE who has taken the language knows someone who at one time spoke like Issac.  If you don't, it's probably you, so pick up that book and start learning formal style.<br />
<br />
And that ends the in-depth portion.  Of course, if you get the chance, there is a TON of great anime out there.  A lot of it has been mentioned here.  Just watch a couple of episodes of something and, if you don't like it, find something else.  Anime is not a genre of media.  There's something out there for practically anyone.<br />
<br />
Oh, and a quick question for anyone who has seen it: Do you prefer Cowboy Bebop in English or Japanese?  It is one of the few series that I have heard hardcore anime fans watching in English by personal preference.  I used to think that way, but I went back and watched in Japanese.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure.  Though Megumi Hayashibara's voice may have a bit do to with that ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-02-05, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paranioa Agent - I loved this series. It is really creepy. Currently collecting the DVD's.<br />
<br />
FLCL - Ha, you mentioned it twice. But confusing as this was, I loved it. <br />
<br />
Bleach - Well, not really related to Bleach in particular, but I am getting to be pretty amused at the horde of anime &quot;elitists&quot; or those that consider themselves otaku, who renounce Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, or just about anything Shonen Jump.<br />
<br />
It is completely illogical. Certainly, they are the very definition of an Anime stereotype, but who cares? They are good anime. It's one thing to hate the fans that follow those series, but a whole another to hate the anime itself as a result.<br />
<br />
For one thing, it is highly unlikely there is an American that can be considered &quot;otaku.&quot; Not that one should strive to be such. John of Animenation, and two other guys from different web sites that I don't recall off-hand, are probably the closest thing to an &quot;American Otaku.&quot;<br />
<br />
Such is how high the bar is for the rest of us. We have a crapload of things going against us in becoming &quot;Otaku.&quot; First, the lack of access to information. Second, the lack of variety. Third, the lack of Doujinshi. These among many others.<br />
<br />
Plenty of people tout themselves as something of an Anime expert, having seen many of the underground hits. Who cares about that? The amount of series, how large of a collection you have, are not indicators of &quot;otaku.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's just a minor rant of mine when reading some forums, such as Animesuki and Animenation ones. I personally dislike it when people call me Otaku.<br />
<br />
There is a decent discussion going on in Animenation with a well-known Japanese person regarding &quot;Otaku.&quot; It is a good read. Lots of false and stupid information in it, though. And Windwaker's lack of english skills makes it all the more difficult to understand.<br />
<br />
Genshiken can humble the most self-proclaimed of American Otaku, and it's not even about true Otaku themselves.<br />
<br />
I really went off on a rant here. D'oh. It's not targeted at you Idiot Neutral, just reminded me that I have the need to rant about it again.<br />
<br />
Hellsing - I liked the series and the Manga, but it's not really my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
Samurai Champloo - I enjoyed this series. Seeing as how it's directed by the same person who did Cowboy Bebop, the anime naturally was &quot;all style no substance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genshiken // Kujabiki Unbalance - Ep. 9 Spoiler<br />
<br />
[spoiler:b27c1cec59]I think I might have peed my pants laughing at this episode. Nose hair.... is it a nose hair.... what should I do.....????! :D<br />
<br />
I also had a chance to watch the first episode of Kujabiki Unbalance, courtesy of a friend of mine who bought the R2 DVD. Great show.[/spoiler:b27c1cec59]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idiot Neutral</div><div class="date">01-03-05, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with that, Stalkyr.  There's absolutely no reason to unfairly hate any particular publisher or, hell, even genre of anime or manga.  That's why I watch Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, and other &quot;popular&quot; anime and care less what people say about they being below my &quot;standards&quot; or somesuch nonsense.  Not liking a genre is fine, but classifying people by genre is foolish.  It's just like elitists in every art field who like only obscure artists and naysay anything remotely popular regardless of artistic merit.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention Monster when mentioning anime.  I watched some of the series, fell off the wagon, and am watching again.  Still loving it.<br />
<br />
And yes, I meant to mention FLCL twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been watching Last Exile again (this time, on the R1 DVD's I own). The series is as enjoyable as I remember. Now that I have a high quality version, I was able to also take some time to appreciate how high quality the art in Last Exile is.<br />
<br />
For instance, I would re-watch the scene where Dio playfully says to Alvis, &quot;What lies beyond the furthest reaches of the sky?&quot; And Alvis has a extreme reaction to it. &quot;That which leads the lost child back to it's mother.... Exile!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sends chills down my spine.</div></div><hr />

Have you seen Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi?  That's what I'd compare it to.  Fooly Cooly is a little less parody, a little more surreal, and the characters are very different (Haruko hits people with a guitar, Arumi has a remarkably solid paper fan.  Completely different), but they have a number of similarities, especially in the comedic pacing and flexible animation style.</div></div><hr />

It's simply amazing. It's one of a kind, and a very moving story. The first few episodes start off slow and confusing, but once you get near the end it all makes sense and you realize what an awesome piece of art it is. This anime didn't damn near make me cry, it made me flat out bawl. I highly recommend it, especially if you like romance.</div></div><hr />

Episode 37 turns this series from a great series, to a 'OMFG GET THIS NOW OR YOU WILL REGRET IT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE' series. Probably the best anime episode ever created. Heck even if you find this type of anime boring, bear with it till then just to see the sheer genious behind the writing.<br />
<br />
Also if you haven't taken a look at AIR, you should do so. It's another hentai-type game anime like Kanon, but the animation is about the best you will ever see from a TV series. Great atmosphere; it's one of those animes where many will be turned off due to the origin, but just style alone will make people tune in to this anime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oy, that was a beauitful series, I loved it to tears.  Its saddening that there probably won't be anything else after the movie is released.<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend anything similar to it in terms of story, humor, and character quality?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-26-05, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's hard to say, &quot;something like it&quot; when referring to Fullmetal Alchemist. It is one of the anime that's around the very top in terms of &quot;greatest anime&quot; so to speak.<br />
<br />
You will be happy to know that the Fullmetal Alchemist manga is very different from the anime. It is coming to the US soon. I personally picked up the Fullmetal Alchemist Starter kit which comes with the first DVD, manga, and an awesome metal case.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently, I forgot to recommend stuff. Some similar anime could be Naruto and One Piece. Fullmetal Alchemist is a Shonen manga/anime, so while you will be hard pressed to find anything &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as good as&quot; Fullmetal Alchemist, you can find a lot of simlar anime fundamentally. Shaman King is also a shonen, Hikaru no Go is very interesting, Rurouni Kenshin, etc etc. Those are older stuff, more current stuff is easily found on your favorite fansub site.<br />
<br />
Just look in Animesuki forums in Suggestions, type in Shonen / Shounen or Fullmetal Alchemist and you'll find a lot of recommendations.<br />
<br />
EDIT END//<br />
<br />
While the 36 and 37 episode of Monster is great, I am personally looking forward to a few more events that I am sure to enjoy far more than these. Not going to spoil anything, though. It continues to be an excellent anime.<br />
<br />
As for AIR, I would be hesistant to refer it as high quality animation. There are a lot of points where the animation just goes nuts, blurry, or gets a impersonation of a van gogh drawing.<br />
<br />
It is decent, though. AIR eroge was an excellent game which I enjoyed. A lot of people get turned off from ero-games due to what it is perceived as here in America, with all the image boards (#chan) and what G-Collections and Peach Princess released.<br />
<br />
However, Crescendo and Kana ~Imoto~ were much closer to the eroge that have been turned into Anime (Kiminozo, Tsukihime, Air, Kanon, Da Capo, etc) but still not quite the same.<br />
<br />
For a good look at a highly popular current eroge, www.insani.org has Fate // Stay Night demo that has been translated. (since it's a demo, there are no nudity in it). They are also translating Tsukihime but you'd be hard pressed to find a copy (I bought mine for no less than $93, BEFORE shipping from Japan). Kanon is also being translated.<br />
<br />
As for the style of AIR, it is about as unstylish as it comes. All they did for the characters is gather a bunch of &quot;moe~&quot; characterics (such as the whole &quot;G...gao&quot; she always says). Where it shines is the story, but I'm afraid it will not be able to express the game very well.</div></div><hr />
