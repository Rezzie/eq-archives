<br />
I am looking for more quests that give you abilities that you will use for the rest of the game life.  For example these 3 I have completed<br />
<br />
1) panther mask (turns me into a panther and gives me +20% runspeed buff)<br />
2) curse of the vampire (I cured and now I have a gay fairy pet that heals me 200 here and there)<br />
3) shadowhound quest (real real real fast)<br />
<br />
Is there any other quests like this?  Thanks!<br />
<br />
Wendell</div></div><hr />

You get it by going to hilsbery manor, and get infected by the curse by taking aggro from the bats, then go to slayer camp near the manor and go to the basement and get the quest.  Its an easy one to collect blood from dead corpses.<br />
<br />
Can you please tell me what the fallen Lyceun quest is about?  where to get it and what to do etc??  And what the pet does as well.</div></div><hr />
