I like to have my characters have the Orlando Bloom look, as does my GF - I had an Elvaan in FFXI which I liked, and I spent most of my EQ time as a dark elf.  Now, WoW is a great game, but....where are the pretty-boys!  The night elves all look like steroid freaks with skin conditions, and the humans, dwarves, and gnomes are all even worse.  The closest thing I've found to a traditional slim character is an undead!  Do all the normal-sized males have to be half as wide as they are tall, and have fugly faces?  I mean, the chicks are all slim and pretty, why can't we have equality?<br />

Lurik isn't a superbuff rogue with massively broad shoulders and he isn't 6'5&quot;...   I think he's gonna end up human just because no other race is remotely close. Lurik Crim`Tal<br />

The huge male avatars are a tad annoying, I /suggested more body types the first day of beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">04-12-04, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed. I've always hated playing buff males. I can't name my guys after people like Gackt or Kamijo and have them be all huge</div></div><hr />

I can't stand it in City of Heroes, so many female costumes are ruined because of the massive breasts imho. I don't want to have to go through that in WoW too :P</div></div><hr />

Is funny, I dislike that, you dislke this, why don't they wise up and give us options for both?</div></div><hr />
