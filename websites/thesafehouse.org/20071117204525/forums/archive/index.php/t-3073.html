<br />
Thanks, retkin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">06-10-03, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, first off it depends on whether or not you want to wait until july (or is it august) for the 3.5 books to be released, or just go splurge on stuff now. personally, I recommend waiting the month or so to get the new updated books.<br />
<br />
anyways, the first three you'll want are the 3rd (or 3.5 revised) edition player's handbook, dungeon master's guide, and monstrous manual; the core books.<br />
<br />
with those alone, you can play to your heart's content.<br />
<br />
if you want to go beyond that, there're lots of other books out. if you want to play in a pre-made campaign setting, consider the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting or the Dragonlance setting coming out this fall. if you want more of a horror based world, try the Ravenloft campaign setting. on top of these books, there are addons (such as Magic of Faerun, which is a very good book even if you're not playing in the FRCS).<br />
<br />
these campaign setting books all have campaign specific feats, prestige classes, spells, items, etc. but, even so, you can use *most* in your own homemade worlds if you want.<br />
<br />
for class based books, you have Sword &amp;amp; Fist (fighters/monks), Tome &amp;amp; Blood (sorcs/mages), Song &amp;amp; Silence (bards/rogues), Defenders of the Faith (clerics/paladins), and Masters of the wild (barb/druid/ranger). these basically give feats and prestige classes, as well as general guides &amp;amp; advice on playing the classes. they vary in usefulness, however.<br />
<br />
also for class-based stuff, I *highly* recommend monte cook's Books of Eldritch Might 1 &amp;amp; 2, and the Book of Hallowed Might. these books provide lots of new spells, feats, items, and prestige classes for sorcerers, bards, clerics, paladins, and rangers. very good series. you can get all of them on pdf for around $7 at monte's website here.<br />
<br />
then there's the Epic Level Handbook, which details how to continue a character past 20th level. I haven't used it, however, and am not sure how it will work with the revised rules.<br />
<br />
for pre-made adventures, I'd suggest Bastion of Broken Souls for starting out, and maybe Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil if you want to wait until around 7th-8th level before using a pre-made.<br />
<br />
anyways, there's a good starting list. I would personally go with the three core books (and wait for revised next month if possible), for a session or two, and then see how things pan out. after that, maybe go for some of the class books if you don't want to worry about playing in an official campaign setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also about 1/2 through the Ghostwalk book ... I like it bunches.  Seems like it would be fun to add onto any existing campaign.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah when sean first started talking about ghostwalk on his and monte's boards, it sounded really damn cool. yet another setting I'd love to try out if my group actually gamed heh  <br />
<br />
I reeeeeally wanna get everyone together when arcana unearthed comes out, though.</div></div><hr />
