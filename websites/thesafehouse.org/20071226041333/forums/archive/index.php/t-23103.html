It's not great, but the older episodes are alot better than the newer ones, now that I've finally seen them.</div></div><hr />

You've only seen newer episodes!  Yeah, they get worse and worse--more reliance on Mooninites and ****ty gags, etc.  The good dialogue is in the first two or three seasons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">02-28-06, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like their current lineup.  FMA, Bebop, Champloo, GitS are all awsome shows.  I'm really enjoying Lupin too even though the thing is 30 years old.  And s-cry-ed and Inuyasha aren't too bad either.  Only I think s-cry-ed has way too few episodes to be showing it 4 times a week.  It's repeated twice just since I've been watching it.<br />

The only anime I really dislike so far is EVA, cause EVA is for kweers!</div></div><hr />

According to the interview anime doesn't do well in the ratings since most are episodic so they stick with comedy stand alone shows. This is probably how crap like Tom Goes to the Mayor stays on since I'm guessing its super cheap to produce. It sure looks like **** and so is the humor.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I believe CN has gone on record as saying they would never show that series. Yet they'll make another season of 12oz mouse and Tom goes to the Mayor! (wtf)<br />
 <br />
I smirked at the 'subtitle' question. The answer got a laugh. 'it just didnt work out'. yeah, BS, someone from the top said that you wouldnt get ratings and forced the idea to be dropped, don't be a bitch and lie. There's plenty of people that would watch a GOOD series subtitled, not just any random anime that you import cause it's cheap. They'll put the most retarded BS on the air cause it's cheap, but they won't show subtitled anime. I lose my faith in Cartoon Network more and more every day.</div></div><hr />

I guess but i just wish they would try showing some better off the wall kind of anime like they did with paranoia agent...<br />
<br />
And Im pissed they never show the Inuyasha openings...some of em are good =(.</div></div><hr />

Same here. No idea why, a friend turned me on to it and I watch it whenever I've got the tube on at that hour.</div></div><hr />

I lose my faith in Cartoon Network more and more every day.Sorry, I'm as much of an anime dork as the next guy(unless the next guy is Len), but even I realize that subtitled anime just isn't gonna do well.  Sure, *I* like it more, and so would most people if they gave it a shot, but the fact is, nobody is gonna give it a shot.  Their audience is mostly stoners and other various collegiates.  Those people DON'T want to ******* read.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. Me and a friend have this theory worked out that Lupin and Gramps are really the same person, even though it's physically impossible. Like that split personality episode of X-files. (I do believe that is a bronze at the geek olympics).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantium</div><div class="date">03-01-06, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only anime I watch regularly over there is Zatch Bell and Champloo.  I'll leave Naruto and One Piece on, but more as background noise than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ponzi</div><div class="date">03-01-06, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zatch Bell?! How can you sleep at night without having nightmares of those hideous doll monsters?</div></div><hr />

That's like saying you LIKE the Pokemon cartoon.</div></div><hr />

Haha, that's awesome.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people lost that faith when CN gave up on cartoons and started showing non-animated movies.</div></div><hr />
