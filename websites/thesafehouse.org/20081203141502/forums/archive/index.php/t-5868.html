I don't call 6 hours notice &quot;scheduled.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Must have been something pretty extreme, all we got was a few &quot;Server coming down NOW!!!! Please log off!&quot; type of messages.<br />
<br />
Probably less than a few minutes from first message before server was locked. <br />

<br />
A few instances I was just standing there and BOOM!  LD.  No spells or anything.  I know that the Cleric, Monk and myself were having a VERY hard time staying connected (I think I went LD and crashed to desktop about 6-8 times in 4 hours).<br />
<br />
I hope that's what Verant is fixing.<br />
