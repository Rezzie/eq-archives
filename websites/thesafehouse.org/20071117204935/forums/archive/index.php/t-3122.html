<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Snibbs Quickinshot</div><div class="date">10-02-03, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm starting a campaign that'll play out like a samurai novel and is based in ancient japan. I'm trying to keep a bit of historical accuracy with fun stuff thrown in of course. Pretty much just looking for any advice anyone might have on a campaign setting such as this. I plan to use a combination of rules taken from Call of Cthulhu d20 (because I love the idea of insanity points and whatnot), DnD 3rd ed., Oriental Adventures and BESM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;mouth moves for several seconds&amp;lt; &quot;hi&quot; &gt;mouth keeps moving for a few more seconds&amp;lt;  <br />
<br />
I'd also think it would be an interesting campaign thingie to have the oriental setting having to deal with the slow but inexorable arrival of not-so-oriental forces in the area...<br />

Have Manshoon turn into a drug baron. wee!<br />

<br />
the rules are great for the lethal nature of combat (not too many people can take a good hit from a guy with a tetsubo), and the various Clan Schools can be easily adapted to represent family/whatever schools in japan.<br />
<br />
the system flows very well and captures the feel perfectly.</div></div><hr />

It can be cyber punk, shadowrun, hackmaster or D&amp;amp;D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">10-03-03, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find the Tomoe Gozen novels.  Great examples of mostly realistic samurai, with some magic and myth thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Snibbs Quickinshot</div><div class="date">10-03-03, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I've read all of the Tomoe Gozen novels and alot of Jessica Amanda Salmonson's other works, that's where I got the idea of running a samurai campaign. I do plan to base alot of the storyline on stuff from those books and I'd like to have the campaign flow the same, but flow depends more on the players.</div></div><hr />
