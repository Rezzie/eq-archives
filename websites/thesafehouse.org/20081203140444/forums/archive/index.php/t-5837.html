<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HinterDir</div><div class="date">07-30-01, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">about 170 of the best man and woman of mostly german Guilds gathered in the Great Divide the past 5 hours to complete the 10th Coldain Ring Quest for the second time. The first time the war was fought, the zone crashed the moment Narandil fell. No Loot, no Ring, no help from VI officials.<br />
<br />
This time all went smooth.<br />
All waves were defeated, Narandil got kitet a few minutes to assemble the armies for the final battle. <br />
about 1/3 LD during the fight but yet and behold, the gods were with us.<br />
The Quester was not in the group that got the kill. so we had to wait a few minutes. <br />
Over the time of the quest we constantly asked people to leave the zone that were not involved to reduce lag and safe them from death. Most people understood and did what they were ask. Still the flow of those people was constant.<br />
When the time had past for Snacke to loot the questitem..<br />
well he could not. <br />
Someone is already looting that corpse.<br />
about 4 or 5 people did look into that corpse, bevor Snacke was able to do so.<br />
<br />
with the last one standing up.. poof!<br />
<br />
Now, anyone of those could have looted the head, there was more in the corpse (Velium Warlance or something with it´s look at least)<br />
<br />
G*O*D DAMNIT PEOPLE! CAN THERE BE SUCH A MORON TO ACTUALY NINJALOOT THE ITEM FOR THE BIGGEST OF QUESTS THERE IS?<br />
<br />
now, everything could have been put right as i understand that there could have been a way to multiquest it to still give the reward to the right person. Of Course, whoever did it, did not walk up.<br />
<br />
3 Guides came, Keplar among them to sort out what happened. There was nothing that they could do at that moment sincer there was no GM on. There will be an investigation about this, but it may last a few days.<br />
<br />
I really hope justice will be done...<br />
and trust me, all 170 people present agree on how that justice should look like.<br />
<br />
This is not a rant, this is just to inform you about what happened.<br />
We did not mess up anything on that battle that would have resulted in failure of the quest.<br />
Nothing went wrong on the part of Verrant that would have resulted in failure of the quest.<br />
 ONE man or woman, ninjalooting the questitem, after 170 people out of 8 German guilds worked together for 4 and a half hour, to finish an epic battle, resulted in the failure of the quest.<br />
<br />
This day is so sad, i can not even describe it.<br />
<br />
I hope the admins do understand and leave the post as written even though there are words in it that would normaly get edited out.<br />
Thank you for listening. <br />

<br />
I send my best to your questor..<br />
My guess is Verant will maekthis right. They know who has it, just takes some work to track it down.<br />
<br />
Keep us up to speed please..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Whornsaan</div><div class="date">07-30-01, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... that the one &quot;looted by mistake&quot; was tracked down by officials. Also VI did great and helped our beloved Snacke to gain her final award.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who participated and made this quest solved. =)<br />

Maybe I can loot it!!&quot;  It seems you get these little punks whenever you kill a sand giant in the Oasis or back when you used to kill guards in Freeport or Steamfont you'd get the crowd of newbies trying to speed right-click on the corpse.<br />
<br />
Gratz on your ring! Good to see Verant did the right thing   -=Aldelbert Stiener=--=59th Backscratcher Half-Elf=--=Based in Xegony=-</div></div><hr />
