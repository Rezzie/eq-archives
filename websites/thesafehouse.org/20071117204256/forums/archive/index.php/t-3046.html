<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd once again appreciate the advice of you DMs out there. <br />
As I've said before, I'm really rusty in my DMing, and have ran 2 sessions of a Ravenloft Mod for some friends. Things are going well, when I don't flub things by not being 100% familiar with the material.<br />
<br />
By sessions end, I'm pretty wasted, so when I'm awarding exp., I tend to do it less than &quot;professionally&quot;. i.e. I'll compute the exp. for the group for monsters, gold, and hand that out. Then I'll ask for their spell lists...rogue skills list...individual kills list...and I'll award xp with notes from that....but, this leaves players going, &quot;what about roleplay exp?&quot;. Now, granted, I'm still drying my wings out in the DMing aspect, and I don't do good things like, writing down stuff immediately when it catches my intrest, a PC action ect.... <br />
<br />
But I got into a discussion with my players about WHAT really constitutes getting experience from me as a DM for roleplaying. One of my players(the one with the actual gripe) stated that he didn't feel I was giving out xp for people &quot;properly roleplaying their characters&quot;. The example, he never plays rogues, but in this mod, he did. Typically he plays the scholar, the knight, the samurai, all high concept classes, and he does those well. This time, he wanted to be the sneaky dude, the thief, the money grubber. And he did it, although at the end of the session, I failed to realize part of that. For example, he NEVER says &quot;I'll check the bodies!&quot; but this time around, those were the first words out of his mouth after combat, which is what you expect of the rogue. He DN/FTRT every door we came to without fail, and even offered to scale the castle walls at 8 climbing checks. <br />
<br />
Now, he wants xp for &quot;playing his role&quot;. While I agree that he did indeed do that, does it sound like the kind of behavior that warrants xp? I'm of the mindset, PCs earn xp by wowing me the DM with their ingenuity. Good ideas, quick thinking, hitting the nail on the head when solving my mysteries. That warrants bonus roleplay xp.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not oblivious to the other side of roleplay xp by character class. If a paladin makes a huge sacrifice for his faith, if a wizard researches a spell, or a rogue finally tackles this massive merchant's house he's been scoping for months, thats roleplay xp, no doubt about it. But should I reward my pcs for doing the minimum of in character behavior?<br />
<br />
Castles Forlorn isn't a great setting for PCs to act on their personalities. 85% of the realm is abandoned wilderness, the human population numbers about 50 druids, and everything else is monsters, monsters, ghosts, and more monsters. The Mod does provide for some NPC interaction later, but out of the 2 sessions so far, we haven't had much, it really just started at the end of this last session.<br />
<br />
So the point of all this long winded crap is, where do YOU the DM draw the line between rewarding roleplay, and or not? I prefer to err on the side of caution with awarding xp, because I can always give more, but rarely can you take away. What kind of guidelines do you follow when thinking about how to give out xp for roleplay, either active roleplay like problem solving, or passive character roleplay?<br />
<br />

Now I know you are asking where we as DMs stand as far as Roleplay Experience, well, my methods are similar to yours.  <br />
<br />
If the character (PC) really plays his character, I.E. has an intelligence of 5 and is a Barbarian, and he's making all the correct decisions, then he's using Outworldly Knowledge and is not Roleplaying.  Now, if that same character, sits there and talks about wanting to grow his potato farm, and goes into a violent frenzy every time he smells blood, then I would award experience, for him Roleplaying that character.<br />
<br />
If the Rogue just sat there and just &quot;diced&quot; his way through that character, then that's not really Roleplaying.  If he actually acted it out, and truly played his part, then award the experience.<br />
<br />
Now, when I award experience, I don't sit there and calculate the exact experience from each kill.  I keep a list of what was killed and just award a lump sum, depending on what was killed, how many were killed, etc.  Then I award for Roleplaying the character.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's pretty much what I do. Total # of monsters x their xp value / total members in the group.<br />
<br />
I'm talking 2nd ed. D&amp;amp;D here, that's why I do individual experience, like priest getting xp for using magic to further ethos, wizards getting xp for useful spell casting, rogues for successful application of their abilities(i.e. the door actually has to be trapped to get xp FT/RT) and 10% to fighters for killing stuff more or less mono-ie-mono.<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to feel out if I'm being a grinch with my players or not, in terms of awarding xp for roleplaying character, to see if my definition is off or my expectations are too high. 1/2 of it is me being frazzled by the end of a 5 hour session, that much I'm sure of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well personally I hated the 2ed XP awards.  RP XP should be the same regardless of XP chart, otherwise they may argue about how much they got for a task. You take a task that a wizard does and say he gets 100 XP for doing it, Rogue does the same level of thing and gets 100 XP.  For the Wizard thats 10% of his level, for the Rogue its more like 15%.  Why is a Rogue going to get more 'Life Experience' for doing what is natural than a wizard?  Whenever a DM said &quot;Make 5th level characters&quot; to us the Rogue always got screwed.  &quot;I have 25,000 XP, how much do you have?&quot;  &quot;I have 6,000 XP&quot;  (I know those numbers are not correct but its just the point im trying to get across. )  I loved it when the DM said instead &quot;Make a character with 'X' Experience.&quot;  Equal XP for Equal Levels = Good<br />
<br />
Im off topic though, sorry for the mini-rant.<br />
Typically I like to feel out what I think the group should be, i.e. Were they in character at least a basic level.  If they all are in that area then nobody really get any unless they really stand out.  If all but one player in the group is at basic level and the last person is just 'tagging along' then I tend to give the 'basic players' a bit of XP just to give the lazy one some incentive to play along.  Then when he finally does explain that nobody really did anything good to get any bonus RP XP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I did for this campaign, everyone started with 10k xp. Incidentally, if you will notice, Rogues even with Backstab don't hold a candle to any of the other classes in terms of raw power, either through magic, or combat. THATs why their xp charts are smaller. Wizards get 50 xp per spell used. Rogues get 100 xp per power used. Rogues have unlimited uses, wizards do not, but it's the fact rogues NEED that extra xp to have any sort of edge on the other character classes.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
One other thing, the Individual XP awards in 2e are #1 optional(although your players wouldn't advance for poop without them) and #2, they are action oriented. I.e. you don't get them without killing, casting, or picking something. They are completely unrelated to Roleplay xp, which as the DMG states, is completely and utterly up to the discretion of the DM. Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 4/14/03 2:44:13 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they want RP exp, you want Char histories.<br />
<br />
as a player I always have at least some basic background for my characters. Even if it is just the above average dwarf that wanted to see the world or the young elven(oxymoron when you think about it) wizard that studied his missing, but believed to be dead, grandfather's books about magic and found a blank spell book to use for himself.<br />
<br />
now, as a DM, I wouldn't say they would have to be great epic stories for their levels. They could just be some random guy that has a knack for spell craft or swordplay. Also, if you go this way make sure they know to keep it with in reason. No being the a nobles eldest son blah blah blah... unless you wanted something like that to make a mod from  <br />
<br />
and as for RP in general. Doing rogueish things does not an RPer make. Although, something like lifting some ones dagger from their belt, and then using it to hold them up for their gold, well you get the point.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im much more subtle about rewarding players for good roleplaying.  I don't give them experience per say.  Fortune simply smiles on them more.  Mostly in the form of NPC's liking then more, but also in the form of treasure/items.  Other times however, I give the good roleplayers a sort of serindipity.  The badass guard at the castle just happens to be the player's cousin and he owes him a favor.  However, in the same vein, I punish players who act out of character.<br />
I usually give a disclaimer that I do that before the game starts, but players still dont always notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-15-03, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a limit to playing in character in my opinion however.  A player in a group I play in got the party into repeated trouble, Myself (Being Neutral Druid Type) and another (Being Chaotic Neutral) left him be when he stuck his hand into an ooze after I told him not to.  (Curiosity)  Immediatly got engulfed.<br />
I left him be because &quot;Nature filters its own&quot;, the other left him be because he was rather upset at him to begin with.<br />
The third and fourth tried to help him out, One was a chaotic good character that was only helping because it was the right thing to do.  Other was a good cleric.<br />
So the two of them get the fellow out of the ooze minus his stuff. (all floating in the ooze now)   What does he do but pick up a rusty longsword we left laying in the hall and goes to get his stuff back.<br />
This time even the chaotic good character stood there and watched.  The cleric was helping anyway due to RP.<br />
<br />
How this affects this conversation.  We were about to close the door but instead this one &quot;Curious&quot; fellow could have possibly erased the whole party from existance because he wouldent listen to &quot;Wait, its alive.&quot; (He's supposed to have common sense as well in his personality description)<br />
End Result, Critical Hit and he killed the thing. (Was already abit weak from the previous extraction)  Then he finds a Legendary Major Magic Weapon in the back of the room, the GM is infamous for not handing out magic items.     Hoping for +1 weapon each by the time you reach 10th kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Basiclly the group tried to use this example as a &quot;Lesson&quot; to the 'cat' but it turned around and became extreamely rewarding because the group didnt help.  Ill admit it is possible that the GM is trying to turn around that reputation but I doubt it because the whole reason were in the dungeon is because some thief stole the only magic item in the party and we were chasing after it, which was in this characters possesion BTW.  No I dont think the two events are related.  (The item was the biggest bag of holding and the character had put nearly all his posessions in it before it was taken.)<br />
<br />
Oh, did I mention we're 6th level.<br />
<br />
Do I think the 'cat' shouldent have gotten squat after loosing all of his cloth/light-leather/paper posessions even though he took the creature on one-on-one?  No, He definatlly should have gotten solo exp for it, probably even Bonus RP experience.  To be fair he was playing in character  to a point.  The GM was obviously shocked at our reactions and not helping, but giving something akin to a lesser artifact for it is abit extreme.  (I honestly dont know the real powers of the weapon but it was apperently a weapon that a high powered (20+ level) character in a past campaign used and the player that used it was gasping and aweing.<br />
<br />
Yes I do plan on talking to the GM about it later and not just keeping it under wraps to stew.<br />
<br />
Edit: Darnit!  I tried to hijack the thread again, sorry.<br />
Maybe you should ask your players what they want to be consitered RP Viable for XP.  If you talk about it and agree with a level/situation for it then they cant complain.  <br />
As far as the reason for a Rogue XP Chart being so low I completely understand.  In 3ed the classes are balance so that you dont have to worry about the XP difference.<br />
I remember in one campaign I was playing a druid and decided to pick up some bard, told the GM I was going to start on the bard XP chart and all xp was going to it.  End of the rather short adventure I jumped to about 9th level and everyone else made nearly one.  Pissed a few people off and I understood why, I had more non-weapon profs then all of them put together at that point, something we liked to use.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-15-03, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it was put to me, some of my players feel that being &quot;in-character&quot; and behaving as such, warrants xp. That doesn't include winning ideas, effective NPC interactions, or anything, simply that they have a character concept, and it shows in their minute to minute behavior. Now, I agree, players should be rewarded for making that effort, rather than sitting quietly til initiative needs to be rolled, or a situation arises that absolutely requires their special skills, but at the same time, don't we as DMs kind of expect players to &quot;play their personalities out&quot;? At least I think I do. I'm always prepared for that all too bright fighter, or that cleric who can't seem to stop himself from looting corpses, but most of my players know how to stay with in the domain of their character concept. And I don't think that in itself percludes a reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you explained that to them?<br />
<br />
Maby you should fool them.    Say they get 100 RP XP and just pull that XP from another source.  They seemingly get 100 less Goal XP.  Then give them XP for their ideas.  Change the glossery if they are going to be picky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Playing in character is roleplaying, isn't it?<br />
<br />
If you say you're going to give xp for roleplaying, shouldn't them playing in character then give that xp?<br />
<br />
Quote:PCs earn xp by wowing me the DM with their ingenuity. Good ideas, quick thinking, hitting the nail on the head when solving my mysteries. That warrants bonus roleplay xp.<br />
<br />
While worthwhile, I think the above are separate xp issues from roleplaying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, but how much effort from the PC should warrant an xp gain? Where do you draw the line? When do you go from thoughtful character behavior and attitude, to bare minimum roleplaying? Should I award players for that bare minimum? <br />
Let's take my example of the guy playing the rogue. Saying he searches every body when it hits the ground is roleplaying, because he isn't normally like that, so he's playing his character's role and personality out, but should I give him xp for that? My gut says no, even though it IS roleplaying. So where do I draw the line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Playing obviously out of character should be an xp penalty.<br />
Playing in character in easy circumstances is worth a small bonus.<br />
Playing in character in moderate circumstances (ie: you are a paladin and you group wants to torture info out of a captive) gives a moderate bonus.<br />
Playing in character when it's difficult (ie: that same Paladin being forced to accept the surrender of someone who murdered members of his church) is a large bonus.<br />
Playing in character against impossible odds (ie: The Paladin being faced with some great evil, yet being honorbound to do nothing to it at the moment) is a huge bonus.<br />
<br />
That is how I do things.  I use a paladin as the basis because they have the largest number of roleplaying constraints placed on them (and if you ever find 2 game masters who expect the same behavior set in a Paladin, I'd be shocked.)  Frankly, nearly ANY activity a player can come up with can be justified as playing their character properly if the player is clever and cheesey enough.  It is only through the players exploring their characters weaknesses that roleplaying bonuses are really useful.<br />
<br />
In my current game, I am a Rogue/Bard.  Among other things, I was cursed years earlier when I broke into a tower which was inhabited (unknown to me) by a Lich.  I survived the encounter only through blind luck (this is all backstory material) and now the character is pretty much completely useless in the presence of undead...or even in places where undead MAY be found like crypts.  Even a simple skeleton moving it's arm or the moan of &quot;Braaaiiins&quot; from a zombie is enough to send him into a state of near catatonia.  This &quot;weakness&quot; is one of the things I base his personality around and when it comes into play, I generally end up with a roleplaying bonus.<br />
<br />
Being stupid and getting rewarded for it (the ooze example above) just sounds like a bad situation.  Were it me, I'd ask that rogue to go scout ahead, and then run the other way.  People like that WILL get others killed and need to be abandoned as quickly as possible if you want to live a long life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume a bare minimum of roleplaying from my players.<br />
<br />
I also use adhoc awards mostly, I figure out the rough value of what encountered during the session (fights, traps, puzzles, conversation, role-playing, et al.) and base the xp on that.<br />
<br />
If a player performs subpar in his role-playing capability I usually dont do anything about it immediately, reducing xp gain is somewhat demorilizing, and usually all my players are good role-players so its not an issue.<br />
<br />
If a player performs above the call of duty, a particularly heavy decision, or have to go with a bad call because of what they believe (samurai have this sort of thing happen a lot like Telurinon's paladin below), then I usually award an xp bonus.<br />
<br />
I also use awards outside of xp, karma points that allow a reroll is an example, so good roleplaying might gain a karma point instead of bonus xp.<br />
<br />
My gut is that rogue probably didn't deserve a bonus xp award for playing in character. A certain minimum amount of such a thing is expected, but it can depend on how you presented your case for giving xp awards. But not being there its hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">04-16-03, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My group, whether I'm DMing or someone else, usually has a period as we wrap up for the night where you can sue for exp.  Typically this is where outstanding roleplay or innovation is rewarded.  90% of the time, people do not sue for themselves.  They sue for other members of the party.  If the DM feels that a reward is meritted they'll give exp.  Often a smaller amount of exp will be awarded to the person doing the suing as well.<br />
<br />
Things that are typically sued for (these really happened at one time or another):<br />
<br />
&quot;I sue for Joe for figuring out the maze.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sue for Megan for using perform to distract the angry mob&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sue for Kevin for roleplaying the encounter with the mage and averting combat&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sue for Drew for staying in character, even though he actually figured out the plot point before anyone else&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sue for Del for putting style above results&quot; (it was a superhero RPG)<br />
<br />
In most games, the rewards for these types of incidents range from 25-100 exp each.  Depending on how well the group was playing we've had as few as 2 and as many as 15 things sued for in one session. - Nymm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-17-03, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now theres a good one that I hadent been able to put into words.  Style over Results.  I did that the other night and got my butt kicked.  We were all mounted fighting mounted goblins (on worgs) and I was weaving around the area on my horse at full combat speed (x2, 100' per round, Archery)  Problem was that because of the way combat works when I was finished moving one or two would come up and bite me like I was standing still then due to some house rules I would get attacked via AOOppertunity because I figured it didnt make sense for me to go from 100'/3seconds to dead stop.  I threw reality out the window however when I only had 8 HP left and stopped so it didnt get another AOO on me.<br />
<br />
Style over Results would be a good one to put XP towards.  I like that idea alot.  As far as the &quot;Sue for XP&quot; thing, intresting concept.  You have to have the right kind of group for it to work I beleive.<br />
<br />
Oh an on the Ooze thing above, I talked to the DM.  The weapon is &quot;Rabbitslayer&quot; from a dragonlance book. +4 Dagger that you cant lose.  Not some mega-magic item like the other guy made it sound.  But then again, it may be a mega-magic item for that campaign.<br />
The GM had told me that he put an item in the dungeon for each person along those lines.  He wanted each person to have an item that one of the &quot;Heros of the Lance&quot; once had.  Couldent tell you what that means myself because ive never read any of the Dragonlance novels.  (Yes, its a Dragonlance campain, the 'Cat' is a Kender.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-17-03, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont do the Sue thing myself but I am open to my players saying &quot;Hey, what about the encounter with the kobold at the dinner table?&quot;  If Sessions go long you tend to forget things, its human nature. <br />
But when he mentioned it, the suing made some bit of sense.  Though that wouldent be what id call it.  Nominate would be a better word IMHO.</div></div><hr />
