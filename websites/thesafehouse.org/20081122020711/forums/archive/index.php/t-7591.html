<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Skarwolf</div><div class="date">06-06-01, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heading to Neriak to bank and do some other stuff I saw a warrior shout a challenge to the zone.  It was a 41st warrior challenging someone to fight him within his level.  So I said I'd give it a go, a 34th rogue    <br />
<br />
I didn't have any poisons ready, or the means to make any from long nite of adventuring in crystal caverns.  Asked the warrior what race he was, he responded, halfling, he was using a wurmslayer and whip of ensnaring.  My weapons consisted of jagged ice shard and crystal grinder.<br />
<br />
So I head to lavastorm zone where he said to meet and challenge him.  Soon as he accepted I hit sneak/hide kept trying to get behind him.  He would move away and use arrows to reveal my position.  Initially he would get cocky and sit down but after being backstabbed couple times for 100+ he stopped doing that.  After few minutes, I also managed to disarm him couple times too but he began to get pissy.<br />
<br />
It seems as if this warrior, who had 7 levels on me and like 900 HP's expected me to just stand there and melee him.  So he started whining in /ooc about me hiding and evading him all the time.  Sometimes I'd even lure him towards the guards, rock, and iron guardians.  As he'd attack them I'd backstab and try to disarm.  In direct combat it was obvious who was stronger, the warrior but thats a given.  He had 7 levels on me, but this rogue was far more devious then he had expected  <br />
<br />
Finally I caught him trying to bandage and ask another player for heal.  At this point I was at 2 bubs of health and he was at around the same.  Partially because I bandaged myself while hidden    So I snuck up and landed a BS for about 146.  We danced for awhile and at this point he would just stand still waiting for me to move in.  It was obvious he lacked skill at strafing and upon realizing this I was able to constantly manoveur behind him.  Soon I dropped him to within I'd say 30% health.  Knowing he'd go berzerk I backed off abit because if he landed any hits with the wurmslayer while berzerk he'd take large chunk of my HP's.  <br />
<br />
Whats he do?  Runs for lavastorm trash talking and zones    <br />

Only reccommendation is if you had vials/suspensions/pestle on you, the blind poison components are dropped right there in lava ;p</div></div><hr />

Not like it's hard to win using such lame &quot;tactics&quot;. [ Current Level: 54 | Max Backstab: 455 ]</div></div><hr />

I mean.. there is no way i'm going to stand there and let a wizard with 7 levels on me - nuke me while i just stand there.. why would i do the same with a warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Elegance</div><div class="date">06-09-01, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol I wouldnt go toe to toe with a warrior 7 lvls BELOW me. I learned a long time ago that rogues are simply not meant to stand there and take it. I think I would rather die than play primary tank, and well in a duel you are primary tank. of course the mob is a stupid (yeah I know or smart) as the player on the other end and not just another mob in this case. I would have been all over grabbing some poison supplies before accepting his challenge. and hiding to bind and all that. if he wants a fair fight tell him to find a warrior/monk thats in his range, that way he cant bitch, unless the monk usess mend.<br />

Bluebies, as we lovingly call them on Vallon, are players who want to duel, not fight.  They want to slug it out and not use their opponents to use their skills.  They want to bow before the fight.  They cry when things don't go their way.  <br />
<br />
Good job brotha.  What are we if we don't use our skills?  A drood with heavy armor.  A wizard with plate mail.<br />
<br />
If ye'd had a poison ready ye'd have really licked him, especially a blind poison.  ALWAYS use your skills to the fullest if you duel.  Hide/sneak if it'll help, strafe for the backstab, bind wounds, apply poisons, whatever it takes within the rules.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of my old days on Bertox playing my necro.  A warrior three levels above me challenged me to a friendly duel, and then got really pissed when I started shadow stepping.  Engulfing darkness crippled him enough to just step around and keep casting on him until he died.  He was mad that I didn't stand toe to toe.   Soon after this event I switched to Vallon and haven't looked back.<br />
