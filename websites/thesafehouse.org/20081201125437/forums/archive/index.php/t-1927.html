<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The room that I'm currently in is maybe 30' x 30'.  There are 18 cubicles in this room, 16 of which are currently occupied.  The cubicle walls are about 3' high, so this means that the entire room is open-air.<br />
<br />
There are about 4 different radio stations playing.  <br />
<br />
There are at least 10 people talking at once, either to each other or to customers who may or may not be on speakerphone.  They progressively get louder and louder as they can't hear themselves over the increasing volume of the room.<br />
<br />
There is at least one walkie-talkie set loudly on someone's desk that is squawking something like &quot;Louie, come in Louie&quot; or &quot;Chris call me 5209&quot; every few minutes.<br />
<br />
The phones are constantly ringing (or buzzing if the person's already on a call).  No one has figured out how to set the ringer/buzzer on the lowest setting.<br />
<br />
The vent above my head makes this constant whooshing noise.<br />
<br />
The windows behind me rattle every time the breeze blows - I just hope I don't wind up getting sucked out a 23rd floor window...<br />
<br />
The printer is complaining about its constant tree-killing activity by making a high pitched whining noise.<br />
<br />
There is someone around here whose keyboard is going to wind up going to Human Resources for abuse... *click*click*bam* *click*click*click*click*click*bam*<br />
<br />
And the guy that sits directly to my right, one of my bestest buddies around here, bless his heart.... is a LOUD Brooklyn-ite, who has a penchant for trying to sing club tunes with his operatic Irish tenor...<br />
<br />
Grah!  Wish I could use earplugs or headphones, but I have to answer the phone far too often, earplugs would become a hassle and I'd never be able to listen to a whole song.<br />
<br />
I'm going out to the mountains this weekend, the only ambient sound will be the sound of the birds chirping during the day, the fire crackling at night, and the cool breeze blowing... ahhhh... bliss! (Back In Black)<br />

<br />
Get a Y cable that is supposed to split off sound to 2 different sets of headsets and use it backwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Use the 2 outputs as inputs and play your mp3 player/cd player/8 track player through one side, and hook the phone ring to the other, and then your headphones on the 1 ended side of the Y cable.<br />

<br />
Split X Symdrome (When the X chromosome seperates into two Xs) is a mental disorder that is typically demonstrated by long earlobes, dullened affect, and a stretched / flatened nasal bridge. It can be associated with mental retardation (that is, an IQ less then 70 on a standardized IQ test) or with learning disorders and distractibility. It is one of the 25% of mental retardations that has a clear biological basis.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, I wouldn't be able to distinguish what the person on the phone was saying to me if I still had the music going - I have to turn off the car radio if anyone's talking to me or calls me on my cell phone - I have to pause my CD at home if the phone rings or someone comes in to my room to talk to me.  <br />
<br />
Dunno what an ear doctor would call that.  <br />
<br />
I can hear a pin drop if there's not too much background noise, but put me in a crowded restaurant or bar, and I'll not hear you unless you step into the ladies room with me or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear pretty well when there's nothing going on, except I've got tinnitus presumably from bad ear infections as a child. When I can tune that out, it's easy to hear little bumps and things going on around the house or outside. When there's actually stuff going on, like people talking in the background, or whatever, I have a hard time hearing it. Sucks. Sensei Pren{Dragon Army}[Tribunal Server]<br />

<br />
The one I have here in the office was about $30 3 years ago.  It features a boom mic, two earphones, and seperate volume and mute controls.  It does a good job as a phone and kills office noise dead when not on a call.  <br />
<br />
I've also seen ones that can be phone or music, with a pushbutton to select which is on.  I'm think when this one finally breaks I'll get one of those. - Nymm<br />
