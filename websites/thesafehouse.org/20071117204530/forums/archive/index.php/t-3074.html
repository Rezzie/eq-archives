I'm thinking such a thread might be a nice thing to have around as a repository for good ideas and inspiration the next time you are designing a campaign for your own group. =)<br />
<br />
Peace.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">06-11-03, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my group is currently really into a game we have dubbed &quot;Final Fantasy O&quot;.  The guy that brainchilded it has O as the first initinal of his name and its what we usually call him.  The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; part is because we have based it loosely off the game.  One character is a Summoner and half the party are guardians.  My character is actually a Psi-Wraith that was the enemy's side greatest soldier when he was alive.  Was brought back to life at the begining of the campaign.  (GM Made all the characters, he had a whole storyline setup ahead of time)<br />
Something he told us last night was kind of nice.  He said it was the only storyline that the players have played long enough to see the 'End of the Plot Wagon Tracks'.  We are real close to finishing the storyline he had planned up.  We talked about it abit the other night and we are going to continue on with the campaign anyway going on with the various character's individual quests.  (Getting the summoner some more aeons for example)<br />
<br />
The system we are using is a heavly modified d20 mixed with Rifts.<br />
<br />
Edit: OH, and Al-La FF. Some of the big bosses do have around 2000 hit points.  Makes for long battles which can be fun when you get to bosses.<br />
How many times have you been in a group and finally get to the big boss that has been turning your world upside down only to smite him in 3 or 4 rounds of combat.  Primarally because you were able to buff up before the battle.<br />
Now we buff up but have to fight for our lives just to take him down.  Then he transforms into a second incarnation and we have to take him out all over again.    fun Fun FUN! Edited by: Urusai at: 6/11/03 6:48 am</div></div><hr />
