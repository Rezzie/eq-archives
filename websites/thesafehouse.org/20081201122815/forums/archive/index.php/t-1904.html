<br />
Screw you, satellite, screw you to the chilling, nearing absolute value of zero frigid hells of deep space as you spiral out of control forever DAMNED TO BE ALONE SO ALONE IN THE VAST COSMOS!<br />
<br />
$70/month for satellite. With a 12 month contract. With all the other @#%$ added together, it comes to be $2500 for the first year of service with like an $800 early cancellation fee.<br />
<br />
Hello, this is me not paying it.<br />
<br />
I would suffer even $50/month for broadband surfing without online gaming. That'd be another $20/month (eventually) and requiring dialing up to play games with horrible ping. But with all the installation and service charge crap, @#%$. $70/month is not a &quot;reasonable monthly payment once the installation is complete&quot; ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE $1800 INSTALLATION.<br />
<br />
At least they're offering two way satellite for that unbelievable price. But guess what? You still need a dialup modem and phoneline to install the bastard. What the hell?<br />
<br />
It's not like I can play my favorite genre of games anymore anyway, I'm damn sure not taking two @#%$ in the ass by not playing them with satellite.<br />
<br />
No more hardcore in d2, too. I'm not bitter about not being able to play the two games I played anymore or anything and not being able to do a god damn thing about it because the phone and cable companies havn't expanded their infastructure in the last 6 years. They stick their dicks in their mothers. Sensei Pren{Dragon Army}[Tribunal Server]<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nazbuk</div><div class="date">10-10-03, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with Satalite is that you have a slow upstream and a high downstream. You can leech all you want with it but when you play games on it your ping at best will be a 250-300 (At best). So you'll basically be someones b**ch.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">10-12-03, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">even with the 2 way you can't connect normaly to games ?<br />
are you sure ?<br />
<br />
since here in kuwait its banned to have 2 way sattlite connection , you can only have downsteram , up stream it can be only dailup or ADSL ( new service )<br />
<br />
but what i know ( from testing ) it doesn't work on anything other than HTTP( for downstream ) so if it can get ( for example )  120k on HTTP, u get dailup / ADSL speed on FTP or BT or kazza or IRc<br />
<br />
does that apply to 2 way also ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-12-03, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the speed listed was 500/60, even with supposed two way. Which is awfully @#%$, I thought satellite was almost as 'fast' as a T1 line, but the unusibility comes from the fact the signal has to travel so far. so you get clumps of data as opposed to a stream. fine for html, bad for real time.

<br />
btw for the same price ( 2100 $ ) you could get a 512 ADSL <br />
here in kuwait</div></div><hr />
