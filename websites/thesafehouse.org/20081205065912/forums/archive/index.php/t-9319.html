<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been reading about some various details about the Leadership power pool. As it turns out, those buffs stack. Also, for Defenders, they give a much larger bonus than other ATs provide when running the Leadership buffs. <br />
<br />
7.5% buff for Tank/Scrapper/Blaster, 10% buff for Controller, 12.5% buff for a Defender.<br />
<br />
Now, just imagine a 4 defender group, each of whom are tunning all 3 Leadership buffs. (Yes, the toggles would eat up some END, but assuming at least a couple of the defenders had one of the various END regen group buffs, it shouldn't be a problem.)<br />
<br />
In that kind of group, every single person would have 50% higher defense than normal, 50% higher accuracy, and 50% higher damage.<br />
<br />
Can you just imagine how effective that could be? You could add 4 of anything into that, and make a friggin machine. You'd have Scrappers that could double as tanks with the added defense, you'd have tanks that could actually put out good damage, and you'd have Blasters that could kill stuff 50% faster than normal. Plus, of course, all the defenders could probably use their secondary lines better than a non-buffed blaster.</div></div><hr />
