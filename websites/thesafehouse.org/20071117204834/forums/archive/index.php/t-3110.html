I would have gotten in contact with you earlier, but my computer died and your phone number was stored in it.  I won tickets to a P-funk concert in richmond and we are going to see them saturday afternoon.  Sorry to give such short notice, but I really didnt have a chance to get in contact with you until now.  Anywho, we can get back to things in a week, hopefully.<br />
