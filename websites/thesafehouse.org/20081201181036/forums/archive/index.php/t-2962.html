<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kobal Dacovale</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I’m just starting tabletop, and I want to REALLY get into role-playing.  <br />
<br />
And something that bugs me is I can buy a set of thieves tools and then a masterwork set. But I mean WHATS IN IT??<br />
<br />
Here is what I have so far.<br />
<br />
Basic:<br />
Standard set of lock picks<br />
Small hammer<br />
A few iron nails<br />
2 wedges<br />
A standard skeleton key<br />
A small handsaw<br />
Pair of wire clippers<br />
<br />
Masterwork<br />
Extensive set of picks and lock wrenches<br />
Small wooden mallet<br />
Small metal head hammer<br />
Hand saw for wood<br />
Handsaw for stone<br />
Pliers<br />
Wooden pegs<br />
Iron nails<br />
Various wedges<br />
Assortment of skeleton keys<br />
Several small springs<br />
A few feet of wire<br />
Clippers<br />
Small vial of acid<br />
Small vial of really sticky stuff.  (Tar or an alchemical compound of some kind)<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? Or am I just a bit too into this?<br />
<br />
Any help would be great thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would add the following for breaking into places :<br />
<br />
An auger or gimlet for drilling holes in wood.<br />
Make sure your wood saw is one with a long narrow blade, such that you can use it starting in the hole drilled by your auger.<br />
Oil for loosening and quieting resistant mechanisms. and for making other things slippery, as needed.<br />
A sturdy prybar, with a proper piece of pipe to fit onto it to enhance leverage, where needed.<br />
A Chisel.<br />
<br />
Also, though not really tools, it is good to have some rope, cord, string and even thread.  And a few black silk handkerchiefs.<br />
<br />
the handkerciefs can be used, for example, to wrap a couple around a hammerhead to muffle its blows.  Or put them over the face and hands of the guard you just dragged into a dark corner so he isnt so easily seen.  Or, in combination with the tar you already mentioned, to break through small windows (spread the tar evenly on the window, stick the cloth to the tarred window, break the window.  All the glass shards of any size will remain stuck to your cloth, and not rattle about on the floor inside)  You can also then use more tar and another kerchief to mask the broken window pane to prevent drafts that might alert someone.</div></div><hr />

Grappling hook is also advisable. If by wedges you mean Iron Spikes for blocking doors, cool, if not it's also a must. Helps you investigate areas and break into houses, blocking the doors so you can have time to find an escape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some other suggestions:<br />
<br />
a housebreaker's harness (climbing harness, basically)<br />
dogpepper (used to throw tracking dogs off your scent<br />
weaponblack (pitch and oil mixture to rub onto weapons, faces, etc, to make them black and dull)<br />
caltrops if you're going to be running from something.<br />
leafs of ricepaper or something. you can crumple them into balls and drop them on the floor, you'll be better aware of people sneaking up on you if they step on them, whereas they look mediocre to an observer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kobal Dacovale</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks guys yea i had included rope seperatly, some of that the dm isn't gonna let me automaticly include in the kit, i'll have to pay extra for sure, what do you think about some white powder for blowing into a passage to find trip wires or other trap mechanisms, or some rock dust to disguise foot prints in a duneon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Dont think I'd bother with the footprint hiding dust.  If there is so much dust in the dungeon that you'll leave an obvious trail, it seems likely that your opponents dont go there often enough to see any trail you might leave.<br />
<br />
Im also not sure how white powder is going to expose trip wires or other trap mechanisms, unless you have some means of getting the white powder to stick to them.<br />
<br />
Breaking into a dungeon is a whole different kit compared to breaking into someplace urban and patrolled.  Stealth isnt nearly as important, and you can bring a lot more gear, since you can pack much of it on the big dumb warrior who is coming with you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a few things I always include when I'm making up a theif's kit...<br />
<br />
Lockpicks<br />
Grappling hook<br />
Silk rope<br />
Small Handheld Mirror (looking 'round corners, etc)<br />
Flask of oil (good for squeaky hinges, sliding heavy objects across the floor, firebombs, etc.)<br />
Flour (for exposing tripwires, a bit of disguise (ghosties!), etc.)<br />
<br />
other useful stuff:<br />
caltrops<br />
weaponblack<br />
 Delissandra Splitshadow -  Half-Elven Assassin - &quot;Far Seekers&quot; - The Rathe<br />
So do I feel superior to any druid-twinked post-Kunark still-sucking-at-his-mother's-teat rogue? <br />
You better believe I do!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-14-02, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG you don't have a glass cutter in the masterwork kit!!!<br />
<br />
OMGGGG!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">07-15-02, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*cough*<br />
<br />
Grease, a large square of leather and a hammer is better then a glasscutter. Plus so few areas had any large amount of glass, *and* windows are a lot easier to open then break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I was thinking a glass cutter was out of genre myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">simplest way to detect tripwires is a string with a semi light weight rock/whatever tied to the end that you hang off your crossbow/a stick in front of you as you advance slowly. the weight shouldn't be heavy enough to trigger any tripwires but you will see it swing when it contacts the wire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or take a piece of string tied to a weight, throw the weight down the corridor, and lay the string down. The string will &quot;peak&quot; where a trip wire is, and string != enough weight to set off a tripwire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Haranavei</div><div class="date">07-16-02, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My spellfilcher always had a bag of marbles.   They're great for 'trapping' a corridor or area while you're stealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_WarrantofRv</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soft wax for plugging things (ears, nose, holes in the cask of ale you are delivering. . .) and a couple of fish hooks.  <br />
<br />
Ahh the S.A.K. (Standard Adventuring Kit), never leave home without it.</div></div><hr />
