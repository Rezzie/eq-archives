Because they all have pretty much the same names....<br />
<br />
Some ideas: The Dark Lords, The Evil Legion, The Shadow Lords, The Death Squad, The Legion of Doom, The Gods of Death, The Shadow Empire, The Evil Doom Squad, The Doom Lords, The Shadow of Death, The Dark Shadows, The Death Legion, The Evil Dead Gods, The Shadow Dread Lord Gods of The Dark Evil Dead Doom Legion. I'm Partial to The Evil Dreadful Death Defying Doomishly Dark Dracanion Demon Lords of the Dead Doom Legion of Deathsylvania.<br />
