<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Daggerthorn</div><div class="date">03-18-00, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As i was running through EC the other day to go to FP.  I noticed a few members from an old guild that kicked me out 7 times...  So as a joke i started making fun of them and they didnt take it so well.<br />
      So one of them challenges me to a duel  and im thinking he is blue this should be easy then i realize he is a necro and he brakes the pet out.  Im thinking ok im dead now great..  I hotkeyed 2 pumice stones.  He challenged me first.  I swung around hit the /d command and landed a nice BS for about 80. Im thinking not a bad start.  I pumice him 2 times to take those stupid necro buffs off.  He tries to darkness me and i resist.  HAHA that 7 hour camp in Upper guk for me fork payed off.  So he pulls that im gonna run back and fourth and let my pet get free hits in thing.  So he starts doing that and i start getting some nice BS in.  The pet wasnt touching me and it was blue.  Im like this is going well.  Then he pulls out the life taps.  He gets me a couple times, But my daggers were more powerful than his spells.  I repeated to tear in to him.  Then he started walking and i looked at his health it it was gone.  I was at half!  Im thinking how did this happen.... oh well WHAM! BS for 90 for the kill.  <br />
       I go sit it tunnel and ponder the duel when a old friend from the guild gives me a /tell.  He said they were making fun of me in guild chat and that rogues never stay in one place and fight fair...  He said they all shut up when they saw i won.  Stupid necros.  when will they learn...  During this time i have no idea why he didnt use his Harm shield...  maybey he didnt have it loaded...  Oh well works for me =)<br />

With my magic resist up to 60(need to get some real magic resist equip, 60 is with my normal gear on), I resisted the one fear and the 2 darkness spells he threw at me. He was down to 1/4, and I had lost half a bubble. And we all know this is too good to be true, so my computer @#%$s the bed on me *sigh* Wasn't very happy =/ Your signature privs have been taken away do to the fact that your html skills suck - a lot.</div></div><hr />
