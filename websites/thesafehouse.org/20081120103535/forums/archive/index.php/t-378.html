I was taking a break from Kunark and decided to see if anything was happening in lower guk.  Lord group was full and running rocky, frenzy was a no-list group of some friends, assassin DT and BR were all evacing and training constantly.   Not really an ideal night in guk. <br />
 <br />
Friends in frenzy called me down when a wizard left, so I joined up.  Me (51 rogue), 50 monk, 51 ench, 51 cleric, 51 warrior, 50 magician.  The folks were all there to help the warrior get a haste sash, so we took our time clearing spawns.  It was too light for the group, we had spawns cleared and were sitting most of the time, so I started scouting up above and Assassin was in the room and group was disbanding.  Pull assassin down to frenzy, kill it and a 34 rogue runs down to get mask.  Head back up, pull ritualist down, got arms.  I'm not sure how the subject got brought up, but someone bet me 1000 plat I couldn't pull the live king to frenzy room without dying.  I take pride in my pulling skill, and the warrior backed him on the bet so I agreed to it.  <br />
<br />
They keep clearing spawn, I head out to Innothule and get lv 52 druid SoW.  Head back down and zone in on live side, start sneaking to King.  On the way, find mino pat holding a sword.  So I pull him back to frenzy, got ebony blade.  Head up and pull Assassin down again, 'nother mask.  Sneak back to King, double check one last time with group to make sure they wanted this pull.  To my knowledge noone has ever attempted or actually pulled king anywhere, let alone across zone to frenzy room, and I wasn't sure what the result would be.  Group said go for it, so I shoot and start running.  Make it back to frenzy room with one and half bubbles of health, King and 4 other mobs in tow.  Mez em all, drop em all.  Got mith 2H.  Frenzy pops, get sash (given to warrior).  Sentinel pops, get a brig tunic.  We just decided to stop right there before something bad happened.  *chuckle*  The most fun any of us had in a long while.<br />
