<br />
Minor Signet of the Dark Knight.<br />
<br />
Someone got some useful Infos. Sounds like SK Quest..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">05-17-03, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Greater Faydark, just outside the spires are 2 new NPC's.<br />
<br />
[Wed May 14 15:48:47 2003] You say, 'Hail, Seana Marsinger'<br />
[Wed May 14 15:48:47 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Hello, my name is Seana Marsinger. I am here representing my loyalty to the League of Antonican Bards. It matters not to me whether you support the League or loathe it propaganda is not my objective. Everyone must find their own truths in this life path, so says Quellious. To business then, are you [familiar with the Plane of Hate?]'<br />
<br />
[Wed May 14 15:49:00 2003] You say, 'I am familiar with the plane of hate'<br />
[Wed May 14 15:49:00 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Good, I need someone that has a bit of an eye for how things should look up there. My brother and I have been studying Innoruuk and his intricate dealings for years. Being raised in New Tanaan may lend us certain neutrality towards all people, yet the values our parents have instilled in us do not allow us to let him go unwatched. In fact, I have begun to believe that my paranoia may prove useful not only to the League, but to the Citizens of Tranquility and New Tanaan itself as well. We have received a simple [piece of intelligence] that may conceivably upset the entire balance of the Pantheon and have most dire repercussions here in Norrath.'<br />
<br />
[Wed May 14 15:49:57 2003] You say, 'what piece of intelligence'<br />
[Wed May 14 15:49:57 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'An old friend of our father's in Qeynos, Jusean Evanesque, has been very busy sorting out the information that is coming to him in droves.  The first clue came from Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then in bits and pieces from many travelers moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the seas has grown, and somehow the Broken Skull Clan has gained power that should have been out of their grasp. Our informants there say that it can only come from Innoruuk. I am afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with this power. I do not believe that we will be able to uncover all that we need [alone] in time to warn people of the dangers.'<br />
<br />
[Wed May 14 15:52:48 2003] You say, 'why are you alone?'<br />
[Wed May 14 15:52:48 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting Jusean with all that needs to be verified and ensuring that the League's network contacts are all still viable. They will need to stay there in case we must get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the residents of Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it as biased. Thus we are here alone. Does this type of project  you?'<br />
<br />
At this point it diverges based on class.<br />
<br />
Wizard, Enchanter, Mage get :<br />
[Wed May 14 15:53:13 2003] Zyramus says, 'I am interested'<br />
[Wed May 14 15:53:13 2003] Stefan Marsinger takes a moment to size you up. 'You appear to be a practitioner of pure magic, am I correct?'<br />
<br />
[Wed May 14 15:53:30 2003] Zyramus says, 'you are correct'<br />
[Wed May 14 15:53:30 2003] Stefan Marsinger says 'I believe it is safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe the revenant, the ashenbone drake, and the loathing lich. They seem to be the main practitioners of your art in the least dangerous area. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover some type of signet that proves you have been studying these creatures, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some vampire dust and a diamond. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for you to do.'<br />
<br />
Cleric, Shaman get similar asking for stuff from Cleric of Hate or Spite Golem + Vampire Dust + Diamond<br />
<br />
Warrior are asked for Abhorent, Repulsive Rat, or Kirikuei + Abhorent Powder + Jacinth<br />
<br />
Ranger was asked for Ghast, Scorn Banshee, or Haunted Chest + Abhorent Pwder + Jacinth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats all the classes I've run through.  Never seen a signet drop (was going to try the armor they drop, but now that a signet was found, I guess that means its just rare). [i]</div></div><hr />

None/None<br />

When I gave it to quest giver she replied with &quot;I don't need that&quot;.  So either this is not the signet for the Ghasts (for rangers) or it *is* but the quests are not MQ'able.</div></div><hr />

Thats all i could find on Lucy and Magelo at the moment.  Item id 54027-54029 are priest rewards, 30-32 are hybrid, 33-35 are melee, 36-38 are caster.  I'll keep an eye out for new ones. Edited by: Javan Transient at: 5/18/03 7:03:07 pm</div></div><hr />

I would shave off my foot hair for that item.  FT3, and great stats... AND Saves!  (on a PvP server, the more saves you haev on your normal gear the better)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant: There are already dozens of great range-slots items out there, and you can only use one. And us melee's are screwed with non-weapon range items too.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying those items are bad.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't forget.. for the 3rd stage you need an item from Inno/Maestro.. which seem to be quite kick-ass... so I guess you need to be in a at least Tier3 or even Tier4 PoP-Guild to kill them.</div></div><hr />

why not make them charm slot? since I only seem to hear complaints about charms, that would be a usefull alternative for a place to put a nifty buffing item like these. eh, just my 2cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vanidor Silverbranch</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple notes, there are Signets asked for but its not really clear if you have to have it<br />
in inventory since some quests now require that.  <br />
<br />
Those classes needing the tradeable Vampire dust also need the more expensive Diamond versus<br />
the rarer Jacinth + nodrop abohorrent powder.<br />
<br />
Tested: Wizard had a Signet of the Dark Sorcerer from an Ashenbone drake. He had it returned<br />
while vampire dust + gem was eatten. Similar to what Teaamilie posted.<br />
<br />
Tested: handed in a regular bone chip, was returned. So she should only eat items she wants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suspect that the quest isn't quite as Javan has it, more like the following:<br />
1st level:  nodrop item from mobs  + required powder + gem, possibly with a signet in inventory<br />
2nd level:  first level reward + signet<br />
3rd level:  second level reward + book from Maestro/Innoruuk<br />
<br />
<br />
Hybrid<br />

item + abohorrent powder(nodrop) + Jacinth<br />

Ghast Fingerbones (nodrop)   (it was eaten/used according to one safehouse poster)<br />
<br />
<br />
Int Casters<br />
-----------<br />
Study: Revenants, Loathing Liches, Ashenbone Drakes<br />
item + vampire dust(tradeable) + Diamond<br />

Known items from the above mobs:<br />
Hatebone ??? (not really known by me, just mentioned in one spot and presumably from Drakes)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:If you survive long enough to uncover some type of signet that proves you have been studying these creatures, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some vampire dust and a diamond. <br />
<br />
The item that drops for priests is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Minor Signet of the Dark Priest&quot;<br />
<br />
The NPC specifically asked for the signet + dust and diamond.  I'm thinking the script got busted between test and live.<br />
<br />
Update: On terris thule, the quest NPC returned the Hybrid signet and Caster signet, however the quest worked as intended for me as a priest.  signet + diamond + dust = Gem of Faith. Edited by: Javan Transient at: 5/19/03 8:41:51 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vanidor Silverbranch</div><div class="date">05-20-03, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Javan, after seeing Teaamilie's post and having watched what Siderius was trying I assumed it was only that the text was misleading, not that the caster/hybrid parts were broken.<br />
<br />
WTS 'working as intended' quests to other multiplayer games and WTB just plain 'working' quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">05-20-03, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mystery solved.<br />
<br />
It seems the old restraint in sony's quest engine is still in place.  One NPC can not give 2 quests that require the same items (this was a problem in the Dozekar tear quests).  since both caster and priest need vampires dust + diamond, it'll only work for one.  Likewise melee and hybrid both want abhorent and jacinth.<br />
<br />
An enchanter friend gave thet signet, dust, and diamond to the npc standing, and she ate the dust/diamond and returned the signet.  Same with SK friend.<br />
<br />
So, with a leap of intuitive faith, I had my wizard give the signet of sorcery, vampire dust, and diamond to Stefan (the nnpc that is sitting down).  BINGO, got the caster gem.<br />
<br />
So, net result:<br />
Priests and Melee give to Seana Marsinger (the one standing)<br />
Casters and Hybrids give to Stefan Marsinger (the one sitting)<br />
<br />
Even though they BOTH give the SAME text asking for items from ALL 4 class types.  GO SONY! Edited by: Javan Transient at: 5/20/03 10:39:27 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part 1 of the quest:<br />
<br />
Give the Minor Signet + Diamond/Jac + Powder to one of the dudes. <br />
<br />
**IMPORTANT**<br />
As far as I know and from what I've tested:<br />
<br />
The one sitting takes Hybrids/Casters.<br />
The one standing takes Melee/Priest.<br />
**IMPORTANT**<br />
<br />
1st part recepies:<br />
<br />
Priest = Minor Signet of the Dark Priest + Vampire Dust + Diamond<br />
<br />
Hybrids = Minor Signet of the Dark Knight + Abhornet Dust  + Jacinth<br />
<br />
Melee = Minor Signet of the Dark Soldier + Abhornet Dust  + Jacinth<br />
<br />
<br />
Receive: Your first reward.<br />
<br />
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Part 2:<br />
<br />
Give your first reward + a &quot;crest&quot; from the higher lvl versions of your mobs you had to kill for the signet + some mob dropped item.<br />
<br />
2nd step recepies:<br />
<br />
Priest = Gem of Faith (first reward) + Vengence Dust (off vengence golems) + Crest<br />
<br />
Hybrids = Gem of Courage + Ghast Fingerbones + Crest<br />
<br />
Melee = Gem of War + Khurikai (spelling) Flesh + Crest<br />
<br />
Recive your second reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

The 2nd trigger is &quot;what work?&quot; But I need to know what the 3rd part is to know if this Tome of Dark Healing I got off Maestro is the part I need. Almost got part 2 done, just need a crest (which I blew yesterday trying to figure the first part out :\)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_artebus</div><div class="date">05-25-03, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The text for the final quest is &quot;I am ready for the final reconnaissance errand&quot;, although &quot;I am ready for the final&quot; works (and probably, &quot;ready final&quot; works).<br />
<br />
Seana Marsinger asks for the Tome of Dark Healing from priest classes, and Dissertation of Dark War from pure meleers. Stefan Marsinger asks for the Compendium of Classic Torture from hybrids. Not sure what he requests from casters, although it's not hard to find out. So the piece NiacinEQ got off the Maestro is going to make some priest happy, I imagine.<br />
<br />
Here's the quest text that I received as a bard (after the preliminary stuff about who they are and all that):<br />
<br />
Stefan Marsinger says 'I believe it is safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe the ghasts, scorn banshees, and haunted chests. They seem to share some qualities of your art and lie in the least dangerous areas. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover some sort of minor signet that verifies you have been studying these creatures, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some abhorrent powder and a jacinth. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for you to do.'<br />
<br />
Stefan Marsinger says 'Wonderful. Return to the plane and continue your studies of the hybrid demons. With the new information you have brought I believe we have a good framework of reference for the lower rankings of these beings, however there is a higher echelon of power that I will need to be familiar with. Seek out the Teir`Dal knights and grave lords of hate. All of these creatures should be within your area of study, but take care! Make sure to keep your protection with you at all times. Some of them should have a kind of Knight's crest symbolizing their rank; bring me this crest and some ghast fingerbones, along with your Gem of Courage. If you succeed in this task you are more valuable than I could have imagined, and I may need your skill with a final reconnaissance errand.'<br />
<br />
Stefan Marsinger says 'In my personal studies I have heard rumor that there are four archaic tomes that contain some of Innoruuk's darkest secrets. I cannot ask you to uncover all four, I am not even certain that they exist. The fabled tomes are the Compendium of Classic Torture, Texts on Pain, Writ of Agony, and Tactical Hatred. If they do indeed exist and you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The tome that I do seek will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's own confidantes, and they seldom seem to show their faces. It is possible the Prince of Hate himself holds the tomes close. Find me the Compendium of Classic Torture; return it to me with your Gem of Courage and your work is finished.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Each class type gets 4 books listed in the quest text, but oddly they are different for the different classes. Consulting with my guildmates, priests get books A, B, C, D listed (don't remember full name) and Seana asks for book A, and casters get E, B, C, D (that is, the last 3 books are the same, only the first differs) and Stefan asks for book E (naturally). I know that some of the books listed for meleers and hybrids also overlap, and the two books they are asked for are completely different from any of the books listed for the first two classes.<br />
<br />
Basically, the complete quest text for all four classes mentions at least 10 different books, but only 4 of them are specifically requested. Are the other 6 books red herrings, or do they have some use? The text would seem to indicate that they'd care about the others, but that would assume that quest designers are sensible. :)<br />
<br />
Also, has anyone gotten the requested books off mobs other than the Maestro or Innoruuk? The quest text seems to imply that other mobs might be able to drop it (the priest version even more so: &quot;The tome that I do seek will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's own priests, and they seldom seem to leave their studies.&quot;, and Maestro isn't a priest).</div></div><hr />

<br />
mywebpages.comcast.net/ma...erview.htm<br />
<br />
Complete site to walkthrough all 4 versions of the quest with mobs to look for, drop names (and most images) and result names (and 7 of 12 gems with images).<br />
<br />
Note: there is a typo in the hybrid text.  Quest giver asks for the book and 'gem of courage' for the 3rd reward.  Gem of Courage is the 1st reward, I'm assuming he wants 'Gem of Daring' instead.</div></div><hr />

I have Etched Sorcerer's Signet and Concordance of Black Magic from Maestro.   All I need is a hatebone drake bone and I'm done with entire quest. =D<br />

It seems like hatebone drakes are scattered south of the zone. It'll be a bitch to hunt them down... /sigh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">06-01-03, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the spoiler on alla, if you turn in the 3 &quot;unasked for&quot; books along with your 3rd gem, you get a 4th and final reward:<br />
<br />
Marsinger's Glimmering Gem   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
AC: +20 <br />
Str: +15 Sta: +20 Wis: +20 Int: +20 Cha: +10 <br />
MR: +20 FR: +10 CR: +10 PR: +10 DR: +10 <br />
HP: +100 Mana: +100  <br />
<br />
Effect: Aura of Regeneration<br />
Focus Effect: Spell Haste IV <br />
 <br />
<br />
I can not confirm this with any in game task, and considering the last text I get from quest giver is:<br />
<br />
Quote:&quot;Find me the [book]; return it to me with your [3rd reward] and your work is finished&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not quite sure whether to believe it or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking at the 4th reward, the stats are awesome, but for melee it appears to have lost the +ATK component of it for a spell focus effect.  Does anyone know if there is in fact a second version more designed for melee, perhaps with Aura of Daring/Bravery instead of Aura of Regen and spell focus?<br />

What i was wondering, is if any of you guys know if for sure some mini bosses or named can drop book needed for 3dr part.Or only inny and Maestro can. From what the npc says there is a possbility for others to drop it but im wondering if any of you guys have looted one from any mini boss. Any information will be good</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that the books do drop off of other named mobs aside from Innoruk and Maestro.  A mob named Arcanist V'Gimis dropped some decent caster gloves and a &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;.  I cannot confirm other books.<br />
