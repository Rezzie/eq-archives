<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">04-23-03, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a couple marathon (11+ hour total over 2 or 3 days) gaming sessions for mods that shouldn't have taken more than 6, a discussion sprung up over at the Online Game Day yahoo group about what kinds of things you can do to make the online gaming experience go more smoothly, both as a DM and as a player.  I thought I'd repost some of the suggestions here, because I thought a bunch of them were really good advice, even for people not playing online.<br />
<br />
The group, and so some of the suggestions, are related to RPGA-based games and module structures, but I think there's plenty of stuff that's applicable to people playing any type of game.  I didn't make any of this stuff up, so I acknowledge the source at the beginning of each quote.<br />
<br />
First, a post by Ken Jenks<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
If there's a rule question or debate about one player's action, skip <br />
that action until the player looks up the appropriate rules. Then fit <br />
the action in to the combat later. Take debates out of the main <br />
window to a private chat window, but don't neglect the main window.<br />
<br />
At the end of each round, give the players a quick summary of what <br />
happened in that round, like, &quot;Okay, that completes round 4, where <br />
Rintrose dropped the goblin leader, the Ogre stepped on top of the <br />
table, and Charlamak is still unconcious under the table, trying to <br />
stabilize. The goblin sorcerer has three Mirror Images left.&quot;<br />
<br />
When you are preparing your scenario, pre-roll Hide, Listen, Spot and <br />
Disguise checks and pre-cast any long-duration buffing spells for <br />
your bad guys, so when the good guys encounter them, you spend less <br />
time rolling dice for the bad guys. This can also help you visualize <br />
where the bad guys are before the encounter, so it's more clear when <br />
the good guys get a Spot check to find a hidden or disguised bad guy.<br />
<br />
When the players are clearly off-track, looking at the plot the wrong <br />
way or searching the wrong area for clues, they meet an NPC named Red <br />
Herring. He'll start to drone on and on about nothing in particular <br />
and the players always figure it out right away. Sometimes it's a <br />
bartender, sometimes it's a cleric, His High Priest of Perpetual <br />
Pompousness, Herring the Red.<br />
<br />
When I ask a player what he wants to do on his turn, I'll sometimes <br />
ask which of several likely paths he'd like to take, like, &quot;Do you <br />
want to keep attacking the troll or take a five-foot step and grapple <br />
the wizard?&quot; <br />
<br />
I always discourage splitting up the party or letting one group get <br />
far ahead of another. That often leads to combat disasters and always <br />
leads to player boredom, but splitting up the party also takes more <br />
real time.<br />
<br />
I have the monsters surrender or flee from combats when things look <br />
bad for them, especially if the party does something dramatic and <br />
intimidating. This can greatly decrease the amount of time spent in <br />
combat, and it usually lets some of the monsters live to fight <br />
another day. Not that this has any campaign effect in LG, but it's <br />
more realistic than every monster fighting to the death.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are familiar with each encounter at the APL selected. <br />
Don't assume that the encounter as written is the same as it was when <br />
you played the game; your DM may have screwed up, giving you a false <br />
impression of how an encounter &quot;should&quot; go, and you may be DMing at a <br />
different APL than you played. Read the flow chart, if one is <br />
available.<br />
<br />
Take the time to copy/paste all boxed text into a Word document (or <br />
whatever) in paragraph-sized chunks that will go through AIM so you <br />
don't have to take extra time to select/copy/paste during the game.<br />
<br />
Make any maps available on a Web site, then give the URL of each map <br />
at the appropriate time during the game. This avoids the delay of <br />
launching e-mail, checking for new messages, downloading attachments, <br />
etc. <br />
<br />
Make the maps large enough scale that players can print them out on <br />
standard paper and plunk the map down on a battlemat and use <br />
miniatures. This saves oodles of time.<br />
<br />
Don't volunteer be a DM unless you really have time to play out the <br />
whole game. Don't DM in one window and play another game in another <br />
window -- it's rude to keep your players waiting.<br />
<br />
Announce a schedule of breaks then stick to it. This will help <br />
everybody get to the fridge and the potty or whatever without <br />
interrupting the game with too much AFK time.<br />
<br />
Another tip for saving time when you're the DM: have a player look up <br />
spell durations and other details. When an NPC cleric casts a Ghoul <br />
Touch on a player character, ask the player to look up the effects <br />
and duration. Keep track of the duration on the during your end of <br />
the round summary so everyone can see it. <br />
<br />
Even when you're playing on-line, it may be more efficient to work <br />
from a printed scenario, where you can pencil in notes in the margins <br />
and use a highlighter for the encounters of the correct APL.<br />
<br />
For NPC spell casters, it's a good idea to pencil in a little table <br />
showing the DC of each spell level the NPC can cast. So if the NPC <br />
sorcerer has a 16 CHA and Spell Focus: Evocation, I'd write a little <br />
table in the margin of the printed scenario like this:<br />
<br />
Lvl | DC | DC Evoc<br />
----+----+--------<br />
0 | 13 | 15<br />
1 | 14 | 16<br />
2 | 15 | 17<br />
3 | 16 | 18<br />
4 | 17 | 19<br />
5 | 18 | 20<br />
<br />
For NPC fighters with multiple weapons and/or multiple attacks, I <br />
check the math in the scenario. It's often wrong, or it includes Rage <br />
bonuses or other situation-dependent bonuses that might or might not <br />
apply. Then I pencil in a little table like:<br />
<br />
Main Longsword +9, 1d8+6<br />
2nd Dagger +8, 1d4+4<br />
Iter Longsword +4, 1d8+8<br />
<br />
This is a good place to note situation-dependent bonuses, like Ranger <br />
favored enemy or Rage modifiers.<br />
<br />
You should have a pre-generated scratch paper for each combat, with <br />
information on each NPC, including hit points, spells, potions, <br />
scrolls, doses of poison and maybe the tables I mentioned above. <br />
You'll need one for each APL because you may not know before the game <br />
starts exactly what APL you'll end up DMing.<br />
<br />
And if you really want to save time, play via teleconference using <br />
free/cheap minutes on cell phones and chained three-way calling. <br />
Telecon games take about half the time of an AIM game and are much <br />
more fun. See Y! group LivingTelecon for details.<br />
<br />
<br />
From Mike Sitts<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
GMs:<br />
-- know the mod. sounds silly, but that extra hour of prep will pay <br />
off, likely saving 2-3 hours, plus, make the games run a LOT more <br />
smoothly.<br />
<br />
-- take 20 minutes to a half hour at the beginning to copy and paste <br />
and perhaps print out everyone's basic info. Knowing PC names, <br />
general stats, etc. helps speed things up, and gives the game a more <br />
natural feel. Not everyone's AIM name matches their PC name. It's <br />
cooler if you can maintain that feel throughout the mod.<br />
<br />
-- sometimes, when it's running long and people are frazzled or <br />
frustrated, do some creative editing. Is it obvious that the PCs, <br />
who aren't particularly hurt and have dispatched two-thirds of the <br />
baddies without a problem? Wrap it up. Don't start fleeing and <br />
spring-attacking and such if it's not integral to the mod. All it <br />
does is bog tables down. That extra hour of meaningless combat <br />
doesn't do anyone any good and can be very frustrating. <br />
<br />
-- Recap frequently. Give Sit-reps. Especially when there aren't <br />
any maps to hand out, it's pure visualization, and feeling completely <br />
out of touch bogs the game down with incessant questions and makes <br />
people frustrated.<br />
<br />
PLAYERS:<br />
-- Be ready! Know what your character is going to do, pay attention <br />
to what others are doing and preferably have it typed out just <br />
waiting for you to hit 'enter'. <br />
<br />
-- If you have questions about a situation, ask them in a concise <br />
manner. Indicate what you'd like to do, if you can do it, and <br />
alternatives if you can't.<br />
<br />
-- have the die-bot in your clipboard, so a Paste will set it up.<br />
<br />
-- keep track of who's in front of you once initiative is rolled. <br />
That way you can be alert and ready.<br />
<br />
The long games usually end up becoming an exercise in endurance. By 9 <br />
hours, people are burned out, usually frustrated and annoyed and <br />
become increasingly careless with their PCs, which can lead to <br />
unfortunate results. &quot;I don't care, I just want SOMETHING to happen, <br />
so yes, I charge into the middle of the Ettins with Barbarian/Rogue <br />
levels!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a bit of work, prep and attention, things can be brought down to <br />
reasonable levels and the enjoyment of everyone will increase.<br />
