<br />
I didn't put this in Rants because I'm not ranting about it per se... I'm just wondering if I'm just too old to like this show, or if it really does suck.  And if it does suck, why the heck did they move it to a such a good time slot?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Home Movies has the primo time slot right now because it's the only AS comedy with new episodes, everything else is in reruns.  It's not one of their more popular shows, but it has a solid fan base and doesn't do too terribly.  As far as I know, the only AS shows that just bombed were Lupin and Reign (both of which I felt were pretty good), not counting Pilot Candidate and the other Toonami rejects they used as filler when first starting up the block.</div></div><hr />

I love goofy and offcolor humor, but I just can't get into Home Movies.  Granted, there are some very funny lines once in a while, but I sure won't miss it when they move another show into that slot.<br />
<br />
On a similar note, I love that Birdman reruns are playing early... I get to see some of the ones I miss when I go to bed at 11.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dahne</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just don't understand some of the shows.  I never liked Home Movies either.  They all talk in this droning monotone that gets on my nerves very quickly.  Though I'd like to know what song the boy was gargling along to in one of the commercials.  It was a cool, sort of Indian-sounding song.  <br />
<br />
I don't quite understand ATHF, though it's funny sometimes.  The milkshake is annoying.  <br />
<br />
How could Lupin have bombed?  Man, Lupin rules. It took me a while to get used to the art style, but then I became a big fan.<br />
<br />
Reign was just too monotonous.  I can't stand shows that constantly exude the same emotion.  There has to be some variety.  And why the heck did every episode start out with bad CG and &quot;ALEXANDER&quot; written on a rock?  It didn't help that, while girls in battle bikinis aren't great, men in battle bikinis are just plain scary. <br />
<br />
I never caught on to the Space Ghost Coast to Coast thing, but I saw an episode last night that was weird, yet oddly hilarious.  Outer space shows are for children and stupid people!<br />
<br />
Witch Hunter Robin is also a bit monotonous for my taste, and I hate the lucky coincidences that happen every damn episode (Hmm, a witch, eh?  I think I'll walk through the park.  Well, whaddya know!  The girl I was talking to yesterday is the witch!  That's convenient.), but it just started to get interesting on Friday night.  What with the Methudelah witch, and the beginnings of a real plotline, and &quot;the truth is-<br />
<br />
THIS IS A REQUIRED TEST OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM.<br />
<br />
(Yes, that seriously happened to me.  Arrgh.)<br />
<br />
While we're on the topic of Adult Swim shows, anyone mind giving me a basic rundown of the plot?  I watched enough to get vaguely curious, but not curious enough to endure the show itself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ZoldenShadowhunter</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. You guys are a ... really big minority. However that works... anyway, EVERYONE I talk to loves Home Movies. I dig it, although not as much as some other shows, it is definitely original and pretty funny. <br />
<br />
It has its' great moments which usually include good quotes. &quot;Well, Brendon, if you think about it... cheating is really just another way of being prepared. You know?&quot; I'm really surprised at the amount of hate for Home Movies around here. Do you guys also hate like... Curb Your Enthusiasm?<br />
<br />
The ads are great. C'mon... coach talking about what he wants to do in life: &quot;There's two things I want to do before I die. One, is fly on the concord. Two, I wanna learn Japanese. Not that I care or anything about the culture, but this one time I was in a Japanese restaurant and I saw this a-hole, obviously American, ordering in Japanese. I wanna be able to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The episodes that are in squiggle vision and before were bad. It's gotten so much better in the last season.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it should be in ther 10:00 timeslot, even if it is a new episode.  I don't usually bother watching any AS, now that it leads.  I just get some sleep early.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkefang</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Home Movies is hilarious.  I'm not sure if it is written by the same people who did Dr. Katz, but many of the voices are by the same people.  It is really deadpan humor, and it is all about the dialogue.  The animation isn't particularly good.  It is a lot like Curb Your Enthusiasm, like someone already mentioned.<br />
<br />
Quote:Reign was just too monotonous. <br />
<br />
That's an understatement.  They spent 20 minutes of each episode talking about either: 1. how Alexander was going to rule the world, or 2. how said ruling would destroy the world.  There was way too much filler in that show.  And the animation was indeed creepy.  I'm pretty sure the ancient Greeks didn't wear quite so much bondage gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ten Evenings</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Home Movies and Sealab 2021 are the best, best shows on Adult Swim, hands down.<br />
<br />
Both are an aquired taste, I guess, but Im suprised so many people dont like Home Movies. The deadpan humor, the delivery, the non visual style is just so well done...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pharius Ravenslock</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree home movies rules.<br />
<br />
my fav shows in order are probably<br />
ATHF<br />
Sealab<br />
Home Movies<br />
Harvey Birdman<br />
<br />
and since I now play D&amp;amp;D every sunday night, do they still show the oblongs?  if they do, that takes my #1 spot. <br />
<br />
Makin' things hot since 1983!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deltar Battlewall</div><div class="date">03-09-04, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before it actually premired, the commercials for Home Movies were annoying, uninspired, boring, stupid, and lazy.  I couldn't conceive that anyone would watch 30 seconds of a poorly drawn, motionless, monotonous cartoon character talking (or singing, badly) about nothing, and then get jazzed about watching 30 whole minutes of the same.  To date I have not brought myself to actually sit through it, however if there is such a high vote of confidence for this show here, I might give it a try one day.  I'm not holding my breath though.<br />
<br />
As for the others, in order of most to least favorite:<br />
<br />
1) The Brak Show.  Sadly, my favorite was the one they don't show anymore.  George Lowe as Father was god.<br />
<br />
2) Sealab 2021.  Totally hilarious, that episode where they all go crazy on herbal pills is a standout.  &quot;I feel like I have the strength of a bear... that has the strength of TWO bears!&quot;<br />
<br />
3) ATHF.  Numba one in da hood, y'all.  I agree it's an acquired taste however.<br />
<br />
4) SG:C2C.  Funny most of the time, oddly disturbing some of the time.  Give it up for Moltar though.<br />
<br />
5) Harvey Birdman.  Funny concepts, but many of the one-liners and quips fall flat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Lupin, that's one of my favorite series on AS.  Heck, I even bought the 2 soundtracks for it.    <br />
<br />
Edit:  I forgot to mention that Home Movies sucks horribly. Edited by: Pearll at: 3/9/04 12:06 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Enol Sournote</div><div class="date">03-09-04, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I like the Home Movies where Brendon wants a pet.  So, he ends up pet sitting the cat Alexandre.  Well the cat gets out, get rabis attacks Brendon and has to get destroyed.  The Vet is so awesome in that episode.  He keeps on talking about how they will have to give the cat &quot;cotton candy&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I believe it is a season one episode.  That is the one to watch to get people hooked on Home Movies.<br />

Never seen it... we don't have HBO.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know we should get HBO, for all the great stuff.. but then I'd want to get Showtime so I can watch Dead Like Me, and it'd just snowball into pay channel craziness.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I dont get to stay up late enough to watch much Adult Swim like I used to. And I never had any inclination to watch Home Movies from the commercials.

Brak show = yay<br />
Space Ghost: Coast to Coast = yay<br />
Sealab 2021 = yay<br />
Cowboy Bebop = Permayay<br />
Inuyasha = yay<br />

Watched a bit of Witch Hunter Robin a couple days back. Was sitting there thinking &quot;SO... um... the hell? WTB a plot&quot;<br />
<br />
Big O is always funny to watch. Always haveta speculate on how overworked the poor road-construction crews are...<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! We got this block back up and running again! I think we can call it a night, everyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
worker runs up &quot;Another fight on the other side of town! Them Megazord thingamabobs're goin' at it... AGAIN.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!?!? What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some freaky critter that turns everything it touches to sand, and mister 'Bursts-through-the-streets-in-entirely-too-dramatic-manner' as usual. Several blocks laid waste, cars flattened into the concrete, footprints on the thoroughfares, the whole shebang.&quot;<br />

FINALLY we get rid of Amon!  Maybe the series will pick up now.  He was a serious pain in the ass.  Yes yes, you're silent and mysterious.  I GET it.  Parts of it bug me, but the interesting bits are good enough that I keep watching.  I just wish there was more witchy powers, plot, and maybe talking about things like what the Orbo (stuff in the vial around the hunters' necks that keep the witch powers from affecting them) and why Robin thinks it's &quot;disgusting.&quot;  <br />
<br />
By the way, can anybody tell me what powers Amon, Sakaki, and Doujima have?  Or are they just boring normal people?  And is it just me, or does the psychic girl's power suck?  &quot;Oh, I can read emotions from things in the two episodes where I actually bother to!  This bullet has lots of anger in it!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">03-12-04, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amon used his powers at the very beginning of episode one, but I didn't realize it was going to be some big mystery and only remember that he did something vague and superhuman now.  I'm pretty sure the other two are just normal humans.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the rest of the series will focus on the Factory and orbo.  I have no trouble it is disgusting, given that witch powers are angelic in origin.  That sort of thinking leads one down Eva-esque pathways (Orbo egenerates an AT field that severs the users, or victims, from humanity?), and really, was there anything about Evangelion that wasn't disgusting?</div></div><hr />
