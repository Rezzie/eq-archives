<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay so this patch really hit alot of people hard. Some classes more than others<br />
<br />
From what i know and have seen the following got effected:<br />
<br />
Devices; Blaster Secondary~ Caltrops: got its duration decreased and its effect lessend. This is a very big hit for the devices line. Was it over powered...maybe but that line up front is not all that great till mid 20's. The other blaster secondarys blow this one away in the earlier levels, and can compete pretty well later on too. Caltrops is still &quot;okay&quot; once you slot it 6 times, now with 3 SO slows, and 3 SO recharge Reduc's.<br />
<br />
Hasten: The king has been slain! Hasten got its reusetime mega increased unofficially its now 12 - 15 minutes. Also, running hasten no longer decreases that delay. While this skill was mega over powered, it does hurt the scrapper the most. I can almost garuntee you every high level scrapper you see hast hasten, many of them built thier entire template around this power. While, thats always a bad practice, its kinda like eq end game, its built around the MT and the CH chain.<br />
<br />
Now, something that really hurts me as a radi / radi defender. Accelerate Metabolism got hit pretty hard. Yes with reuse reductions you could keep it up all the time, however since you put all your slots to reuse, the endurance you gained back from it was minimal. As a defender i still burn through endurace like there is no tomorrow, with only an AE heal that heals for beans compared to the single target empathy and even 02 burst from the Storm line, i have to usually pop heal when ever it comes up. Coupled with being radi / radi my debuffs eat endurance too. FFS they are making being a healer really freaking expensive.<br />
<br />
For Fire tankers burn got its damage halved. This i think was a decently warrented nerf. Burn tankers could solo like mad men. On victory there are already 3 37+ with one 40 burn tanker playing. Burn is still effective, just not that effective anymore.<br />
<br />
From my exp so far thats all i have heard about, add in anything else you may have found, since cryptic i guess doesn't bother to inform thier players on what they fix. *Note: im used to every mmo i have played to having patch notes on patcher. If its on some website some where that dissipates some of my anger, but not seeing what they fixed really set me off when i had to download the patch.*<br />
<br />
I think its really sad that on thier first patch they chose to nerf instead of fix the pathing issues / mob in wall issues. Like SoE when they patched they completely botched the Kinetics line for defenders, many of my defender friends say that over half thier powers no longer work at the moment. All in all some needed fixes, and somethings that need to be re evaluated.  Again i think the last stages of beta was focused on playing the game, and not looking for &quot;teh ubar stratz&quot; such as the ones they fixed. <br />
<br />
On the plus side they did fix that ever annoying sound when you had combat jump / super leap on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are in the process of patching the patch as I type this. I think some of the healing powers ended up a little bugged and not working as they meant to.<br />
<br />
Of course a patch message would be lovely so we'd have an idea of what was in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What?!? My combat/super jump lightsaber hum is gone? :lol<br />
<br />
That did annoy me (though I have to check whether they replaced it with something worse) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wish they'd get rid of that low level hum on focused fighting. It's really killing my love of the reflex power set.<br />
<br />
Of course I wish they'd get rid of the rings coming out of my butt with combat jump too, but I doubt that's going to happen. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if the nerfs will remain or not.  There will be patch notes in the future, the know they dropped the ball on that one...again.<br />
<br />
Telekensis also was nerfed to. No more bosses and end cost is  something crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the skill based system intead of loot, the nerfs hit much haarder.</div></div><hr />

Mind you, I mean no offense by this, But It hould be very difficult to be a combat healer as a Rad/rad defender. You are trying to put a square peg into a round hole if groups are relying on you as a main healer. Posts by Developer Geko on the main board made it clear that The only real healers are Empath Defenders, followed by Empath Controllers.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Rad Defenders are no good, I have one on my regular team, and he's great. But hes not a healer, any more than a Ranger is in EQ. Its jsut that refresh boost on AM and Hasten and the Recovery of AM allowed you to pound the square peg into the round hold with a really large mallet. But Buffs and Debuffs? They are great. <br />
<br />
Luckily, COH isn't quite as dependent on Healers as other MMOs are.<br />
<br />
And Hasten was way overpowered. It seems like a majority of players considered it a must-have power, central to their abilities. That screams overpowered to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Meddik, though I hate to say so considering how much I loved it :p<br />
<br />
However, since it no longer affects its own timer, I would really like to see the duration increased to 3 minutes, which means that with 3 SO redux enhancements on it, it will be 3 minutes on 3-7.5 minutes off. Then of course those who are dedicated can of course take all 6, making it perma if the lower recharge of 12 min is taken...but still, if it goes through it's really not so helpful anymore :(</div></div><hr />
