Twas an anazing turn of events that got me this great new breastplate. I am hunting in Lower Guk with good friends. We decide to venture into the live side since everything on the dead side was camped. The live side was a nice change of pace. Saw lots I had never seen before. Anyways, a fellow rogue and former guildmate, Telalun, knew I was in search of a Ravenscale Chastguard. At the time, he was hunting in Cazic Thule, and informed me of a warrior who was trading a Ravenscale Chest for warrior items. I ask the seller about it, and he informs me he would really like a crafted chestguard to finish his set. Meanwhile, Crystallion, a warrior in my guild was busy slaying ghouls on the dead side, and his group just received a Black Enamelled Breastplate! He tells me this, and knowing that if he wins this breastplate it would replace his old crafted breastplate, I pray to innoruuk that he is rewarded with it. With lots of luck, he WAS, and he let me use his old crafted breastplate in the trade with the warrior who had just received the ravenscale chestguard. So, was a great day for many. Crystallion got a new breastplate, A warrior finished his crafted suit, and I got my final piece of Ravenscale.<br />
