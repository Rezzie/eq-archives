<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-28-06, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what?  I can honestly say that two really popular animes that I just plain didn't like were Trigun and Kenshin.<br />
<br />
First of all, I don't like episodic shows.  If an entire story doesn't take more than 20 mintues to tell me, it probably wasn't worth telling me.  I love story arc.  Though, like Greldek says, I hate waiting for new episodes.  But unlike him, I just deal with it.<br />
<br />
Both Trigun and Kenshin start out episodic.  Trigun starts a story arc halfway through the series.  And Kenshin has a couple multiepisode arcs, and then ends on a big one(okay, it actually ends in fillers, but I don't count those).<br />
<br />
But the main problem I have with them, is I can't STAND pacifistic main characters.  Especially in shows that are supposed to be about fighting like Kenshin.  It just pisses me off to no end.  Especially when the bad guys run around killing people left and right, and the good guy could have saved alot of people by dealing with him right away.  But noooo, the good guy won't kill somebody.  It's wrong to kill!  Great, so instead of you killing that one evil guy, you half-ass your first fight with him, he kicks your ass, and then gets away and kills dozens of good people.  How the hell is that not your fault?!<br />
<br />
Also, Trigun pisses me off because EVERY town is full of backstabbing peasants.  It doesn't matter how many people he saves, how many children he keeps from getting killed, they always try and turn him in.  Yeah, your poor, I get it.  Suck it up and starve.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Akira blows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
YOU SIR BETTER HOPE SALLEY STRUTHERS DOESN&quot;T VISIT THIS FORUM!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, and on that note, I'm not really too impressed with Akira. It was an impulse buy at Wal*mart one night. <br />
<br />
However I do love Princess Mononoke, it's right up there with Titan A.E. in my favorite animated films list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">04-28-06, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yes, PM was fantastic.<br />
<br />
Akira is just...you know, I get it, the animation was like 10 years ahead of its time.  So artistically its amazing.<br />
<br />
But the whole thing is just bull****.  In the beginning, alot of boring/depressing **** happens.  Then alot of wierd **** happens.  Then there's a giant milky teddy bear that I still have nightmares about to this day.  Then more wierd **** happens, with some generally gross ****.  And then it all climaxes in one big abortion of &quot;Man...sucks to be them.......sucks to be me also, I just sat through this.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think this kinda applys more to Kenshin then trigun (I have more experiance with trigun then Kenshin...which ill admit i didnt find all that great)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Trigun pisses me off because EVERY town is full of backstabbing peasants.  It doesn't matter how many people he saves, how many children he keeps from getting killed, they always try and turn him in.  Yeah, your poor, I get it.  Suck it up and starve.<br />

<br />
Spoilered<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wtf do you expect from the ppl they think he was the reason that all these bad things are happening in the towns and **** b/c of what Knives did...Knives was the one who made the ppl hate him from the start of the show...(actually it was Knives plan but that mind controlling dude did most of the work).<br />
<br />
And about him being for not killing anyone...didn't the anime show you enough why he didn't want to kill anyone? Not everyone can be naruto/bleach etc ass-kickers and crap. Not *every* bad guy has be an ass-hole in the inside (Wolf Wood. Yes he was a bad guy but even he could change in the end). And you also have to consider the whole setting and all. I mean damn the whole world was all Fed up anyway so you had to stop the violence somehow...<br />
<br />
Anyway i think the anime kinda supported why he didnt kill anyone in itself. Not all heroes need to be able to kick ass in a bloody way sometimes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes Akira sucks. Prob worst anime I have seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bleach<br />
Paradise Kiss<br />
<br />
.. damn that was about it.  I've slacked off.  Nothing of the last year and a half has really grabbed me very much to be honest.  I tried Fate/Stay night, and it did absolutely nothing for me.  Naruto lost me with the filler.  Yay filler. <br />
-_-  I should look into groups that are doing older things that will likely never come here, but so many of those groups go depressingly slow.<br />
<br />
Stalk, how in the world you have that much time to obtain and watch all that anime is beyond me.  Do you have any interests outside of anime at this point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">04-28-06, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, similiar to Stalk I watch a ton of stuff.  But I must still bow to his list.  I pull a lot of what is suggested on here in reviews as fansubs but I am always way behind on watching the subs.  I keep watching my DVD's that I get about 3-8 a week of.  Then I have my weekly TV Shows like John Doe, Dr. Who, Smallville, Supernatural, ect.ect.  After that I watch Fansubs typically.<br />
<br />
Sometimes though, I wonder if Stalk even works. :b</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telurinon</div><div class="date">04-28-06, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't care for series that much, in general.  Sturgeon's Law applies to anime, as much as to any other medium, so most series are simply crap.  A number of 'popular' series were so awful I couldn't stand watching 'em.  Naruto, for instance, is a better version of Dragon Ball Z or whatever that silly show with the kid with the 'spirit gun' is on Cartoon Network.  Better, though, is still awful.<br />
<br />
There are exceptions:<br />
Serial Experiments Lain<br />
Berserk<br />
Key: The Metal Idol<br />
Trigun<br />
Cowboy Bebop<br />
FLCL (though, it's an acquired taste...)<br />
I even liked Ranma 1/2 for the first couple episodes.<br />
<br />
Movies and OVA's I tend to like much better, although the OVA's often suffer from the same problems that episodic series do.</div></div><hr />

I'm not particularly proud of my obession, I just thought others would like an idea of what I watch on a general basis. For what it's worth, what i listed above is only the stuff I watch as an episode gets released, not including the stuff I watch as &quot;filler&quot; in between (i.e. completed series, or low-priority active series such as Karin, Kage Kara Mamoru, etc)<br />

I don't keep my anime on my HD, I am on my third 500 DVD book of fansubs, so however many that is. I also have a large R1 DVD collection, but I put more effort into my figures than I do DVDs, which take up two bookshelves at the moment.<br />

Whats wrong with doing what makes you happy?<br />
<br />
And for geekyness if you buy 4.7gig DVDs you can get about 27 eps per DVD at about ~150-160MB.<br />
<br />
assumeing you have 1500 DVDs of anime you will have a total of 40500 anime eps on DVD :P.</div></div><hr />

Lol not all are filled to the max :p<br />
<br />
What's wrong with doing what makes you happy? I guess it depends.  It's a question of am I doing this to make myself happy, or to run away from reality? In general, I'm healthy, social with my co-workers but only one person I associate with outside of work is another geek who I've been friends with for 15 or so years. <br />

Am I really doing what's making me happy? Would I be happier going out, meeting girls and making friends, going out and seeing the world? Is that what I am running away from, subconsciously? I like to think not. <br />
<br />
Just little things like that. I do feel happy, just not proud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me it's:<br />
<br />
 Naruto (up to 181)<br />
 Bleach (up to 20-25 currently, need time)<br />
 Utawarerumono (up to 1 now, need time)<br />
 The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (up to 4)<br />
 Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (up to 1 now, need time)<br />
 Black Lagoon (up to 1 now, need time)<br />
<br />
<br />
Dunno if you have or haven't...But if you like suspense or mystery stuff be sure to check out Monster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen a few episodes of it on TV, but never got the time to grab 100+ episodes to watch it all. I might watch it once I find the time for it though. It was ok, but nowhere as good or fun as Naruto or Bleach. But then again I admit that I haven't watched it from the beginning of the series.<br />
<br />
Dunno if you have or haven't...But if you like suspense or mystery stuff be sure to check out Monster.<br />
Shadowcross, you would love Mushishi. I've always meant to tell you this. I think you would really enjoy Ginko's character.<br />
<br />
Thanks, I'll look into those. I'm always happy about new recommendations. (Yay, even more stuff I want to watch but don't have time for!)<br />
<br />
BTW, I really like Utawarerumono.. I saw the first 2 episodes by now. A- !<br />
<br />
And Stalk - there is nothing wrong with what you are doing. You enjoy manga, you know a lot about it - so more power to you! It's more envy speaking here.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, it's got it's share of god-awful ones also, but some of them are really good.<br />
<br />
Right now, One Piece is actually my favorite series.  And not just because both Naruto and Bleach are in fillers.  I mean taking each series as a whole.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
One Piece has the most god-awful dub, ever, SX. They completely butchered the series. Forget watching it on TV or picking up the english DVD's, watch the fansub version.<br />
 <br />
And yes, you should watch Mushishi. I like the soundtrack, so ambient yet awesome.</div></div><hr />

If Deviantart's anime is any indication of untalented wannbes then I can't blame you...</div></div><hr />

I must admit, thats where I was coming from as well. :blush  I spend a lot of time playing video games as well though, cuts into my anime watching.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, and DeviantArt Anime does suck.  And im worse that most of them at it so I dont even try.  It would be like a christian using the bible as a coloring book to me. :b</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Utawarerumono - up to 3 now: definitely going to continue watching it<br />
 Higurashi no Naku Koro ni - saw Ep. 2: good one, looking forward to 3+4<br />
 Black Lagoon - saw Ep. 2: not decided on this yet, it's not that awesome, but might continue it anyhow, although at low priority<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any good (legal) sources for Mushishi, Full Metal Alchemist, Monster, .hack// and One Piece? I take it they are all licensed, so there aren't any legal ones? :hmph Feel free to PM me :wink</div></div><hr />

Oh well hehe. Was hopein Monster would be good but I guess its not for everyone. I think if your not impressed by the first 1-12 eps then i doubt you will like it in the future. I would give it time tho it is a slow series.</div></div><hr />
