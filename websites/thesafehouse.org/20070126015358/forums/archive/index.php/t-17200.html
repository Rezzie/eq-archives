<br />
I'm a lvl 26 swashbuckler, and a lvl 47 carpenter.  My tradeskill level allowed me access to the zones I needed to race through in order to get the boots.  <br />
<br />
I used this (http://www.friendsnfun.net/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=454&amp;amp;PN=1) as a guide.<br />
<br />
It took me 8 or 9 hours to do the whole thing.  The hardest part for me was the zek race - I died 4 times there just tring to get the route down, having never entered the zone before.  <br />
<br />
Feerot I made the run on the second try.  Didn't die once, but at one point I was down to about 15% health, and my heart was pumping.  I got to the waterfall with  about 50% health, hit evac, and was whacked by a spider to drop me to 10% health and evac went off, lol.  OMG, I was on the edge of my seat for this run, it is TRULY one of the most exciting things I have accomplished in my MMO history.  Running through that jungle with aggro galore, never stopping, I felt like like I was being hunted.  I never looked back, not once, but I could hear the mobbs behind me the whole way.  The &quot;tat tat tat&quot; of their feet had me squirming in my seat, and going &quot;eeeeheeeheee!&quot; like a leetle geerl.<br />
<br />
This was a very well done quest by the dev team, and EQ2 does in fact rock if you are willing to put yourself to the test with it.  True, you can play pansy if you want to, and there's nothing wrong with it, but if you want to get hardcore with EQ2, it's totally there for you, I swear.<br />
