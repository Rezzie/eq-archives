In order to write around them, I've had to slightly alter the nature of some events, but thankfully not much.)<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
During my visit to Faydwer, I took an opportunity while Jherek was resting in Kaladim to have a bit of a look round myself.<br />
<br />
I'd travelled to Unrest looking for Zombies to take their skin, an ingredient in poison vials, and whilst there I hooked up with several people.  Most of them drifted away until I was left with a fellow Barbarian, a Shaman called Hamorr.  We left Unrest together and travelled through Crushbone, Greater Faydark and eventually wandered into Lesser Faydark, where we spent a futile time hunting for an Orc Chief's tongue which he needed in his quest for Totemic armour.<br />
<br />
This hunt came to an end when we heard a cry for people to gather for an expedition into Mistmoore Castle.  I only knew that place by reputation, and an evil reputation it was too.  We would have to tread carefully and be ready to run if we were rushed, but with care and luck we would get good loot and battle experience.<br />
<br />
It took Hamorr and myself a little while to get to Mistmoore entrance, due to unfamiliarity with the area and by this time forming a group wasn't quite straightforward.  However, an Enchanter whose name I have since forgotten agreed to join with Hamorr and I.<br />
<br />
I will admit that now I was here, my heart wasn't really set on battling near an entrance.  I had started the quest of Redemption, and in order to obtain the Gem of Stamina I had to fill a case with assorted drinks, one of them being Blood Spirits.  Unfortunately, only one thing in the whole of Norrath carried this particular liquor and that was a powerful creature called a Hemo Enologist, found deep within the castle, and it was a requirement of the quest that I had to take the spirits myself from its still-warm corpse.  The group I was in was not strong enough to even reach the area, let alone kill the creature; I needed stronger allies.<br />
<br />
Scuttlebutt told me the names of several powerful people known to be the Mistmoore.  One name in particular, Aumaar Ryell, a High Elf Cleric, stood out in my mind and on further investigation I was able to find out he and some friends were in the area and would be willing to help.<br />
<br />
Having secured this information, I explained to my erstwhile group what the situation was and that it was an opportunity I wanted to seize.  There was no way that we would be able to get there as a team.  Only stealth could be my friend in this situation.  Hamorr and the enchanter understood the nature of my task and so, after bidding them a fond farewell, I cloaked myself in shadows and silence and set off for the castle proper.<br />
<br />
How what followed next happened I know not, but I blacked out unexpedctedly and didn't come to for quite some minutes.  By some miracle I was unmolested, but there in front of me lay the corpse of Hamorr, lying broken and bloody on the floor.  I felt a great sadness and not a little guilt - would things have turned out differently if I had been there to fight with him?<br />
<br />
I put the thoughts of regret out of my mind.  My path was now clear, I had to press on with my quest.  Making sure that I was hidden from normal sight, I crept quietly into that castle.<br />
<br />
I wish that I had taken the time to find and study a travellers map of the area, for I knew they existed, but this opportunity had come upon me without chance of proper preparation and so the castle was a closed book to me.  I knew where in relation to me Aumaar and his colleagues were; I knew how to get from where I was back to Lesser Faydark, but no matter what corridors I took nor what rooms I entered, I was unable to reach them.  I could even hear them through the wall at one stage, I got so close, but finding my way through was proving to be an intractable problem.<br />
<br />
I was on the verge of giving up when a message reached from me from Aumaar, telling me to meet Maija, one of his friends, near the entrance.  She would guide me to the Hemo Enologists lair.<br />
<br />
Maija turned out to be a Wood Elf Druid of more than fair countenance.  I did not let myself be distracted by such things though for there was a job at hand and it would be disrespectul to a lady well versed in magical arts and who had considerably more battle experience than I.<br />
<br />
A few spells to aid our journey later we were heading into the castle, Maijas sure steps guiding me on the way.  We quickly got to where Aumaar and the rest of his companions regained their strength and energies between battles, and once there I was introduced to them all.  Bummy, a huge and good natured Troll Warrior; Malic, a Dark Elf Necromancer of quiet nature; and of course Aumaar.  He told me that we were also going to be joined by another Barbarian Rogue called Icebreaker who fought with them on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
They were not due to take on the Hemo Enologist for a little while, so I was invited to stay with them for a while and share their camp, an offer I was very happy to take them up on as it is rare enough that I get to see a group of veterans of many battles taking down powerful opponants, let alone be able to fight with them.<br />
<br />
Of course I was going to fight with them - if my contributions meant that the foe was brought down just before it could strike rather than just after then I would have made a difference.  I could have just kept quietly in the corner, skulking in the shadows and staying out the way, but where would the excitement have been in that?<br />
<br />
Several fights happened before Icebreaker joined in and I was there for them all, stabbing backs, using my whip, trying to land as much damage as I could.  I was careful though, and I chose my targets with a clear head making sure that they were well engaged with one of the others before joining in.<br />
<br />
Once Icebreaker had arrived and the group was complete, it was time to get ready to slay the Hemo Enologist.  A last bit of clearing the immediate area ensued, and then it was the Enologists turn to receive our attentions.<br />
<br />
It was a quick, bloody fight.  Several of us were involved in bringing it down whilst the rest held off its companions.  We landed blow after blow on it, bringing it closer and closer to death until finally, I landed the last blow that ended its monstrous life.<br />
<br />
It amazed me too, at the time.  Bristlebane was certainly smiling on me that day!<br />
<br />
The Hemo Enologist had two bottles of blood spirits on its corpse.  I took only one, as we had heard another Rogue on the path of Redemption was on his way looking for some.<br />
<br />
I was there for a little while longer, fighting alongside my new friends and enjoying every minute of it.  In their generosity I was allowed to take quite a reasonable amount of loot as they would be there for some time and would be unable to carry it all themselves.  Bummy was especially good to me for before I left - he offloaded several useful and valuable items onto me that I could either use or sell for reasonable amounts.  However, it soon came time for me to go.  Maija generously offered me a teleport out which I gratefully accepted, and I soon found myself in Steamfont.  A short journey returned me to Kaladim where I was able to meet back up with my friend Jherek and tell him the good news, and put the precious bottle of blood spirits in the drinks case.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
EPILOG: Since then, I have finished that part of the quest for Redemption and I now possess the Gem of Stamina.<br />
<br />
Aumaar told me in conversation that he was going to form a new guild, with the others in that group to become many of the guild officers.  This has since happened.  A couple of weeks later, Jherek and I fulfilled our pact to join the same guild when we were invited by Aumaar himself into the Reapers of Fate.  I look forward to interesting times ahead... <br />
