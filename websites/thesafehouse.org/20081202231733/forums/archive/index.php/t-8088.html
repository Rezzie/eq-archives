<br />
Cut the crap the progression for the creation of an advanced poison should be like so...<br />
<br />
<br />
advanced vial sketch + large block of clay<br />
flask of water + skin (purchased from a tanner killing level 5 bears doesn't add to the experience thanks) = advanced vial<br />
<br />
firing sheet + vial = finished vial<br />
<br />
celestial susp(purchsed)<br />
<br />
common poison component (purchased)<br />
<br />
dose of rare poison component (farmed)<br />
<br />
vial + susp + component 1 + component 2 = poison<br />
<br />
8 components 3 steps and your done what a concept...<br />
<br />
ADD MEANING AND INTEREST TO THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERING THE POISON SYSTEM<br />
<br />
If you want to add another time sink that actually makes sense how about this...<br />
<br />
Make the creation of a given poison fail without a certain char flags.<br />
<br />
These flags will be obtained by questing. The addition of virtual spaces means that these quests could be designed to be done only with difficulty solo by the rogue without worrying about rogue + 5 friends gimping the encounter. There should be a heavy emphasis on stealth and careful and selective use of force.<br />
<br />
The npc that gives the quest should give you the recipe by direct tell and flag you upon completion.<br />
<br />
LIMIT THE NEED TO CONSTANTLY FARM<br />
<br />
The idea that poison components should drop off mobs that you might actually consider killing for experience, fun, loot is a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Now we need to get the fact that killing in x zone to get x ingredient may well be fun but doing it again and again just ot use a certain poison probably isn't.  Fact is each hour of poison hunting should yield enough of that poison to last through 10 hours of hunting. Id say that <br />
<br />
The way you cram that much of an ingredient into a small space is via distilations that are basicly charged items that summon a dose of the ingredient when clicked.<br />
<br />
Id say they should be combined in the corpse bottle via this recipe.<br />
<br />
5 shissar venom sacs + small bottle <br />
(stackable before combine) = bottle of shissar venom<br />
<br />
8 bottles of shissar venom + large bottle<br />
(stackable before combine) = 100 charge distilation:shissar venom</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DominionAssassin</div><div class="date">10-27-02, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am intrigued by the new poison system and to see how it will work out in the long run. I have prolly devoted 30-40% of my playing time to the art of poison. Most of it is very situational but I find it does add an extra dimension to your skills.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
I am seeing the same effects, only a different way to make and inflict them. This is where i find the shortcoming of poison.<br />
<br />
Where is my Pacify/Mez/Memblur poison? Im sure there is some vial substance somewhere that when introduced into the bloodstrem would paralyze you and wrack your brain so intensely that for a breif moment you are completely unaware of your surroundings.. .. I.E.  There are 2 mobs, you can only take them out one at a time.. you are alone.. Whip up a quick dose.. Hit the first one, and while he is totally blitzed, the 2nd one follows you to your ambush spot and by the time the first comes out of his trance, he doesnt know to go after you!<br />
<br />
And where is my Charm poison? There are certainly compounds and solutions that might make a person susceptible to suggestions.. Once they have been injected, they will pretty much go along with whatever you tell them.. AND would not neccessarily know enough about you to send anyone after you.. .. I.E. There is a need for a distraction.. Whip up a quick dose.. SNeak up and inject a victim.. send him in as a distraction to them 3 see-invis mobs.. and then casually sneak on by while they are tearing your guy to pieces and since he was in no state to tell them you sent him, they would not even bother chasing after you because he was &quot;Your Pet&quot; or whatnot.<br />
<br />
I dunno.. maybe too much to ask.. but I've been asking for them for years hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zogin</div><div class="date">10-28-02, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With lots of help from Osprey, I managed to get the ball rolling for myself with the poison skill, so I thought Ill just comment the wish list list.<br />
<br />
As for the way to make vials, suspensions, resin I dont think its terribly bad, Its a whole lot of clicking. If VI wants to stay firm on how much these things are supposed to cost, then just please up the prices further and increase te yield instead.<br />
I rather pay 10times as much to yield 20. Sure it would be nice if it didnt cost as much, but for me this is too much fun to miss out on regardless what it cost. I would like to see all the Tier 1 ingredients being Vendor sold.<br />
<br />
Even with 250skill and Seal I failed a lot (failed like 1/4) of the Tier2 advanced poisons, so it means that Poison mastery will really help. I know Osprey has atleast PM1 and he seems to fail a whole lot less.<br />
<br />
As for the effects and the procrate they really need to soup it up. With 265DEX it didn't seem to proc very often.<br />
Effects on my wishlist would be different bane bonuses added to weapon for a duration instead. <br />
A really wild idea that prolly would be a pain to code would be a 8slot container endless quiver, where you could link the poisons to the spell buttons. Even if its not endless it would be pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Overall I really like the changes. Hopefully VI will listen to peoples comments about Poison and do something about it.<br />
<br />
