<br />
I just wanted to give a heads up to anyone considering purchasing Atari's computer version of Gygax's classic Greyhawk adventure, &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; ....<br />
<br />
DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
At least not YET...<br />
<br />
It is in DESPERATE need of a patch.   It is absolutely riddled with bugs such as unfinished/broken quests, mobs spawning inside of walls upon party resting (making said mobs uncombatable, and because it is totally turn based, you CANNOT just run away to end combat!!), the game will &quot;hang&quot; on a turn, making ctrl+alt+delete a common feature of the game, etc. <br />
<br />
The game is SO damn buggy, it is just plain hell to try and play for any extended period.<br />
<br />
And OMG, if you haven't already picked up this game, you have NO idea how frustrating this is because .....LOL in every other respect the game cries out &quot;I rock!!!!   Without these bugs I would be soooooo fkin fun to play omg&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, of all games with major bugs I have EVER played, this one is by far THE most frustrating in the truest sense, because it otherwise is sooo sweet.<br />
<br />
Character creation is the best of any D&amp;amp;D game I have ever seen,  graphics are a delight, combat is THE BEST there ever was.  I mean, I used to HATE turn based play in computer games, but this is something different - each turn here seems very important, very tactical and very exciting.  Turn-based play has never been done so well, period.<br />
<br />
Really this looks to be the best combat-focused D&amp;amp;D game ever, and it is bugged to ALL HELL AND BACK!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Wait for the patch (supposedly coming late october, we'll see).<br />

<br />
Is it the end of the world? nope.<br />
<br />
Is it even something I worry about after I've installed the fan patch? Sorry, what was the question; I was too busy playing ToEE....<br />
<br />
However, if the Hardcore mode appeals to you, you'd best wait for the official patch.  Losing characters due to bugs makes one hulk out.  And in hardcore you can't just quickload it all back. Ninen of Saryrn<br />

-Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying &quot;End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH,&quot; the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.</div></div><hr />
