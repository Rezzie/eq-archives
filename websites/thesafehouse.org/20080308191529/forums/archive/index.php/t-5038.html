<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shonuff123</div><div class="date">04-23-02, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, All:<br />
      Even though I visit this site often, this is my first post. And, I must say you guys are crushing all of my hopes. These observations made(in the 'I Hate Stun/Mez' thread) about killing a smite cleric are...discouraging...to say the least. Just the other day, I thought I had found a viable way of dealing with a smite cleric. But, after reading the posts of you, more experienced assassins, it looks like I just got lucky. And, ran across an inexperienced gamer or got a lucky crit off. CRAP!!<br />
My kobold critblade is only 22nd lvl. And, doesn't have the more infamous styles and combos(G/AH, PA, etc...). Though garrotte is coming next level(drools). As brief as I can make it; I BS2'd an orange smite cleric with my 2H sword. Sword is non-magical. Used snare poison. Switched to 1H sword/shield(both magical). Thigh Cut,  using disease poison. At this point he either stunned or mezzed me. I don't know which. He backed away and nuked me. I used sprint. Switched back to my 2h while running. Hit him with 'Assault' and ran through him to be out of his LOS before hitting 'stick'. Switched back to 1H/Shield. He cast something else which hurt. I smacked him with 'Assault' again. At this point, neither of us were looking too healthy. He then panicked and tried to run away.  Disease kept him from running very fast and I was 'stuck' to him. I had almost no endu, or no endu left. But, finished him with a couple more swings.<br />
Now this was in the newbie BG. So, inexperience may have been a factor in this encounter. I have a 41st lvl troll warrior. And, 30th troll skald. So, I am not unfamiliar with meleeing. <br />
 The factors that I know were in my favor were that (1.) I knew the specific target I was after. (2.) I could envenom my blades specifically for that target before entering battle. (3.) And, of course, stealth and being the one that actually initiated the fight. I am not highly specced in envenom. Only at lvl6. I didn't really expect to live through the fight. And, in fact, didn't live much longer after his buddies turned around. :-) I was 'taking one for the team', so to speak. That cleric was a key factor in the Alby tanks ripping our tanks apart in a decent sized battle. About 20~ Albs against 20~ Mids. And, I was just hoping to tie him up long enough for a skald or healer to get behind the lines to mez him. <br />
Mistakes on his part(1.)Not healing himself. Also, he took his time about backing up(cocky bastard); instead of turning and running and then re-facing. That's why I don't know if he stunned or mezzed me. The stun could've been wearing off and the nuke hit was simoultaneous. Which would make it just a coincidence. Or, he mezzed me. Nuked me and broke his own mez. <br />
(2)He didn't call for help- just plain stupid. RvR is a team sport, IMO. And, no one seems to be worth over 2rps apiece in the newb BG. So, it wasn't worth the thrill of a solo kill when he could've just typed 'on me' or 'help'.<br />
3. Not using a stealther bodyguard. And, believe me, I do alot of that kind of work out there and I've never hurt for action. :-)<br />
But, what I had truly hoped was that the combination and order in which I chose my poisons were a major factor. Snare, for obvious reasons. Disease to knock down his stats and make him have to waste time and mana to heal himself or have his spells severely affected when trying to support his tanks. Remember, I didn't expect to actually *live* through the fight. Just needed to inject the 'nasties' into his sorry backside and hope we prevailed. And, I could get a rez. <br />
BTW, we won! And, they ended up chasing the Albs back to their PK. Of course, I was one of the very last  to finally get a rez... They decided to camp the Alb PK for awhile- which is a useless waste of time; instead of coming back to the bridge and rezzing those of us that had died- for you peeps familiar with the BG area.  And, I very nearly released out of frustration over lack of team attitude. My attack was coordinated with the others' main charge through groupchat. So, everyone knew what was going on. <br />
So, am I completely wrong about how the disease poison would affect a caster? I've seen the poison tests. But, don't remember seeing any tests performed on a caster.</div></div><hr />

Clerics have insta-heals, (a) he used it prior to your fight within a few minutes (b) he was too paniced to think about using it.<br />
<br />
BG1 you'll get lucky alot, because players are trying to figure out the best way to RvR for thier playing style. it will slowly change in BG2 and BG3 on to full RvR in frontiers, by that time, players know the in's and out's of thier class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">04-23-02, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually a smite cleric in the bg1 very well may not have any instants yet (well other than mez). You need to raise rejuv to 11 to get the first instant (40% heal). Don't get the second instant (group heal) until 23 in rejuv.<br />
<br />
Even with not having an instant he did make a mistake. After he mezzed you (clerics don't get instant stuns) he should have moved back to max range, smited, stunned, smite, smite, then melee with drive evil (PBAE shout on a timer).<br />
<br />
Smite clerics are nasty. IMO thier lesser dmg is offset by their cc abilities. <br />
<br />
Of course I don't fight any cc class. I hate being stunned/mezzed. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
two clerics? on the spiral up to the lord, keeping my entire force pinned. I sneak up, take one out, other retreats. I rest up, people in lord room, pinned by the second healer. I go up, take them out. group is on the lord, now this is where it gets downright stupid.<br />
<br />
A group of albs comes rushing the keep and *one* smite cleric gets into the lord room.<br />

turns to me with absolutely no rest time, stun, smite smite smite dead, turns to the first person in the lord room, and I assume did the same thing (could not see, wall was in my way).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shonuff123</div><div class="date">04-24-02, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I guess I'll have to learn to live with smite clerics even with my SB(sighs). My 41st warrior, of course, stands almost no chance against one. With My skald, I've learned to just skald stun(really a mez) them and leave them for later. But, that's makes me feel like a complete wimp when I do that. I've also been able to counter with my skald songs. IMO, the skald is the best class in Midgard for dealing with those evil beasts. I've used my speed, 2h hammer, DD's, snares, and stun to some good effect out there against them. But, again, that depends on who sees who first. What has been cast, etc.... Also, the kills were all in the BG's. I don't know how I'll fare against them in later levels. Probably, just as poorly as every other tank class. :-)<br />
But, since this is a rogue forum, I was more concerned about my critblade. And, figured you more experienced killers may be able to guide me. Is there anyone that knows what effects disease poison would have on a smite cleric? Or, have a guess as to which poisons they think would work best against them. I use a 2h sword to BS2(with snare)/Thigh Cut . Then switch to 1h/shield(disease). I rarely use L-A. And, don't really ever plan to. LA 8- and, emergency use only. <br />
Or, am I going to have to deal with them as a SB the same way I deal with them as my massive, over-muscled troll warrior....see what *might* be a smite cleric...run away like a little girl from an icky spider. <br />
Any data on other casters would be welcomed, also. Of course, most other classes of casters don't seem to live long enough for it to matter once one of us assassin-types have given him a sudden introduction to the sharp end of our favored weapon. Thx in advance for any help.<br />

35Smite, 25Rejuv, 11Enhance so far.<br />
<br />
Just some notes / thoughts -<br />
<br />
23 or 35 are good stopping points for most clerics that are not full smite. The differences are as follow -<br />
<br />
At 23 smite spec you have a 19second PBAoE Mez.<br />
At 35 smite spec you have a 25second PBAoe Mez.<br />
<br />
It usually not real difficult to last another 5 seconds and get it off a second time for another 12 second mez or so.<br />
<br />
Plus the 8 (or 9 if you are 46th level) second single target casteable (non-instant) stun.<br />
<br />
If you are full spec smite you have access to a 30second PBAoE Stun, a 200ish dmg PBAoE nuke, a 400ish dmg single target nuke, a 9 second single target casteable (non-instant) stun, and a damage buff that lets you mash peeps with your hammer for 125 to 150 damage on a consistent basis as well as the single target instant heal.<br />
<br />
I also run with about 1200hp buffed and with items, have seen a few 50th level clerics hit close to 1500hp with the right buffs and items.<br />
<br />
I know someone may nail me with this, but it should be fairly common knowledge, it's never the assassin with Lifebane we fear. We fear the assassin with the disease based poisons that prevent magical healing, if your going to take out any cleric that is worth their salt, you almost have to land that disease poison on your first dagger and lifebane on the second.

 <br />
 So there you have it folks.. &quot;Smite is right!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Think assassins are overpowered? Then take a good look at some of the other classes and talk to a few level 50s in them.. Here is a short list of classes that are fun and powerful to play in DAoC. <br />
-Cleric<br />
-Thane<br />
-Bard<br />
-Armsman (can 1-2 shot you, &quot;if&quot; they get near you) <br />
-Skald <br />
-Eldritch<br />
-Scout<br />
-Hunter<br />
-Ranger <br />
<br />
Get use to feeling powerful when you play online games like this.. DAoC is not like EQ and other games where the answer is to make you feel weak compaired to the world your in. DAoC is all about being &quot;the hero&quot; and powerful enough to make a difference. <br />
 <br />
 That is why I play DAoC over all other games, it's a great game and feeling powerful after a long days work or school is just what many of us want. <br />
 <br />
 Take care! <br />

All they have to do after mezzing you is to cast their cure disease spell and then heal up.  Best way to take a smite cleric is tag team.  While one eats the mez the other approaches and uses the clerics standing still to cast as a easy line up for a PA. Zedisa - Nightshade TL</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 Sure I will explain.   <br />
 <br />
 Bards are a fun and powerful class to play. Just like the healer class in Midgard. You can talk to healers and they will tell you they are broken (I agree I have a level 31 healer). But the class is powerful.<br />
 <br />
 Bards have power in their ability to spec in a manner that fits how they wish to play, it is a very flexible class. To many people this means fun.. this means power.<br />
 <br />
 If I lead you to believe that any of these classes were &quot;overpowered&quot; I am sorry. What I was trying to show is that &quot;many&quot; of the classes out there are POWERFUL in some way. And as such, assassins are well within the curve on classes and power in DAoC.<br />
 <br />
 Healers need some love.. Bards need a good amount of attention from mythic too. But these classes are indeed powerful to the point some are already saying they are overpowered on their own boards. Just go read them.. so many classes have people on their own boards crying for a way to &quot;prevent&quot; a nerf, because they are not use to having power like DAoC gives us.<br />
 <br />
 Just for information.. If anyone does not already know.. Mythic is not looking to &quot;balance&quot; classes. They have always said that they were trying to make sure that &quot;REALMS&quot; were balanced. And that is why things are the way they are. <br />
 <br />
 It's not &quot;even&quot; melee for each realm or &quot;even&quot; magic for each realm. It's an offsetting of the two. Balancing magic against might and brut force, that's what they are doing. A good hint at this is to look at what the relics are.. yep each realm has 2.. a power (magic), and a strength (melee) relic. That is the balance folks.<br />
 <br />
 Mid is to the melee side of the balance tables.. and hib is to the magic side of the balance tables.. with the lovely Camelot of alb sitting right in the middle of the balance tables. So on your server, which way is the table tilting? Now take a look at all the servers and see how your realm is doing there. It's just something to think about.<br />
 <br />
 As many games in the past have found out.. trying to balance classes is just to much of a problem for any game that plans to keep adding new content for their paying customers. By having the &quot;vision&quot; to look at the big picture and only balance 3 realms against each other, you can do much much more and allow some classes to be powerful and fun to play, and not cookie cutter for all the realms.<br />
 <br />
 I am rambling.. I am sorry   <br />
 <br />
 Take care   <br />

As it has been stated above, unless you want a quik trip home, I would advise against taking on clerics as a melee class. Taking an archer or waht not is a good idea, but maybe a mage class is even better, esp for Hibs as you can return the stun favour in kind.<br />
I don't think disease is the way to go. i think your best chance is to land a dot, which might stop him from following his mezz with stuns and smites. Another option is to try to restealth. As he backs away from where he insta mezzed you, you may be able to get away from the stun.<br />
The only tactic I can think of, would involve landing dot with a PA, and then sprinting out of his mezz range which is comparativly short because it is PBAE. If you make it out of this range you should be able to get restealthed before he can land anymore spells. at which point you come back for a second go.<br />

But, probably wouldn't unless my tanks were really getting chewed up by him again. <br />
  I agree that I probably got lucky. But, to my understanding, due to a bug,  or game demographics, or whatever; only the first tic of DOT poison will interrupt a caster. And, probably wouldn't stop his instant at all. <br />
  I could definitely be wrong on that one. Can anyone set the record straight for me, please?<br />
 And, I am now sure that disease really screws up heals. I have since duo'd with a hunter on a tank. I hit him with disease with the first shot. And, his cleric couldn't heal him. We killed the armsman and actually got away from the cleric only because we were so close to our PK. <br />
  He could've been a rejuv cleric. I dunno. And again, this was in the lowest BG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Occito</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to kill a smite cleric, is with a partner. Simply put, if you attack an even con smiter who is not AFK solo, and they know what they are doing. You die. The best tactic is to attack clerics in pairs. First guy goes in, gets mez'd. Cleric begins to back off to smite/stun combo, or to cure disease/poison. At this point the cleric is completely and 100% at the mercy of a second person. His mez timer is 30 seconds. His mez doesnt last ALL that long. So if you havent killed him by the time his mez timer repops, your budy is about to come unmez'd with sleep spell immunity. Chances are this cleric has used his instant if he is still alive at this point, and its only a matter of finishing him off.<br />
<br />
I play a smite cleric, and that is how steathers kill me. One guy baits me into dropping my mez, and the second rushes in and denies me the ability to do anything but melee or run. I can't tell you how many times a multi waved stealth attack completely and utterly destroyed me ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cougar Pak</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">smite clerics are my most feared targets in RvR.. I have yet to take an even con or orange out solo yet (48 ns). I have successfully taken a blue smite cleric out (did that just tonight actually). I had to switch to a low delay weapon (I usually use an Arc GR), loaded up with Lifebane and Disease and caught her sitting, PA'ed and CD'ed (normally, with my Arc GR, I never land CD so I'm sitting there mezzed, while they stun then smite the fek outa me). I punched viper after I saw the dot landed, and the next Dot tick killed her.. hehe<br />
<br />
Although we do get a bonus to their chain... smite clerics can really mess up our day. We usually can't kill them before our CD stun gets off.. and if we don't catch them sitting, they will more than likely get their insta mez off on us, at which point they can stun and smite us down with relative ease. I have yet to live from an encounter in which a smite cleric landed stun on me. They can just nuke for too damned much.<br />
<br />
I'm also beginning to fear Merc's a bit... but I think I got dirty tricked that fight :&quot;&gt;  ... but I digress</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Stryhf</div><div class="date">05-22-02, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;&gt; If I lead you to believe that any of these classes were &quot;overpowered&quot; I am sorry. What I was trying to show is that &quot;many&quot; of the classes out there are POWERFUL in some way. And as such, assassins are well within the curve on classes and power in DAoC.<br />
<br />
Grouping Bards with Healers is a disservice to Bards.  They're not even the same class when it comes to CC.<br />
<br />
5 forms of CC, 2 forms are insta-cast, and 5 separate immunity timers versus 1 form of CC?<br />
<br />
What does a Bard do when you perf them?  They typically die.  If not from the initial perf (a lucky Critblade can still one-shot a Bard).  Land the Creeping Death and before the stun wears off it's often lights out.  A Cleric or Healer, if attentive have methods of avoiding that secondary attack, a Bard does not.<br />
<br />
You go to the Bard boards, and you'll hardly see us cowering to protect ourselves from nerfs like you'll see Clerics, Healers, Minstrels or Skalds (all classes doing very well on Modred right now).  You'll see them basically saying they're beyond fed up and disillusioned.  The fact that people still classify Bards with Healers is a significant issue.<br />
<br />
Ask any Inf or SB, given a choice between a Bard, Healer, Cleric or Druid, which is the easier kill?  You can't really classify Bards as a melee capable priestly hybrid, unless friars or wardens, our spec paths do not compliment weapon usage.  Nurture is completely and utterly mutually exclusive with melee usage.  The lines relatively are anemic compared to any other realm's and this is by DESIGN.<br />
<br />
Our spec choices are supposed to be diluted, we ARE a hybrid.  Contrary to how Bards would LIKE to play their class, we are not a primary CC class, which is why we are NOT granted 2 forms of CC, or an insta/quick-cast version of those spells (and this is across ALL realms and for all mez casters).</div></div><hr />

<br />
To kill a smite cleric.<br />
<br />
Disease and Purge.<br />
Disease and Partner.<br />
<br />
Disease is a major pain in the ass and will do more to help you win than anything else you can do solo.<br />
<br />
clerics have <br />
<br />
PBAE MEZ instant up to 30 seconds on a 30 second recast timer.<br />
2 second castable Stun up to 9 seconds<br />
<br />
Then they have <br />
3 second baseline smite DD's<br />
4 second specline smite DD's<br />
PBAE instant Smite DD on a 20 second recast timer.<br />
A nice specline Damage Add that makes them do decent melee damage.<br />
<br />
Then they have <br />
1 instant single target heal (usually 60%)<br />
1 instant group heal (usually 40%)<br />
<br />
Not to mention any realm abilities.<br />
<br />
If you can screw up their 2 Crowd Control spells (purge and pray or a partner) and limit their healing from instants (disease) then they are toast, otherwise, don't even attempt one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Snoopdog</div><div class="date">05-29-02, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you had better pray that the smite cleric doesnt have purge or resist the gimpy disease poison :-( or have a partner himself....<br />
<br />
clerics arent worth the effort to kill - leave it to the longer range casters of your realm or wait till they are stunned/mezzed :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ingo</div><div class="date">06-03-02, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds very much like that cleric was not experienced, the fact that he mezzed you and then immediately nuked you shows that.<br />
<br />
If we was good, he would have backed off, healed himself, then stunned you for a few seconds THEN nuked you once or twice while you sat there.<br />
<br />
I have a smite cleric but actually had to bring the smite spec up for bg fun.  The only assassin class I had a problem with once was a night shade, that insta nuke allowed him to interrupt a stun cast and run away to get friends.  I still got him, but got owned myself 10 seconds later by his friend (what can I say, I was stubborn and wanted him...)<br />
<br />
You see a lot of that in the bg, the first solo kill my cleric had was an enchanter who ran almost right up to me with his pet (why I do not know...).  Needless the say, he died along with his pet, but strangely enough he kept trying to cast while i was meleeing him down at the end.<br />
<br />
The smite cleric is indeed powerful, but lord knows I have been owned a few times.  Their main weakness is their range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 50th cleric with the Uber template will have a 48 smite 23 Rejuv and the rest into enhance<br />
<br />
They have:<br />
Single Target Instant heal ~600 points (15 minute Recast)<br />
Group Instant heal ~600 points (20 Minute Recast)<br />
<br />
PBAE Mezz duration 30 sec (30 Sec recast time)<br />
PBAE DD ~150 Damage (20 sec recast)<br />
<br />
Target Stun 9 sec duration 3 sec cast time<br />
Target DD ~280 Damage 4 sec cast time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Stryhf</div><div class="date">06-05-02, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;&gt; Target Stun 9 sec duration 3 sec cast time<br />
<br />
That's a single target stun on a 2.5sec base casting time, with self dex, that's very close to 2.2sec.  As low as 2.0 if you get +75 dex due to items.<br />
<br />
Self damage add +9.2 DPS, which means you're not slouch when it comes to melee'ing.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the 122 base damage ranged AE spell, pretty hefty power cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KaedenKy</div><div class="date">06-05-02, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics with a the general full smite template have a great weakness it is called spirit resist.  Second our smite range is patheticly short...so yes bring an archer, archers and caster classes teamed with anyone take me down so fast i want to cry. <br />
<br />
It is simply because my mez and insta heals are on timers from hell and if you can trick me into using them then it is taht much easier to win.<br />
<br />
As for a solo go against a cleric i would say use dot poison and disease.  You can hope he is stupid and doesnt cure disease first and lastly use a fast weapon and try to get cd off to stun him.<br />
<br />
Overall the best tactic on a smite cleric is bait him with a stealther and then have an archer or something pop out.<br />
<br />
This tactic also works well with an assassin waiting in back and a speed class running up to the cleric forcing him to blow his mez...<br />
<br />
Basically the rule of the day is make the smite cleric blow his baby pbaoe mez on a 30 second timer and then beat the tar out of him.<br />
<br />
Smite clerics can melee decently, but if you are beating him down and he is diseased he hasnt a chance in hell vs an assassin.  You just need someone to go up and take the mez.<br />
<br />
This also makes this class a perfect canidate for purge because the mez is on a timer...so it clearing all your mezzes doesnt matter. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qweyesth</div><div class="date">06-06-02, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting Dulsin / Vulture. I did not believe there was anything &quot;Messed Up&quot; about my post.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are full spec smite you have access to a 30second PBAoE Stun, a 200ish dmg PBAoE nuke, a 400ish dmg single target nuke, a 9 second single target casteable (non-instant) stun, and a damage buff that lets you mash peeps with your hammer for 125 to 150 damage on a consistent basis as well as the single target instant heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is what I said. And at 50th level with a 42S 25R 22E spec, the above list is fairly close. The difference are that I don't have the 30 second PBAOE Mez (You get that at 44S spec), mine is only 25 seconds. I do around 200hp with my PBAoE Nuke, around 400 with my single target nuke (although the one at 48S spec will do more than that), I do have the 9 second stun, and my damage buff (not the highest level one which comes with 50S) lets me hit for roughly 100pts. I also have a single target and group instant heal as well as decent secondary enhancement buffs.<br />
<br />
There is a significant difference between 42S and 48 through 50S however I did not believe the extra 5 second mez and extra damage were worth it. I am running around 1600hp at 50th and close to 700AF, 255Str, 245Con 202Dex, 143Quick and 202Piety (Capped). I am very happy with the template so far.<br />
<br />
As for the Assassin / Stealth classes and how clerics fair in RvR, well solo one on one it is always a matter of the PBAoe Mez being resisted or not. Disease based poison does help against us. So does having a backup or two person hunting team, it is fairly easy to get a cleric to throw their PBAoE Mez initially. Although a good counter tactic is always moving a bit first then throwing your PBAOE DD, then the Mez, sometimes you'll catch the second person if they are stealthed and are to close to the action. I always try to at least Duo out in the frontier, soloing is still fairly risky even with the get of of jail free PBAOE Mez.<br />
<br />
I don't fear the soloing stealthers much although they can scare the living heck out of you at times. Makes you keep your hands on the keyboard though  <br />

<br />
You started talking about the &quot;30second PBAoE Stun&quot; which is a very common mistake. Full smite clerics have a 30second PBAoE Mezz. The difference is one is broken by damage the other is not. If smiters had them both then they would be in desperate need of the nerf bat.<br />

Was running from crunch to alb wall and low and behold a cleric pops around the hill to spy on crunchy.  The only other person that was there was another 50 NS.  I asked if they saw the cleric (lvl 50 btw) and headed that way. Yep they saw him and i moved up for the first strike knowing i would die easy.  I perfed and and CD'd = stun lead with a snare poison switched weps and went for garrote combo, her mistake was she turned and ran so i kept following behind garrote garrote garrote. She stopped mezzed at this time my friend was able to perf combo her. She did 2 insta heals but we finished the job and no-one died.  <br />
<br />
1. 2 on 1 odds against a smite are needed.<br />
2. Element of surprise when they see 2 people usually they turn and run.<br />
3. Carry more than 1 xtra poisoned wep. I care 1 in the 2 handed slot with poison on it and 2 in my pack with xtra poisons.  It really helps on the purge and insta heals. You also never know when another foe may step up to become your next victim.<br />
<br />
If i had not snared her twice then we would have lost. <br />
<br />
just my 2 coppers worth.</div></div><hr />
