<br />
I was there last night with Marchand and two others with the help of The Maerlain Consortium, Havenlight, and various other guilds we assembled in kithicor forest and took down 4 generals in less than two hours.<br />
<br />
Thanks go to every one who showed up and especially to Rindain who organized it and led the raid.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />

I really need to get going on my epic, and I'm glad to hear that it's possible to assemble a crack-kithicor team on Xegony</div></div><hr />

<br />
origionally I was gonna make a small 2 group raid thurs nite to farm kith for kedge robes and maybe a general if enough show up for someone I know, was thinking 7est.<br />
<br />

Next time anyone is planning something, I hope they'll post it, as I and perhaps my guildmates would love to comel try to come. I really need to get my box to hand in anyway, so I'm just as glad I didn't miss that chance on Thurs.<br />
