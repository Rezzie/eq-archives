<br />
My question is this.. is a crush merc worth anything? I've read quite a bit on various forums about the merits of slash vs thrust, but nobody mentions crush. Why?<br />
<br />
FYI, my proposed merc template is either:<br />
a) 50 DW, 50 Crush, 28 Parry<br />
b) 44 DW, 44 Crush, 44 Parry<br />
<br />
Race is Highlander, 10 points into str/con/dex.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why I'm so fixated on having a mercenary duel-wielding hammers. I'm very odd.<br />

<br />
Of course of the three styles I think slash is best. having a 29 use-anytime style rocks. <br />
<br />
Basicly if you want to go crush, go crush. You will be fairly unique at least.</div></div><hr />

So you get to hit a lil harder too</div></div><hr />

They have bonus vs plate, but since youre a Merc you wont be putting that to use. If I was ever a Blademaster that I would go with Blunts over all others.
