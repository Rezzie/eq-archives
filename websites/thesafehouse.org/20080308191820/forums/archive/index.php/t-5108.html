<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bastion</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm going to make an inf. And I've been working with the character builder over on catacombs. I had been thinking on specing up to 40 in stealth(safe fall 4 and sure I could get to 50 with items). But I've been doing alot of reading and alot of people are saying you should only spec to something like 36 in stealth.<br />
<br />
I know this is an opinion question and I will get no &quot;right&quot; answer. But if anyone could, please post some thoughts on how high to spec my stealth.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this gets asked alot, I did alittle looking and didn't find anything that satisfied me so I'm asking again. &quot;It is said correctly that law exists not for the Just but for the Unjust, for the Just carry the law in their hearts and do not need to call it from afar.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm in the &quot;Only spec to 36&quot; camp.  When you take into account the pulsing nature of stealth, you can get away with not having totally maxed stealth.  Bear in mind that with a 36 natural spec, most people will still have upper 40s modified stealth, which for the purposes of sneaking up on non-assassins is plenty.  Hell, Caith (At level 42) only has 37 or so modified stealth, and does pretty well trying to hide from non-assassins.  Of course he'd do better with higher, but when he hits 50, the extra 80% of a horse length will be insignificant given the amount of time it will take for the stealther to show up on the enemy's screen.  Against an assassin, this becomes more of a liability.  In my mind gearing up the offensive skills (Especially as a Nightshade) is more important.<br />
As an inf, you also have a lot more leeway with the speccing.  You may see more benefit from speccing higher that 36 in stealth, as your other skills will have hit higher diminishing returns at that point.</div></div><hr />
