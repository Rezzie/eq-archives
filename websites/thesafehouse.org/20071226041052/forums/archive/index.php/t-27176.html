What language is the opening in?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">12-10-06, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.) Latin<br />
 <br />
2.) Hot Nekked OMG face, not frowny. the opening consists of a naked, pink haired teenage girl rending about 30 people into pulp without actually touching them.. At one point, she takes someone's heart out from thier chest and squeezes it in front of them.<br />
 <br />
It's one of the bloodiest sequences I've ever seen.<br />
 <br />
I'm tempted to bust out my Lilium avatar, but Santa-Thulhu reigns 'till xmas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">12-10-06, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, Elfen Lied's opening sequence is one of the bloodiest, attention-grabbing scenes I've seen in anime.  Below are a few screen caps, starting with the opening image.<br />
<br />
The guy in the foreground has already lost his arm, and is about a second away from losing his head.  Lucy breaks out of her cage and restraints and uses the elevator, only to have four guards open fire the second the doors open.  After killing three of them, she walks up to the fourth one, crouches down in front of him, then kills him.  She opens a door and sees the 20 guards.  Guess who wins...</div></div><hr />
