<br />
The lack of prestige classes and NPC classes from the DMG.<br />
<br />
And all the best monsters aren't in the toolset!<br />
<br />
No mind flayers, no beholders, no chimeras, no hydras, no driders, no nagas, no griffons, no wyverns, and most of the demons/devils are not represented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I saw the Illithid model and was positively stunned.<br />
<br />
Personally I want a mule.  I've got a working script for a pack animal (works as a portable merchant) but I have to use an ox.<br />
<br />
Justin Gattuso is the guy who wrote the script and did a great job.<br />
<br />
Give them some time and you'll get what you are asking for.<br />
<br />
Prestige Classes... NPC classes...  We'll see what Bioware comes up with soon enough.  Maybe nothing.  Who knows? Baroness Acinonyx Lanoche<br />

<br />
<br />
Like Acinonyx said though, there's a bunch of people working already to fill in the holes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. How can you have a proper assassination plot without a Gnoll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they don't have gnolls, hobgoblins, or kobolds. I  mean seriously what's wrong with these guys? I was annoyed enough when the monster's manual didn't have bullywugs (had to wait for monsters of Faerun for those. I didn't think the old D&amp;amp;D cartoon took place in the forgotten realms).<br />
<br />
yeah there has to be expansions here for monsters, prestige classes, monster races for players, all kinds of things. 1 Crow bad news<br />
2 Crows myrth<br />
3 Crows a wedding<br />
4 Crows a birth<br />
5 Crows for riches<br />
6 Crows a thief</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah!  No hobgolbins!  Whats up with THAT??<br />
<br />
And I totally forgot about the gnolls.<br />
<br />
Thats the other thing the expansion needs, players as monsters.  I'm need to make a rampaging hoard campaign.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to a nice Shadow Dragon too with the transparent wings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wanna try making about 2000 different characters but I don't relish redoing the same mod over and over.<br />
<br />
Pity its not as easy as Morrowind's =(.  More robust though...<br />

Driders, demons, kobolds, Illithid are all part of that, so it would make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_VERY LOW SODIUM</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look at the Custom Content area of NWN's boards. Many people are making these models, but there are a couple issues to work out concerning bugs, file formats (Bioware is dragging their feet releasing the whitepapers, just a matter of time), compatibility. I'd say give it a month, and there will be a ton of models out there with many homegrown tools to create your own monsters/placeables/tilesets.<br />
