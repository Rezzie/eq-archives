Because of how the Major was changed by her meeting with the Puppetmaster, the two movies wouldn't be part of the 'Stand Alone Complex' timeline.  This would be the first SAC movie, unless I'm missing a movie somewhere (there's only GitS, Innocence, and now Solid State Society).<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm guessing it'd go (unless SSS is a prequel):<br />
<br />
Timeline 1:<br />
Ghost in the Shell -&gt; Ghost in the Shell: Innocence<br />
Timeline 2:<br />
Ghost in the Shell: SAC -&gt; Ghost in the Shell:SAC, 2nd Gig -&gt; Ghost in the Shell: SAC, Solid State Society</div></div><hr />

Nope, you're not missing anything, this is indeed the first SAC related movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">07-09-06, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Production IG website has been updated with new information about Solid State Society here (http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/s00_/index.html) (though I guess there's a spoiler in the description):<br />
<br />
Ghost in the Shell:<br />
Stand Alone Complex<br />
Solid State Society<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
With more than 1.5 million copies sold in Japan and 100.000 copies per volume sold in the USA, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex has consolidated his place among the classics in the world of science fiction. Now, after two years from the TV series that started all, a completely new and all-original chapter is about to emerge: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society. Directed by Kenji Kamiyama and with the participation of the same staff from the popular series, this full-length 105 minute feature has required an unprecedented budget of 360 million yen (or 3.20 million dollars), in order to provide theatrical quality. The movie will premiere in Japan on the SKYPerfecTV! satellite television network on September 1st, and successively released on DVD on November 24th. Release outside Japan is to be announced.<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
A.D. 2034. It has been two years since Motoko Kusanagi left Section 9. Togusa is now the new leader of the team, that has considerably increased its appointed personnel. The expanded new Section 9 confronts a rash of complicated incidents, and investigations reveal that an ultra-wizard hacker named the Puppeteer is behind the entire series of events.<br />
<br />
In the midst of all, Batou, who was stalking the case on a separate track, encounters Motoko. She goes away after saying, &quot;Stay away from the Solid State Society.&quot; Batou is left with a doubt in his mind. Could Motoko be the the Puppeteer?<br />
<br />
The series of intriguing incidents that Section 9 faces gradually link together almost artistically. Who is the Puppeteer? What will happen to Batou's relationship with Motoko? What is the full truth behind this carefully planned perfect crime? And what will the outcome be? Mysteries surround the Solid State Society...<br />
<br />
NOTE: The word &quot;Puppeteer&quot; is used in this text as a temporary translation for the original Japanese term &quot;Kugutsu Mawashi,&quot; and it is not meant to be the official English adaptation.<br />

Those in the New York area might want to consider attending ComicCon, as GitS:SAC - SSS will have a screening there (as well as 'Shinobi' and 'Blade of the Phantom Master').<br />
<br />
Production IG's website also has a five part behind the scenes section that may be of interest, begining with part one  here (http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/s08_/000515.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-27-07, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched Solid State Society, it was kind of interesting. I liked some of the changes in cast, but I did not like the lack of Ksunagi. She's a central figure in the series. In terms of story, it was excellent, but she made a noticable huge hole in the overall story.</div></div><hr />
