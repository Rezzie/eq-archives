It was late, stormy, and we were all tired from the days toil. Had we known what lay ahead, perhaps we might have spared ourselves from this awful fate.<br />
  But we did not! There!! Again the castle sends a scout to check on his comrades here. Quick, to the fight!!! We have him and he begins to falter. Alas, the fiend is greatly hurt, overwhelmed by our mayhem, and he knows it. He turns to run...<br />
  &quot;Do not follow!!&quot; The words choke in my mouth as I see we are suddenly noticed by no less than three of the heathen scum. But they too are weak and, still confident, we begin to shred their blue skins to ribbons when....<br />
  &quot;AAaaaaiiieeee....!!!!&quot; I am smote by magic from behind! Turning I spy the most seductive creature it has ever been my misfortune to lay eyes on. Clad only in slight and revealing garments, her eyes burn through me and she whispers..... &quot;Love me.....&quot;<br />
  &quot;RUN RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!&quot; I shout, and as one we turn towards the safety of less evil places. But no, the very air now is filled with all manner of deadly reinforcments, no doubt sent by the vampire headmaster himself. How long they watched us carve up their disciples, guaging our strength, I'll never know.<br />
  Again I am blasted by evil magic as I race down the pass. I run, but in my heart I know there is no hope. I am filled with dread. A gargoyle smacks me to the ground and, not content with only my death, stands above me to jeer and flout his victory. I lose consciousness and..... I dream.?!<br />
  A sweet voice has filled my ear and beauty my eye. My loins flush and the battle-blood turns to lust. &quot;Love me....&quot;.<br />
  Never have I been so possessed of passion for a woman as then. Though my enemies stood all round, though they brought destruction raining upon the heads of my comrades, though this lovely creature was in truth most vile... I did not care. &quot;Leave this one be&quot; she ordered her vassals. &quot;No, my pretty pet&quot;, she whispered to me like a slap in my face, &quot;not now, not here. Follow me to my chambers.&quot;<br />
  And so I did. At times I resisted, found strength to run, but ever her enchanting grace brought me to heel. Deep into the lair we went...<br />
  &quot;Wait here a moment&quot; she said to me and glided off to prepare herself for what lay ahead. And that was her mistake. Dark charms may be strong, but fierce and icy blood runs thru these Barbarian veins!!! With a great effort of will I snapped the bonds of my possession. &quot;Someday&quot; I whispered into the darkness, &quot;someday, I will return an put an end to this madness&quot;<br />
  I slipped into the shadows and snuck away....</div></div><hr />
