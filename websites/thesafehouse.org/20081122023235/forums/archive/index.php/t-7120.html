Sentry Enots and Kcor, I think their names are. You have to be apprhensive to Enots to give him helms, and then once you're at dubious you can give Frost Giant Toes, Helms, or Mercenary Assignments to either one for continued faction increases.</div></div><hr />

I went to Skyshrine with a bag full of toes last night for hand ins.  Go figure dumb ass me decides to figure out the right person.  Every one I handed a toe to just ate it with no faction or returning it.  I am dubious and tried sneaking behind and just straight hand ins.  No luck.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere today that the person to hand in is leutenant &amp;lt;something&gt; and is near where the CS key use to drop.  Sure wish I didn't waste that whole bag of toes.</div></div><hr />
