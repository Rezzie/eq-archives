<br />
Hell, Suncoast sold the individual discs of this for 30$ each (like most of their anime). That's the reason I didn't buy it then, cause I already had the nonplatinum set. <br />
<br />
*Yes I know Suncoast is not a good place to buy at for the proce, but on tripple reward weekends, boxsets have a lot of return on them. I also don't buy much anime, only have NGE, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, and Hellsing that I've actually bought.</div></div><hr />

1.) Sorry Toppy, but I tend to go all insane and berserk-ish when I start talking about it. Many broken things. High bloodpressure. Not good. :frown <br />
 <br />
 <br />
2.) Wow... Sweet deal. If only more big-name anime was that cheap. I wouldn't mind picking up GItS:SAC someday, guess I should wait for the second blue moon on the third week of february when the stars are aligned. :pulid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolo</div><div class="date">12-13-05, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">$46 is the cheapest it's listed on Half.  Sometimes you can get awesome deals, sometimes not.  I got Hellsing for $10.  Can usually find Trigun or Cowboy Bebop for $20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cheapest for the Platinum (not to be confused by the Perfect, Complete, and whatever other collection out there) is 55.00. So still a good deal.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, there are a TON of shady deals there (bootlegs and the such.) from what I am told. So things may not be as they seem. The complete Hellsing for $10 sounds like a bootleg to me, even if it comes with a fancy box. Trigun and Cowboy Bebop for $20 works out to $2 a disc, also bootleg prices.<br />
<br />
I never shop here though, so I am not speaking from personal experience. Not to mention I don't think Cowboy Bebop wasn't ever released as a set, afaik. I don't see anything on Half.com showing anything below $15 per dvd.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just checked, and found a TON of bootlegs there. Whoa o.o dangerous grounds, there. They seem to even use ripped DVD's from DVD ripeprs and put them on DVD, to make it sound like it's official releases. Yuck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">12-14-05, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact of the matter is that Shinji doesn't make the series, even though he's the main character.  The very point of Shinji is that he's a wimpy, plyable child who has the weight of the world put on his shoulders.  His motivation is simple, but it allows those around him to have more complex emotions.  <br />
<br />
Misato starts out carefree and jovial, but throughout the series as more and more responsibility is piled upon her she begins to lose her carefree nature as she struggles with the decisions she needs to make at work.  Rei is quiet and reserved, and we find out she's the way she is because of all the questions she has internally about who she really is.  Asuka starts out as the classic attention getting brat, but we later learn how fragile she really is on the inside and why she's the way she is.  Then there's the relationship between SEELE and NERV and their differing agendas, and what is done by SEELE sending Kaoru ('the fifth child') to NERV.<br />
<br />
The only part of the series that I didn't like was where they left Asuka, but they 'fixed' that in the &quot;End of Evangelion&quot; DVD.  Neon Genesis: Evangelion is an excellent series not because of Shinji; it's excellent because it tells a story in which all the characters' motivations link together to allow Shinji to make his final decision about the fate of the world.<br />
<br />
Btw, I recently read that they're around halfway to their goal of arranging $100 to $120 million in financing for the live action Evangelion movie.  I think most who know about the live action film know that Weta (Narnia, LotR, King Kong) wants to do the special effects for the movie.</div></div><hr />

then i watched the OVA , then i truely hated that peace of ****<br />
unexplained stuff , someone become god , another become eve , some big teddy bear thing with one eye <br />

my brain was hurting for weeks after it , hell i watched Street fighter the movie and it thought it had a nice story ( back then ) because of it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gainax was stumped when people asked them about religious connections. They just thought it looked &quot;mysterious&quot; and cool. Just like how many of us like to use  that star with circle thingy to give the impression of something being mysterious, chanting in latin, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Nobody on the Gainax knew anything about Christianity. Like, 0.0001% of Japan believes in some form of Christianity.<br />
<br />
It is western fans who know about Christianity that came up with this connection.<br />
<br />
Fun fact: During and after Evangelion, Gainax was getting hate mail from otaku constantly. Someone even went to their offices and spray painted death threats. And no, it wasn't because the show sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">12-14-05, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Explanation of (my interpretation of) the end of the series:<br />
<br />
SEELE wants to initiate a third impact to start &quot;human complementation&quot; which joins mankind into one single, perfect entity. Kaworu, who's the fifth child and the 17th angel (sent to NERV by SEELE to start Third Impact) forms a friendship with Shinji.  In the final scene with Lilith (the angel involved in the Second Impact), Kaworu tells Shinji that he has decided that Shinji should choose the fate of mankind (as the initiator of the third impact) and gets Shinji to kill him. Because of this Shinji goes a bit nuts, knowing that he killed the 17th angel because he has been told to kill the angels, but that the 17th angel was his friend.<br />
<br />
The third impact is initiated and the last two episodes are Shinji's fractured mind trying to assemble enough information to make a decision on how mankind will exist after third impact by conversing with the minds of others who he knows (because after third impact all mankind is joined into one 'human soup' of consciousness).  He is shown 'perfect freedom', which is essentially a white limitless void were there are no limitations. It's only when restrictions are applied (an up and down, a solid form) and other people with whom to interact are added where he is able to give himself a perception of who he is as a human being, and that in the limitless void there is no difference between himself and nothing because there's no form of perception to give one individuality.  In the end he exclaims that he wants to be himself and that he wants to continue existing.</div></div><hr />

One of the really interesting explanatory bits is about the Garden of Eden, by name, and the Trees of Life and of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  That it's from a nonChristian perspective actually makes it better, since they're going not by the watered-down versions most of us are familair with but instead looking at the source material and going, &quot;Wow, that's some crazy ****.&quot;)  Stuff that's hard to understand makes some people angry.  I just think it's cool, and an amazing story.  I just started watching it for the second time, and I love being watching the plot and themes develop and getting all the things that I hadn't noticed before.  I had no idea, for instance, that the Human Instrumentality Project is mentioned so early on.  <br />
<br />
And I KNOW I'm in the minority here, but I actually have a lot of sympathy for Shinji.  I guess I just have a really high annoying character tolerance - the only character in any game or series I can think of offhand that I really couldn't stand is EVA in MGS3. <br />
