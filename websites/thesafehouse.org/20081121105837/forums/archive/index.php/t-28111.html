<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Literacy</div><div class="date">02-02-07, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Priory is a progressive raiding guild on the Vanguard Shidreth server. We plan on steadily advancing in all spheres: adventuring, crafting, and diplomacy. <br />
We are made up of mostly working adults and those who have obligations outside of Vanguard that prevent them from playing 14 hours a day. Our goals are to make the time we do spend worthwhile. We intend to see everything Vanguard has to offer but are in no rush to do so today.<br />
The founding members come from top end guilds from Everquest and World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
While we have players who are on all hours of the day our raid times will be late nights EST weekends, and evenings weekdays. This is subject to change to fit the needs of the Guild as a whole.<br />
The type of player that would make a good fit in Priory will enjoy the journey but not lose sight of the destination. They will understand as a guild we are looking at the quality of the player over the quantity of our numbers. A good sense of humor is also a must.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that, at this point, we're building this guild up from the bottom. We don't know anyone but each other. But this doesn't mean we're completely useless. We're relatively intelligent, well organized and focused (except Tork who is mildly retarded. just give him something shiny and he'll follow you around like a lost puppy. its weird.). This puts us ahead of a large portion of other guilds out there. We're not about to grab a bunch of dumb, unreliable people just to fill out the ranks. Thats just bad policy and I also heard that it'll make you go blind (its kinda like that other thing that'll make you go blind, but not). <br />
<br />
As long as you're intelligent and have a good sense of humor, you're in the right place. Our requirements really aren't more specific than that because I think that covers a large portion of what makes someone a good player. Intelligent people can adapt easily. They usually play their class well. And, for the most part, they are reliable. With a good sense of humor, most drama is squashed immediately. Its easier to relax and have fun. And for me, I'm less likely to offend someone with a hooker joke when they're able to laugh at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Literacy</div><div class="date">02-10-07, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Priory is looking for dedicated crafters. This doesn't mean that crafting is the only thing you have to do. But it should be your main goal. As a dedicated crafter in Priory you will be provided with a steady supply of oreos, naked ladies (and/or dudes if thats your thing. I wont judge.), harvested and looted materials needed for your particular crafting profession and I might could fax you a nickel.<br />
<br />
Since our original recruiting post its become more obvious when our regular raid/group times will be. Keep in mind that we probably wont be raiding every single night. I also read on the interweb that raiding for more than 4 hours a day lowers your IQ by 20 points and could possibly make you have 'tarded babies. These length and times may change slightly depending on members schedule and Torks parole hearing (cross your fingers guys).<br />
<br />
Weekdays: 7pm CST til 10 or 12 CST (add an hour for EST. subtract 2 hours for PST)<br />
<br />
Weekends: 7pm CST til whenever (add an hour for EST. subtract 2 hours for PST)<br />
<br />
In addition, will will have late night/early morning raid times. These are:<br />
<br />
Weekdays: 7am CST til 11pm CST (add an hour for EST. subtract 2 hours for PST)<br />
<br />
Weekends: 7am CST til 11pm CST (add an hour for EST. subtract 2 hours for PST)<br />

<br />
Priory is still kicking ass and taking names - as such we're looking for a just a few more members to round out our roster. Level is unimportant, as long as you are not an asshat and are actually trying to progress whichever sphere you're interested in, but be aware our lowest members are in the mid-20s. The majority are 35+.<br />
<br />
Feel free to come visit and apply no matter what your class, but be aware we are explicitly looking for a few casty-burny types, a couple stabby and/or face-eating types, and 1 - that is ONE, as in singular - fat chick to cushion our pushing.<br />
<br />
If you have a pansy job like healing or something you can apply too, but you'll have to please Jak before we consider your app. And no, not the &quot;funny joke ha ha&quot; kind of pleasing.<br />
<br />
Now we are in fact a progressive raiding guild, so you should expect to be able to raid from 8-12 on weekday raids, and from 7 till when **** is done dying on the weekends. We will NOT be raiding every day, but as we do not know how much content is currently in the game, how much will be added in the near future, or what the respawn times will be like, we do not know the exact number of days we will need to raid. It will likely be between 3 and however many it takes to kill **** in the face.<br />
