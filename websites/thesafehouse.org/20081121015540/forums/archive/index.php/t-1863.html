The last time you saw me was about a month before you overdosed when I was nine-years-old! Your heart stopped beating and some medics had to get it going again with electrodes! But your brain had been so deprived of oxygen that you'd become a vegetable! The doctor said he'd &quot;never seen a brain as flattened by drugs as yours!&quot; It was only a few days before they turned the machine they'd hooked you to off, and you died again, and I went home to finish reading The Fellowship for the first time! Remember now? I remember that night! Your name is written on the inside flap of that book in pencil! You erased the printed version and wrote it in cursive! Now you must surely remember! Shortly afterwards, mom and dad started fighting!<br />
<br />
Hello Maria! Remember me? I'm your friend! The last time you saw me was this summer about a week before you started using! You were so quiet and angsty! Remember now? Well @#%$ you if you don't, I don't give a @#%$ if you @#%$ screw yourself up on drugs because you're just a @#%$ lame ass typical @#%$ angsty teenager who's too @#%$ self-pitying to help herself, who gets drunk and cries and then starts using, just like my sister, just like all the other @#%$ people who kill themselves every single @#%$ day!<br />
<br />
God . . . @#%$ . . . Dammit! Edited by: Boot Disk  at: 9/20/03 2:09 pm</div></div><hr />

I don't think I'll post anything more about it, because if she found out I'd been posting about her . . . It just probably wouldn't be good.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the comforting and such, though, guys.</div></div><hr />
