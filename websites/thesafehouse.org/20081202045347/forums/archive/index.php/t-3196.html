<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean literally stuck in a wall.  Anyone know of anyway to move a character (like the fixme command in Morrowind).  I can't go and ask for official help until Friday when I get a copy that isn't &quot;evaluation&quot;.<br />
Without thinking last night, I saved the game when I went to exit to look for an answer, so loading last save isn't an option now either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This happened to me once. Two things I can tell you to do, but I'm hoping there's more.<br />
<br />
1. Download the patch if you haven't<br />
2. Load last auto-save if you haven't overwritten that with the quicksave. You'll lose everything since then, but it's better than losing it all. If you haven't gotten to an autosave point yet, then it's no big loss.<br />
<br />
Those are the only options I know, tried fixme and a bunch of other commands with no results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Pedric.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I have already patched it.  Had also quicksaved it while still stuck in the wall, so that's a no go either.<br />
<br />
It's no real stress I suppose.<br />
I was going to restart on Friday when I got my copy, was just running around for a couple of hours before I started on the toolset tonight.<br />
<br />
**edit stupid custom sig. must remember to go and change that option one of these days.** Edited by: Dargesh  at: 6/23/02 8:54:05 pm</div></div><hr />

Hehe, when I got stuck it was during the attack on the academy, so I didn't have your fancy schmancy teleporter stones!!<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;---- Can't believe he didn't think of that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It turns out that the problem was as simple as restarting.<br />
I got home, started up and was free of the wall.</div></div><hr />
