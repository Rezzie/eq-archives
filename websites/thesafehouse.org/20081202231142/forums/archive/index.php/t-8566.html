<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_wynnde</div><div class="date">06-06-03, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally got the notes from Kaladim and Neriak for the epic.<br />
It took me forever to get the one from Founy in Kaladim.<br />
What I did was just camp by him, log in, pick him empty, then log out (to save my SoW and AC/HP buffs). Repeated this dozens of times.<br />
<br />
I assumed (may have read it somewhere) that coins would come first and once the coins are gone, then you'd get a chance for gems and The Note. So I figured that since I was always finding at least a couple silver on him, that no one else had already taken the note.<br />
<br />
So.. After getting the note I thought I'd pp another time or two, and to my surprise I got more coin. I'm wondering if part of the reason it took so many attempts to get the darn note is because someone already took it. So it might have saved me some troubles to time it so that I'd be there when he respawned, to get first pick   <br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm the only person who had this false belief, that you had to get all his coins before you'd get the good stuff...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wristie</div><div class="date">06-06-03, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is NOT true that you will pick all coin first, then some item (be it the epic pieces or anything else off a mob).  It's purely a function of random chance.<br />
<br />
The first check is to see if you successfully pickpocket the mob.  If that check is successful, the next check is to see what &quot;item&quot; you pick.  That can be any non-magic, non-nodrop item in the mob's inventory, or one of the coin types (platinum, gold, silver, or copper).  If it's one of the items, you get that item; if it's one of the coin types, you get 50% of the remaining coin of that type.  It's as simple as that...<br />
<br />
I think why you may have been under the impression that it worked the way you described, is that if the mob only has one item, but coins of all 4 types, you are much more likely to pick some coins than pick the item.  And even After you've picked a particular coin type, you only got 50% of that coin, so you can still pick from that coin type again.<br />
<br />
The resaon most epic-guides tell you to &quot;pick the mob until all the coin is gone and then pick him 30 more times&quot; is simply to tell you should be persistant in picking until you are fairly certain that the mob doesn't have the epic piece.  Not that you have to first empty the mob of all coin and the &quot;good stuff&quot; will get picked...  <br />
<br />
Gratz on the notes, and good luck on the rest of the epic quest !!<br />

50% of the coin type? that cant be true, or some mobs with much pp in it would give all the time pp, when i get first 10pp then 2pp then 3pp and since then i get only gold .. silver... copper. and some items between the picks of money.<br />
I think that is also random</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_serpin</div><div class="date">06-10-03, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, there isn't a way to see the note on him or know if he is going to give it up.  Just try until you get it or he aggros, or you decide that a safer course would be to try later.  I got mine on the 3rd pull, but Tani's was a little tougher  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bummey</div><div class="date">06-10-03, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got both my notes on the first pick =\ I got founy's on the second spawn, and Tani's on the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zaelera Soulbound</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ONLY way to assure he hasnt been picked already is to be there when he is a fresh spawn. Depops 8am game time, and promptly repops at 9am gametime (thought it was 10 but its not)<br />
When I did it for my epic, got the note off Founy second pick, and Tain first pick. <br />
Redoing it for my high elf mask quest. Took 14 FRESH Founy spawns to get the note.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FaerieFire13</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked Tani down to the toes of his socks quite a few times and didn't get the parchment. I think his pockets actually are that deep. When I finally got it, I'd taken a break after days and got it on the first try.<br />
<br />
Founy seemed to be picked clean quicker (might just have been those spawn), but the one time I picked him past my usual 25 tries past what seemed to be picked clean, I got the note (on try 35ish).<br />
<br />
There's a point where they are picked clean for normal PP purposes but where they still seem to have items left on them. That point may be long past when you'd normally give up. Then again, remember they don't always spawn with it. It's a guess, but I'd wager the only time I picked them clean plus 25 that they still had anything was that one time with Founy. Go figure.</div></div><hr />

I'm at 200 skill, but only level 47, so in reality I don't have to pick the notes for another 3 levels. But I'm impatient.  <br />
