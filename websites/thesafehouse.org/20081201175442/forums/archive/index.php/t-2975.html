<br />
and, why do they only go up to level 10?<br />
what are some good benefits of taking a prestige class?<br />
is it just like multiclassing to another normal class?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and quasits...i decided i'm making my rogue a quasit.  i got the ability bonuses figured out, +2 dex, -2 str.<br />
<br />
what would be some good, fitting, not overpowering attributes for a quasit race to have? <br />
<br />
this is my first time DMing dnd, and like 2nd time playing it so i'm kind of in the dark :)<br />
<br />
I'm not irascible today.  Lucky you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theory; Prestige classes are a development of one or more basic classes. Essentially, they are specialisations; you become more formidable in one specific area, at the expense of a loss in others. For example, you might have an undead hunter prestige class, which would give you lots of bonuses against undead, but you would lose your class benefits for the levels, so you would be weaker against everything else.<br />
<br />
Practice; Prestige classes are uberclass upgrades that give your character loads of cool skills and make them better in every way.<br />
<br />
They are the same as a normal class , but you have to meet the prerequisites before you can multiclass into them, and they don't bestow an xp penalty for multiclassing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Heartsong Steelsoul</div><div class="date">09-14-02, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason that they only go up to ten:<br />
<br />
firstly, you have to actually get the prereq's first, which takes five to ten levels of normal classes, for the most part.<br />
<br />
secondly, since they are, as mentioned, specializing, there's a smaller body of knowledge for you to learn.<br />
<br />
For future reference, there are also five level prestige classes (such as the FR Divine Disciple).</div></div><hr />

<br />
if so, lock away</div></div><hr />

5-level prestige classes can't... ShadowCross Bladesong<br />
