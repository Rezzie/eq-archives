<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krikit</div><div class="date">01-08-06, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres a little theory that i have concerning guilds. SoH should put a rule on guilds that they have to maintane a minimum number of active players. On a weekly or bi-weekly basis this would be checked. Heres why i think this would help the community and the end game.<br />
<br />
Im gonna use WOW...because....it the perfect example. WoW has a ton of guilds on each server that dont do a damn thing because they dont have the numbers or appropriate classes. This is directly related to the fact that you can start a guild and invite the world but maybe your average number of players will equal 7..That makes it harder to get groups for instances and if theres level 60's in that guild there gonna be bored. In fact i think this is why so many people often complain that the end game for WoW is boring/sucks ect...because they dont have the guild. Finding a guild thats capable of lvl60 content is also effected by this because its onyl leaving a select few that actually have a good amount of active players.<br />
<br />
Putting a min number of active players requirement on guilds will help everything in the long run...even the short. Whats everyone else think of this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they're more worried about doing endgame instances, they're not going to stay in that guild. simple as that. let people make the guilds they want, with the dumb guild names they want, because it has absolutely no effect on anything whatsoever.<br />
<br />
people complain about being bored in the endgame because just about anyone would get bored with running the same couple instances &amp; encounters over, and over, and over, week after week.</div></div><hr />

Thats not how its working though. They wont leave the guild in most cases, instead groups of people just quit and migrate to another game. Not only that,  how would this negatively affect the 7 friends that were guilded. Instead of making there own why not all 7 of them just join the bigger guild? Stuff like this absolutely has an effect on everything.. <br />
<br />
As far as being bored running the same instances..thats only true if your dealing with pick-up raids(IMO). If your with your guild of lets say 40 people thats been together for awhile,  it makes it more fun. Which in turn is why the bigger active guilds in WoW dont complain about being bored..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">01-08-06, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why I liked FFXI's system of having an equipped item be your link to a guild. To change guilds, all you had to do was equip that guild's item, and POOF you were that guild. Was easy to carry around a general 'pearl' for everyday use, and if you got invited on a raid it was simple to be given a new 'pearl' to equip for the duration, then switch back at the end. Easy. Simple.</div></div><hr />

how would it negatively affect the 7 friends?<br />
<br />
well let's see - those 7 friends no longer have a guild. not for any good reason, but just because you say there are people at level 60 who are lazy enough to not expend the minimal effort in joining some zerg guild.<br />
<br />
seriously - again - those people and their 10 person guilds have absolutely no negative impact on this game. if someone doesn't want to join a raid guild, it's because they don't care about raiding and they don't WANT to raid. those are the people you see on the boards asking for alternatives to 40 person raids at level 60.<br />
<br />
not to mention, you're suggesting they kill the ability to create guilds unless they're endgame zergy guilds just for the endgame. remember those other 59 levels? what purpose does your 55 person guild serve me when I'm level 30 and leveling up with my friends? <br />
<br />
shouldn't I have the opportunity to be in my own guild, with my own guild name, on my own vent server, with my friends?<br />
<br />
in your world, my friends and I run around without a guild tag, but still group together and do everything we always do. and that includes avoiding huge guilds until we actually &quot;need&quot; to join them, at level 60.<br />

sorry, but I just don't see where the basis for this suggestion is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">01-11-06, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have to say &quot;No&quot; to this suggestion as well. Guilds aren't just created for the end game. There are many role playing guilds, or even &quot;Family&quot; guilds as well.<br />
<br />
All Barbarian guilds (Shanks! Shanks! Shanks!), all Elven guilds, even all gnome guilds exist in other MMORPGs and are quite active. These guilds may or may not participate in the end game but their focus is on the guild they have created and most have a role play story. In the &quot;Family&quot; guild situations these seem to be people who are all clos friends in real life and just want to have the same last name.<br />
<br />
As has been brought up by game creators and players alike, the main force in keeping a person playing a game is the community in the game, so putting an active member requirement would kill some of these guilds, or at the very least the &quot;Family&quot; ones and their sense of community will be lessened and they will be more likely to leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">01-11-06, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no problem with putting a minimum active account limit on a guild if it's to prevent exploitation and reduce maintenance overhead.   It should be something reasonable though, like 5-10 active members required to maintain the guild.<br />
<br />
Now when it comes to things that are at a premium, like guild housing for instance, I can see a more stringent requirement.  Maybe number of active accounts, maybe total levels, maybe a tax of some sort.<br />
<br />
For the basic ability to have a guild tag though, it should only be limitted by whatever reasonable maintainability warrants.</div></div><hr />
