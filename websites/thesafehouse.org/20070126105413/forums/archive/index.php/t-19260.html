<br />
So far we finished Sunken Temple of Atal'Hakkar (nice dragons),<br />
went halfway the BRD (not much loot there), but have not seem much else.<br />
<br />
What are nice places to visit for rogue/paladin/mage/hunter/priest at their 58+ levels? Where are nice drops &amp;amp; encounters?<br />
<br />
Dire Maul, Stratholme, Spire?<br />
<br />
Where to search for Paladin armor and rogue end-weapons?<br />
<br />
cheers thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">06-20-05, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stratholme and Scholomance are both extremely challenging for a well-geared 5-man group of 60s; you'll want to do them in 10-person raids for loot, for a while.<br />
<br />
Lower Blackrock Spire is a fun challenge for a 5-man group of 60s.  Upper Blackrock Spire isn't possible without a full raid.  I'd suggest doing Strath/Scholo/BRS raid groups for loot before trying LBRS in a 5-man.<br />
<br />
Blackrock Depths is great for a 5-man group in that level range.  Keep in mind the dungeon is huge, and split into, essentially, a lower-level, lower-loot &quot;jail / city&quot; section, and a higher-level, higher-loot &quot;beyond the bar&quot; section.  <br />
<br />
Dire Maul is split into 3 wings; in increasing order of difficulty, it's East, then North, then West.  You could easily do the East wing, which is a pretty quick run and has 4 or 5 loot mobs.  After going through the East wing, disband, reform with a new leader, and do it again - you'll be surprised how many good, blue-item upgrades everyone comes away with.  Also, the super-rare book that begins the Pally/Warrior epic quest can potentially drop from any named mob in the instance.  You could probably do the North wing as well, but the melee DPS output of some of the mobs can get nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthien</div><div class="date">06-22-05, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh we tried shortly Dire Maul east wing in 4-man group with only me, paladin as healer. (didn't work :pulid). I had 4k life, 4k mana in INT mode and even a shield, but keeping up myself tanking and healing was no go with me slow heal spells 2.5 sec a cast. This was 'cause the 5th member, a pally 60 left for BG he's been queueied into since last day.<br />
<br />
Then another pally 60 from friendly guild jumped in, and we could handle it with crosshealing relatively well. It was tricky, specially as our mage likes to AoE grrr but he's a flamboyant gnome. Best drop was the leather hat (for the looks :pulid). The plant life in there is -well- real abnormal both in evilness and strength. Remnicsent of Baudlaire &quot;Fleur du Mal&quot; :pulid.<br />
<br />
The waittimes to get a group going even with well known team are horrendous. I think we try again with pick-up raids of 10 or so and see what/how is the fun. <br />
<br />
Thx fer tips!</div></div><hr />
