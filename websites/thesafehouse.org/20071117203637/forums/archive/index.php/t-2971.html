<br />
The single greatest thing EVER for monster campaigns.  Oh yeah, and a bunch of other crap too.<br />
<br />
But its a complete character generator that lets you make characters from EVERY monster in the MM.  All the stats all the abilities.  It even has the level modifications(like when you make a worg, your automatically level 4 fromthe start, cause just being a worg is worth 4 levels of your exp, so if you GM says you can play level 6 characters, you can play a level 2 Worg)</div></div><hr />

<br />
is it associated with the &quot;master tools&quot; thing that came with the PHB but has seemed to have stalled? 1 Crow bad news<br />

I have not DL'd a version since Dieties and dem-gods came out, so I can't check those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">08-12-02, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically Wotc is having a &quot;talk&quot; with developers that have products that are in direct competition with e-tools.<br />
Thats why all the support for the rest of the d&amp;amp;d and d20 stuff just disappeared from pcgen.<br />
rumours 3 different software devs got cease and desist letters.<br />
The guys from pcgen seem very optimistic as to what they have to do to comply with what Wotc needs tho.<br />
You can read more about it on enworld.org.<br />
E-tools is kinda cool but really the master tools just got reduced to character and monster editor with core support.<br />
If fluid adds the rest of the books to it as patches it will be a halfdecent proggy ...but really won't do much that pcgen already did.<br />
<br />
This thread seems to cover most of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kroe Magnon</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">still haven't heard about e-tools, is it the one fluid is working on?<br />
<br />
the pcgen thing works great! hopefully they update a few books eventually. (Green Ronin's shaman book and of course the WoTC class books)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">www.fluidnet.com<br />
<br />
click on the dungeons and dragons icon<br />
yes its made by fluid its the release version of the program that came with the players handbook which was going to be this grand program called master tools.<br />
It got reduced to e-tools  its not a bad program but needs the splatbook support to really shine as a character editor..but if you like monster races it is very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kroe Magnon</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the link mate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone interested in an old version of PCGen with all the class books and basically all FR stuff included can contact me .. I will give you the link to the files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">08-14-02, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take it you got my email then, SX?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-14-02, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes Tel, thanks a lot... although I had gotten version 2.70 from the official page too - the files are still there, but it's a bit tricky to get them.. you have to know the version number, which I only know for 2.70. So it was good that I got 2.72 from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kroe Magnon</div><div class="date">08-16-02, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">all hail the allmighty shadowcross for providing us with the happy goodness/evilness that is PCGen with all the books I own already loaded into it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Icebreaker</div><div class="date">08-16-02, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in all honesty i do like the e-tools program lotta good stuff their ..they just gotta keep adding in splat book support and d20 stuff as free updates and i'm cool with that.<br />
oh and btw everytable from the core books are in the helpfile<br />
handy when playing DnD online(which is how i play)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">08-28-02, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Friend finally got this, has already found two bugs.<br />
<br />
Anyone know where to report bugs to? Delissandra Splitshadow -  Half-Elven Assassin - &quot;Far Seekers&quot; - The Rathe<br />
One! Two! One! Two! and through and through<br />
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DreamspinnerSethan</div><div class="date">09-01-02, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eTools is seemingly a pale imitation of what was promised   The disc with the PHB was good for getting a character started and a neat printout version of the character sheets. All the same . . . <br />
<br />
This doesn't grab me as worth the $40 being asked for it. IF the rest of the Master Tools was there , then maybe IF it was $20 instead, of course . . .<br />
<br />
Not this CD which I can fit under my door</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-04-02, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, do you have any CDs that DON'T fit under your door?</div></div><hr />
