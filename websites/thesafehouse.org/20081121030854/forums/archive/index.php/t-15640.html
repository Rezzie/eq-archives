Anyone knoe where there are. I looked for several hours last along with some others. The only books I found are by the merchants in DB to get the Bloodsaber quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetrose</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too am looking for those darn books.  I found a stack of books in one of the tunnels...nope cant target em.  I Do remember seeing a room with books on a table, probably them...but I was running for my life and I have yet to be able to retrace my steps.<br />
<br />
I wish there was a way to make some sense of those tunnels lol.  I've tried always turning to the left to get someplace and to the right to get back but I always end up lost regardless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem, but after I had inspected both the merchant's book piles and gone to do some other quests I noticed I had finished the quest and needed to return to Valaen.  The reward was some copper and a choice of weapon.  A great way for a new scout to get another dagger to duel wield with their citizenship dagger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have messed with the books at the male npc and female npc in DB. nothing yet. Maybe I will have to complete some oher quest first. :crazy  I will be trying again today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-19-04, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you take the ink-stained note that's in the books?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished it somehow. I don't what I did but hey it's done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kierra the Silent</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">still stuck on this one myself, have inspected both piles of books numerous times, spoken to the merchants numerous times. I dont know what to do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kierra the Silent</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i got the answer... you have to jump behind the merchant =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarSky</div><div class="date">11-22-04, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah!  I spend at least two hours crawling around in those bloody sewers to no avail...guess now I have to go back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try double left clck on the books. I think that is how I did it. I was on another quest last night in antonica, you know one of those that so go here then there, then there an on and on, Well all of the places would automaticlly update once i got near the area. This one tree however wouldn't update my journal. Everyone in the grp was like just near it that is what I did. The the were like run up and touch it. So I did. Finally in button frustration I double clicked it and bam quest complete. LoL I nearly jumped out of my chair when the quest compte audio came through my turned up speakers.</div></div><hr />
