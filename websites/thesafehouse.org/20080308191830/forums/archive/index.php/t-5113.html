<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_zeemee</div><div class="date">06-28-02, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Auto-Training Stealth - As you level the trainer will say that you must have your stealth at the minimum level needed for your profession &amp;amp; therefore he will raise it by 1 if it is lower than that minimum. Which is basically ¼ your level. It starts at level 8 and increases every 4 levels by 1. So level 8 = level 2 stealth, level 12 = level 3 stealth, level 16 = level 4 stealth etc… So auto-training allows you to gain extra points you would have spent on stealth to use wherever you'd like even on higher levels of stealth. Auto-Training stealth to 32 gains 35 spec points. <br />
