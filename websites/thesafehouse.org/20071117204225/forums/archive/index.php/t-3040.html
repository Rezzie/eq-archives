<br />
What do you folks think?  The little tagline about &quot;not knowing to cast as an arcane or a divine&quot; each round seems to me to be a mostly trivial issue.  <br />
<br />
I guess what I see is that there's very little downside to going this route, especially if you look later on the caster's career.  Giving up 3 levels of arcane caster for the sake of some hefty cleric powers seems to me to be a gimme of a tradeoff.  That is - given that someone wants to devote themselves to being a wizard, taking a 3 level detour into cleric or druid is a relatively minor hit, seeing as you would be able to still cast 9th level spells as an arcane caster later on (albeit later), and be able to pack some heavy duty divine punch as well.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the archetype fighter/rogue/arcane/cleric party becomes after level 6 fighter/rogue/theurge/cleric or even -theurge/theurge.  The only downside is having to keep up both wisdom and int/cha.  But if you figure that the cleric path will end at effective level 13 cleric, you're still only looking at needing a 17 wisdom to cast those level 7 spells, something that with upper tier magic items is amazingly doable, even with a pretty paltry starting wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">04-04-03, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">general consensus is that it's a tad bit overpowered, but not as grossly as you'd think when you first look at it.<br />
<br />
and to quote sean reynolds on some of the issues:<br />
<br />
If you get into the class as early as possible:<br />
<br />
1) overall you end up with more spells per day than a single-classed cleric (you start off behind, but that's just because clerics get so many spells per day)<br />
2) you have more spells per day than a single-classed wizard (nearly twice as many when you reach the end of the class)<br />
3) you have more spells per day than a normal multiclassed spellcaster who splits his spellcaster levels evenly<br />
4) you have more total spell levels per day than a single-classed cleric<br />
5) ditto for wizard<br />
6) ditto for even-levels multiclassed spellcaster<br />
<br />
You get the same skill points as either class (assuming Clr or Wiz) and cleric BAB.<br />
<br />
Drawbacks: wizard saves (not as good as cleric), wizard hp (not as good as cleric), you don't get the high-level spells.<br />
<br />
he wrote up an analysis on the class, on his board.<br />
<br />
of course, one of the big problems is that the requirements for the class are an absolute joke. they aren't even really requirements, they're standard statistics for any multiclassed wiz(sorc)/cleric. plus, the class has absolutely no flavor to it - it just seems like a pointless powergamed wiz(sorc)/cleric prc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">04-04-03, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other drawbacks:<br />
<br />
No wizard bonus feats.<br />
Familiar doesn't gain in power.<br />
Turn undead doesn't increase in power, you're still turning at original cleric level.<br />
If druid, lose out on wildshapes and other special nifties.<br />
<br />
Technically it says a cleric cannot cast spells of an alignment opposed to his diety's, this would follow over into his arcane spellcastings too.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth:<br />
That's a wizard BAB.<br />
Most of the DMG prestige classes aren't terribly flavorful, some flavor yes, but not much. The DMG doesn't need to put too much flavor in it, because then it gets stuck into a certain campaign mold. The DMG has to have a certain amount of genericness to reach the greatest audience possible (yes, this is seen as both its strength and its weakness).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">04-04-03, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh it misses out on what, two bonus wizard feats and still gains the initial stat bonus from familiars? and with all the divine feats available, clerics can and will often use their turning ability for those instead.<br />
<br />
where does it say that bit about deity affecting arcane spellcasting? there's no reason it should, the alignment thing would come from your deity not granting specific spells, which has no effect on spells you memorize from your book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Raxee</div><div class="date">04-04-03, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder what happens if you start taking levels as a true necromancer.  Do you still add the caster levels together for necromancy spells, even though you're getting one in each per level with the Theurge?  Wouldn't that mean a level 17 character could be running around with an effective caster level of 30 or something for necromancy spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">04-04-03, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Matheren:<br />
you can take the theurge with as little as 3 wizard levels, which means you don't get feats at 5,10,15, and 20.<br />
<br />
Agreed, big deal about the familiar, they're not much of a big deal to me personally, but some people consider them greatly.<br />
<br />
Note I used the word &quot;technically&quot;. It says <br />
&quot;A cleric can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or to his deity's&quot; or somesuch<br />
It doesn't say the diety doesn't grant those spells. So a GM could certainly rule that way. I would. A cleric's diety should get mighty peeved if his good aligned cleric starts casting evil spells, arcane or no.<br />
<br />
You also have to take things in mind like splitting treasure on two ability scores. Instead of only having to purchase a +6 int item, you have to buy a +6int and +6 wis item (or whatever bonuses) to get full effect.<br />
<br />
Plus you still aren't going to be casting your arcane spells in armor without taking that arcane spell failure.<br />
<br />
I'm not thinking the Theurge is weak by any means, but I also don't think it's necessarily too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">04-04-03, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, for the alignment thing, how many arcane spells even have evil? the only 3e books I have with me are manual of the planes and dmg. but just as a combat/utility wiz alone, this guy is badass.<br />
<br />
for stats, you can have an 18 in main stat (probably int for the skills) and stick with a 12 wisdom, and by 12th level you should easily be able to get a +6 wis item. you should be able to MAKE one. even with a 25 point buy, you can come out with 16 int and 15 wis.<br />
<br />
now imagine this character at 20th level - a character able to cast 9th level spells in his main (probably wiz), and 7th in his offset (cleric). that's utterly devastating. and with the buff spells this guy will be casting from both the arcane and divine side, the armor thing is negligible at best.<br />
<br />
also remember that because it's a cleric/wiz, it has the ability to make both divine and arcane scrolls, on top of wands, potions, etc. so not only does it have a ridiculous amount of spells per day, not only can it throw a few maximized fireballs followed by a raise dead, but it can keep going after the spell slots run out. which would be a difficult thing to do :P<br />
<br />
Here is another discussion on it, on monte cook's board. some people did the math as far as total spells, etc. it is rather scary.</div></div><hr />
