<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-06-06, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So last night we managed to get on, and me and tea we're able to get our cleric to level 3 and a half. I rolled up a barbarian ... which is now level 3, and we all did successfully the following quests. Water Works, STKX2, Tangleroot, among others. We would've kept going until we could get sol level four, but I think five in the morning is late enough thank you.<br />
<br />
I managed to get a maul of rep bane right off the bat, and tea got some boots of feather fall 20 minutes after we stopped talking about how nice it would be .. to have some boots of feather fall.<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking when I get on at 8 I will be on my barbarian until we get sol to four, then I will get on motego and noone will have any &quot;you are being pl'd no exp for you!&quot; messages.</div></div><hr />

Hehe. I have Empower healing now so i can use the skill with less of a mana pen. Also got Devotion II. for a 20% bonus to healing spells of level 2 and 1.<br />
<br />
Might need to start looking up some cure wands for the small caster heals. They tend to eat up the mana :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT:    Not logging in after all, forgot I had to build a computer so I did that, now I'm gonna go rest my leg for a bit so I can play tonight.</div></div><hr />

Aye...I have it already but don't use it b/c heal takes most of the SP. Guess thats why heal wands are so widely chained most of the time.</div></div><hr />

Good work last night all, only downside, the sweling in my leg is insane, still hasn't gone down.  I spent too much time sitting at the computer with my leg down instead of propped up like I was suposed to.  Saturday I will have to keep my leg up even if it torques the **** out of my back.</div></div><hr />
