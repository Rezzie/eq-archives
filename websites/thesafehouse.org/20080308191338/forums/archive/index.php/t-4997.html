<br />
What would be the difference in % in the damage output for a shadowblade level 50 having Left Axe = 34  and Axe = 39 and a Shadowblade level 50 with LA=44 and Axe=44 ?<br />
<br />
Or in math terms, what would be function f of left axe and axe to determine DPS: DPS=f(A,LA)<br />
hehe<br />

<br />
a) Noone knows.<br />
b) We know but it's so obvious that you can find it anywhere on the web.<br />
c) err ... I don't understand the question ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dither DAoC</div><div class="date">03-30-02, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">basically, all we have for info is this:<br />
<br />
your damage range for both your main weapon and left axe is supposedly 25%-125% at no spec, 50%-125% at 1/2 spec, 75%-125% at 2/3 spec, and 100%-150% at full spec in your weapon.  this is a linear equation, not a stepping stone, so every point in weapon will raise your avg damage.<br />
<br />
using a left axe, your normal damage with each axe is halved, then you get 25% + .5% per LA point in bonus damage.<br />
<br />
You should be able to do your comparisons with those 2 formulas.  There is some question as to whether or not the first formula is 100% correct, because we don't see a raise in damage cap when we put points into weapon past our level, but this could be due to the damage formula having steps and capping before getting to the skill part, or the formula being wrong.  the other formula floating around is the same as the first, but it has 100%-125% as full spec damage.
