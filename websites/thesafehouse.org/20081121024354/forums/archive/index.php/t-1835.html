<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelbaaz</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. So I read here that training is a waste?  So, adding spending the points on enhancements is kind of pointless?  Do the enhancements really help that much, or no?<br />
<br />
2. I goofed, an accidentally didn't mean to pick what I picked at 6th lvl, I was going to pick a travel power, I clicked a power from my Primary power list, and then cancelled out from talking to the NPC, but it still went ahead and picked the primary power, as though I confirmed taking it... so my question is, am I screwed now because I missed picking a travel power?  <br />
<br />
I just hit lvl 9 last night, added 2 more enhancement slots to a power, but I guess I haven't paid any attention if I can pick a travel power at any level, or am I screwed now when I hit level 14?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can take a power pool power at any level after six as well.  If you want a flying hero, take hover at ten or twelve then flight at 14.  If you want a leaper take combat jump at ten or twelve then super leap at 14.  If you want a teleporter take teleport friend or foe at ten or twelve then teleport at 14.<br />
<br />
You just need to pick one of the first two powers in the series so the third opens up at level 14.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To take a traven power at 14 you need a precursor power before 14.  In beta I routinely waited until 12th level to take a precursor.  Also, you don't HAVE to take the travel power at 14, it becomes available and stays available from then on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all reality, aside from combat leap *extra defense* is really the only power worth taking before 10 or 12. Yes the lesser travel powers are nice they help a little bit, but are not essential by any means.<br />
<br />
As for Training enhancements. They DO help. As a defender i bought 5 trainings for my heal that were 2 levels above what i was. Each added 2 hp to my heal. For an ae heal thats very nice, as a total of 10 hp is a decent boost when even at 18 i only have like 408 hp.<br />
<br />
Yes, DO's and SO's are much better than trainings, but something with a training enhancement is better than nothing at all. Now as soon as you get around level 10 i would hold off on &quot;saving / buying&quot; training as you can start buying DO's in Steel Canyon around that time, and believe me they are expensive.<br />
<br />
Another thing when buying DO's is that being that they are so expensive is you have to really evaluate where you want to put your expansion slots. For example:<br />
<br />
As a radi / radi defender, i have several debuffs that drain end as long as they are on. So i just put enough end reducer enhances so that it breaks even with regen, theres really no reason to put more end reducers on it after that imo.<br />
<br />
For lesser powers like utility powers that you may have, at higher levels its okay to buy a lesser DO to put in there. It will still provide a nice increase to what you enhance and save you some $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I am the one who says Training Enh's are useless.  They arent useless, but they are useless to buy :)  The stuff you hunt usually drops some enh's, Ask your grp if you can get &amp;lt;x&gt; enh (like i usually give healers healing ones if they ask, or tanks resist dmg, ect ect).  Saves a ton of enh so you can get the good DO's at 12.<br />
<br />
Enh's are a Percentage increase, how they actually effect it, Im not certain, but from 1-12 you dont really see your archtype shine, so its not mandatory, but when ya get to 12, and mobs get harder and better, you need the enh's, so why waste inf on lowbie stuff, when you can save for DO's at 12.<br />
<br />
Movement isnt absolutely necessary, but it sure helps.  My first char (PhantomRogue on Freedom) has teleport, though its nice, its a huge End drain, Second has Flight, and third has Super Jump.  Super Jump is the best imo, least drain and good def bonus on Combat.  Its all a matter of preference, a few range/end reducers on TP and you can TP a good ways (Max at 14 is like 120yds).  But depending on your Arch, you might get a good bonus from Hover, Blasters like Hover, Tankers/Scrappers like Jump [can land in middle of a grp of mobs and not die like a jumpin blaster ;)]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you level on the top right there is an option to select a new powers, use that and you still get a travel power before 14 so you can upgrade it at 14.  Get a travel power, it makes the game so much easier.<br />
<br />
If training enhancments gave 0% then they would be useless.  But they don't so they are still very usefull.<br />
<br />
At your level you should save up for a few good DO enhancements that you can first use at lvl 12.  Like most players you probally have around 10k or so you cant afford much.  Choose a few solid DO's and the fill in the rest with lvl 15 training enhancements.  <br />
<br />
Then you want to save up for DO's to slot, but do not waste any money stacking them, since at lvl 17 you be working for the lvl 20 DO's and at lvl 18 all your previous DO's will not give you any benefit. (3 lvl limit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my 2 influence on training enhancements.  Useful, but not useful enough to buy them.  Training drops so much in normal play that you shouldn't need to buy them.  just save that influence for the DOs on your primary powers when you hit 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True enough, but  the &quot;etc powers&quot; do not have DO's available until lvl 22 so you must use training enh's in some slots.<br />
<br />
Take a travel power it is essential.<br />
<br />
Everyone you group with will have some in one form or another, you don't want to be the gimp that needs a teleport 10 minutes or gets lost because they can't keep up with the group.<br />
<br />
Also the hazard zones can be deadly if you dont have some defense power or a travel power.  And the game is 10 times funner when you don't die from simply running to a contact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd disagree with you quite a bit there.<br />
<br />
Recall Friend Has come in useful a million times as a Healer, and a Group leader. If I'm in Perez Park, and we need to invite someone else into the group, we could A) Fight our way out invite him and then fight our way back in, and take 10 minutes doing it. Or B) Invite, target him and use Teleport Friend, and poof, he's right beside us.<br />
<br />
Or as a Healer... Lets say someone has run out of range chasing a runner, or the Group gets spread out a bit, and I can't cover both halves of the group. I see someone in either of thsoe situations getting beat down quickly? Poof, He's over beside me, and an Heal other/Absorb Pain and He's back at 100% health.<br />
<br />
Also, Hover is Great. It allows me to solo by getting out of Melee range (Yeah, they can shoot, but I'd rather take a shot every now and then than a cosntant sledgehammer to the forehead that does 4x the damage each hit.) Also, Its a great defensive buff, and for non-melee types, it allows us to be above the fray, rather than down in it. Gives us a lot better view of the battle, and the ability to manage it a lot easier with heals and crowd control stuff. In my regular group, the scrapper and tanker are down on the ground, while everyone else hovers above, or just behind them in msot battles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i disagree that training enhancements are a waste. while you spend some points, frankly after buying level 5 training enhancments at early levels helped me alot.<br />
<br />
also the key is not to buy 3 identical training enhancements. IE buy 1 level 10 defense buff, then use drops in the 7-9 range to improve it.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to power selection,its pretty important. mostly because you have to look at the powers you want. buying flurry,or jump kick is uesless unless your willing to put extra slots into them to improve your damage.<br />
<br />
i selected extra pool powers at 6 and 8 because my available choices were not great to start with.<br />
<br />
the first time around, i messsed up my power selection by level 10,and along with a bug i encountered my charecter was rerolled.</div></div><hr />
