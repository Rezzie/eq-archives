Kind of gives a warm fuzzy feeling, no?<br />

Sony halts development. (http://mac.ign.com/articles/518/518131p1.html)<br />

May 22, 2004 - Sony Online Entertainment today confirmed that they have halted production on the development for the Mac version of the popular MMORPG, Everquest. In a post on the eqmac.com forum, an Everquest gamer posted an email from D. Scott Mattson, Executive Director of Customer Service.<br />
<br />
The email says: &quot;My apologies Brian but as a company Sony Online Entertainment will not be making any changes or coding fixes to the Al Kabor server. This decision was a business decision made some time ago by our Executive staff and still stands today. Even if we wanted to we could not do the changes as we have no programmers on staff that can accommodate the needs of the Mac. This is probably going to come as a blow to you and your friends but at this juncture this is the situation we are left with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although Sony will no longer release patches and bug fixes the Mac version of Everquest the server is still online.<br />

<br />
Do you think this is a real blow? Is the server always really full? Does their server message board indicate a mass leaving of EQ or just a platform switch?<br />
<br />
Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">05-24-04, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It says its still going to keep the servers.  And wasn't the mac version of the game only on the SoV expack? like 3 year old ?  Could it be they just can't find any more bugs in that game.<br />
<br />
If thats the case I always thought that eq died after that expack if they just keep a server up to that expansion...well then maybe i'll go buy a mac.<br />
<br />
 :liar</div></div><hr />
