<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinge</div><div class="date">02-07-07, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not seen any information on this quest posted yet, and it's a great quest doable at lvl 18ish for a rare quality 15dps dagger. At the time that I did this, this dagger represented a massive upgrade for me. <br />
<br />
Involved killing only 2 dot mobs so quite possibly soloable, although when I did it I duoed it with a warrior friend and would probably recommend getting some help, at least for the dungeon parts unless you have stealth skills maxed and are lvl 18+. The final reward is a choice between fairly nice weapons (dagger, bow, +healing staff and caster staff I believe, although disappointingly when I did this with my warrior friend he could only really use the bow - had been hoping for a sword or something similar.)<br />
<br />
Posted below is info based on my recollection of doing this quest, anyone else who has done it feel free to add comments as my recollection of some parts might be a bit hazy.<br />
<br />
Quest line starts from Guard Cronan, 3 rivers village. There are a number of quests in the line, I believe the first is obtainable from lvl 16 onwards. Was able to get these quests without being kos as a goblin.<br />
<br />
First quest - kill Stonesmasher Gamehunters, easily found in the open south of 3 rivers.<br />
<br />
Second quest - kill Stonesmasher Fishermen, easily found on the banks of the rive to the West of 3 rivers.<br />
<br />
Third quest - kill Stonesmasher Gemrunners - rarish spawn, best place I found was just south of the main Stonesmasher encampment south of 3 rivers. They spawn in the encampment itself and then run both south and northish, so I hung out south of the gate to encampment and ganked em as they appeared<br />
<br />
Fourth quest - kill Stonesmasher Gemseekers. Actually need to go into the Stonesmasher Enclave to find these, which is a 2 dot dungeon SE of 3 rivers. In the dungeon, head left at the entrance then take first left again, and you should find em.<br />
<br />
Fifth quest - kill a named Chief in Stonesmasher Enclave. To find where he spawns, head left at the entrance to the dungeon, first left again, follow the passage down to a largish open area with some tent like structures at the far wall. Chief is a rare spawn under the far tent structure, spawns by a table. However, he is a rare spawn, 20 minute timer, has a normal Stonesmasher mob as a PH. Took me about 2 hours to get him to spawn, ranger friend of mine who had done this same quest earlier and told me about it said it had taken him 4 hours.<br />
<br />
Mobs in the dungeon go up to lvl 18, so could be rough doing this solo unless you are lvl 18+ and have stealth maxed - in which case can probably sneak to the Chief spawn point and gank him or his PH solo without getting any adds. The fact he's a rare spawn has led a number of people to believe that this quest is broken, but as of last Sunday 4th Feb I can confirm it does work - completed it then as did my ranger friend.<br />
<br />
That's about all I have for now, but figured I'd share as I found this a great way to get a nice dagger.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly, there were some nice pieces of armor scattered in the quests as well.</div></div><hr />

Same here, thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitch</div><div class="date">02-09-07, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone one Florendyl want to duo the last part with me? I think he's lvl 17 3-dot.  I'm currently camped right behind his tent, and should be logged in this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Send a tell to Grimzik, or PM me here.  I'll be on around 6 MST, United States.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Schortt</div><div class="date">02-10-07, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the rewards for the last three steps are very nice boots (Sandals of Disruption), gloves (Cronan's Fistwraps), and the dagger (Cronan's Shank).  I believe you have to be 14 to start the series and 16 to do the last part.<br />
<br />
Another good dagger quest for Thestrans is in Renton Keep, and begins with the Dwarf inside the keep itself (in front of the fireplace).  He sends you to a man who lives in a farmhouse near Tharridon's Quarry who proceeds to have you loot some crates, kill some Hobgoblin Thaumaturges (17-18 2dot), and then the Quarrymaster (18-19 4dot).  The end reward is a Crystalline Shiv, which is just a tad more DPS than Cronan's Shank with a big +hp mod as well instead of +9con.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finkel</div><div class="date">02-14-07, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some thoughts after dooing both quests at lvl 20, mostly solo. <br />
<br />
First the bugbear questline, the cave for the last two steps is a 3dot dungeon with the nameds beeing 2dot, including the final mob you need, so as long as you can solo a lvl 16ish 3dot, you should be able to solo everything in this questline. The spot for the final mob was dead on, and I think the time on the ph was also correct, he pops alot slower then the rest of the room. <br />
<br />
The second chain of quests,from renton was alittle bit harder. The aggro range on the mobs down in the quarry is quite large, even at lvl 20 and some of the mobs have a habit of sitting below the groud, so what you thought was a solo pull, might turn out to be a double, or in worst case a tripple. <br />
<br />
All mobs, part from the nameds are two dots. The second part of the chain involves killing lvl 18 2dot mobs, and as far as I could see, they always have atleast one buddy standing right next to them. Although blackjack makes it easy.<br />
<br />
For the final fella, the Quarrymaster, he is rare, for me alot rarer then the final mob for the other chain. I even got told that he was bugged, while shouting for a group to camp this spot. If you go straight ahead in the quarry and as far in as possible you will face two groups of mobs, standing in packs of 3. One of them has a Overseer and another one has a Instructor. The Overseer is the ph for the Quarrymaster and the Instructor for another named ( lvl 19 3dot). As said before, the Quarrymaster is a lvl 18-19 4dot, this is not something you can solo so either have a good group, or a bad one with a passion for kiting. I used the later and it worked out fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zokushi</div><div class="date">02-23-07, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I did it! We got the bugbear menace dagger after only camping the named about 30mins-1hr.  We got in right after the server crashed so no one else was there to claim him.<br />
<br />
However, we camped the named for the second quest out of renton keep for a good 5 hours with no luck. We got a ton of iron and sandstone and tin and slate... even a star iron ore... but no named. I don't know if I'm going to bother to finish the quest.  I decided since I had the first dagger and it was a very minimal upgrade to the second that I would get the mace to replace my shoddy longsword.  But, after 5 hours .. well I could've bought or farmed something else by then!</div></div><hr />
