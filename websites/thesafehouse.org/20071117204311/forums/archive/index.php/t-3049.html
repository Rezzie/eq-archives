Im gonna run a game where EQ, Starwars, and DnD have meshed together. I was wondering if anyone has tried this and can maybe give me some advice on how to make it work.  <br />
<br />
Right now im thinking of taking the equipment slots and delay weapons of EQ and make it universal for everyone.  I dont know what to do about spells though.  Should i let the EQ guys keep the mana system?  does it work well in the DnD world?<br />
<br />
Starwars and DnD fit really well together im just having trouble with the EQ converting to mesh with starwars and DnD.<br />
<br />
Its actually gonna be interesting but we are already laughing our asses off at an elf jedi and a wookie EQ cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">04-22-03, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, im currently in a campaign we have dubbed Final Fantasy O (Due to the GM's first name starting with O)<br />
Its a mix of EQ, d20 and Rifts.  A FFX type setting with one person being a Summoner and most of the rest of the group her guardians.<br />
Its working out fairly well.<br />
<br />
Mixing with Star Wars would probably be just as easy, if not easier consitering its already got a d20 conversion.<br />
As far as the Mana Point system.  I prefer a point system over the slot system of d20 because it gives you more variety and makes you more of a spell caster IMO. But the downside is that you end up not being able to cast as many spells each day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">05-31-03, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to mesh worlds together a great system to use is GURPS: Generic Universal roleplaying system.  It's designed to allow for all settings and worlds to use the same rules.   And unlike many other systems the rules actually make sense in relation to real life.  www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/  <br />
That link goes to a free distillation of the GURPS system and explains how the system works and has some basic information about it.  From the information in the download at the link you can make a campaign, create characters, and run combat scenes.  However, unlike most systems GURPS does not give any backround story, it simply gives generic rules and leaves the game worlds up to the DM, which I suppose is what you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">06-03-03, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The meshing worlds came about because the GM is really into the d20 system (Heavly modified by House Rules)  The Rifts came into it for the Post-Apoc Gear as per the setting, But he hates Mega-Damage.  The EQ involvement comes because he's a 180% EQ Addict.</div></div><hr />
