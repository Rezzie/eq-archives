<br />
But I notice two issues already...<br />
<br />
1. I just applied on the NWN site about 30 min ago - and have yet to have any email response, I'm sure it's probably like the Root Cellar where you guys manually check it but the wording it used after punching in the info didn't seem to indicate a delay. (assuming I'm right, might want to add in info regarding the delay to stop people perstering ya'll with annoying &quot;When?&quot;s)<br />
<br />
2. Regarding reporting the above, I looked for a bug report link and couldn't find one... =/<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok, 10-15 min ago... apparently it's too late and I'm losing my sense of time ^_~ Edited by: Vaclav Romanov  at: 7/14/02 12:31:48 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">07-13-02, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just looked into this, and the emails are not leaving the server like they should..<br />
<br />
As typically happnes the first thing you make work is the first thing to break..<br />
<br />
I can manually activate your account.. try logging in in a few minutes<br />
<br />
Aye, the bug report will only hsow up once you are logged in. I added a link to the Staff tab...<br />

<br />
An aesthetics suggestion though: in the news section, yellow links on the light-grey-colored background are hard on the eyes.  They look great on the medium-blue background though.<br />

 Edit: apparently this came from the department of redundancy department..  <br />

<br />
how does one check their messages?  i must be missing something. . .<br />
<br />
also, when I click Account I get this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Cannot execute query: SELECT u.email AS email, COALESCE(COUNT(c.uid),0) AS charcnt FROM users AS u, characters AS c WHERE u.uid = c.uid AND u.uid= GROUP BY u.email&quot;<br />
<br />
blah!<br />
<br />
Edit: Scratch that, it was because I was accessing it through hotmail(my normal email wasnt workin).  This post is now irrelevant.<br />
<br />
blah!<br />
<br />
Edit2:  When trying to change my email addy it gives me &quot;Cannot get count!&quot; Nothin but smooth. . .<br />

<br />
if you are not using a java supported browser, I appologize, but you will not be able to access the site.<br />
<br />
If you are using a Java supported browser but your internet security settings are blocking java code, you can do a couple things, but the easiest is adding *.thesafehouse.org to your trusted sites...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">07-18-02, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the goal is to provide you all with a full server status page so you can see who is currently logged into the Virtual Safehouse. Possibly even provide characther names.<br />
<br />
The problem is the Server admin community is working very hard on developing the tools and scripts to perform this, they are just not doing fast enough for me..<br />
<br />
I am not a developer, but I sure know how to steal and manipulate code well enough to utilize it, in other words I know just enough to be dangerous.<br />
<br />
To be honest we really have no idea how many users we can support. The theoretical limit is 64 people, I have not heard of anyone reaching that as of yet.<br />
<br />
This is our current web user count:<br />
<br />
Active  111  <br />
Inactive  11  <br />
<br />
I am also developing a second server that is a bit more powerful than the current one in case we find we reach out  limit on resources.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you all hanging in there while we do our due diligence. We want to make sure you have a solid, stable, and fun experience...<br />
<br />
If all goes well, We might mail out passwords on Saturday night..<br />

No characters listed? No events signed up for? Unchecked mail?<br />
