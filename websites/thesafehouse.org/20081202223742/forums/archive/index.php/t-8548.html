<br />
I am looking for a walk though for ragebringer. I assume there is one somewhere on the site since this is the rogue communittee site.  <br />
<br />
I did searches in each of the forums, but never found a walk though. Just general questioins about level requirements and skill requirements, and lots of complaining /shrug.<br />
<br />
I would like to start assembling all the stuff my rogue needs to get while I still can get exp from the camps.  I really hate farming green critters. So I figured I can atleast get exp while camping stuff.   Tsulyra  Shadowhawk<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cybelle</div><div class="date">04-24-03, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if this was caused by a patch bug, whether it's just on Terris Thule server, or whether it was a concious change made that no one has noted, that I've seen, on walk-thrus, but Founy no longer despawns at 8am game time and respawns at 10am game time... And Tani DOES have a noted, visible depop/repop cycle, though his is more instantaneous...<br />
<br />
I watched server times carefully, and Founy has been depopping at 7am and repopping at 8am game time. Tani insta de/re-pops at 7pm.<br />
<br />
Founy was obvious... I spent a whole cycle pp'ing, getting nothing... Game time, sat down next to the vendor across the way by the tunnel out of Kaladim. His was a regular de/re-pop and I checked game time of both.<br />
<br />
Tani wasn't near as obvious... I made it a habit, to at least attempt a run-out in case of failure, of coming into Tani's room and, while on the stairs, targetting and hailing him to turn him around facing the way out. Then jumped up on the wooden rail behind him, faced out the doorway... Promptly at 7pm game time, evertime, he'd blink for a second and be facing the wood again, and he'd no longer be targetted. Every time.<br />
<br />
Anyway...If anyone is keeping up on that kind of minutia, there it is. heh</div></div><hr />
