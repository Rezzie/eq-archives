<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I brutally copied several peoples binds to make this one, but it works quite well for me.<br />
<br />
What it does: <br />
<br />
If you are on the ground:<br />
<br />
WAS&amp;amp;D trigger both movement and Sprint (Or in my particular case, my prestige power). Releasing the button toggles sprint off, and makes me cease moving in that direction. This means that when I'm standing still, no endurance is being used on my sprint, but the second I move forwrd, left, right or back I'm moving at sprint speed.<br />
<br />
Autorun has the same functionality with sprint, but you still tap it to turn on, and tap it to turn off. The only downfall is that Turning it off using the S key will reverse your sprint toggle Also, pressing multiple direction keys at once may also do that. In that case, Press G to Turn Sprint off in whatever state it is currently in, and you will be back to default state on the ground.<br />
<br />
Hovering:<br />
<br />
If I hit F, I jump immediately into the air, Toggle Hover and continue going straight upward. Gets me out of range of enemies.<br />
<br />
Hit F a second time, and I cease gaining altitude.<br />
<br />
Hit F a third time, and I return to my ground state.<br />
<br />
If at any time I need to know what state I'm in, I press K, and it sends me a tell.<br />
<br />
If for some reason I get knocked out of the sky, or my powers are deactivated, and the binds get out of synch, pres Left Shift + T to reset me to the initial (ground) state.<br />
<br />
Below are the three files I need to do this<br />
<br />
Hover1.txt<br />
f &quot;powexec_name Prestige Power Quick$$powexec_name Hover$$powexec_name Hover$$++up$$bind_load_file C:\COH\Binds\Hover2.txt&quot;<br />
k &quot;Tell $name,&amp;lt;color red&gt;&amp;lt;bgcolor yellow&gt;&amp;lt;scale 1.25&gt;Hover1 - Stationary On Ground&quot;<br />

w &quot;+forward$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot;<br />
a &quot;+left$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot;<br />
d &quot;+right$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot;<br />
s &quot;+backward$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot;<br />
r &quot;++Autorun$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot;<br />
g &quot;powexec_name Prestige Power Quick$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort&quot;<br />
<br />
Hover2.txt<br />
f &quot;-up$$bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\Hover3.txt&quot;<br />
k &quot;Tell $name,&amp;lt;color red&gt;&amp;lt;bgcolor yellow&gt;&amp;lt;scale 1.25&gt;Hover2.txt - Hovering, Moving Up&quot;<br />
lshift+t &quot;Tell $name,&amp;lt;color blue&gt;&amp;lt;bgcolor yellow&gt;&amp;lt;scale 1.25&gt;Reset Hover/Fly Toggle$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick$$powexec_name Hover$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort$$-up$$bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\Hover1.txt&quot;<br />
w &quot;+forward&quot;<br />
a &quot;+left&quot;<br />
d &quot;+right&quot;<br />
s &quot;+backward&quot; <br />
r &quot;++Autorun&quot;<br />
<br />
Hover3.txt<br />
f &quot;powexec_name Hover$$bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\Hover1.txt&quot;<br />
k &quot;Tell $name,&amp;lt;color red&gt;&amp;lt;bgcolor yellow&gt;&amp;lt;scale 1.25&gt;Hover3 - Hovering, Stationary&quot;<br />
lshift+t &quot;Tell $name,&amp;lt;color blue&gt;&amp;lt;bgcolor yellow&gt;&amp;lt;scale 1.25&gt;Reset Hover/Fly Toggle$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick$$powexec_name Hover$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort$$-up$$bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\Hover1.txt&quot;<br />
w &quot;+forward&quot;<br />
a &quot;+left&quot;<br />
d &quot;+right&quot;<br />
s &quot;+backward&quot;<br />
r &quot;++Autorun&quot;<br />
<br />
Simply copy these files 3 into the directory c:\COH\Binds\ and type the command &quot;bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\Hover1.txt&quot; into your chat window. (If you want to change the directory structure, or use Sprint or some other prestige power, just be sure to change it in all places in all the files, otherwise you may get strange results.)<br />
<br />
(There may be some Issues with line breaks in the copy paste. In any event, there should be a new line before each Key (Like &quot;W&quot;) and each Chord Key + key combination (Like &quot;lshift+t&quot;)<br />
<br />
I don't have Fly. But if You do, you may want to substitute the following lines in at the bottom of Hover2 and Hover3, overwriting what I currently have for WASD and R. (Edit, this sentence originally said Hover 1 and 2. If you did that, its gonna be screwed up for ya.)<br />
<br />
w &quot;+forward$$powexec_name hover$$powexec_name fly&quot;<br />
a &quot;+left$$powexec_name hover$$powexec_name fly&quot;<br />
d &quot;+right$$powexec_name hover$$powexec_name fly&quot;<br />
s &quot;+backward$$powexec_name hover$$powexec_name fly&quot;<br />
r &quot;++Autorun$$powexec_name hover$$powexec_name fly&quot;<br />
g &quot;powexec_name fly$$powexec_name hover$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abortpowexec_name hover&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This Should give you the ability to use WASD and R to toggle from sprint to fly, move in the direction you want to move in, and then when you release the key, Fly will deactivate, and Hover will take over. I haven't tested it myself, so check it out before combat, ok?<br />
<br />
The Same problem may occur that I mentioned above. with Sprint and cutting off autorun (Well, autofly?) by using the S key. Similar to above, G should Turn Fly off and Hover on, no matter what state you are currently in. I made this one up just now, so please verify that one especially.<br />
<br />
Also, and added bonus for teleporters like myself:<br />
<br />
SHIFT+LBUTTON &quot;powexec_name teleport&quot;<br />
<br />
Hold down left shift and left click your mouse wherever you want to go. Much, much easier than clicking the button and then targetting.<br />

Edit: Edited out some old code related to fly mode, that is no longer needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aah, but for us squishy types, Its a lot easier to survive by not having to land every few seconds, possibly in the middle of a bunch of people who want to beat us into a pulp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-26-04, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh I just want one that will reliably turn all my toggle powers back on.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I get stunned all my powers drop, which means I start taking damage.<br />
<br />
So I need to turn on:<br />
Temporary Invulnerability<br />
Tough<br />
Super Jump (Or Combat Leaping depending on the tactics)<br />
Acrobatics<br />
Weave<br />
Sprint<br />
Invincibility<br />
<br />
Before the pain goes away :P<br />
<br />
Problem is, since Acrobatics and Tough both have a small activation time, if I try binding them it prepares one, and abandons the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-26-04, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best solution I can think of with that is a single toggle bind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Temporary Invulnerability <br />
Tough <br />
Super Jump (Or Combat Leaping depending on the tactics) <br />
Acrobatics <br />
Weave <br />
Sprint <br />
Invincibility <br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
TempInvuln.txt<br />
X &quot;Tell $name,Temporary Invuln Activated$$powexec_name Temporary Invulnerability$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort$$powexec_name Temporary Invulnerability$$bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\Tough.txt&quot; <br />
<br />
Tough.txt<br />
X &quot;Tell $name,Tough Activated$$powexec_name Tough$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort$$powexec_name Tough$$bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\SuperJump.txt&quot; <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Create a series of these files, replacing The Name of the power with each one in the list, except that the one in the bin_load_file command would refer to the next one you want to setup.<br />
<br />
As soon as all your toggles go down, hitting the key several times in succession would make sure that all toggles are on, regardless of what state you started in.<br />
<br />
Also, you may want to have a bind like this:<br />
<br />
lshift+X &quot;powexec_name Temporary Invulnerability$$powexec_name Tough$$powexec_name Super Jump$$...{Add in the rest of the powers you have here}...$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort$$&quot;<br />
<br />
This would shut off all the toggles at once.<br />
<br />
You might need to make a separate set for combat jump and Super Jump, Probably jsut one to toggle between them, and then Shift + the same key to turn them off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I don't have hover or fly or any of that...and can't decipher how I'm supposed to do the first part and leave the rest out.   I don't get this macro stuff at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-26-04, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Copy the following into a file named autosprint.txt<br />
<br />
w &quot;+forward$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot; <br />
a &quot;+left$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot; <br />
d &quot;+right$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot; <br />
s &quot;+backward$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot; <br />
r &quot;++Autorun$$powexec_name Prestige Power Quick&quot; <br />
g &quot;powexec_name Prestige Power Quick$$powexec_name Brawl$$powexec_abort&quot;<br />
<br />
(If you have a different prestige power, or use sprint only, replace the name &quot;Prestige Power Quick&quot; with &quot;Sprint&quot; or whatever other prestige power you want to use.<br />
<br />
Then place that file in the directory listed above<br />
<br />
Once in the game, use the command &quot;bind_load_file c:\COH\Binds\autosprint.txt&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, using WASD and R will trigger the autosprint commands as shown, and G will reset the sprint toggle if for some reason it gets out of synch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">05-27-04, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just so I know...do you use A and D to turn left and right or to strafe left and right?  And any idea what &quot;numlock&quot; would be instead of R?  I got used to autorun in EQ being Numlock, and I find I hit R accidentally a lot.<br />
I'm going to be flipping through some bind tutorials later today, and maybe I'll find it, but I figured I'd ask.  Thanks for the help though, REALLY appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Vilk<br />
<br />
edit:  found the turnleft and turnright.  yay! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kierra the Silent</div><div class="date">05-27-04, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok this might be a dumb qustion but as i know nothing of doing key binds here goes<br />
<br />
in this line:<br />
lshift+f &quot;Tell $name,&amp;lt;color blue&gt;&amp;lt;bgcolor yellow&gt;&amp;lt;scale 1.25&gt;Fly Mode!$$bind_load_file c:\coh\binds\fly1.txt&quot; <br />
<br />
it refers to a fly1.txt file<br />
<br />
now considering there is no file listed here as fly1.txt is this gonna give me some screwy error?<br />
<br />
and if so what do i need to put in the fly1.txt file  if I need to make it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-27-04, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry bout that. The fly1.txt, fly2.txt and fly3.txt were in there from a previous version. I should have taken those out, but forgot to. Its taken care of now.<br />
<br />
Worst case scenario, it would jsut say &quot;Hey, I couldn't find those files,&quot; and leave the bindings in the mode it was in before hitting that key combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">05-28-04, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured out my problems.  And now I have a bind that does basically what you said it would with Prestige Power Dash, with all the correct bindings.  And thanks to messing with things I also have learned a little bit about how bindings work and was able to help someone fix one that they had screwed up :)<br />
<br />
One thing I found on my own was the word &quot;num&quot; stands for the number lock key.  And its +turnleft and +turnright ... though it took me a few minutes to realize I didn't need to turn PPD on when I turned.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed, though, is that the key seems to get stuck in the wrong mode a lot, so I find myself hitting &quot;G&quot; quite a bit.  Not a big deal, just wish it wouldn't get stuck like that :(<br />
<br />
Vilk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phred</div><div class="date">09-09-04, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't play anymore but I thought people playing might be interested in some key bindings I worked up to emulate EQ's method of strafing while the right button is down and turning when it wasn't. You need 2 files. I call one <br />
strafe.txt <br />
<br />
rbutton &quot;+mouse_look$$bind_load_file c:\coh\turn.txt&quot;<br />
a &quot;+left&quot;<br />
d &quot;+right&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and the other turn.txt<br />
<br />
rbutton &quot;+mouse_look$$bind_load_file c:\coh\strafe.txt&quot;<br />
a &quot;+turnleft&quot;<br />
d &quot;+turnright&quot;<br />
<br />
and both are kept in a folder called c:\coh<br />
<br />
After putting them there just type /bind_load_file c:\coh\turn.txt<br />
and you're off and running. <br />
<br />
The only drawback to this is occasionally CoH loses track of mouse up and mouse down events and you can find yourself stuck running or spinning in place. Usually a few quick hits on the movement key defining the mode you are stuck in will unstick you.</div></div><hr />
