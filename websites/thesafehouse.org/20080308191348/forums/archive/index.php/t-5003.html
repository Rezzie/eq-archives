Why do people choose to limit autotraining stealth to lvl28?  Why not autotrain beyond level 28 (besides the headache involved)?<br />
<br />
I just restarted my 37SB to respec and am back to lvl7 after one night of play.  I am auto training stealth but I still see no raise in stealth at lvl7.  I have 1+1 stealth (Ring of Stealthy).  When does stealth auto-train?<br />
<br />
[Side note:started a char on Merlin server this week for fun.  After asking 8 lvl40-50 players, only one of them knew what auto-training/auto-specing is, what gives?]</div></div><hr />

I meant why do people not autotrain past CLASS level 28?  I wasn't refering to stealth spec 29 potential.<br />
<br />
BUT, since you bring this up......I previously read your post and didn't understand what you meant by 41.  I assume you mean 29+11 from items and another +1 from realm rank right? =41<br />
BUT, I thought I read elswhere on this forum that you can eventually get +10 from realm rank 11 in addition to the +11 from items.  Wouldn't this take it as high as 50 not 41?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point is as soon as you put points on CS, you will feel the urge to train because you will immediately feel the painful effects of losing stealth most of the time, and only if you don't put any points in CS, will you feel comfortable autotraining till 48.  I had 21 in CS before I trained stealth at 24.  It was painful waiting that long.<br />
And yes, you could get up to 50 with realm rank, but reasonably speaking you probably won't get to level 4 RR, and I would guess the way realm points are given is going to change in the near future. Edited by: Lisboa at: 4/1/02 12:07:38 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shandray</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.  I'm beginning to recognize just how &quot;out of reach&quot; any realm rank above 4 is with the currect realm rank system.  I think I will revise my long term plan for max 29 stealth.  Perhaps 35 base stealth is more realistic as a projected long-term DAoC player.<br />
But honestly, I hope they do not change the system 'cause it will AGAIN undermine what players have worked so hard toward in specing.  Plus, if a player somehow attains realm rank 11, well HELL, he sure deserves possessing a strong edge over others in terms of free specs and rank bonuses.  Such exceptional bonuses SHOULD be extremely difficult to attain.  It also helps to minimize UBER-minded @#%$.</div></div><hr />
