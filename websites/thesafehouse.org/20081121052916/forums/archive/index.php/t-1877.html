<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mrens</div><div class="date">09-28-03, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My situation with my roomate has gone way past simple annoyance, that bitch is @#%$ crazy!<br />
<br />
For starters, she talks my @#%$ ear off all the damn time, I don't really mind, it's nice to have an exscuse to drag me away from my computer. But holy hell, I comment on one damn thing she raving about and she can always make me feel like the @#%$. I can't say ANYTHING withought getting a dirty look and swore at. &quot;Fine, just...@#%$ FINE!&quot; seems to be her catch phrase.<br />
<br />
She asks me how she looks, almost every day (She has serious issues about her looks, and is a belimech(sp?)) My normal responce is a quick glance and &quot;You look nice, where are you off to tonight?&quot; (Years of dealing with females have taught me this is the best answer) And HOLY @#%$, aparently she interpets this as me saying she looks like a fat ass slut! She @#%$ goes off on me just cussing me out and all kinds of nasty @#%$. Like I said im not sleeping with you, so im not gonna put up with your BS!<br />
<br />
Her belimia(Sp?) Yes im almost positive, she dosent even try to act secretive about it, I havent said anything because of the @#%$ storm I know it will start.<br />
<br />
Now she does have one redeming factor Erin, Erin is a good friend of hers, and I like to think mine by now, Erin is a very sweet person who I do have a bit of a crush on, we talk often and have even gone out to a few movies and Dinner as friends. We often talk about the mental welfare on my roomate, she agrees that &quot;She aint right&quot; and knows about her eating disorders and has asked me not to kick her out. I won't because Erin asked, and she often stays over on my couch, I got no complaints there because she is usually over for the whole day and we get to hang out.<br />
<br />
That we have her boyfriend, her alcholic boyfriend, I don't know how certain people seem to attract the @#%$ of the world but she seems to do it quite well (Excluding Erin of course) Now I wouldent even mention him if it wasent for two reasons. 1. Whenever he comes up in a conversation I know im gonna get chastised for saying something with the wrong tone. 2. He is the reason I am up right now, I have two phones, one in my room and one in my living room. He calls at 6 @#%$ AM once a week and just lets it RING AND RING AND RING until it wakes me up and I answer. Our conversations ALWAYS goes something like this <br />
<br />
Drunk (In a slured voice): I Daniela there?<br />
Me: It's 4 AM, she is here, and asleep.<br />
Drunk: Oh *Click* <br />
<br />
I just started turning off the phone in my room saturday nights (When he calls) I guess I forgot to tonight. I have brought this up to her, her usual recorse is &quot;ITS NONE OF MY @#%$ BUSINESS WHO CALLS HER&quot; <br />
<br />
Now this is a very horible overstatement, made by someone who is very pissed about being waken up 3 hours early, she is probibly pleasent 5 nights a week. (Infact she gave me a very good haircut today (Saved me $12  )<br />
<br />
But I swear it's like she can control her period and chooses to have them one night a week. I have taken to locking my door and pretending to be asleep when I know she is in one of her moods.</div></div><hr />

Having an alcoholic boyfriend is bad enough, but the bulemia nervosa will KILL her.<br />
<br />
You and Erin, if you are Daniela's friends, should take her to the hospital for the bulemia, and let her get better step by step.  There's no reason why you should be going crazy trying to deal with someone that has definite mental problems.  (Back In Black)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xanyia</div><div class="date">09-29-03, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to share a four bedroom apartment with two baths in Rome with three other girls a few years back.<br />
<br />
What made it all work was that everyone of us had total privacy in their bedroom, that is if the door is closed and it's not a phone call we wouldn't even dream of knocking on the door.  If we knew we were expecting a phone call after 9 pm we would make sure to answer the phone as soon as it started ringing in the hall personally.<br />
<br />
If we were in a chatty mood we'd just let the bedroom door wide open, or go out in the kitchen, turn on the radio and make coffee or tea.  Sooner or later one of the other girls would show up.<br />
<br />
I cherish memories of that time, I spent over two years in that apartment.  Even if there was four of us we were still able to have a quiet and relaxing everyday life, we could have our boyfriends visiting but it  never turned chaotic or disrespectful.<br />
<br />
One important thing when you have roomates is to set firm rules so that no one has to suffer beause of the close quarters.</div></div><hr />
