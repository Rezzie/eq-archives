Overall, very good with some interesting new lore.  There were a couple of times where I got the impression that the designers created some creatures more as &quot;what they think they should be&quot; rather than how they actually are in the game - which is fair enough in most cases.<br />
<br />
I'm now awaiting the DM's book ... would be good to get that final piece of the puzzle.</div></div><hr />

Really TibisHatter? Please elaborate, I'm genuinely curious.</div></div><hr />

only think I found odd was that mayong is like one of the greatest evils to plague norath , well considering about a 3rd of the critters deal with him hehe.<br />
<br />
What i want though is the Bloody GM's guide so i can convert equipment over.   Jazzin Kur'nel, 63 Rogue<br />

He is my favorite character in all of Everquest.  Hands down. I would love to read lore on him.  He's got his finger's in everyone's pockets.  Since release, almost every character in kelethin has something say about him.  With every expansion release I hope for more info on him.  I don't ever want him to be in the game though, I don't want to see him get killed.<br />
I'm hoping more lore on him shows up in the next expansion. <br />
Ever since the government covered up the proof of Space Dracula, we haven't trusted a thing they say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">01-04-03, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't consider mayong evil.  Basically, he believes that the god's are only in charge because the people let them be.  He wants to open the mind's of norrath by becoming a god himself to prove the gods are really no more powerful then joe public.  That's what I've half picked-up for 3 years of EQ anyway.</div></div><hr />

Without evil there could be no good, so it must to be good to be evil sometimes.</div></div><hr />

But I bought this book anyway.  It kicks mega-ass.  The pictures are great and I love the descriptions.  Also I have to say that the Cazic Thule Character sheet is the most wrongest thing Ive ever seen for any gaming system. <br />
