I'd like to do something like split character sheets, one for the real world, and one for the matrix. I'd like to make your abilities/stats in the Matrix reflect your mental capacity and understanding of the matrix. I think I might dip into the Cyber Punk and Shadow Run rules sets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternity.<br />
<br />
Specifically, Alternity and the Dataware supplement. The two give you relatively in-depth rules for combat and roleplay elements for both the real world AND the digital world.<br />
<br />
Dataware even goes so far as to expand on the vital stats of AIs and other various programs. As well as a template for the character's digital &quot;Shadow.&quot;<br />
<br />
It doesn't provide specific rules for the matrix, but I'm certain a person with your focus on the more difficult aspects of roleplay would find it easy to modify some rules. And better yet, you could say its halfway between 2nd Edition and 3E dungeons and dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Alternity is a stand alone system? I'd have to read through it to see if it jives with my personal visualization of the system(which is pretty nebulous). What I AM having a hard time figuring out is, who do you justify one character's ability to say, jump across a 75 foot gap, from another's ability. And how to do justify, thinking in terms of the matrix, @#%$ that up? Things always go as planned for people in the Matrix, because they believe they can do. So do I give players stats that allow them to knock holes in brick walls and do triple backflips across the board, and just make my NPC reactions extreme in response?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternity is a stand-alone system. WOTC shut it down in order to make room for 3E though, which saddened me to no end. (Another reason for you to hate 3E, how about that).<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain one small thing regarding strength and such for a Digital Shadow in Alternity: they have a &quot;Computer Science- Hacking&quot; skill. The more ranks you purchase in that skill (to a max of 12) gives you a bonus to your shadow's abilities. I believe it is around +1 to str/dex/con for every 3 ranks. Hacking is also an intelligence based skill, so it meshes quite well with your idea that mental capacity should affect how strong you are in the matrix.<br />
<br />
(Post Split, modem prob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(post split here)<br />
<br />
As for how to jump tall buildings in a single bound and flight and other forms of super-heroish stuff that neo can pull of in the matrix. There's another supplement that details THAT.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beyond Science: A guide to FX&quot; gives in-depth rules for creating your own superheroes in the alternity system. It gives you such abilities as Super Speed, Super Strength, Flight, Super Jumping (Jump the grand canyon? BOING!), Fusillade (attack more times per round). Once again, it would be easy for you to modify these rules so that they only apply within the Matrix. And it also requires skill points to master these superpowers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmm, thing is, I want the Digital World and the Real World rules to operate the same, but the digital world can take stats and actions far and beyond the Real world. Difference is, physical stats in the Digital world will be derived from mental stats and the &quot;nebulous stat of Matrix ass kicking&quot;. So like, if you have say a strength of 3, and a &quot;mind&quot; of 3 in the real world, you could have a mind of 3 in the Matrix, and a physical of say, 6. Haven't decided how I want to derive that, either as a stand alone stat or a compelation of Mental stats and overall experience. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I really need to read the rules for Alternity to see if they will work for me, but I want to define Programs in the digital world in the same terms as regular people, so I can quantify how much more ass they can kick than your average joe_001_got my brain hooked into the matrix. I think programs should be designed from the ground up along the same lines as a PC. Having their stats derived from a single skill seems too one dimensional for me, but then again, I imagine Alternity was built along different lines of action and behavior than the Matrix movie.<br />
<br />
edit And see, about the Super powers, I was thinking this. Your stats define the upper limit of your abilities such that you don't have to test for them. If you want to go above and beyond, say you could jump 30 feet horizontally normally within the Matrix, and you want to jump 60 instead, you test against some number based on your experience level, i.e. familiarity with the rules of the matrix, to see if you succeed. Someone like Neo when he first enters the matrix has an abysmal chance of convincing himself it is possible. Neo from Reloaded understands the rules very well, and has an almost certain chance of suceeding.  Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 5/19/03 8:51:31 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternity was skill-based. You abilities determined not what your armor class is or how much damage you deal, but how easily and what magnitude the success of a &quot;Unarmed Combat - Power Martial Arts&quot; or &quot;Acrobatics - Dodge&quot; skill check would be.<br />
<br />
Hacking only determines the bonus to physical stats, you still have to use the mental skills that are related to your other mental skills while in the Matrix. But hacking does determine the skill check for your digital attacks and other hooked-in physical aspects of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And also, Alternity treats superpowers as it would any other skill. It still takes a skill check to jump that colossal expanse, just like it would take a skill check (or in some cases, multiple skill checks) to roll around and fire several shots at the agent that's following you and actually HIT him.<br />
<br />
Of course, he has to know he HAS the skill before he can use it, now doesn't he?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reason I don't want to seperate jumping, climbing, lifting ect... into skills is...when you think about the Matrix, your level of preformace(phyiscal) is determined by your belief (or disbelief) of the Matrix. In terms of the movie, the only thing I've ever seen anyone &quot;fail&quot; is in throwing punches. Granted, it's a movie, and @#%$ up isn't good for an action movie, but still. When people jump across buildings, it's not because they &quot;think they can make it&quot;, they know it, or even better, failure isn't part of the equation. I want direct confrontation, opposed rolls, to be the only real dicey thing. Actions like jumping, smashing down walls, ect... I'd like to be defined by your &quot;Matrix Level&quot;. The longer you manage to run missions and survive, the more potent you become within the Matrix, in terms of your ability to manipulate it. <br />
<br />
Shooting guns, ect... I haven't figured out yet either. I guess I could do rolls to hit, and allow for dodging, and that would be a skill that you would need to dump points into to get better. Things like skill checks while driving a car, recorrecting if someone broad sides you or whatever, would still require a skill check of sorts. <br />
<br />
But then again, when you really really get into the mindset of the Matrix, could you not also &quot;make&quot; your bullets hit, or &quot;right your own car after it's hit&quot;? I dunno. This is kind of icky ground to be conceptualizing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordOfChains</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you when you say its too complex to detail here, and that you would have to read the rules themselves. I do believe a good portion of your concerns are detailed within.<br />
<br />
Also note that you can change various aspects of the game to suit your style.<br />
<br />
As one particular point: In Alternity, your digital shadow can fly throughout the cyberscape. But that would be too easy for people in the matrix, wouldn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I would say so. Although, seeing how Reloaded has dealed with Neo's super powers, I don't think it would be out of line to have high powered characters flying. But for your average Runner, I would say yes. Flying entails complete control and belief in the process. I.e. you almost have to believe that you aren't human, because humans can't fly the speed of sound unprotected without dying from either exposure or G's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple other things I just thought of.<br />
<br />
Skills can be uploaded once you are inside the Matrix. So if you know how to fire an M16 like a pro inside the matrix, would you retain that skill once you left? Additionally, thinking about physical traits and survivability, should a guy who is heavier, physically tougher be able to sustain more damage inside the Matrix than a smaller, weaker person? A bullet to the head kills everyone, but if you were getting the crap beat out of you, should your actual physical constitution play into that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nenjin, why don't you just tie matrix physical prowes to character level?<br />
<br />
You can jump levelX10 feet without fail at will.<br />
<br />
You can punch through levelX2Xinches of concrete at will.<br />
<br />
You can hold your breath for levelX2Xminutes underwater before losing conciousness and drowning.<br />
<br />
These happen without fail, no check rolls.  As someone gains levels, they obviously gain inner belief in their abilities, letting them do more.  Until they get to level two, they *know* that they can't jump that 15 foot space.  If they try, they go splat, no die roll.  Stupidity leads to character creation.<br />
<br />
Anything you don't want left to chance, tie directly to character level in some aritmetic (or non-arithmetic) progression, and make it every clear to your players that the limits on those abilities are not up for negotiation.  <br />
<br />
As characters level, you can even give them new abilities.  Starting at level 4, you can fly for level^(1/2) (square root level)X10 minutes.  Or (level-3)X10 minues.  <br />
<br />
Think about what types of physical abilities you want your characters to have, define them, and then make them happen without fail, with strength/intensity/duration tied directly to level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Llabak, that is what I've been talking about doing this whole time.    I've been at work the whole time though so I haven't gotten around to hashing out acceptable numbers. But yes, I think prowess ect... will all be tied to level. I need my gaming group though to bounce these ideas off them.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
But now I need to really know, based on how you've seen the movies and understood the process, should a larger, more physically fit man be able to sustain more physical damage than a smaller person, i.e. should someone with a real world &quot;body&quot; of 6 be able to sustain more non-fatal damage than someone with a real world &quot;body&quot; of 4?

<br />
You're mental abilities determine your agility, speed, and dexerity.<br />
<br />
an acrobat in the real world with a mind of 6 is going to be able (sooner or later) to run up a wall and over agenst while hitting them all with a 9mm.<br />
<br />
while that guy with a body of 6 and agil of 2 and a mind of 3 might be body 6 agil of 4. this way, he may be tank in the real world and be rather clumsy, in the matrix he is still a tank, just has an average agility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
while that is true, if the system is based on what you believe/know you can do, then if you know you are stronger then most men, and can take more punishment, then that would translate over to the matrix.<br />
<br />
You may get hit more then say some one with a high agil score(while in the matrix), but you can take the hits and keep fighting.</div></div><hr />

So you might be limited in the scope of what you can attempt, if you are roleplaying your character adequately. Describing mechanics to make that possible is a little harder.</div></div><hr />

Everyone other than Neo can see what he can do, but can they do it? They know that they could do it, but they can't. I would use (well, steal) the focus system from the games, you concentrate so much, but then get mentally tired, and mix that with the level system, with level's being how &quot;on terms&quot; you are with the matrix. That would allow for people to be natural's (a la Neo) who go from lvl 1 to lvl 20 in a snap, and for people to spend alot of time in the Matrix and gradually get better (Morpheus).<br />
<br />
And with that, better you than me Nenjin.</div></div><hr />
