Does it just increase your regen or does it give you a set amount of HP?  Can you become full if you eat/drink too much?<br />
<br />
Just a few questions i had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each food/drink has a maximum amount of health or mana it will regen for you.<br />
<br />
This is then put on a timer -- (forgive me I dont' have exact numbers for this) 98 hps in 20 seconds for example. If you remain seated while eating you will get the hps over the course of the 20 seconds (it is evenly spaced). However, you can stand up before the time period is over and only get a partial amount of the full health. Or, if you didn't need all 98 hps and you're back to top health again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengel Tyger</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.  So does food/drink not stack with itself?  I mean, can i eat all my pies and drink all my teas and have regen like a mofo!?<br />
<br />
Do you eat food like in EQ, where you will eat the food if even if you don't click on it?  but you can still click it to eat it.<br />
<br />
What about being full?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Food doesn't work the way you're thinking of.  When you consume a piece of food or drink, you sit down and you get a buff.  The buff is &quot;Eating&quot;, and the effect is &quot;Restores X [HP/Mana] per second&quot;, and it will generally last for about 20-30 seconds; the lowest-level foods that you start with are 98HP over 21 seconds, and some of the slightly-higher ones I've seen are something like 560HP over 35 seconds.<br />
<br />
Standing or taking any other action will remove the &quot;buff&quot;; likewise, as it is a buff, I don't *think* that multiple foods would stack, as the second one would just overwrite the buff you have currently - but I've not tried it to check.<br />
<br />
Likewise, there is no such thing as &quot;full&quot;.</div></div><hr />
