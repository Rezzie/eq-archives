<br />
This evening we put in another patch to correct some issues that arose with the patch yesterday.  The changes implemented include some that weren't announced previously:<br />
<br />
- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP encounters.  In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now.  PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.<br />
- Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the person killed.  In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.<br />
- Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.<br />
- On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights.  We would prefer to implement some sort of &quot;majority damage&quot; logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players &quot;ninja-looting&quot; the loser in PvP encounters.<br />
<br />

Stupid patch.<br />
<br />
And they did not fix my video problems so it really doesn't matter though.<br />

on the new PvP Server eh? Then enlist in the Screams</div></div><hr />

When grouped if someone gets pked... usually you try to loot ASAP so the pker doesn't get a chance (on Rallos anyway).  That way, no real loss as long as you trust your groupmates.  Now, you are SOL.  One more reason why I don't play PvP any more.</div></div><hr />

If someone you are grouped with is always going to ploot you before your corpse hits the ground, what's the point of being able to loot in PVP at all? - Nymm<br />

As a PVPer this is a great patch.  Its annoying as hell to kill someone to try to claim your reward for a well fought battle, and have some gimp grab what should have been rightfully yours.  <br />
<br />
As for debuff's...ack now I might have to fear enchanters in pvp some, so good for them.  <br />
<br />
Great patch and its about time Verant did something to help PVP.<br />

<br />
One of the problems before was that on the team servers someone from your same team could loot their &quot;friend&quot; on the opposing team when you got the killing blow and ye had no recourse against them.<br />
<br />
This way the &quot;ninja looters&quot; Karne mentioned will be thwarted (Hi Karne!).               Fricka       of the Vallon Zek Shanks<br />

<br />
Well, enchanter is lookin' good for the new server now ;p I think the level 4 Tash is -16 MR, times 1.5 = 24... That ought to lower most people MR to, oh, about 0 considering there is no MR gear, unless I make it bwuahahaha ;p<br />
