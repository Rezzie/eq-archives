It isn't, or at least it doesn't seem, like it is a short term benefit. From what I have read and understand, diplomacy is a long term thing that will come in handy LATER on.</div></div><hr />

/em ears perk up<br />

Did you just say racial illusion masks?  Like the Guise of the Deceiver type masks?  Do tell, how does one acquire these masks exactly and what races have been found thusfar?</div></div><hr />

Hands up those who had every possible illusion mask in EQ :nerd</div></div><hr />

I spent god knows how many months in SSRA Temple for that and all the other crap in there.  I still remember that bugged grunt they made, it got so irritating.  :wtf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LuxAeterna</div><div class="date">03-25-07, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well diplomacy has its benefits! although i do not agree with the 5s part! If you are doing quests that are part of a story and not just civic diplo then you get hold of various good items that you can sell at a merchant! Also we have the benefit of a free horse, saddlebag etc etc! Finally it is the only mean of acquiring the trust of stupid villagers :pulid making them build your Guild Village (although this feature has yet to be implemented). So my answer is No! diplomacy is a fun relaxing and more RP type of gaming inside VG...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suldaien</div><div class="date">05-17-08, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about the diplomacy buffs? I seem to remember some kind of disparaging comments made by Pain about another guild that needed to use diplo buffs to beat mobs in APW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swag</div><div class="date">05-17-08, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need diplo buffs to kill anything, but they sure do help. Stuff like +25% hps, +12% damage, +12% crit, etc. goes a long way in APW, as devs seem like like DPS-check fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suldaien</div><div class="date">05-19-08, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And diplo buffs have a 3 hour duration?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swag</div><div class="date">05-19-08, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">City buffs are 1 hour, outpost buffs are 3 hours.</div></div><hr />
