<br />
Dawning Nemesis (DN) has opened its applications for Vanguard on Xeth server.  We are looking for players 20th level or higher but are always looking for any outstanding individuals of any level.<br />
<br />
Dawning Nemesis strives to create a &quot;Drama Free&quot; environment for your gaming lifestyle. It is our goal to be one of the leaders in Vanguard at both content conquered and playing satisfaction.  We will map the unexplored worlds and write the strats, not follow them. <br />
<br />
Dawning Nemesis brings a tradition of successful guilds in both EQ and WoW. We have a great core of members that met in EQ and WoW and have moved on to Vanguard. It has always been our intention to make our home in Vanguard.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, please feel free to send a private message to any of the officers listed on our site through our forums messaging system, in game, or by simply asking a question on our boards.<br />
<br />
We hope you find the home your looking for in DN.<br />
