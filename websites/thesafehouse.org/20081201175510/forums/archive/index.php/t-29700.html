<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wcnesmith</div><div class="date">04-27-07, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I have been reading alot about the vampire quest in Hilsbury Manor and would like some more information.<br />
<br />
I have read that it is all really broken at the moment, but rewards are supposed to be as follows:<br />
<br />
Embrace Vampirism: Be a bat for 5 minutes at night (Lev) 15 minute cooldown, faster runspeed at night<br />
<br />
Cure for Vampirism: Get a Pet, used to attack but does not anymore apparently (nerfed) (15 minute cooldown)<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me updates on this??  I don't want to do this quest yet because I don't want to make the wrong decision.<br />
<br />
Personally I think having a pet would rock for a rogue, cuz the pet could get aggro, allowing the rogue to ravage, backstab and then rape all in stealth form.  Personally it doesn't matter to me what the level of the pet is, as long as it doesn't die in 1 hit, any more time that I can use to get crits why I do my thing would be very valuable.  It would help us rogues solo.<br />
<br />
Is there any more information on this?  I really want to get the pet in hopes that they fix him later to at least get aggro.<br />
<br />
Thanks Guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowspawn</div><div class="date">04-27-07, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several broken aspects to these quest lines, though in most cases it benifets the player.<br />
<br />
Curse of Vampire: acquired by fighting undead in manor.<br />
<br />
Curse currently only activates if you die or log in game at night.  It gives you a 10% runspeed buff that stacks with just about all movement effects, including mount and stealth.  There is a duration timer of 5mins but when it hits 1s it remains and does not go away.  Well eventually it goes away I have had it last over an hour. &quot;Theory it seems to go away when the next game night cycles, so I just camp out and back in and i have it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is also supposed to go away when you complete either Keeping the Curse or Curing the Curse quest, which it does not.  Now this is not what the curse is supposed to do but this is what it does.<br />
<br />
If you do Keeping the Curse quest you obtain Form of the Vampire, which currently lets you turn into a batform with levitate.  Power is only activatable during the night game time, last 5 mins 15 min refresh(as long as its still night).<br />
<br />
If you do Curing the Curse you get a fairy pet, only castable during the day 5 min duration 15 min refresh(as long as its daytime).  Currently does nothing, it used to fight but was way overpowered, so they just basically shut him down.<br />
<br />
Its worth gettting the curse of the vampire now even if you haven't decided which way to go, just for the runspeed buff.<br />
<br />
I personally went with the Form of the Vampire, I don't ever see them allowing the pet to tank much at all, and even if it did its for only 5 mins every 15mins during daylight.  I much prefer being able to levitate, which has come in handy quite a few times.<br />

<br />
Also saw something weird before with this fairy pet.<br />
Guy who own it was pulling mob and other mobs (right close this one what he was pulling) not join fight so maybe can be usefull sometimes.<br />
Personaly I chose keeping the curse so cant test this for 100% confirm.</div></div><hr />

Seems it always fails people when they post on the boards, then I read this comment.Also saw something weird before with this fairy pet.<br />

   YES, it is pet pulling. And seems to work even better than it did in EQ, from which you did by using a FD class, or a class that could CoH the pet. There was a whole lot more into it , but seems a LOT easier to do in VG than it was in EQ. Don't plan on this being in the game plan forever though, I am sure it wasn't intended just as pet pulling in EQ wasn't,( although it took them 7 years to fix that coding:smoke )<br />
   <br />
    Since I did a lot of this with my SK when I played EQ, I thought I would give it a shot witht he shaman pet. And like Karol said, no aggro on tight pulls. Single mob aggro only.Great for groups when no CC is available other than the rogue. Just show them how to single pull instead of having to stay out of combat to CC :thumb</div></div><hr />
