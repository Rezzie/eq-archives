Specifically, the Mars Lander from 6 years ago.  I went to NASA's site in hoping they have an online store, but alas they don't.  I'm hoping for something authentic rather than some cheap knock off from the back of some guy's truck.</div></div><hr />

I'm searching some old trade-list emails at the moment to find some stuff (Bunch of planentarian geeks were talking about this in the last few months).<br />
<br />
You might want to give the Fiske planetarium (Univ of Boulder)a call to check out their gift shop. Their website only lists typical astronomy touristy crap but most planetarium gift shops are pretty extensive. I know the Fiske is a pretty nice place too. My company hired thier old production guy.<br />
<br />
Fiske Planetarium<br />
Campus Box 408<br />
University of Colorado<br />
Boulder, Colorado 80309<br />

<br />
Edit: And I know Lego has a limited editon series out on the rovers right now. Ah here it is. Edited by: Nocte at: 3/5/04 8:19 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boulder eh?  Hmm, I could do that.  Heck, I might just take a tour of that place if visitors are allowed, which it sounds like they are.<br />
<br />
If you have any further info would you please toss 'em my way?    Thanks, Nocte!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The planetarians are going gaga over this one.<br />
<br />
I was also tipped off to ebay listings by another colleague. <br />
<br />
From what I gather, NASA stuff is very collectable as it goes out of production fast. I hear the Hot Wheels die cast replicas are very cool, and the Lego sets are NOT kid sets, they tend to be pretty intricate models.<br />
<br />
Another note, NASA sells it's logo pretty regularly for cash. Just becuse it says NASA, it isn't always high quality stuff. So keep that in mind when you stumble on stuff. A brand name with a NASA endorsement is usually pretty safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah, called Fiske, and all they have are Mars stickers, and posters.  No figures or toys or anything like that.  <br />
<br />
Even ebay's turned up dry for Mars Lander stuff.  I'm mainly trying to find some sort of replica of the 1999 Mars Lander and I'm just not having any luck anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, that's right. You wanted the Pathfinder mission.<br />
<br />
There was one Hot Wheels pack listed on Ebay for not too much cash.<br />

It's mostly a place for scientific lectures and laser light shows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to go visit our latest theater install... the Queen Mary 2. The lucky bastards who installed it got to go on the maiden voyage. <br />
<br />
Never been to the Fiske, only heard about it. We're revamping the classic Griffith soon. I want to visit that one to, just so I can sit in a seat and Moooo and hope a switchblade fight didn't break out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nyssa Rainwhisper</div><div class="date">03-05-04, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't seem like have anything other than posters and stuff for sale.  I guess that's what you get from a university though.  It's more for educational purposes than retail.</div></div><hr />
