<br />
I am partial to both Gatecrasher and Planar Champion from the Manual of the Planes. My character will be trying for Planar Champion eventually.<br />
<br />
Have you guys thought of any cool new classes or seen any that you like?</div></div><hr />

One version was very close to the Animal Lord Pclass, and the other very close to the Shifter (I think that's the right name).<br />
<br />
Anyway... my goal is to make my greataxe wielding dwarf fighter a weapon master someday.<br />

Ninja has so many cool and useful abilities, whereas the Knifefighters are tough and have a lot of flavour.</div></div><hr />

Duelist is interesting as well - but, unfortunately, both classes lack versatility.  They tend to thrive in one type of environment and be utterly useless in most others - which seems to be a disturbing trend in most D&amp;amp;D settings.  <br />
<br />
Quite a lot of the higher-level creatures are immune to sneak attacks, which puts rogues very low on the totem pole in terms of effectiveness - like they didn't already have enough handicaps.  -- Veteran Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br />
 -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic<br />
 -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend<br />
 --  Formerly of Requiem of Souls, now of Crusaders of Plilo<br />
 -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br />
&quot;Once, in the old west, a gentleman shot a professional gunfighter in the back. When asked why he didn't give the other chap a chance to draw, he replied, 'Well, he's dead and I'm alive and that's how I wanted it to be.&quot; -- from &lt;u&gt;Red Planet&lt;/u&gt;, Robert A.

<br />
My girlfriend is running an elven fighter who became a deepwood sniper (frmo the masters of the wild book) and now that her levels are getting higher she's godlike from a distance. she shoots like 4 or 5 times a round, crits on a 18-20 or something and her crits do quadruple damage. this of course added to the fact that she's a damned good shot.<br />
<br />
If you like artillery support look into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_WarrantofRv</div><div class="date">07-22-02, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always been a big fan of elves in D&amp;amp;D.<br />
<br />
The Bladesinger was always a fun kit in 2nd ed. and I've been wanting to play the 3rd ed. prestige class.  With feats and the new skills (Concentration especially- old rules any dmg interrupted casting if I recall correctly; though elves aren't known for high Con scores), they would probably be lots of fun.<br />
<br />
Another from the 2nd ed.  Complete Book of Elves that I'd like to see made into a presitige class is the Spellfilcher, an extremely fun roguely class.</div></div><hr />
