 Welcome my fellow rogues to the pit.  Welcome to the canine jungle.  Welcome to the happy home of the Sabretooth clan, a blended fury of blood, fur, and steel warmed over and ready for your consumption.  Whether coming from the deep chill of Everfrost or the temperate climates of Qeynos hills, the unwary should beware, keep a dagger handy and above all have the eyes in the back of your head secured on the nearest exit.... <br />
  <br />
 General Description 	 <br />
 Blackburrow is a low level dungeon that can safely be approached at about level six, and is conquered near completely by level seventeen or so.  Coming from Queynos, Blackburrow is located on the far east wall of the Queynos hills zone between the ruins and the guard tower. The safest route from Queynos involves heading  straight out down the road till you hit the first fork you see and make a right. Take that road to the guard tower and just before you enter the pass to the Karanas hang a left and hug the wall of the zone keeping the mountains close to your right.  At low levels be wary of the rabid bears, wolves and other nasties in this area...you may want to stay hidden for a large part of the journey until you are comfortable.  And DON'T attack animals of any kind (even rabid) when you see Cros Trewind or Holly Windstalker abouts....you will die quick. When you see a gray gnoll's head jutting out from the rock enticing you into it's maw...you have reached Blackburrow.  <br />
  	 <br />
 Coming from the everfrost side is a bit harder to describe, as it involves about six or seven forks.  If you are a newbie Barbarian who just reached fifth or sixth and are ready to start Blackburrow, a guide might be the wisest course of action.  My best advice for the low levels headed to Blackburrow are to stop and /con ANY skeletons you see. If you see anything with the words VENGEFUL in them move out of it's way..and activate your hide skill.  If you ever leave the peaks and see wide open space this is bad you shouldn't be here. Turn around and ask directions. The entrance to Blackburrow from the everfrost side has a ramp similar to the one coming out of Halas and looks like it a bit but here...the guards just aren't as nice. <br />
  <br />
 Blackburrow is a perfect dungeon for a low level rogue to practice in.  You can go just about anywhere under the cover of hide/sneak and let your group buddies know what's up.  Just don't get too balsy at low levels and you'll be fine. There is ok money to be had if you know where to look.  You won't get rich here alone, but you will be well on your way by the time you leave.   <br />
  <br />
 The biggest disadvantages mostly are due to location.  Other than half-elves and Barbarians no roguish race starts anywhere near here.  Most of the teleports I have seen involve N. Karana making the trek a long one, necessitating the long navigation of W. Karana, a zone as a low level that you only want to go through either in stealth or with a good escort.  The other bad part of the Blackburrow area is that it is tough to transact or to do business here unless you are dealing in Blackburrow merchandise.  Want a Dragoon Dirk or Tentacle whip? Don't come here looking for it.  <br />
  <br />
 Treasure <br />
  <br />
 There is a lot to be obtained here if you want to look for it, and have a good system.  At first most of the drops consist of cloth articles and such.  Cracked staves go for nearly a plat each to vendors, so look for gnolls that carry big sticks.  Other than that, provided below is a list of whats available, what it does, etc. <br />
  <br />
 Ruined Gnoll Pelt- Many gnolls...pretty much useless...destroy them unless you want to have PP fun. <br />
 Gnoll Pelt- Found on Elites, Shamans, Commanders, Brewers and (rarely) Guardsmen. -used for at least one quest, the monk headband...you usually can get 2pp each for these on the open market, less from vendors. Also usable for poison vials <br />
 Gnoll Skin- A rare drop overall, can be found on Shamans, High Shamans, Commanders and sometimes elites, used for the same quest as above plus the rogue Burning Rapier quest.  These usually go for 4pp-5pp on the open market. <br />
 Patch of Gnoll Fur- see Ruined Gnoll pelt <br />
  <br />
 Gnoll Fangs- these are no drop items that make Blackburrow a hidden gem.  These can be cashed in to Captain Tillian in the arena in Queynos, for eps and moonstones, which in turn can be given to Mcneal Jacob at the Fish's ale pub for BB stout and MORE xps.  I still get xps for these fangs even at 20th, though of course not as much.  I would recommend this route instead of giving them to the warrior guild in Halas because there are no hits with the rogues guild in Queynos when u turn these in.  In Halas you WILL take a guild hit. <br />
  <br />
 Spiked Collar +3str/3ac- Found on Elites and Commanders, often difficult to sell, but when they do usually go for around 2pp,  vendors will give you close to one for em' for I usually just do that. <br />
  <br />
 Studded Collar- +1Str/+1Sta/3ac-other than the differences in stats, this basically is the same as the item above <br />
  <br />
 Silver Ring- Found in the base of the central pond, used in the paw of Oppola quest.  Easy to get so it won't usually fetch much on the open market, but hey you can sell it to vendors for a few gold.  Oh and if you aren't good at swimming don't go fetching it till your at least tenth.  Razorgill will eat ya alive. <br />
  <br />
 Onyx Earrings +2 Agi. Found on Elites(rare) and often found on commies and high shamans, usually go for 1pp on the market if that, far less from a vendor.  I liked to give these away to newbies around Queynos.  Can't have too many friends...never know if they'll be a twinked, powerlevelled caster that'll invite you into a group some day.(hehe) <br />
  <br />
 Wooden Idol +10 mana wahoo!- Found on shamans and high shamans these usually go for 2-3pp at most on the market.  Again I'd rather give em away to a newbie. <br />
  <br />
 Blackburrow Cask-  Found on brewers (rarely) or Master Brewers.  A very rare drop that is essential in completing the Jaggedpine Cloak quest (where three are needed) or as a mixing vessel for the burning rapier quest. This is a VERY rare drop and people come into BB all the time shouting &quot;looking to buy casks&quot; The spot where the most common brewer spawning ground if often camped by some high level character trying in frustration to get one. You can sell one for 20pp easy, and often more if the buyer is bored out of his wits.  Good item to camp if you like that kind of thing. <br />
  <br />
 Giant Snake Fangs- 5 dam/ 27 delay. Found on giant snakes. A very common newbie rogue item.  Usually sell for about 6gp maximum.  Often they are given away, so if your new here and want one, just ask and you'll often get one. <br />
  <br />
 Giant Snake Rattles- Found on Giant snakes- Usuable for a monk headband quest, otherwise not too useful I've heard of them being sold for about 1pp, but it usually takes too much time to find a buyer.  <br />
  <br />
 Snake Poison Sacs- Found on Giant Snakes- Blackburrow is a great hunting ground for these. There are giant snakes in abundance and they usually have a decent drop rate of these sacs.  The only problem with the snakes is that they are fast, so a root spell from a friend would help. I never tried to sell mine, as I liked to bank them for future use myself, but they usually fetch 1pp per sac. <br />
  <br />
 Giant Snake Poison Eggs- These are only good to add to your food supply. <br />
  <br />
 Rusty Spiked Shoulderpads +5str -10 MR, VERY rare drop found on gnoll commanders sell for usually 5pp each useful low level item....if you don't attack spellcasters. <br />
  <br />
 Elven Charm??? I read on allakhazam's site that this can be found in BB, but I have never seen this, nor heard of it...it is supposed to be +3 cha <br />
  <br />
 Other drops- Bronze weapons and sometimes rawhide is dropped by the elites, commanders and shamans. <br />
  <br />
 Small gemstones are dropped by the gnolls on up.  Plus other random drops involving alcohol, pouches, clothing and of course rusty weapons. <br />
  <br />
 Hunting Grounds <br />
  <br />
 The &quot;Big&quot; Elite room- Located just up the dirt ramp and to the left from the snake pit , this is the exclusive spot for the High Shaman to spawn.  This room also contains elites, commanders and regular shamans.  This is the toughest room in the dungeon and of course the best loot.  Skins seem to drop with more frequency here, but can be acquired from other places.  Try not to let the mobs or elites escape from this room when holding it, they will go to the small elite room and bring in more fun than can often safely be handled.  This room full contains 2 &quot;specials&quot; and four elites, with 2 guardsmen closely outside.   A party of at least four thirteenth level characters are needed to hold this room effectively.   <br />
  <br />
 The &quot;small&quot; Elite room-  This is located past the Big elite room in the warren.  Commanders and elites spawn here mainly.  This is the next high level spot that's camped if the &quot;big&quot; elite room is camped. It is tougher to catch escapees here, they often make it to the door and aggro the guards outside. <br />
  <br />
 The elite ledge-  This is the spot for those who are just starting to take on the big boys.  To get to it go to the safe area in the basement take the long bridge to the island, and then take the bridge up to the ledge. <br />
 Two elites typically spawn here along with an occasional gnoll/ patrolling mixed in.  Kill the little ones quick they will be a headache when the elites come.  This can be effectively camped by at least 2 14th level characters. <br />
  <br />
 The commander room-  Under the elite ledge lies a small room guarded on the outside by a Burly gnoll and 2 regular gnolls.  Watch out for the burlies they can be a bit of a surprise for the lower levels.  Upon entering the room, there are 3 regular gnolls and a spawn point for one &quot;special&quot; that rotates between a commander, an elite and a shaman.  The spawn time for the special isnt that fast, so rogues often have a chance to heal. However make sure you kill the gnolls if they run they will fetch the burly or a guardsman. <br />
 In a pinch they can be death for ya. <br />
  <br />
 The snake pit-  This is an area this is popular for the lower levels in the dungeon as giant snakes have no poison and are relatively harmless.  IMO however this area is too dangerous.  Close by is the elite room and many of the trains that come out of there come through here sometimes carrying between 10-20 happy gnolls in tow.  There are also a lot of guards around, so be sure you activate your hide before you go in and out of here.  The last obstacle to using this place is it's cryptic location.  If you don't know BB too well it is easy to get lost.  But if you are high level, know BB and know your way round this is the place to go. <br />

 Grizzly Bear- Don't ask me why a grizzly bear appears here but it occasionally does, and always on the upper level. It drops the usual items (Grizzly Pelt, meat, etc.)    Nothing special about it at the moment...but that may change. Lvls roughly 12-15. <br />
  <br />
 Giant Plague Rat- This nasty hits pretty hard for a rat.  Leaves nothing special either, but the popular consensus believes that Tranix spawns just after whacking it. It too spawns at the top and will only attack if attacked, like most rats. Lvl 16-19 <br />
  <br />
 Razorgill- These little buggers swim around the central pond in Blackburrow.  They will not leave unless provoked,  but if you fall in the pond by accident expect to hear lots of little chomping sounds as your health quickly falls.  Get out quick. <br />
  <br />
 Giant Snakes- These drop a number of useful items including poison sacs, rattles for monk quests and fangs whih can be sold for a few gold each.  The are not poisonous, so in many ways they are an excellent kill.  They drop sacs like CANDY compared to other places,  so come and get em while they are hot. <br />
  <br />
 Tips and Tricks <br />
  <br />
 1. Bridges - Down below you will see all kinds of bridges crisscrossing here and there.  These are a danger and often a pain.  Do NOT think you will escape a mob by jumping off them...all you will do is flee slower and get hit more often as they pummel you from above without you being able to counter.  Not to mention the pain of corpse retreival...make sure you stay on them. <br />
  <br />
 2.Central Pond - DO NOT jump in the central pond unless you know what you are doing!!! Razorgill are nasty buggers at low levels and getting your body from this deep pit requires some help. <br />
  <br />
 3. Get a Guide - Unless you know what ur doing get a guide if you have to go somewhere, don't go wandering here you will get lost quick. And if you insist go all the way in stealth mode.  Don't take any chances. <br />
  <br />
 4. TRAINS -  Hehe one of the more infamous features of BB.  When you hear this phrase if possible hide immediately and evaluate the train.  They are good backstab practice, but only if you can handle the monster being targeted.  Often these get routed to the safe area by the main bridge down below.   Also get a feel for who is making these trains...if they do it often they are usually doing it on purpose.  My take on this is let them die, they will kill plenty more in their wake.  Help only those in genuine need. <br />
  <br />
 5. Razorgill -  The fish in the central pond can be pulled easy and often one at a time!  Near brewers rock there is a small river which is overflow from the central pond..if u dive a little and face the central pond area you will often see the razorgill sitting there stagnant.  Without going in to the central pond pull out your trusty bow and skewer one...they will come outside the central pond and you can get easy kills this way excellent for chars in low teens. <br />
  <br />
 6.Giant snakes - These are all over the place and are often good safe hunting.  I would not recommend going to the snake pit to do it though.  There are plenty of spawn points for these, and they don't have to be right next door to the toughest room in the dungeon.  A snare/ root helps A LOT in hunting these..they skitter FAST in this dungeon and I have trouble killing them with a SOW at higher levels.  Best tactic is to try and sit down hopefully they'll come back. <br />
  <br />
 7.Safefall - Lots of good places to practice this here.  The main bridge down below is great. You can do quick loops here forever and its one of the safest areas in the dungeon. Damage is at max 4 hps. <br />
  <br />
 8.Safe area - The safe area down below actually isnt all that safe. Mobs can still hit ya even up cave wall....so if you hear TRAIN jump and get ready.  Otherwise this area is good eps. Hang around the bridge and group with pals to knock off gnolls and patrolling gnolls, till you get high enough to go deeper. <br />
  <br />
 9. Bows and arrows - As you head down from above you enter the safe area by the main wide bridge.  If you look at the other exit you will see a long spindly bridge that goes to an island and eventually goes to the elite ledge,  On this bridge and island there are often gnolls with bow and arrow.  You can get A LOT of arrows real quick here perfect for pulling. <br />
  <br />
 10. The Hollow Tree - Up above you will see a large tree, that is hollowed out to make a little mini alcove. It is always empty.  DO NOT GO IN unless you can rumble, you will go to the lowest level of the dungeon.  The floor is fake and drops you into a pool surrounded by three patrolling gnolls with heavier support close at hand.   <br />
  <br />
 11. Hide/Swim - You can hide and swim...you just cant START hiding or sneaking while in water.  If you start on land and sneak/hide into water you will swim in stealth mode.  You just will go slow as hell. <br />
  <br />
 12. The Elusive Brewer -  Just as you get below to the safe area you will see a large bridge.  If you step on that bridge and stop you will see a large rock to your right close to the water.  Right by that rock the Master Brewer Spawns, his place held by a guardsman or a regular brewer.  This is the kill that provides the elusive BB cask, an item used in a ranger quest, and of course the burning rapier quest.  SOMETHING spawns on the rock every 18 mins. Quite often it's a guardsman.  From all I've been able to determine its completely random what spawns.  I have found no pattern that can be verified.  <br />
  <br />
 13. Seeing in the dark - If you are a fledgling barbarian go head and get a quick beetle eye from Queynos hills.  It is a long dark tunnel coming in from the Everfrost side, so the first time you will need a guide, or a lantern. <br />
  <br />
 14 Trannix - If you want to hunt this bad boy, have no doubt he will make his presence known usually by shouting to the whole zone.  He usually spawns right after the giant plague rat is killed, and usually he spawns up top. <br />
