(ny current warforged is newt/newt)<br />
<br />
But I don't know of anyone who plays this server not on group nights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-04-06, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose I can roll up another character to help ya get to around our level if ya want to join us for group night. We could use a cleric, our swiss army bard has his hands full healing us. If ya wana join us you need to get to level 4.. cause our highest is 7 and you would get -50% exp otherwise. If I see ya on, I will invite ya to the guild... whats the name anyway? If you roll up a lawfull good character and t hasn't sold that mace yet... we may have a very very very nice mace for you.... anyhow, see ya ingame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im Sollonn Darkmoon (had to add an extra n =/). Im pretty much a pure healer/support type. If ya do roll up another char to help that would be cool hehe. Im still tryin to learn some stuff but that only comes with practice i guess :P.<br />
<br />
Have like 18 wis ( ya ya i know the arguments over the small amount of extra spell pts but every little bit helps :P). Devotion I, Divine Vitality I. Mental toughness and extended.<br />
<br />
Btw you have any other chars i should know about hehe? I know ya seem to have a lot more play time then others hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-05-06, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you'd be suprised, the only other character I have is a level 7 on Tharashk and well... we've stopped talking. My only actual character is motego, and I have a bit of work today but when I get done. I will get on to organize stuff and if you need any assistance I will be glad to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">06-05-06, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohhh...<br />
<br />
Fighter, bard, rogue, ranger, cleric.  Oh the things we could do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-05-06, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Sol can get to level 3 by tomarro night (four would be amazing if pulled off) then I can take a break or do my own thing if you guys want to spend a while on a very lucrative quest getting her to level 4. Once foured I can rejoin the group and noone would suffer a penalty. Damn my being seven now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">06-05-06, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just on and did 2 Gwylan's runs, no loot to speak of really but the exp was insane.  After that Sollon popped on so I switched to my new warforged and we did 3 quests together but I had to log.  lvl 1, rank 3 for my new warforged.  Sollon was still playing when I logged, I said to just put on LFG and a group for a cleric should be no problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and my Gwylan's group had a woman in it.  Honest to God, and she actually spoke on voice chat.  Appart from my old EQ guild that is the first without a doubt female I have played an online game with, and she was a rogue :love  hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-05-06, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard 2 women, so I got you beat there. Both we're very fun to play with and used voice quite a bit. This is the third time I have heard of it happening.. I suppose we can assume the old myth busted? :b</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<br />

So I assume to the best of my ability, and since your avatar is the only thing I can go off of because I didn't hear any voice chat last night.. well. I assume I'm playing with a crazy eyed catgirl that could attack me at any moment *shrug*. :b</div></div><hr />
