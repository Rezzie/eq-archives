Simply press the Update button on your Neverwinter Nights Launcher.<br />

<br />
- Creatures will now use their spell-like abilities again.<br />

- Fixed the 'Bad Strref' GameSpy connection message.<br />
- The game now sorts Community Names alphabetically in the chat portion of the Server Browser area.<br />
- Made Neverwinter Nights work with DirectX debug DLLs.<br />
- Added a Tech Support chat area in the Server Browser area.<br />
- Fixed an issue with save game characters and moving between single and multiplayer<br />
<br />

I noticed it wasnt just 1.0, thought I cannot remember what it was.  I have yet to patch at all, so I guess I will hold off.  I notice that the stupid bloated dire spider in ACT I did poision and knockdown a lot.<br />

After hours apon hours of creating a zone, testing over and over, pulling my hair out trying to figure out if I forgot to set something for the mobs special powers and as to why they were not using it was driving me nuts.<br />
<br />
Not kidding you when I say I tested one mob encounter for 6 hours last night. (i.e. No special powers).<br />
<br />
Oh well hope it's fixed soon, v1.18 is alittle to stable for me to go back to default version for mod building. I'll wait it out.<br />
