<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthien</div><div class="date">02-13-06, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, like the quest says: behind the Ravenhold manor.<br />
<br />
NB:Had you been a rogue, you would have had visited Ravenhold for that broken roguish quest before :pulid<br />
<br />
a) finding Ravenhold: ride from Hillsbrad-&gt;Arathi, on the pass entrance where 2 griffons court, follow the hill line rounding west-north toward river. If you keep close to mountains, there is a path begin behind (next to) a tree that leads up into mountain and Ravenhold (its first leg climbs IIRC direct north). It is easy to miss though but it is there - path ground is brownish and distinguishable from grass. <br />
<br />
b) To find apothecary you have to pass behind the main building and then practically drop down a bit behind the plateau to be able to climb left up to apothecary undead.<br />
<br />
HINT: not sure if it all is worth a violet suit or a dress for ya! :pulid</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i did find after i said hell with it and jumped from a hill , found a road and found him at the end of it<br />
<br />
and the prize may not be worth it , but its a fun quest anyway , i didn't expect to get a legendry item from it :P<br />
<br />
hell i killed Omen for a light source :P</div></div><hr />
