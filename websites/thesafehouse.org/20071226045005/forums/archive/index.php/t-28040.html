I like that the license is for programs &quot;targeted exclusively to adults over the age of 18&quot;.  I guess I'm finally going to have to get a digital cable box.</div></div><hr />

I would be careful what you wish for when you say &quot;Over the age of 18...&quot;</div></div><hr />

They might have something like Mezzo Forte late at night, but considering YTV has aired/is airing Ghost in the Shell:SAC, Bleach, Full Metal Alchemist, Witch Hunter Robin, Eureka 7, Naruto, One Piece, and InuYasha and has had enough success with the Friday night format that it's applying for its own channel, I think it'll be much of the same.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh. I guess thats just an oddly phrased wording. B/c Bleach and Naruto aren't exactly 18+ focused.<br />
<br />
Guess they just did it to save there buts for possible problems heh.</div></div><hr />

I'm enjoying Bleach (Naruto is growing on me, but I still don't see what's so special about it) and I'm well over 18. Sword fighting, demons, and blood (albeit black blood for soul reapers), what's not to like?  Before most of the anime YTV airs on Friday night they have a disclaimer that states &quot;This program is intended for an older youth audience.  Viewer discretion is advised&quot;, so I think those types of programs are what they want to peel off onto their own channel.</div></div><hr />

Well Naruto was good in its time. It kinda died off when it hit fillers. And by then a way better version of it came out....Bleach :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">01-31-07, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I think when Naruto is &quot;good&quot; it's still better than Bleach.  Cause when Naruto is good its awsome.  It just hasn't been good for almost 2 years now.<br />
<br />
Bleach is just constantly very good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soul Reaper blood is black btw?</div></div><hr />

YTV is currently at episode 65 where Souske fights Gaara in the tournament, so it's still in the first third of the series.  I'm guessing it's in the meat of the plot for the time period, so I guess I've passed the first fillers and not yet into the second fillers.<br />
<br />
As for Soul Reaper blood, I have a feeling it's to allow it to be shown on YTV (which is billed as a youth channel).  Below are a few screencaps from Ichigo's first fight with Renji.</div></div><hr />

We do have anime channels. But most of em are geared for just the company titles not a wide range of titles.</div></div><hr />

Hmm i still have my last elective course to take to get my paper slip... but since all of the schools in the county rejected me for my ill mannered behavior.. i guess ill go to either some learning of the Japanese my friend is learning over at his high school. and he is learning the advanced stuff.. =/ almost all his teachings are advanced.. Hmm maybe ill borrow a few of his books to learn the language and live the rest of my life as a hermit over on a small island in japan... okay Never mind my day dreaming got the best of me. but all i guess i can do is wait and see what the heck air's on the cable box and see if it is good for the time being</div></div><hr />

Aside from a couple episodes between one of the arcs, the fillers don't start till like episode 125ish, and they don't end till about 100 episodes later.</div></div><hr />
