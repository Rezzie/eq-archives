<br />
Can anyone give me a rundown on it?<br />
<br />
Thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farem</div><div class="date">08-22-06, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm playing right now, and I like it. I've been able to find groups whenever I need em, and I've been completing half the quests with just me and a friend of mine (i could even solo them if i wanted to). So it's pretty nice in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

If you like a game for the end game... there is none. Both epic encounters require you to exploit to beat them, the dragon has been changed a bit, but it's still pretty much exploit to win.</div></div><hr />

We found a way to pass through a permanently locked door, we found a way to finish the quest without completing it, we found a way to stay inside a dungeon after the timer ran out, we found a way to bug her out so she didn't attack us back... we were getting the loot, not completing the quest, and we didn't have to do the previous quest to get to her. It was about as broken as it could have gotten.</div></div><hr />

All the servers were hammered this last week due to 1yr anniversary.  So I don't think it's quite that dead yet.</div></div><hr />
