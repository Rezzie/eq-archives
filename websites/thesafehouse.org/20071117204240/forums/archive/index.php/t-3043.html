<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">04-10-03, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not at all rogue related. This is not even RPG related, well directly. We picked up a new game last night, Civilization the board game, oh man. VERY good game. I had my doubts (especially when we were seperating the 738 individual game pieces from their plastic thingys) but they somehow seemed to find the perfect balance of making a game more involving than Risk, more complicated, yet somehow simpler and much much more fun than Axis and Allies.<br />
<br />
The thread doesn't belong anywhere else either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">04-10-03, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) How many people did you have playing?<br />
<br />
2) What kind of learning curve is there (in time terms)<br />
<br />
3) Did you/other players have experience with Civ the computer game, and did it help or hurt?<br />
<br />
4) How long does a game run?<br />
<br />
I'm always on the lookout for a game I can play with my wife (so 2 person) because so far she hasn't expressed a ton of interest in computer games.  I've picked up a number of box games, like the original Civilaztion and Hannibal, neither of which really caught our interest, and we had quite a fun run of MTG and Illuminati but they became boring with just 2 people.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it is a great, great game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Swipey, there is the older &quot;classic&quot; civilization which IS a fine game (if a bit complicated sometimes), but there is also a new game that is based on Sid Meier's computer game Civilization.<br />
<br />
Confusing, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">04-11-03, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) How many people did you have playing?<br />
<br />
Well 3, but we would have liked more (6 is max)<br />
<br />
2) What kind of learning curve is there (in time terms)<br />
<br />
Actually not really that high. You can pretty much pick up the instructions and follow them as you go along.<br />
<br />
3) Did you/other players have experience with Civ the computer game, and did it help or hurt?<br />
<br />
Yes, and really doesn't matter much at all<br />
<br />
4) How long does a game run?<br />
<br />
Long time, we never got past the first technology age. My roommate took over the world. Again.<br />
<br />
This isn't a two person game, and you need a really big table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">04-12-03, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The made a board game based on a computer game?  Isnt that against the normal way of things?<br />
<br />
I am talking about the old Avalon Hill game myself.  I guess that is &quot;classic&quot; civ boardgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Civilization started as a board game way back in the day.  Sid created a computer game based on the board game.  Late last year, Eagle Games created a new board game based on the computer game.  Silly, no?  <br />
<br />
The new game is a blast to play and it's been our best seller since November.  I can barely keep any in the stores    I'm not much for strategy games (I always lose) but it's fun ... haven't finished a game myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. There may be a new rule next game though, that being all diplomatic talk must be conducted in the pantry since there is a lot of...<br />
&quot;But you and him are planning to ...&quot;<br />
&quot;You aren't supposed to know that!!&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm spying&quot;<br />
&quot;We just invented the wheel&quot;<br />
<br />
And then there's the ever popular...<br />
&quot;It would not displease my country to see an invasion by your country into this area.&quot;<br />
&quot;Quit plotting against me&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not plotting, I'm just saying that it would not displease me to see you invaded, and I traded him that oil city out of good will.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Teannin Bramblefeet</div><div class="date">05-07-03, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got the game today... been pulling out pieces since I got home, and I must say, I FOOKING HATE THE BATTLESHIPS!! They split right in half when I pull them out... well... 2 out of 8 did, so I'm using scissors to remove them now...<br />
<br />
But yeah... might post my thoughts on it after this weekend when I actually get to play it   <br />
I AM THE AVATAR OF APPLE PIE!</div></div><hr />
