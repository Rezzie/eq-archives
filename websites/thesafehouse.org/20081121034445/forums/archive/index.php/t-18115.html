With E3 quickly approaching, the Sigil team has been buried deep in their work of getting Vanguard ready for May, and as a result there has been an absence of new info and looks at the game since January. But finally, Sigil has unveiled their March screenshots (only just barely :)) and they are up on the website. And let me say, they keep getting better, all the time. <br />
<br />
Check out the March Screenshots HERE (http://www.vanguardsaga.com/screenshots.php)!</div></div><hr />

Methinks I'm going to rethink the video card for my new machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like the matte chain mail with the shiny plate mail on the &quot;Watching over Tursh&quot; picture though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-01-05, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm reasonably confident that I will able to play Vanguard with my current setup (AMD 2600+, 512 PC3200 RAM, GeforceFX5900XT 128 meg)....but I think I'm gonna wanna run it at higher settings than min. So I will be upgrading for Vanguard regardless of what the end specs look like, even if it's just another 512 stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwin</div><div class="date">04-01-05, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love kick arse graphics (and Vanguard looks the part) but we are not in a PC state for them yet in MMOG's. I was one of the first people to say I hated WoW's graphics and thought they looked cartoonish, but now I love them. <br />
<br />
First of all they are not that bad as for a models go and the cities and landscapes down right rock with the ammount of details put into them. The thing I love is the fact that I can run around the busiest cities without graphical lag. This really matters in raid settings.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that I never have top of the line PC's but I am in the top few percent (i have a hard time convincing myself to pay $400+ for a little processor increase) at least twice a year. I usually have a top of the line video card yet these games choke when you have 30+ people in the same area. <br />
<br />
I will settle any day for fluidity over high end graphics when playing a MMOG! That is just me. Now mind you if it doesnt look good I am not going to play it! I am not saying I want to go back to EQAlpha characters but I can settle with last years game engine running on todays technology when it comes to MMOG's!</div></div><hr />
