<br />
I continually post here about my exploits on Vallon Zek, PvP Teams Server, yet still some of you rogues seem to think you're better at being a rogue than I am.   Kidding. I just wanted to get your attention.<br />
<br />
It took me nearly two weeks to get the Blood Spirit booze in Mistmoore. During that time I continually asked those of the light races for a hook up and was repeatedly turned down. In the end, a dark elf wizard assisted me by letting me loot the booze from his kill.<br />
Now - I've got my Gem of Stamina.<br />
<br />
For the past week I've been in Solusek's Eye. I've been hunting, but I've also been messaging all those light races that entered to see if they'd assist me in killing Lynada. I was turned away every time except once. Some folks had legitimate excuses. The one time I wasn't turned away was a failure, however, for the high level druid had to gate out to avoid death.<br />
<br />
I eventually convinced a level 50 dark elf magician to assist me with killing Lynada. I told him &quot;It's more of a status symbol for me. Besides, I'm in a race with a lightie rogue to get it first.&quot; He responded immediately and said he'd help me out. 15 minutes later I stood there, in inkie form (ahem got my Mask at level 23), and watched the magician kill Lynada. The level 50 still thinks I'm a dark elf rogue.<br />
