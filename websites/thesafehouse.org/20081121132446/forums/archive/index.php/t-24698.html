Our #1 priority will be of the end-game raiding content. We strive for success with a select group of dedicated members. We are currently seeking members who look to dedicate their time to a team of people who all have the same focus in mind. You can visit our website here (http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=81730&amp;TabID=704029) <br />
<br />
Our current leaders and officers have a diverse background of high end raiding experience in both Everquest and Everquest 2. We are looking forward to starting a new chapter in Vanguard with a fresh group of members who look to see end-game content as we do. <br />
<br />
If any questions or concerns, you can reach me at either Venge Magnus on AIM or drop me an email at bongxterry@hotmail.com. We are looking forward to seeing you all in Vanguard!</div></div><hr />
