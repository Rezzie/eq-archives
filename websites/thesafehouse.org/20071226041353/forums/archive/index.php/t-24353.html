Plot Summary: <br />
<br />
Haruhi goes to Ouran High School, which is a school that exists only for rich people. She did not pay to enter, rather, she won a scholarship to enroll into this prestigous High School. Due to having to study hard to become a honor student to get in, she had no sense of fashion and acted very tomboyish. <br />
<br />
While searching for a quiet place to study, she entered Music Club room 3, which happened to be where the Host Club is. The Host Club is managed by six young men, and it's sole purpose of existence is to graitfy the wishes of girls. In other words, girls come to this club in order to have the bishounens make them feel special.<br />
<br />
While suprised at the surroundings, Haruhi accidently breaks a vase worth 8,000,000 yen (approx. $80,000). In order to pay off the loan, the club makes her work it off. Finding out Haruhi looks like a perfect bishounen, they make her into a Host to pay off her loans. What they did not realize was that she was an girl.<br />

<br />
This show never fails to amuse me. It took a sweet turn, toning down on the comedy a bit. The small romance between those two children was very cute. I absolutely adore the character art style in this show, sometimes makes it hard to believe the manga is it's actual source!<br />
<br />
And when haruhi went &quot;shhh.. zip it!&quot; aaaaa~ so cute. She's so lovely. And seeing her in the middle school uniform was wonderful! They turn her into a girl just often enough to keep me pleased, and don't treat her as bad as most women in anime are.<br />
<br />
I absolutely adore this series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For what it's worth, while I'm not saying ONLY these fans will like this series, a lot of others can discover this as something new and enjoyable, people who have seen and enjoyed Fruits Basket is almost 100% guaranteed to enjoy Ouran.<br />
<br />
Haruhi and Tohru are similar in so many ways. Or rather, this may be a lighter, more comedic version of Fruits Basket. (i.e. no &quot;dark side&quot; of the story, as of yet, anyway)<br />
<br />
I'm saying this because I think you've seen Fruits Basket.</div></div><hr />

I dunno really =/. I find it odd also b/c i usually like stuff stalk recommends. Altho im still a little behind so still need a few more eps....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Episode five spoilers<br />
<br />
When they were holding hands and watching Haruhi walk away, it was really touching. &quot;It seems as though someone has intruded upon our world.&quot; I'm not sure why, but it really got to me. I think it was a little over-the-top, but it still touched me. Maybe because I've experienced something similar with my deafness &quot;my world, and theirs&quot; that it really got to me.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed that aspect.</div></div><hr />

When Haruhi goes Girl, how the hell does she end up with long hair?</div></div><hr />

Bah, after all the lead-up, she comes out wearing that old-fasioned swimsuit, and they don't even show it the rest of the episode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-24-06, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you ask me, Haruhi is not very sexy. She's extremely cute. A one piece suits her imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-26-06, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked episode eight.<br />
<br />
Man, seeing Haruhi in Tamaki's arms was so moe! It's the first time I felt that way for Haruhi. She's been cute, but that scene in particular was extremely moe. She looked so frail and innocent, made me want to grab her and give her a big hug!!<br />
<br />
But it was a good episode, I was suprised at how they moved Tamaki and Haruhi's relationship forward. I was expecting no change, but to see Haruhi embrace Tamaki, even if it was out of fear, was a refreshing sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">05-26-06, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eight is a good episode.  Plenty of relationship developments between the characters, even if the rest of the story seemed a little weak.  Only thing I have to ask is what was up with that crab dinner scene?  A little bizarre if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haruhi was trying to piss him off, I think, by eating a lot of crab and making a lot of noise next to him, also, do you know how eating crab is messy with brokens hells and such? I think she was making it splatter him.</div></div><hr />

Aww, that was a sweet scene ^^</div></div><hr />

Well I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I didn't feel like there was much progression made.  It still had some decent jokes, but nothing outstanding.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
All hail TransDaddy! I liked this episode a lot. Haruihi is just awesome, the bit where her dad was saying how she can't depend on others, has no wishes of her own, yet helps those around her.... she's such a sweetie ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ep14- serious john williams music vibe right before the commercial break thingie, lol. good ep overall, some humor, some seriousness, a bit of backstory, and an awww moment, to boot.<br />
<br />
series is still going strong, imo =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">07-20-06, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still watching.<br />

15 was one of the better episodes in a while.  &quot;He's chopping logs for some reason&quot; that cracked me up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-20-06, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still watching also. Haven't had time to keep up with most series threads, though. Ouran has been great. 15 was funny as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-20-06, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha yah, episode 15 was good, just finished watching it. Eyes of the devil/beast, indeed :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like we're finally getting into Tamaki's past. Too bad we couldn't go into more detail of Kyouya's relationships with his family. Hopefully there'll be a second season going into more detail about this.<br />
<br />
Overall the series is getting a somewhat solid ending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-01-06, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">26<br />
I really enjoyed the end to this. They tied things up pretty nicely. Concluded Kouya's relationship with father, Suou and Kouya's family, defined what was going on with his mother, moved on Haruhi, Kouya, and Tamaki's relationships with each other, and so on.<br />
<br />
Don't have any real complaints about the end.<br />
<br />
All in all, a wonderful series. I'm glad to have watched it. It ranks pretty up there on my imaginary list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerda Jurtafryde</div><div class="date">10-02-06, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed the ending as well.  I was afraid the last episode was going to be a letdown, but it delivered.  It was perfect when Tamaki jumped off the bridge to catch Haruhi, I loved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">10-03-06, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a fitting end to an awesome series, albiet a rather blatant (imo) lead in to another season (which makes me warm and fuzzy inside :D)</div></div><hr />
