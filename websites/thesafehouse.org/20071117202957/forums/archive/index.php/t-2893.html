<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grinkle</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Name the three original DnD booklets (no looking them up on the Web!)<br />
<br />
I only remember the first two names, myself.  I'm talking about the three booklets that came out and were followed by GreyHawk.<br />
<br />
Some trivia - Halflings were called Hobbits in those books (and I think GreyHawk too?), but Tolkiens family complained, and TSR changed to Halfling, where it has reamained ever since.<br />
<br />
There were two (I think two) other expansion booklets before the ADnD Players Handbook came out - (after GreyHawk).  Anyone remeber what they were called?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't remember all the answers, myself - what are they?  And when exactly was that last appearance of the word &quot;hobbit&quot; in a TSR book?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">02-27-02, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 3 original books are:<br />
<br />
Men &amp;amp; Magic<br />
Monsters &amp;amp; Treasure<br />
The Underworld &amp;amp; Wilderness Adventures<br />
<br />
However, most people think of the first 3 supplements as the original books.  Those are:<br />
<br />
Greyhawk<br />
Blackmoor<br />
Eldritch Wizardy<br />
<br />
Later, they added:<br />
<br />
Gods, Demigods, &amp;amp; Heroes<br />
Swords &amp;amp; Spells<br />
<br />
These are all on my shelf in the back room...and boy, do I suddenly feel old.</div></div><hr />

Nice collection!  I lost my set in one of the dozen or so moves I've undergone since high school.<br />
<br />
Can you please confirm for me if I'm right that hobbits used to be hobbits?  I'm 90% sure, but maybe not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st edition had weapon length tables...they never explained what they were used for, as they did not match the actual size of the weapons.  In the original books, there were hit location charts.  Against larger then man sized creatures, the size was added to the player size, and would modify the hit location.  We used it in 2nd edition...and it worked nicely!
