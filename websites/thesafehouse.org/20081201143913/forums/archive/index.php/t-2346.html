If you are a Hover User, or a Hover/Fly User, I would especially recommend the post in the second link by Meraxes at 04/27/04 12:42 PM <br />
<br />
A little tricky to setup, but Its an incredibly useful set of binds, that lets you hit F to 1) Jump up and start hovering upward at max speed 2) Stop rising and hover level and 3) stop hovering and drop to the ground.<br />
<br />
It also has stuff to reset the three modes, in case it gets out of synch,  and you can use shift+F to toggle from Hover mode to Fly mode and back again.</div></div><hr />

I have my binds setup so I have 3 different chat bubble colors. Got F1-10 setup as the Alt-try powers.  <br />
<br />
One uber bind I reccomend...gotta wait till i get home to see what the command is, but basically you have a key setup to target nearest.  This works great when used with the default tab key since tab likes to pick targets further and further way the more you use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the F 1-8 setup as tea member 1, 2, 3, etc. helpful for a healer/Buffer i suppose, but not so great for an attack oriented person.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I had to change the Chat bubbles. Got mine in whatever colors my character wears for most of them.</div></div><hr />
