I'm also seeing some templates bringing it as far as 34 --but wouldn't maxxing poison be a more effective damage dealer? Or thrust even?<br />
<br />
Thankee.<br />

<br />
If you are going to be running around stealthed and attacking choice targets one at a time then pioson will be used basicly everytime you attack.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you are going to be wading in (maybe appearing from stealth to get that suprise that is so important) and won't have time to apply poison every battle then DW may be better for you than poison.<br />
<br />
Of course, if all you care about is minmaxing your template to get the best use of your points (at least what looks on paper the best use for this patch) then perhaps DW beats out poison all the time. <br />
<br />
It all depends what you are going after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I have been told by a fellow inf that DW is VERY effective.  Maybe not effective enough to raise to 40 or 50, but very nice in the mid spec levels.<br />
<br />
Raising a weapon to 50 can be a good idea if the styles are attractive.  Same with CS really, IMO.  The problem is you spend sooo many points raising from 40 to 50.  The same points could be used to raise a skill like DW or ENV up from 1 (if you planned on completely neglecting it) to 30.  That could be a HUGE difference. Aurra Sing - 37 Infiltrator<br />

I've heard that to keep anything effective at these low levels I should be maxing out thrust and dual every level!<br />
I didnt wanna be all uber like that though, but of course if you arent your screwed. so the wheel turns to should I even try to be different?<br />
<br />
PS- lv 6 I am, brought dual to 4, also venom to 4, stealth and thrust are at 3. None in CS, starting to regret anti- CS approach. Could I Chnage it without having to reroll, I got great armor. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Dual wield and Celtic dual wield percentages have been increased slightly. Lower level (pre-20th) dual-wielding classes won't notice much difference, but up at the higher levels, you'll notice that you attack much more often with both weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Critical Strike is important as well. <br />
<br />
Envenom is nice.<br />
<br />
Stealth needs to be at half or so, so you can complete stealthed attacks on mobs.<br />
<br />
By the time you get to 40. Stealth should be about 3/4ths your level. CS should be 34 at least, and Weapon Skill should be as high as possible. <br />
<br />
There are not enough extra points for Dual Wield to be very high.  Sunthas Bayne<br />

<br />
In 15 seconds at max skill for every 375 points Envenom adds DW/CD will pay back 300. And with envenom you get nice suprises like Disease, Enervating and a POS useless Snare they may actually make something outta some day. <br />
