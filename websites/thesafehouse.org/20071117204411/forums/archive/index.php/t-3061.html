<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">05-17-03, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, my 8 rogue/ 1 cleric (had no choice in that lol)<br />
died due to a will save or die roll that failed (11 with the DC of 15)<br />
<br />
so I rolled up a monk. level 9, human.<br />
<br />
so far I have weapon finess unarmed strike (dex and wis both 18)  weapon focus unamred strike.<br />
these bring my unarmed to hit upto 11/8 from the base 6/3<br />
and the 8/5 they would be if I used my str modifier.<br />
<br />
next I have dirty fighting.<br />
if I take the full attack action I can do an extra 1d4 points of damage. so that brings me to 1d10+2 + 1d4 per attack (so a max damage of 16, or 28 if I crit)<br />
<br />
well, there are three of my feats, I have too more now.<br />
Took snatch arrows for mostly roleplay reasons.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but catching and throwing a javalin right back at some one as a free action owns... now to talk the DMs in sending stuff at us that have javlins lol.<br />
<br />
and my last feat is mantis leap. If I make a successfull jump check I can treat my attack as a charge. deal normal damage, plus my str modifier times 2. so with a +2 str, that would be +4 damage along with my 1d10+2 damage for charging.<br />
<br />
what I am looking for now is a way to get in more attacks per round other then flurry of blows (which would put me at 3 attacks. +9 +9 +6) and dirty fighting, which I may not be able to use with flurry of blows.<br />
<br />
any suggestions out there to allow me to do a bit more damage?<br />
<br />
also, thinking about changing the char a bit to make him a 1st level psion (that would be his 1st char level) and an 8th level monk. this would allow him to take inerital armour (as long as I have any powerpoints, I get +4 to my ac) which would bring my AC from 19 to 23 (bring it to 29 in full defensive)<br />
<br />
thanks in advance guys Edited by: Mdar kelf at: 5/18/03 11:33:57 am</div></div><hr />

You can only take 1 attack in the round you use it and, once you get multiple attacks, it is rarely worth the loss of a feat.<br />
<br />
For a Monk, Freeze the Lifeblood is a fantastic feat.  Check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mdar kelf</div><div class="date">05-18-03, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I presume that that is also in the ultimate feats book?</div></div><hr />

Oriental Adventures or Sword and Fist?  I don't own the Ultimate Feat Book....assuming it isn't just a &quot;book&quot; online somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">05-18-03, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Book of Ultimate Feats is an open source d20 book printed by Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery, of &quot;Traps and Treachery&quot; fame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, that would be Gygax' company, the folks who did the ridiculously over-powered &quot;Rites and Rituals&quot; book.<br />
<br />
I'll pass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no, gygax isn't swords &amp;amp; sorcery. s&amp;amp;s is the company owned by white wolf :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some clarifications:<br />
<br />
The Book of Ultimate Feats is from Mongoose Publishing<br />
Some may be unbalanced, but it is a compilation of feats from a multitude of open sources, not just their own.<br />
Additionally, feats are like chinese buffet, take what you want and leave the rest.<br />
<br />
Gygax is primary with Troll Lord games, though he does do other stuff for other companies on occasion.<br />
Necropolis from Sword and Sorcery games for example.<br />
<br />
Sword and Sorcery games is a part of White Wolf. Which also has Necromancer Games<br />
(Necromancer Games products are published by Sword &amp;amp; Sorcery Studios and distributed by White Wolf.)<br />
Sword and Sorcery is the one who put out &quot;Relics and Rituals&quot;<br />
<br />
Traps and Treachery is actually from Fantasy Flight Games.<br />
<br />
Freezing the Lifeblood is a feat from Oriental Adventures.<br />
<br />
Dirty Fighting is from Sword and Fist, therefore not open content, therefor not in the book of Ultimate Feats<br />
<br />
More information:<br />
<br />
There is also a book called &quot;Feats&quot; from Alderac Entertainment Group which is another compilation of feats.<br />
<br />
If you're looking to spend a little cash you could also pick up &quot;Beyond Monks&quot; in pdf from rpgnow:<br />
www.rpgnow.com/product_in...ts_id=143&amp;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, all from the dredges of my brain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">05-20-03, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to remember whenever you call a feat book Unbalanced that any and all feats you pick for a character are *always* subject to DM approval, regardless of source.  For example, the 9th level spell &quot;Hide Life&quot; from the WOTC Publication &quot;Tome and Blood&quot; is outlawed in my campaign because it is not decently clarified in the spell text, and makes the caster immortal and invincible to all fatal spells and attacks as long as they have a fingernail buried somewhere in Outer Mongolia.  Sorry.  if you want to be immortal, you get to be a lich or vampire and take the penalties that come with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">05-20-03, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elminster is a Lich or Vampire?  :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, yes, a lot of spells, classes and feats from the various expansions are outlawed in our games.  Choke for instance, is a 1st or 2nd level spell that pretty much spells doom for any spell caster it is put on.  So, outlawed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best creative spell useage...ever</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;you're in a narea 1/4 the blast radius. where are you going to dive to?&quot;<br />
<br />
sorry, but that is by far the most creative spell usage Edited by: Mdar kelf at: 5/20/03 8:20:29 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">05-20-03, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was my example from the &quot;Worst Deaths Ever&quot; thread! And it was Wall of Force, not globe of impisenment, Wall of Force allows creation of a wall or sphere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
read it as globe of imprisinment.<br />
<br />
still, great way to waste some one.</div></div><hr />
