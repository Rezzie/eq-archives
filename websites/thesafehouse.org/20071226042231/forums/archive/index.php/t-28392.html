<br />
&quot;On Saturday, March 10 at 12:30, Blood+ will premiere on Adult Swim.<br />
<br />
A continuation of the anime movie Blood: The Last Vampire, Blood+ is about a high school girl named Saya with no memory and a case of anemia who lives with her adopted family in Okinawa. Soon her life begins to unravel as she is attacked by the inhuman chiroptera -- and discovers that she is the only one who can stop the rising threat. Aided by her family and her enigmatic servant Haji, it's Saya's job to rid the world of the Chiroptera and rediscover who she really is.&quot;  <br />
<br />
So how good/bad do you rate this show?</div></div><hr />

I watched the first 10 or so episodes, but I just sort of forgot about it. But what I have seen was excellent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do plan to finish it later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably watch it again on AS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this, Eureka 7, and Trinity Blood, Adult Swim has a lot of those these days.</div></div><hr />
