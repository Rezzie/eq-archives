<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here's the deal.  I've knocked off the prophet and the chosen (Trying to keep it vague because I know you bastages are reading this even though it's labeled spoilers :P) and I'm inside the stone.  My auto save is before I take on XXX&quot;s chosen, the ones listening to her projection.  My quick save is after that.  Anyways, the problem.  I can't find anywhere to rest/recall after that point, and when I get to the fight with (OK, seriously, I'm going into spoilers here, so get out! :P) the big M and her various body parts/protecters, I'm SoL.  I have to beat the chosen AND I have to beat M all with the spells I already have memmed.  Basically, the useful ones are:  Summon Creature 8 (One cast), Fire Arrow (Three Casts), Time Stop (One Scroll), Greater Spell Breach (One cast + Scroll), Magic Missles (Lots + Enhanced versions), Melf's Acid Arrows, Greater Rockskin (Two casts + Scroll), Fireball (Three I think, and Two Enhanced) and Protection from Spells (One cast).  So anyways, besides hahah, stinks to be you, here's the response I'm hoping for :P<br />
All the protectors at the top of the screen, I'm assuming correspond to damage types M is vulnerable too.  So I try killing the fire one, then hitting M with Greater Spell Breach (To remove protections) and then my fire spells, but she still won't take any damage.  Not to mention my familiar, elemental, and henchman all die off to the hands and various creatures that spawn.  So how DO you take M down?  Does the statue do anything special?  Do I have to take out all the protectors? &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ...

Try taking the protection from blades or mace or whatever type of weapon you have then poke/crush her to death. She's very fragile once you have some protections down.</div></div><hr />

I ended up exporting my char, starting chapter 4 over, and getting access to my level 9 spells.  I summoned a Balor to keep the hands busy, used the Horrid Writing to take out almost all the protections, then my balor totally ripped her a new one.  I'm a mage, so I can't melee worth #$%^ :P   &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ...
