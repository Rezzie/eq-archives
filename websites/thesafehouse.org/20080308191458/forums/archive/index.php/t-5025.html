<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gorgon1</div><div class="date">04-15-02, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wondering if there is anyway to create macros to set up chain attacks or a way for switching weapons.<br />
<br />
Since I am here.... Question. When I use a 2 handed iron sword for attacking, I average about 26hp per swing. (about 4.3sec) Then I switch to the my steel sword and axe and I only hit with 8 sword and 6 left axe. (about 3.5sec) I thought that they should atleast be somewhat comparable.<br />
<br />
So what is happening?<br />
<br />
Thanks for you help.<br />

You have your sword skill vs. left axe skills.  You have bonuses on the weapons (do they add points to the skill?).  You have the quality of the weapons which effects their actual damage.<br />
<br />
Lots of stuff besides base DPS and speed, in other words, so it's really hard to determine just from that data exactly why your output is how it is.<br />
<br />
On the macro question, Nostromo's N-50 and MS's Strategic Commander are left-hand devices that let you assign keystroke strings to a single button.  I've found them a little frustrating to use for combat, though, as the timing of the fight changes dramatically each encounter.<br />
<br />
This time your PA goes off just right, so you continue to CD and then SS.  But this time your PA doesn't go off, so you're either running or switching to Garotte.  This time you get AE'd while just about to PA, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
The problem with repeating keystrokes by rote becomes when the situation alters and your stupid macro keeps plodding along and you're now trying to do something else.<br />
<br />
Hurm...now that I've said all that, is using one of the above devices against the CoC?   Drolk - L43 Kobold Shadowblade (Tristan)<br />
