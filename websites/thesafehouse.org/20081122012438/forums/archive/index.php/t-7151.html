Not sure about all the other servers but the bazaar on tunare is extremely laggy and the sleeping hours when you type /trader you get the lovely message &quot;The Bazaar has reached the maximum amount of traders please try again&quot;  which happens to be 500 for the zone i guess.<br />
<br />
My idea to eliminate that would also bring some life into other city areas in norrath, or luclin for that matter..  Anyways the idea is making people be able to set themselves into trader mode is specific areas in any city zone.  This would require them to add a column to item search for what zone the item is located in, and now that PoP has been out awhile it would be easy for people to get their items from any city zone.  I think that if they are capible of inter-server tells and chat channels they can pull off multible zone searches for items.<br />
<br />
what does everyone think?<br />

Of course the bazaar window would show everything in both zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fanra</div><div class="date">02-27-03, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There have been a million suggestions for fixing the bazaar.<br />
<br />
The one I like the best is to create about 20 NPC merchants to stand there whom you give the item to and set a price and they sell it for you.  They can keep 10% of what I get if they want, just as long as I don't have to leave a mule there all the time.<br />
<br />
Note that this method also reduces the bandwidth that Sony pays for by a huge amount, lowering their costs and increasing their profits.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Sony is not interested and have ignored all suggestions to improve the bazaar. Fanra<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">02-28-03, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fanra, I think that's a great idea. I know a friend of mine can't stand downtime of any kind, so he has a friend of his with two accounts who is almost always in trader mode on his second machine sell for him in exchange for a % of the item's price. I find myself wishing I had two accounts so I could leave a trader mule up in bazaar to sell.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't like to see traders in every city in EverQuest. For one thing people wouldn't use every city. What do you do for instance if you're a high elf looking for an item and the only person in trade mode selling it is in third gate of Neriak? Now you're looking at the hassle of either getting a dark race to buy it for you or transfer funds to a mule to buy it. Maybe it would work ok on pvp servers but on other servers, heh, no way. And just imagine the hassle for Iksar to buy if people could go /trader in every city..</div></div><hr />

Just deal with the bazaar as it is. Noone wants to shop in more than one zone. Noone wants to deal with anything they don't have to. The bazaar is functional the way it is.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_orsyn</div><div class="date">03-02-03, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think one the best things they could do in bazaar is ban the summoning of ALL pets, horses/lizards, familiars, etc... (maybe allow them in the arena ONLY)... I see jack asses with their over siized lizards sitting in stalls (and an ogre on one of these is well over sized)...See people with their giant pets doing the same... YOU DONT NEED IT THERE IN TRADER MODE IDIOTS! <br />
<br />
 and hell for that matter to eliminate even more spammed lag, disable /random for the pathetic gamblers, and disable spells (outside of the arena area)... no need what so ever to have anything of these things going on there really... <br />
<br />
if a person is too lazy to head to the next zone to buff or what not , then they are tooooooo lazy to even be playing.  <br />
<br />
 I know Id like to kick the piss out of those who cast mod rods and open a translocate window on you just to be a jack ass ... and bards is another story all together and some of their less than honest tactics of lagging out people (again songs that have ZERO use their..)  cant even attack anything outside of the arena anyway. <br />
<br />
just my 2 coppers, no one get in an uproar they are my thoughts dont expect everyone to agree....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">03-06-03, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bazaar already has little modifications available to the sellers and buyers such as no weight on money while in the bazaar (zone out and you're practically stuck if ya got 30k in cash though).  No need for food/water while in Trader Mode (can't tell ya how many times I've come back from afk trader mode all night to find my endurance completely drained and the message 'you are hungry' every 5 lines of text).<br />
<br />
I agree that spells and familiars should be disabled outside the arena.  There's no need for SoW really when there is no weight restriction anyway with cash, no need for SoW or STR to grab 100k and go from bank to trader and back again.  And those annoying flappy familiars at every turn add just as much lag to the screen as a real player  :P<br />
<br />
Most of the spam it seems comes from chat.  /say, /shout, /ooc, /auction, etc. seem to lag out the screen a lot if there's multpile people talking.  That's not something that can be helped though.  Dice rolls are annoying spam as well.  Whoever got the idea to start Gambling as a pasttime/rip-off scheme should be drug out into the street and shot repeatedly.  If the annoying shouts for 'Double your Money!!' aren't bad enough, the shouts for 'so-and-so ripped me off' as a result aren't any better.<br />
<br />
As for Vid lag, it's mostly the number of 'angles' in the bazaar, counting the stalls, walls and door.  Reduce clip plane to 0, turn off ALL particle effects (those bard songs get REALLY annoying) and turn off your Level of Detail while in there.  I find that helps a bit.  Best fix of all though, do all those things AND go into a overhead view mode; hardly any lag at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phack</div><div class="date">03-25-03, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just look at the floor.  Doesn't require any fiddling with the in-game options, and the only thing thats frustrating is once you get to the trader looking up and dealing with that lag.<br />
<br />
On a side note... My best RL friend runs one of those casinos... but he runs it in the back of the arena where almost nobody goes.  If you see someone running a casino by the banks, suggest to them that they move it to the arena.  Less lag for everybody.  It seems like the arena is like a completely different zone.  Not being able to see 400+ PC's and all that structural crap makes it much more bearable.<br />
<br />
And say what you will about those casinos... fair or unfar, either side stands to make A LOT of money if they are lucky.  My friend has made over 20k off of it.  All he does is /random 2000, over 1150 doubles bet.  Yes odds are in his favor that he will win, but if you bet the same every time and split winning and losing 50/50 you'll still end up on top.</div></div><hr />

Then you could throw the vendors in a seperate room or whatever and have a low lag area where people can search and buy without hvaeing to run around the lag of all the hundreds of vendors</div></div><hr />
