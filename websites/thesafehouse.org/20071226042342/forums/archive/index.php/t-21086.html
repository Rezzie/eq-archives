<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-25-05, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got home with it, opened it up, and have been flipping through it, and I think this book is a must-have if you've got the Stand Alone Complex first season.<br />
<br />
It's a limited edition (15,000 units) 148 page book which comes with a 90 minute DVD in its front cover, and it details what went into the creation of the series through interviews and sketches.  It goes through pretty much every character in the first 19 episodes, even ones who made one or two appearances (for example, in Episode 9, titled 'Chat! Chat Chat!', the six people who were at the main chat table all have a sketch and a screencap of them, plus a small blurb on their behaviour).<br />
<br />
I love the sketches showing early version of the characters, and just by flipping through some of the episode rundowns (the log only goes up to episode 19; Log 2, which will be released in January, will go over the conclusion of the series; episodes 20 through 26) I've learned some things I missed the first time, making me want to go back and watch each episode again after reading its log book writeup.<br />
<br />
I've just started watching the DVD (its in japanese with english subtitles, btw), and the first 37 minute segment is starting off with a flourish by highlighting some of the excellent action sequences throughout the series, then going into all the other aspects of the series using clips taken from various episodes.  It then ends with a quick look at episodes 20 through 26, which will be the material the second log book will dissect.<br />
<br />
After that there are still two more interviews, one 30+ minute interview on the character voices, and another 20 minute on the visuals.  All-in-all, the Official Log 1 is an excellent companion to the first season.</div></div><hr />

 :rofl <br />
Your comment confused me at first.  &quot;Why's he asking for captioning if its subtitled.&quot; :b<br />
<br />
I have this on order but I havent gotten it in yet.  The info I saw on it made it sound really good.  Im glad that its as good as you say, cant wait for it to come in now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">10-26-05, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only caught a few episodes on cartoon network.  <br />
Last thing I remember is they shut down Sector 9 and the Major got his/her head blown right the **** off.<br />
<br />
They killed off the Major, is this correct?  WTF man?  (Haven't seen anything since that episode, and that was a while ago)</div></div><hr />

Ill start off saying thats abit of a spoiler.<br />
And continue with a spoiler of my own in the tag, though its fairly easy to figure out if you think about it for a moment.<br />
The major wasnt in the body at the time. You find this out by a few  episodes beyond that one. If I remember correctly she spends some time in a civilian body of a child before they get her back into a 'good body'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">10-26-05, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohh....<br />
well like I said I only got to see a few episodes every now and again and was missing most of them, so the episode I was talking about was the last I saw.<br />
<br />
Gonna add ye olde spoiler tags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-26-05, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They didn't kill off the major (though her being on the cover of the GitS: SAC 2ng Gig DVD should've been a hint :p).  The gunshot to the head was, as the black knight said in Monty Python's Holy Grail, &quot;just a flesh wound&quot;.  She actually uploaded her brain to the net (she mentioned to the Laughing Man that she &quot;Had a lot of time to think about what should be done with you.  There wasn't much else do to while I was floating around.&quot;)<br />
Here's (http://www.animeondvd.com/reviews2/alt_reviews/972.php) a review of the book/DVD combo which gives a good assesment of what's in it and how it looks.  I noticed the problem with the DVD's center spindal nub as well, but the glue that they used appears to be permanently tacky (it doesn't harden) so with the clear slip cover and the recessed hole the DVD sits in, it's not yet worth me using some glue or epoxy on the center nub to make sure it never moves; it can just be put back if it moves.</div></div><hr />
