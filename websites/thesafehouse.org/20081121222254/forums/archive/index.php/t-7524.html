<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Briq Shadowspawn</div><div class="date">05-03-01, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am Briq Shadowspawn, of the 14th shadow. I am on the Tallon Zek server and realize how much trouble pvp can be. Casters give a hard fight, especially with damn root/snare, and melee classes can sometimes hold their own. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in organizing an event for rogues on Tallon Zek(my choice), Vallon Zek, or Rallos Zek to help each other learn the tactics of pvp.<br />
<br />
I would suggest:<br />
<br />
1) we can help teach to fight against other melees.<br />
<br />
2) we can make a quick caster to help against..casters.<br />
<br />
3) we can have fun.<br />
<br />
4) a time to share stories.<br />
<br />
5) a time to show off gear.<br />
<br />
6) and a time to fight for money/gear!?<br />
<br />
well i hope some people like the idea and respond, i'll keep looking in on this thread to find out.<br />

<br />

I myself have a RL higher lvled lightie friend who, even though we are good friends, does not like being seen associating with me. =) as long as people want to do this, i'm up for ideas to discuss how we should organize it so keep the thread up.<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />
