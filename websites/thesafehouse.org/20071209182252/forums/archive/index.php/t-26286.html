<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">10-07-06, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, would be one of the few Anime I've watched that I read Manga beforehand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The anime follows the manga rather well but I do recomend geting it tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">10-14-06, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 episode in.<br />
<br />
Verdict:<br />
<br />
Badass.<br />
<br />
It's like Boondock Saints, but with monsters and Japanese honor students.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">10-14-06, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol you'll find the similarities to boondock saints to end soon enough... (and it gets better, too ^_^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">10-15-06, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it really has the same concept as Boondock saints. Actually, I disagree about the similarities ending. Except for the whole Light vs L battle, the undertones is the same I think, even if the method is different.<br />
<br />
Episode 2 spoilers<br />
<br />
Looks like it's time for Light and L to battle. This is, by far, the most interesting aspect of the series. 37 episodes eh? It's going to be long, but I'll be damned if it's not going to be awesome once again!<br />
<br />
Also, I advise people to just stick with the anime. I know they get impatient, but the manga is what it is, however the anime is extremely high quality and faithful to the manga, so it'll probably be far more enjoyable to watch than reading ahead on the manga.</div></div><hr />

its either that i watch/read too much police storiest but once i saw that guy annouce he is L i thought &quot; yeah right , it a trap so he can find out where is he and every city has another prodcast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darcean</div><div class="date">10-19-06, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">episode 3<br />
another great episode! I really need to get the manga.. so anyways onto why i put this into the spoiler box..<br />
<br />
Shinigami eyes eh? intresting, ok.. so light has 93312639 over his name..... now to assume if thats in seconds, minutes, hours or some other way to tell time that i've never heard of.. if thats in minutes well.. 93312639/525 948.766(minutes in a year.. go google!).. 177.417993.................. to which im probably wrong.... because that would equate that he has just about 177 years to live.... divide that by half and you get 88 years, thats just assuming minutes though.. it could be in seconds or anything else...... going by seconds would = 2.95 years...... *shrugs* i was bored enough to think about that Lol..<br />
<br />
anyways, L gets more awesome, so does Light... this is gonna be a fun anime for the next year or so, to the fact that there are over 12 volumes of manga and it could go on for more than 80 episodes, unless they keep to the 37 listed on ANN..</div></div><hr />

episode 3<br />
<br />
 Dunno if it says this in the anime but when you see Ryuk look at light that number is in Demon/death god time not human time....but if a human had the eyes you would see the date in human terms...<br />
<br />
37 eps is doable....the manga goes a little longer becuse it has a *little* more detail.</div></div><hr />

Normally you can find new translations on Thus/Fri...sometimes they are late and come out over the weekends. But normally the closer it is to the weekend the more new translations show up.</div></div><hr />

Woah, did NOT see Light admitting he might be Kira. I love how L has absolutely no clue WTF is going on. I bet Ryuk gave his DN to someone else, who will then get caught, letting Light and Misa go free. Sucks that Light went from totally awesome killer guy to 'normal teenager', but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">02-06-07, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's more likely that Rem is the one that gave the Death Note to someone else.  Since Rem will apparently do anything to help Misa, but Ryuk never seems willing to do anything to help Light.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I totally bought the execution scene. Well played.<br />
 <br />
Sucks I can't really cheer on Light anymore, oh well. Guess I'll have to root for Kira to be found, doesn't really matter by who. It's kinda like my love of this show has dropped a bit. Down to 'Like', maybe. Without such an awesome person like Kira-Light, whom I supported 100%, it will be hard to be as interested overall.</div></div><hr />

I'll be honest, every since Light discarded the Death Note I'd kinda lost interest in everything that has been going on.  It had just kinda got boring for a bit.<br />
<br />
But this episode was the first one since then that really had me involved again.<br />
<br />
It's back to the really convoluted plans that made up the beginning of the series.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it's wierd thought that Hig took a gun.  I mean, he's Kira.  Why would he need a gun?<br />

<br />
Actually, his name is really L. Whole name was L Lawliet. This is never referenced anywhere in the series, but is in the &quot;13th volume&quot; of the manga, &quot;How to Read Death Note&quot;, which is a huge compendium of information on the characters. This is also the reason Misa most probably thought L's name was kinda weird when she saw it. (I haven't seen the anime, I don't know if she mentioned that or not, but it was a point in the manga she did make.)</div></div><hr />

Ya. I doubt the anime will bring this up at all. If they do will prob be near the end. I think its b/c the manga wanted to keep the hype of L's name up till the end. Even tho it doesn't really tell ya anything *that* important.</div></div><hr />

True enough, but if you think about it, there's no way L could have been allowed to win. :P Unless you take the route that Death Note: The Last Name took....which was awful.<br />

Anyway, the cult worship of Mikami Teru should help to make up for that...<br />

Mikami: &quot;Are you God?&quot;<br />
Kira: *evil Kira grin, no hesitation* &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />

Don't get me wrong, the Near/Mello arc is far weaker than the L arc. However, the animators more than obviously know that. They turned the piece of **** the beginning of Near/Mello arc was into gold (relatively).<br />
<br />
Some of the worst parts of the manga is episode 29. And the animators knew that, they consolidated 9 chapters (4.5 episodes) worth of content into a single episode. And it was awesome.<br />
<br />
I mean, really, after you watch episode 29, try reading the manga version if you dare. You'll puke. I gave up the manga no less than six chapters after L died. It was that bad. Right about now (episode 30) until the final one or two episodes are going to be the best parts of this arc. The final two, well, I'll leave that to the animators!</div></div><hr />

Matsuda was behind a screen. When he made that blunder where he showed his face, Higuchi didn't have the eyes. It was after the blunder that he acquired his eyes.</div></div><hr />

I've got a question about episode 25:<br />
<br />
Misa did the trade for the shinigami eyes again, and L said she had been by to talk to Light, so she must have seen L.  Why didn't she kill him?<br />
<br />
Some ******* on another forum had already spoiled L for me, but goddammit, not Rem too =(</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Are you referring to:<br />
 <br />
Her being unable to remember L's name, when she saw him before she got caught? Cause she never saw L after she re-did the contract.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">05-21-07, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Near the beginning of ep 25, Light is standing by L, and L says something like, &quot;You've done nothing but stand there and talk to Misa.&quot; I think it was after Misa did the second exchange.  That poor girl is gonna die when she's 25.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-21-07, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I'm confused about what you are trying to say.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Misa never sees L after she regains her powers. Thus she cannot kill him. And I doubt she will die early due to the eyes- Rem's lifespan has been added to hers. She's had two Shinigami's lifespans added, and had it halved afterwards each time. If anything, her lifespan should be pretty normal, unless Rem had some huge bank of life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-21-07, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly certain that Rem's lifespan does not transfer over to Misa.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
It should. By killing L, Rem died due to interfering with Misa's death, and thus Rems lifespan should transfer to Misa.<br />
 <br />
If that wasn't the case, then Rem shouldn't have died.<br />
 <br />
Or....?</div></div><hr />

<br />
in episode 12 of the anime when rem is explaining how to kill a shinigami rem says that when jealous saved the girls life, jealous' remaining lifespan was given to the girl as her new lifespan. so since rem died to save her again then misa should have rems remaining lifespan. and since she had just taken the life of L, a young guy, its possible that misa has a long life in front of her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santril</div><div class="date">05-22-07, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. The manga made it very clear (Ryuk was very specific) that it was impossible for a human to have their lifespan added to in any manner. I wonder if this is a loophole that was chosen to be closed via the anime, or if this  material is covered in vol. 13. Hmm....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, it's not that Jealous's life got transfered to Misa, but that her death was extended as a result of Jealous's intereference. Since she was supposed to die at 16, and Jealous interfered, she can't die at 16 anymore. So it's extended to the next point of death, not to whatever Jealous had.</div></div><hr />

(This letter has also been served to Animanda, c1anime? &amp; Several Death Note fan sites.)<br />
<br />
As most of you know we have been subbing Death Note since it got licensed back at episode 12, starting from ANFS and working our way to Kuro-Hana.<br />

Nope. Ten bucks on Near having switched the real note for a fake, or is video taping the entire thing live to expose Light.<br />

 <br />
 <br />
Misa was shown on the ledge, leaning forward, eyes closed. I assume she commits suicide.<br />
 <br />
Why, I don't really know. She could have in no way known what just happened. I get the feeling they neglected to include something.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and **** Near. I wanted Light to win, L winning would have been OK too, but Near winning and not dying irks me. I hated Near. He needed to die, even if Light lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-01-07, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">37...<br />
<br />
Oh thank god.  That was fantastic.  I'm the opposite of Len.  I ****ing hate Light.  It was obvious he didn't really give two ***** about creating a better world.  All he wanted was to be worshipped as a god.  So I didn't care who beat him as long as he lost.  Long live Near!<br />
<br />
I think Misa suicided too.  But I'm not sure.  I think that nobody who used the Death Note would live though.  I was honestly expecting her to die of natural causes at some point where Light really needed her.  At first, when she halved her life TWICE I didn't think too much of it.  But after a 5 year skip, I totally was waiting for her time to simply run out.  Since 20 years is a long life-line.<br />
<br />
It feels like the show gave us way more information that we ever had any use for.  There was, like, a dozen Death Note rules that NEVER came into play.  And there was alot of stuff with the Shinigami that they simply never did anything with.  I almost thought they'd become an afterthought until the last moment where Ryuk writes down Light's name.<br />
<br />
Overall, very satisfied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santril</div><div class="date">07-01-07, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it's worth, Misa did not suicide in the manga. She started the cult of Kira, which had thousands of followers. I haven't seen ep. 37, but apparently there's a difference in what happens to her between the two.<br />
<br />
As far as the things which never came into play...eh. I'll just cite my standard rule: Read the Manga for Complete Story. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I understood, she commited suicide on valentine's day, both in the manga and anime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santril</div><div class="date">07-03-07, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">spoiler about misa in post 37<br />
<br />
From what I understood, she commited suicide on valentine's day, both in the manga and anime. <br />
There's no indication of any kind of suicide in Vol. 12; she's last seen leading a procession in a memorial service to Light. What you say may be true, but it'd be in How to Read Death Note, aka vol. 13, and since I can't read/translate any of the three Japanese alphabets, I couldn't tell ya. My understanding is that Viz also has no plans to bring this book over to the US, which is a shame.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Light is an idiot. It would have been child's play to portray Near as Kira if he'd only been able to keep his mouth shut until the failure of his plan was apparent, and even though he thought he was going to win, he had always shown more caution than that. He then could have killed him using the note in his watch, simply explaining it by saying that he needed an edge on Kira, so he took a scrap of it during the investigations with L. Given the setup he had running, the dual explination would have even resolved Ide and Mogi's concerns, and he could have dealt with the investigation team later.<br />
<br />
Mikami is also an idiot -- he knew he was being tailed, he should have taken the real note with him and left the fake in the safety deposit box. Then there could have been no tampering with the real notebook.<br />
<br />
There's no reason Near should have won. Light and Mikami were obviously not operating to thier usual standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">07-03-07, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.<br />
 <br />
Mikami suddenly breaking character against Light's wishes is nothing more than a 'Deus Ex'. Having Light break character there near the end was unusual as well. The more I think about it, the less I like the ending as it was presented.<br />
 <br />
Near got 'lucky'. And in a stupid way, too. Kind of a buzzkill when everything else was this intellectual mindgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santril</div><div class="date">07-03-07, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing does bother me. It's impossible for a Death Note to run out of pages. You can rip them out to eternity, and new pages will keep appearing. This IS one of the rules presented. How did Near replace all the pages of the Death Note that Mikami had?<br />
<br />
The ending just seems too rushed. The entire post-L arch did. Not that it makes this anything less than a great series, but still....<br />
<br />
Oh, and based on what they did since they appeared, Mello is definately &gt; Near. No question.</div></div><hr />

Think its to explain the death note a bit more in detail...I think this is the so called &quot;vol. 13&quot; of the manga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">10-18-07, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[02:35] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; man, i'm hungry<br />
[02:35] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; i want a burger<br />
[02:35] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; i could go to mcdonalds, but<br />
[02:35] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; that would force me to take a right turn on university blvd<br />
[02:35] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; whereas burger king is on the left<br />
[02:35] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and if i take a right turn<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; then L might realize that i'm predisposed to the right side<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; meaning i'm right handed<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; which would mean i might be kira<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; since kira is also right handed<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; on the other hand<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; if i go to burger king<br />
[02:36] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; he might suspect that i prefer charbroiled burgers<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and kira is evil, and evil is associated with fire<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and therefore burger king is associate with kira<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; unless, i go to burger king, and get their whopper junior<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; instead of their regular whopper<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; because then, it would indicate that i don't really like that much fire<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but then L might realize that i'm only going to burger king and getting the whopper jr<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; to throw him off my track<br />
[02:37] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and that i really am kira, intentionally trying to hide the fact that i'm kira<br />
[02:38] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but if i go to mcdonalds, he might realize<br />
[02:38] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; that i realize<br />
[02:38] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; that he would realize<br />
[02:38] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; that if i had gone to burger king<br />
[02:38] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; he would know i was kira trying to hide it<br />
[02:38] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; unless i get onion rings instead of fries with my whopper jr<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; because everyone knows onion repel vampires<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and vampires are harbingers of death<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and thus distantly related to shinigami<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; which are behind the powers of the death note<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; therefore, if i eat onions<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; then i can't be kira<br />
[02:39] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; because the onions might nullify those powers<br />
[02:40] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but what if L realizes<br />
[02:40] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; that i might be willing to take that risk<br />
[02:40] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and consume onions<br />
[02:40] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; in order to evade capture<br />
[02:40] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; or what if he doesn't even make the connection between vampires and shinigami<br />
[02:41] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; no, that's foolish thinking<br />
[02:41] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; there's no way L wouldn't pick up on a connection like that<br />
[02:41] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; unless he doesn't even know that i got onion rings<br />
[02:41] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but to make sure he knows i got onion rings<br />
[02:41] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; i'd have to eat them in front of him<br />
[02:42] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; which would seem awkward, going all the way to burger king, then coming all the way back just to eat onion rings<br />
[02:42] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; unless i ask him if he wants anything from burger king too, then i could bring it back to him<br />
[02:42] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but what if he's not hungry<br />
[02:42] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; i'd have to either make sure he's hungry<br />
[02:42] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; or ask someone else, one of the staff around here, if they'd like me to pick up something for them<br />
[02:43] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but if i ask someone else<br />
[02:43] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; when i havent' asked anyone else in the past<br />
[02:43] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; L might realize that i'm doing it so i can have an excuse<br />
[02:43] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; to come back here and eat onion rings<br />
[02:43] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; to demonstrate to him that i don't fear consuming onions<br />
[02:43] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and that consequently, i'm not kira<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; all in an attempt to cover up the truth<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; unless i can get someone to ask me to pick up something for them<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; then it's not me trying to hide the fact, i'd just be obliging someone else<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but how do i get someone else<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; to ask me to get them something from burger king<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; what if, instead of burger king, they wanted something from mcdonalds instead<br />
[02:44] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; if they did, i would then have an excuse to go to mcdonalds instead of burger king<br />
[02:45] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; citing the request as my reason for taking a right turn instead of a left<br />
[02:45] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; and thus exonerating my choice from implicating me as kira<br />
[02:45] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; but if i do go to mcdonalds<br />
[02:45] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; i have to get an apple pie with my value meal<br />
[02:45] &lt;&amp;Light|Hungry&gt; etc etc etc</div></div><hr />
