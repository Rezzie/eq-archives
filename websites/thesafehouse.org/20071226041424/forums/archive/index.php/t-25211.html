Something they just get used to by watching or is it in a person's Genetic's?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Do they enjoy it or not? And if they do, they watch anime, if they don't. They don't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">07-14-06, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's kind of a broad statement to like/dislike anime.<br />
<br />
Some people might just like a small genre of anime while disliking the other genres.  Others meander through the genres like I seem to do.<br />
<br />
I know I started with the generic afterschool/weekend stuff, but then started hunting down the harder stuff to try out.  <br />
<br />
Some people just stick with the lighter stuff while disliking the 'weirder' stuff.  (The casual vs. hardcore anime difference on some forums kind of reminds me of the casual vs. raider debates on the MMORPG forums :nerd  )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it depends on how long someone is allowed to watch it before facing some social stigmatism.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">07-14-06, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anime is kinda like politics. Some people dabble in it, other people are heavily into it, yet still others loathe everything about it. That's just the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-14-06, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It pretty much comes down to, if you happened to see some when you were going through puberty, you are going to watch it forever,  Because the unique sexuality will scar you!  And it's a fix only more anime can give you!<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what happened to me when I saw Vampire Hunter D when I was like thirteen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">07-14-06, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's just that some people can't get past the 'anime must equal cartoons' mentality.  When I was young, the first anime series I ever saw were Star Blazers, G Force, and Robotech.  I was captivated at the thought that a 'cartoon' could have a running storyline that would make me want to watch it every week to see what happens next.<br />
<br />
Later on in life I returned to anime through Ghost in the Shell and Akira, then Neon Genesis Evangelion.  My anime collection now consists of about two dozen anime series and probably another couple dozen movies and other disks.</div></div><hr />

I think people get into anime when they see one that registers with thier own sorts of interests. Someone that hooked on soap operas and see an anime equivalent begins to see the relevancy of anime beyond being &quot;just cartoons&quot;. It's all about demonstrating the superior value of animation as a medium for story telling. Show someone the right anime that tells the right kind of story for them, and I think they come to see it in a new light.</div></div><hr />

Bingo- for most of the people I know, this is exactly why they won't watch anime. I know for myself, for the longest time, I would refuse to watch anime, because simply &quot;it's stupid&quot; (and boy am I glad I don't subscribe to that mentality anymore).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way you found your way back into anime is a prime example of how to break that mentality.  Ghost in the Shell.  Man I love that series.  One of these days I'll own all the DVDs.</div></div><hr />

Actually I have to give credit to Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.  I was watching Siskel &amp; Ebert in the 90s and they mentioned the movie Ghost in the Shell.  I had fond memories of anime series from my childhood so I decided to rent it, and I loved it.<br />
<br />
I guess I should also mention Princess Mononoke as another movie that got me restarted on anime (though after GitS and Akira), and the movie that turned me on to Hayao Miyazaki.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye I think this is part of the problem...but the other problem is kinda what darthender is leading too. Most see anime as just soft-core porn and can never get past that. Thus they think all anime is about porn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">07-17-06, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of a mix for me.  I think the first &quot;Anime&quot; I watched as &quot;Anime&quot; was Dominion Tank Police followed shortly afterwards by Tenchi Muyo.  I picked up a few other titles because it was kind of intresting and I never ended up stopping.  17 years later I have over 2000 titles in my collection.  (17 years, holy crap im getting old)<br />
<br />
I do see the niche's that anime watchers get into though, and I of people that ive shown it too as well I can see how they like/dislike the 'media type' due to their first experience.  Choosing the first anime for someone to watch is rather important if you want them to keep watching it.  If they watch one of them and dont like it they wont bother watching anymore.  Many people dont realize that Anime is a 'media type' instead of a 'genere'<br />
Its like saying &quot;Oh, your talking about Hollywood movies?  I saw one of those 'Snakes on a plane' I think it was.  Hollywood movies suck, I dont want to watch any of those.&quot;<br />
<br />
That being said, I think it may take a person whos abit more open minded and has a bit of imagination of their own to really enjoy anime.  People with no imagination I dont see getting into to many movies much less anime.  They are the people that complain that cars shouldent blow up like that when they watch Rambo or something.  If they complain about that they they will definatlly have a problem with a boy that got an alien 'wife' because he grabbed onto the horns on her head after distracting her by stripping off her bikini top.</div></div><hr />

That's why I'm trying to hook my nephew early.  <br />

As well as getting him into recreational reading.</div></div><hr />
