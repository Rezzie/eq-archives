<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We recently started an advanced campaign - all characters begin at 12th level, with 3 minor magic items and 2 major magic items.  DM rolled up 24 minors and 18 majors, straight out of the book's random loot table, then let us pick what our characters wanted.<br />
<br />
One of the party is a human Barbarian/Fighter with Weapon Master prestige class, who started at 17 strength.  Upon picking his gear, he somehow ended up with Gauntlets of Ogre Power (+2 str while worn) and a Manual of Gainful Exercise +5 (+5 permanent strength once read).<br />
<br />
This puts him at 24 strength, which is a +7 bonus.  However, he's also a barbarian, which allows him to rage twice per day to jack his strength up 5 more points.<br />
<br />
This boy will be running around at 29 strength, a +9 bonus, using a two-handed masterwork weapon, with weapon feats out the wazoo.  He is at +10 to hit, +16 to damage.<br />
<br />
WITH A MASTERWORK WEAPON.<br />
<br />
Insane!<br />
<br />
Of course, my choices of the items didn't exactly suck either.  The ring of X-ray vision, the Amulet of +5 natural AC, and the Ring of Jumping promise to be interesting - as will the Hand of Glory.    -- Veteran Arafain Entreri, 60 Assassin<br />
 -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic<br />
 -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend<br />
 -- Requiem of Souls<br />
 -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br />
&quot;Once, in the old west, a gentleman shot a professional gunfighter in the back. When asked why he didn't give the other chap a chance to draw, he replied, 'Well, he's dead and I'm alive and that's how I wanted it to be.&quot; -- from &lt;u&gt;Red Planet&lt;/u&gt;, Robert A.

<br />
I asked my DM and he said no =/<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We asked our GM for +1 weapons for our 8th lvl party once. He said no. He did give us a single +1 sword and some proficiency weapons though. The proficiency weapons were pretty cool - until we met the werebeasts.</div></div><hr />

I bet you'll listen now!&amp;lt;/old woman voice&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe... +1 weapons all around is nice, but you really dont want to be the only one with one.<br />
<br />
Party :&quot;Look!  A (level draining) Wight!  Let Bob handle it!  He's the only one with a magic Weapon! The rest of us will fight the skeletons and zombie retainers&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">02-22-02, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry. We were too busy making sure we had plenty of ropes, lots of oil, a goat or sheep, several winterblanket, ink, crowbar chalk signet rings, wigs, 6 scroll cases, silverware, sewing needle, charcoal, sheets of paper, twine, 7 bottles of rotgut, tinderbox, 5 waterskins, 1 large bag of salt, 20 small bags of pepper, several bottles, lamp, soap, whetstone, shovel, and a pole. That was just my list, the others had some more stuff. No silver weapons though. We totally forgot about silver weapons. But we were very very well prepared for anything that didn't involve requiring magical or silver weapons!    Edited by: Koru  at: 2/22/02 8:56:22 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now, I've got a bag which has random affects according to I believe the 2nd edition wizard spellbook additions.<br />

Fun stuff, if a bit dangerous.</div></div><hr />
