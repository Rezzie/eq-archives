<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gankalette</div><div class="date">05-28-05, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently working my way towards the 21/5/25 stun lock build and am lvl 40. I have cold blood and am now working down the sub tree for prep. While I enjoy this build I feel that I am limiting my DPS. I rarely loose in 1v1 pvp and do pretty well at 1v2/3 if I can get a jump and sap. I want to maximize my DPS to help in instances ect., but not lose my sheer dominance in pvp. <br />
<br />
I switched to a combat build briefly around 37ish and fell in love with blade furry. I didnt spec all the way to speciallized swords because I didnt have the points. My dps shined in SM and RFD becuase we were taking on multiple mobs and it was unreal. Unfortunatly, I didnt get much of an opertunity to PVP before I changed back. I didnt notice a difference when solo grinding when I switched from my CB/Prep build to combat, but I noticed a drop in efficiency when I switched back if that makes any sense. <br />
<br />
So basicly, I miss combat, but don't want to sacrifice my pvp abilities. Is there a drop off in ability of a combat sword spec rogue in 1v1 pvp? Any suggestions would be greatly appriciated.</div></div><hr />

I find it amusing for example that you state you think you are loosing DPS by going to the build you are going to over a combat build because at 60 with a good dagger like shanker the build you are going to or maybe a 21/8/22 for the imp BS will get more dps then a combat build any day of the week in a group or raid.<br />
<br />
Before you hit 60 though when you are still soloing up to quest and level combat DOES rock because your fights are typically toe to toe battles and combat shines for that.  However if you want your role in life as a rogue to be  as an offtank then I would suggest making a warrior cause they tank better and can have nearly the same dps as you will with a combat build.<br />
<br />
In a group or raid (lesat in higher levels) your are going to have fights tha simply don't last very long. The burst dmg you can get from ambush is really nice then with the benefit of Cheap shot available to you if the group needs some stuns due to a weak healer. However a great dagger, imp BS, Opportunity, and Imp ambush will do higher dps then anything else at 60 cause to be honest you are NOT going to be doing much solonig then.<br />
<br />
Till 60 though play with all your skills. Combat rocks then, but I would personally have a hard time setting my entire build around PvP snice I don't really dfind myself PvPing as the majority of my online time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gankalette</div><div class="date">05-28-05, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats mainly what I was talking about...pre 60. I plan on changing back to a cb/prep build at 60 but Im not sold on daggers. I have heard both sides saying their side (Daggers vs. Mace/Swords) is better so I will have to judge that myself when I get that lvl. <br />
<br />
Maybe I should restate my question better. If I switch to a combat sword spec build will I lose ability to effectivly PVP? I know its better PVE but i am concerned with PVP...I just dont want to be a push over. I have a sword of serenity and the other sword from rfd that is identical to the sword of serenity in dps/dmg/speed. I will mostly likely upgrade to a thrash blade when I get high enough to go do the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IE in a mass pvp rush on xroads our best tool is the fast ambush and backstab to kill fast. Combat is for toe to toe and in group pvp that is not good for a rogue. <br />
<br />
In a planned duel though combat can be very strong.</div></div><hr />

With good crit gear and imp backstab and imp ambush, damage at 60 is unreal. I'm at 30/8/13. Pre 60 definately stick with combat, i'd say work towards 21/30 for maximum solo effectiveness.</div></div><hr />
