I heard mace is a viable spec option, and seeing that it has the 6% chance to stun I believe I will be going mace/mace.  <br />
<br />
Now which stat effects mace damage, I know humans already have a mace bonus, im thinking it would be probably strength eh?  So human is probably a solid choice for a mace rogue.<br />
<br />
There isn't a glaring problem I am making is there?  Something I wouldnt know about until I actually grab my game and get going.</div></div><hr />

Humans get both a mace and sword bonus. As for mace spec it doesn't seem all that useful to me considering the diminishing returns effect of stuns. After cheapshotting and kidney shotting the mace stun procs wouldn't last long enough to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bender</div><div class="date">01-01-05, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, when I got home I looked it up cause it was bothering me and found the same thing, but from what I understand the diminishing returns only happens with that same kind of stun, as in one cheap shot is 4 sec, the next cheap shot will have diminishing returns.  As far as all stuns, what I had read they all would work effectively once on the same target, but when you start to get 2nd and 3rd weapon stuns from mace specialization, thats where diminishing returns comes from.  Could be different, I have been known to be wrong once in a while )</div></div><hr />

Very nice, especially for PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slymm</div><div class="date">01-01-05, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">keep in mind to get to mace spec you need a lot of points in combat (20+), and so far, even playing as a non-dagger rogue, almost all my points are in assassination. course this isnt really something you can figure out till you've played for a while.<br />
<br />
maces can be quite nice, i used one for a while from high teen's to low 30's or so, but from here on out it looks like its gonna be a lot of swords. just got my sword of omen (awesome sword, go get it soon as you turn 33), then it will prolly be a phantom blade, then thrash blade.  although there is talk of ironfoe, which i think is a hammer. but i dont expect to be getting one anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synrax</div><div class="date">01-02-05, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went gnome.  The racial trait Escape Artist seems iffy to me.  I tried it and even tho its a 1.5s cast, I kept getting pounded by mobs to finish channeling.  Of course I had a train on me so I will mess around with it more.  Ultimately most people say the racial traits don't make much difference.  Play what ya like.  Only way I can see gnome having an advantage is if Blizzard creates some ubah engineering device beyond the normal cap.<br />

If only we could backstab with a 2hander sword keke  :pulid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolo</div><div class="date">01-08-05, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope Psiko.  Escape Artist is less of a get out of jail free card, and more like a second trial with no hope of winning card.  It takes 1.5 seconds to cast.  By that time, you're dead or you're snared again anyways.  It's horrible.<br />
<br />
If you're rolling for PVP traits, Horde is preferable.  Especially Orc.  Horde traits &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alliance traits.</div></div><hr />

Imo, undead rogues have it the best, whether they go daggers, swords, or maces. There's only one skill in the game that totally wrecks me as a dagger rogue, and it's pretty much the same for sword and mace rogues: FEAR :( <br />
<br />
It takes us out of fight and lets dots eat up our low HP before we can kill our targets. Since the undead racial ability allows them immunity to fear it's damn near essential for rogues. If you're not partial to a particular faction, go horde and play an undead rogue.<br />
<br />
If you really want to go alliance, each race has some neat things going for it.  Imo, escape artist &gt; perception, since its useful against more classes. The major reason to go human is for the +1 level to sword and mace attacks. So if you're going for a combat build, human is probably the better choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gage Kitheri</div><div class="date">03-12-05, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Humans are the worst choice for rogues on Alliance side as far as racial abilities go. Perception is total crap since you can't have it on and be stealthed at the same time. And even when it is on it doesn't seem to help at all. The + to swords and maces is completely negligible and humans look really silly with level 60 gear. Really wish I had gone night elf for the innate stealth bonus and cool flip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LurchOG</div><div class="date">03-29-05, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dwarven Rogues get some decent racial traits, and seem to be fairly rare. Treasure finding can be useful(not really a PvP thing but still not a bad trait compared to a lot of them). Stoneform is, IMO, underrated even tho its use is highly situational. Like others here have said, the cast time on escape artist cripples its usefulness. In my opinion Undead are the only race with a PvP advantadge granting racial, Warlocks hate undead, and priests arent overly fond of them either in the majority of cases.<br />
 Taurens stomp is pretty nice too but they cant be rogues. If youre alliance pick the race you think is the coolest, it wont hurt you regardless of which you choose. Oh, gnomes are a little harder to target/see sometimes because of their size, I guess thats sorta a racial trait  :kroe  <br />
