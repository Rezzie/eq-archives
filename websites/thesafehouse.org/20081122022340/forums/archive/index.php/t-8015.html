<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">11-01-01, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT: PLEASE NOTE - this FAQ is being updated to be consistent with the new PoP poisoning system. Generally speaking if you are strictly interested in new poisons, you should consult the FAQ and information at Corinari's Guide to Advanced Poisons<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of people come to the Safehouse Laboratory looking for answers to poison questions. Some of them come up a lot. Unfortunately the information in the Rogue FAQ in the library is somewhat lean on poisoning information, and the unofficial tome of mastery, while the definitive source for effect and recipie information, is not good for answering questions.<br />
<br />
So I'll take a shot at answering common questions in this thread and we'll see if it turns out to be useful. Feel free to chime in with questions and answers to be added.<br />
<br />
Note: For almost every question there are two answers - one applies to the old poison system, and one to the new poison system introduced with the Planes of Power expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is poison worth it?<br />
<br />
A very common question. Probably the first question any rogue asks. Before the Planes of Power expansion, poison was of very limited use. However with the introduction of a new poisoning system in PoP, it takes on a whole new life. <br />
<br />
The new system is still too new for any concensus to be reached on how useful the new poisons are. Some will say it's too much effort, while others will say it is fun and useful. You will probably have to be your own judge.<br />
<br />
Also much of the information we have was discovered by high level rogues who were highly skilled in the art of toxicology. We don't really now how practical poison is yet for the mid level rogues.<br />
<br />
How do poisons work?<br />
<br />
A brief explanation:<br />
<br />
Old poisons: you would create then apply a poison. The first time you attacked, the poison would go off on the target, and be used up. It would also be used up if you zoned.<br />
<br />
New poisons: You &quot;apply&quot; the poison much as you would use a shaman potion - by right clicking on it. This puts a buff on your character (complete with spell icon, and yes it can be dispelled). The buff causes you to have a proc on all your weapons with the effect determined by the poison. One poisons might cause you to proc a snare, while another a DoT, and another a STR debuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I make such-and-such poison?<br />
<br />
Go here: Tome of Mastery: Poisons This is the thread that is pinned to the top of this forum - it contains information on every recipie, every ingredient and every effect of poisons. A lot of rogues worked hard to pull that info together and it's extremely useful to the aspiring toxicologist. This contains all information on the OLD poisons.<br />
<br />
The information on the new poisons is still being collected. The best source by far is currently <br />
<br />
Corinari's Guide to Advanced Poisons<br />
<br />
<br />
            Is there a way to make poisons stack? or<br />
            Can poisons be made to stack like shaman potions for multiple charges? or<br />
            Is there an item like the bearskin bag that will let you stack poisons?<br />
<br />
Two answers for this:<br />
<br />
For old poisons: No there is not. It can't be done.<br />
<br />
For new poisons: By completing the quest given by Renux in West Karanas, you can create a Grand Master Assassin's Seal. This will let you summon special bottles in whick you can create multi-charge poisons, much the same as shamans create multi-charge potions with bear skin bags. However the quest is not simple, and is not even possible until after level 46. At lower levels, rogues must use single charge doses, or have a higher level rogue combine them for you. (Or you could purchase them.) Corinari's site has the full details on this quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
            Does a lower resist posion stack with malosi? or<br />
            Does a slow poison stack with slow spells? etc.<br />
<br />
Old poisons: It depends.  Some effects will stack, while others won't. The malosi line will overwrite our lower resist poisons.  Most slow spells overwrite our slow poisons. For other effects it will vary depending on the poison and the spell. Unfortunately there's no simple answer here.<br />
<br />
New Poisons: Erm....well... We're not sure yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
            Is Make Poison capped by level?<br />
Yes. The exact formula is not quite clear. But the cap is 200 at level 50 and goes up 5/level to stop at 250 at level 60. Prior to level 50 I'm not quite sure of the formula.<br />
<br />
For simplicity<br />
<br />

59 - 245<br />
60 - 250 <br />
<br />
            Is Make Poison a trade skill? Will it be my single above-200 trade skill if I raise it that high?<br />
<br />
No. Make Poison is a class skill, not a trade skill. It will not prevent you from raising another trade skill over 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next few come right from the Rogue FAQ and only apply to the OLD poison system.<br />
<br />
            2.11 How do I apply poison?<br />
By right clicking on a poison vial, you will automatically sit and apply the poison to your primary weapon slot. Applying poison takes roughly 7 seconds. You cannot poison any weapon type other than piercing.<br />
<br />
            2.12 How do I make poison?<br />
First you'll need to buy the supplies. A poison recipe book can be helpful, but is not necessary. There are several vendors in Norrath.<br />
<br />
[the list in the FAQ is out of date - consult the Unofficial Tome of Mastery for vendor locations]<br />
<br />
You will need to have a mortar and pestle to combine the components in. For EACH vial of poison you will need: A suspension fluid , Various poison components from creatures around Norrath, and a vial made by potters or purchased from one of the above mentioned vendors. The poison book will have the recipes, but be sure to check the Safehouse Library forum for all the information.<br />
<br />
<br />
            2.12.1 How long does the poison last?<br />
Each application is for one use only. If you zone without the poison effect going off, you also will lose it. Upon the first hit with your piercing weapon, the poison effect will go off. There is a chance the mob will resist the poison. Backstab will not activate poison. Note also that you must use a piercing weapon for poison.<br />
<br />
<br />
          Can I keep the poison from going off until a tank has secured agro?<br />
<br />
There's an answer hidden in the last sentence of the answer above. You have to have a piercing weapon equipped when you poison, but it won't go off unless you have one equipped when you attack. You can therefore apply poison, and switch to a 1hb or 1hs weapon, and then attack. The poison will not go off. Then switch in a piercing weapon and the poison will go off.<br />
<br />
<br />
            Can I poison throwing weapons?<br />
The simple answer is &quot;no&quot;.  The more complicated answer is that you can sort of do it, if you poison a weapon that can be both equipped in the primary hand and the range slot, and then throw it. It's complicated and not for casual use.<br />
<br />
<br />
            Can I hand a poisoned weapon to someone else?<br />
            Can I poison several weapons and keep them in inventory?<br />
            Can I poison my secondary weapon and my primary weapon for double effecti? <br />
No.  It seems like you are poisoning a weapon, but it would be more true to the game engine to say that you are activating a one-time proc on yourself that will go off on the next hit with a piercing weapon.  You are not actually doing anything to the weapon. If it helps, think of it like casting a spell on yourself that will go off next time you stab a monster.<br />
<br />
            How do I raise my pottery skill so I can make my own vials?<br />
There are a number of excellent pottery guides. The best source for info on any tradeskill is probably www.eqtraders.com, which has recipies, guides, vendor data, and so on.<br />
<br />
            Where can I find skins to make vials with?<br />
Many places. In days gone by, most rogues worked with zombie skins since they were the only kind of skin that would stack. Unrest was the most frequently farmed zone for this. However since pelts of various animals are now stackable, there are many more possibilities. East karanas and Stoneburnt mountains come immediately to mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
            What is the secondary attribute for poison? Dex? Int?<br />
When you find out, let us know.  I read something recently that said at a fan faire they were debating making dex the secondary attribute, which implies that at this time there is none. No definitive information exists on this.<br />
<br />
<br />
            Does my apply skill affect how long my poison lasts?<br />
Uncertain. After reading accounts from a number of people, I'm inclined to say no. But no definitive testing has been done on this. Generally the only established information about the apply skill is that once you get over 100, you will very rarely fail to apply a poison.<br />
<br />
For new poisons, the apply skill is not used at all and has no effect on anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
            How can I raise my Make Poison skill quickly and cheaply?<br />
You can't.  Poison making is not a cheap skill by any means.   There are extensive costs both in time and platinum. Generally you will need to spend both, and if you want to spend less money you will need to spend more time, and the reverse applies.<br />
<br />
A wonderful suggested advancement path can be found here:<br />
<br />
http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessage?topicID=2045.t opic<br />
<br />
           Can I apply multiple poisons or stack two different kinds of poison on my weapon?<br />
<br />
No. At least not how you probably mean. You can apply one poison after the other - the second poison will overwrite the first one.   This is the case for both old and new poisons.<br />
<br />
<br />
            Can I buy poison from a merchant, or from other rogues?<br />
You cannot buy poison from any merchant at this time. There are quests you can do for poison, but they require farming just like making the poison does.  Whether you can buy poison from other rogues depends on your server. It is my understanding that there are not many rogues selling poison on the open market, but some do take comissions.<br />
<br />
<br />
            Will VI be &quot;fixing&quot; poison soon?<br />
<br />
It's fixed!<br />
<br />
<br />
            What about those &quot;haste&quot; poisons? Do they haste me?<br />
<br />
No, they haste the target. The idea is that while they speed up the target's attacks, it debuffs other stats. There are some limited uses for this type of poison but that's about all. No poison has any effect on anything except the beastie that it hits (i.e. it never does anything to you, just the target).<br />
<br />
<br />
            Can I apply poison from within a bag?<br />
<br />
No you have to apply from a main inventory slot. New poisons can be used from the AMMO slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
    I just turned level 18/20 and went to train in Apply/Make but the trainer in Frionia Vie doesn't have the skill. What gives?<br />
<br />
For reasons known only to Verant, the rogue trainer in FV only offers the basic skills, and not all the special rogue skills. To get your traning in Apply or Make poison, go to a rogue trainer in a starting city. (i.e. hop on the boat to Kaladim) <br />
<br />
<br />
I  have a Grand Master Assassin's Vial, which gives me +5% to my make poison skill. Can I also use another item that boosts it (such as a decanter of the apothocary or tinkered item) to boost it further?<br />
<br />
No. Only the highest skill-modifying item is used. They do not stack.<br />
<br />
<br />
How high can I get my skill using skill-modifying items?<br />
<br />
Sony has given some fairly detailed information on this kind of thing as it relates to trade skills and for this purpose Make Poison would be included in that. The highest effective skill you can have is 252 (that's after all modifiers). So if you have a skill modifying item, your skill caps out effectively around 241 or so. However it's important to note that the Poison Mastery AA skill does not add to your skill - it directly boosts your success rate. Therefore it will have an effect even if your skill is maxed. I highly reccomend that anyone who is really interested in making poison pick up at least Poison Mastery level 1. It's been shown to have a significant impact.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can I combine different poisons types at the same time?<br />
<br />
Technically, yes.  However the new poison will over-write the first poison.  &quot;Double dipping&quot; may help your Apply skill increase, but you will not get a multi-poisoned strike with that weapon. -- Lemac Dushae, Redeemed member of the Court of Jesters<br />

<br />
Yes.  You can poison a weapon as usual, but not equip a piercing weapon.  By using a 1HS or 1HB weapons, you can still Apply Poison, but the poison will not work until you attack with a piercing weapon.  Once the main tank has the mob securely, swap in a piercer to attack with poison.<br />

No. It seems like you are poisoning a weapon, but it would be more true to the game engine to say that you are activating a one-time proc on yourself that will go off on the next hit with a piercing weapon. You might want to include here that, in this context, Backstab does not count as a piercing attack even though it requires a piercing weapon.  Likewise, a thrown piercing weapon within a limited range can activate the poison. Mistress Lannella, Druzzil Ro Dominatrix, <br />

Edited to reflect additions.  Lannella - that question is answered in the copy from the Rogue FAQ 2.12.1 where it says that backstab doesn't count.<br />

<br />
You neither need to have a piercer in your primary weapon slot when you apply the poison nor do you need one to make it go off. It does depend on the type of poison if it can be used with a slasher, though. BTW: If this does not work in full screen mode, don't blame me. I do use the &quot;old&quot; interface, not the full screen mode. Here I can also apply poison from any bag, not only from a main inventory slot. <br />

A: It depends on what inventory screen you are using.<br />
If you are using the pre-SoV inventory screen, yes.<br />
If you are using the SoV (full screen) inventory screen, no you have to apply from a main inventory slot.<br />

The answer, of course, is no.  I believe you are actually poisening the primary slot itself, and if it is empty upon apply poisen, you will apply the poisen to your hands.<br />

Suggested change of the answer of  Will VI be &quot;fixing&quot; poison soon? to &quot;Verant have hinted that there may be a major poison revamp; however, this is low priority and thus has no ETA.&quot;<br />

Add question:<br />
<br />
 There are all sorts of interesting new items on Luclin that look like they could be combined to make a poison!  Have any new recipies been found?<br />

At this time, there are no known new recipies using Make Poison introduced with Luclin, with the exception of a componant in a Vah Shir quest (Sonic Wolf Bane poison) which isn't a poison in the conventional sense anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Addendum to previous info:<br />
At level 25 you can raise your Make Poison skill to 130. An additional 20 attempts resulted in no skill raises. This suggests that the formula is level * 5 + 5.<br />
<br />
Supporting info:<br />
From skill 98 to 130 it took 110 attempts (average approx 1 skill raise per 3.4 attempts). Longest run without a skill raise was 8 attempts. Thus 20 extra attempts should be sufficient to show that 130 is the cap at level 25. Etrigan Y'Cronus <br />

<br />
Wood Elf rogues are called Scouts. (A &quot;nice&quot; name for rogue) Poison is considered an &quot;evil&quot; skill and not taught by the wood elf trainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemac Dushae</div><div class="date">08-10-02, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incorrect Ghost.<br />
<br />
FV doesn't train any of the higher level skills because they were originally placeholder trainers for Kunark.  As an overisght they weren't removed, nor made full blown trainers.<br />
<br />
This affects all non-iskar (since they can use Cabilis of course) characters looking to train in Kunark.  It has nothing to do with good/evil/naughty/nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Even without  any formal training - &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt; with the knowledge (recipe), components as well as a Mortar &amp;amp; Pestel can make the simple snake/spider type poisons.  <br />
The point here, only  after training merely 1pt at level 20, would you ever be able to &quot;improve&quot; your Making Skill beyond just the basic mixes because you are a Rogue!<br />
<br />
The key here is two fold - impress your fellow GROUP members with an occasional combine while medding up.  You should see the looks my gnomish enchanter gets handing out a fresh snake venom to the sneaky's.  His often disappointment is when the silly 18+ hadn't even bothered to train in Apply Poison yet!  <br />
Secondly, while it was mentioned that your success is somewhat hit or miss, your opportunity to USE Apply skill-ups at level 18th and 19th don't have to wait!  My Barwench was brewing her toxins at 15, 16 and 17 while her vault space was still sparsely used.     :Mumbles about stacking &amp;amp; charges.<br />
<br />
Non-Shamans can't make potions - the Medicine bag appears to have a skill check; however, the Gnomish Tinkering Box like the Mortar &amp;amp; Pestel can be used by &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;.  Of course those in the GKnow already have Fulcrum's Compendium booked marked.  <br />
<br />
Remember those party smirks - how about a halfling druidess who prefers to make her  own Fireworks.  <br />

<br />
The mortar and pestle recipes (including some poison ones) that I've seen non-poisoners report success on are:<br />
<br />
&amp;middot Metallic poisons subcomponants (eg White Lead) (Never Fail)<br />
&amp;middot Celestial Essence (Never Fail)<br />
&amp;middot Snake / Spider venoms (Never seen them fail, doesn't mean they can't though)<br />
&amp;middot Dye extracts (about 50% success I believe)<br />
&amp;middot I believe there are a couple of other recipes that involve crushing gems (never fail)<br />
<br />
Hence the comment about &quot;varying degrees of success&quot;!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Freeburn</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed that while using poisons there were no mentions of minimum lvl's required for apply poison skill in any of the recepies or posts. Ran across a problem trying to apply a tier IV and tier V poison while my skill in apply was in the 140's. At lvl 159 still did not work but at 161 I tried again and was now able to apply both tier IV and V. Not sure if 160 or 161 is the minimum. Just thought I would pass this on as I found it very frustrating that no one could answer this question for me when I posted it on every board I could find.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TibisHatter</div><div class="date">10-05-02, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been noticed before, but is usually overlooked.<br />
<br />
I don't think it has been fully determined whether it is level or apply poison skill that determines whether you're skilled enough to use a particular poison though.  Your information may well have helped pin it down a bit further though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crillan</div><div class="date">10-15-02, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can apply any poison once you get the apply skill, it doesn't matter what level you are or what poison it is.  If you fail to apply it just means your skill is really low and keep trying hehe.  As far as poisoning throwing weapons the weapon itself has to be labeled &quot;piercing&quot; and the range is about 45 for it to proc.  I've used long range piercers to try throwing to poison stuff but was too far away.  If you try throwing and find you're too far away it won't proc and if you get closer and try throwing another one it won't work anymore but if you turn attack on and stab then the poison will still proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gilgame Heart</div><div class="date">10-22-02, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you mentioned above that certain throwing weapons have piercing skill yet fit into the ranged slot where they can be thrown to trigger the poison since the effect take place on THE FIRST PIERCING WEAPON USED AFTER POISON IS INTRODUCED. this seems logical, but i have not yet seen many piercing weapons which also list they work in the ranged slot. about 5 months ago when i picked up a rusty dagger, mace, sword, it would be placed in the ranged slot if it was empty. im not sure you can still do this. i know for a fact that the rusty weapons didnt list they could fit in the ranged slot yet they did and i was ABLE TO THROW THEM. however when my rouge was in PC i looted a sullied dagger off a bandit and i couldent place it into the range slot. what gives? has the rule changed or does it just not work with never weapons like the sullied dagger? are rusty weapons still throwable? are regular? bronze? FS? if you know certain piercing weapons which are throwable for sure please list a few =). Thx in advance,<br />

Geez 500pp i just spent for a whole 2 points in making poisons (134 to 136) <br />
I'm better off just going to the guild trainer and paying him the pp and getting many more points from the same amount of pp. And yes i did have int. armor on along with int. buffs<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">11-13-02, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can certainly do that. Like most things in EQ, there is a range of possibilities. On one end you have &quot;High time/effort, low cost&quot;. On the other end is &quot;Expensive but easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Time is, after all, money. Therefore it should balance out.<br />
<br />
At the extreme end of &quot;High time/effort, low cost&quot; you can farm poison ingredients from greenies, farm skins, and make your own vials. This takes a lot of time but is very cheap.<br />
<br />
At the opposite end, you can take a big ol' pile of platinum, and go visit Stanos and use up practices. Quick, easy, but not cheap, especially over 200-ish.<br />
<br />
The balance comes where you stop and say &quot;If I do it the fast expensive way, can I then take that time and go earn money?&quot; You didn't really save time per se - you just used it differently to go make money and then spent the money.  Which choice is best for you depends on what you like doing, and how fast you can make money.<br />
<br />
I skilled up at the end with plat, and while it seems somehow cheesy, I don't regret it. Not like I didn't do plenty of combines at first. <br />

DEX affects your learning rate for Make Poison as much as INT/WIS do, and should be MUCH easier for you to raise. And if you get CHA over 122 or so, you get the best prices. <br />
<br />
For the last grind toward 250, I had dusted off a ton of old armor with DEX on it (Woven Shadow bracers, for instance) and was getting Focus of Spirit (or other DEX) and CHA from nearby shamen. When they ran out, I left FV and went to Dreads for refills. Materials were cheaper and I skilled faster, both resulting in less money spent per raise. 	Blusco Kickshaw-Stonefoot<br />

Maybe that has been done already, as you had to do that for a number of skills. Just make sure you did, then we can take it from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashii</div><div class="date">06-04-05, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This might be good to add into the FAQ under the question about activating poison from within a bag:<br />
<br />
Advanced (PoP) poisons may be activated using the Potion Belt window. This works extremely well with multi-dose versions, because it automagically adds up the total doses of that particular poison. <br />
<br />
In regards to the question of whether you can have multiple poisons active at one time, you might also add that you may have one old-school poison (Spirt of Sloth, etc.) and one Advanced (PoP) poison active at the same time, since Advanced poisons are active in the buff slot, while old-school poisons apply just to the next primary piercing non-backstab attack.</div></div><hr />
