<br />
is it an item that drops in the frontier of another realm that you can't sell?  is it an item with stats or a cash item?<br />
<br />
stuff in emain macha drops cash loot that is sellable in midgard, so it sounds like you may have one of the few items that is bugged to not sell, like rat tails used to be.  send in an appeal with the item name, and i bet it will make its way to a patch near you. Dither Disgustipated<br />

The spider silks drop off of spiders in Albion. I believe they are giant spiders which can be found in the Black Mountains.  When you click on the item to target it, you get a message similar to &quot;This item belongs to another realm.&quot;  I would suggest that you send in a bug report which includes the item name, what mob you got it off of, and what area you were in.  I did the same thing about two weeks ago.</div></div><hr />
