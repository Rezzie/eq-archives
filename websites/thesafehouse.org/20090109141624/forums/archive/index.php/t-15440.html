AND they dont have a [easy to find]reason why or a length of time they will be down.  It's like the original eq release all over!  Well, maybe I'll get an additional free month out of it, I hope this doesnt become a habit.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the release of CoH, I don't remember any problems.</div></div><hr />

After the 20 minutes of patching and going through the tutorial, I was playing on the Butcherblock Server (one of the only ones that was not already listed as FULL) and the server crashed after 15 minutes of play. (9:00 PM MST). I think SOE underestimated the need of servers. Hopefully they will be adding more real soon.<br />

Didn't get too involved in graphics yet, but what I did see I liked. It does seem a lot like DAOC compared to EQ1. I liked getting track right away. Good to hear that the JBoots are of no real value to a Scout before I /claim them.</div></div><hr />
