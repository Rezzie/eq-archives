<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Benadas</div><div class="date">04-20-00, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The day had started promising, I had gotten a brand new dagger and had reached level 5, so knowing that was the recommended starting level for Blackburrow I was on my way. Well after getting lost in Surefall Glades, which I had mistaken for Blackburrow(I'm new to the area so give me a break!), and zoning 4 times I finally found the entrance to the evil breeding ground that is Blackburrow. First thing I did of course was sneak around and looting any left behind corpses and ended up with 2 gnoll teeth and a large cloth cape, nothing new to me so I decided to venture further.<br />
  I couldn't help but notice that everyone around was getting beat and calling for help. Pff! Like I'm gonna help those that would just as soon spit on me! So I wondered around for treasure to plunder and then all the &quot;interesting&quot; things happened. I had just wondered into a gnoll den, giggling to myself about how everyone was oblivious to the fact that I was there and then one of the scrawny gnolls started screaming about how half elves shouldn't be here and so on, so  I did what every brave  rogue would do I started running for my life! I ended up boxed in a corner and then death came. Ironic that I called for help as I was knocked unconcious. <br />
     Returning to home point, LOADING,PLEASE WAIT..... So anyway after going from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills and almost getting taken out by gnoll scout, I was back to get my stuff. In and out that was the plan. &quot;Wanna group?&quot; asked Eron a cleric in there with me, it was rather unsettling that he could see me and how he stood calmy in a battlefield. &quot;Sure let me just get my stuff&quot; I responded. It's my weakness that I can never say no to joining a party. I quickly gathered my things and made my way to Eron.  We started chatting when the one thing you never wanna hear when in a dungeon was uttered. &quot;TRAIN!&quot; One long lag later and I stood all alone. Strange I didn't see any gnolls. So I turned to go find Eron and ended up finding where the train had gone. All the gnolls just stood there waiting to strike and finally Bristlebane smiled upon me and I was, for once, happily disconnected. <br />
   In conclusion I don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Colvin</div><div class="date">04-25-00, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same kind of experiences, I was taken there at level 4, basically just to look around.  After seeing the trains and all the stuff that could aggro on me, I decided I did not like this place.  I had to go deep in the bowels one time to retrieve a friends corpse(that was actually with my enchanter, was so scared invis was going to wear off; wouldn't have been scared with my rogue).  I went back a few times because that is where my friends like to fight, still a scary fight.  But, finally as a rogue of the 14th season, I ventured back into this scary place.  con green,con green,con green, aaahhh.  Elite guards, con blue, take em out solo, get off me.  I can now walk freely through this place, even breaking up trains when needed.  As for my 10 enchanter, thats still a problem, but he will be back one day to area mez the whole place.</div></div><hr />
