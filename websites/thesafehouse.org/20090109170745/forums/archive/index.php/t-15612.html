Now, I had assumed that meant that it was an effective weapon in whatever hand it listed.  But I picked went to swap out one of my secondary daggers with a different secondary dagger (double clicked it) and it went into the primary slot...so I had two dual wield secondary weapons equipped.  That confused me, am I reading that stat wrong?<br />
<br />
Also, you have to have two dual-wield weapons equipped to dual-wield yes?  You can't have like...one handed and then dual-wield secondary, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That first one sounds like a bug and I've never noticed a primary/secondary tag on weapons before. <br />
<br />
The second question is definitely no. both weapons must be dual weild to use. Currently I'm using the Freeport citizenship dagger and a tin dagger secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I just wanted to make sure.  I was fairly sure you had to have 2 dual wield weapons, but when that other thing happened...I wasn't sure.<br />
<br />
I just went to look to see what weapons I'm using.  (On eq2players).  It says I'm using: http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/item.vm?itemId=829 and http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/item.vm?itemId=2238 but the first is listed as One-Handed.  I was almost certain that was a dual wield primary weapon.  *shrug*  I'd not guess their site was wrong...maybe bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had similar expirience with l/r wrist slots. Seems like when I have a similar item it will only replace the similar item. When I try to swap a wrist item that it totally different in apperance and stats it is a no go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">during beta it always replaced the lower level of the two items for duel wield, bracelets, etc.<br />
<br />
So if you have a lvl 5 and a lvl 8 item equipped and loot a lvl 7, right clicking the lvl 7 would replace the lvl 5, regardless of which slot it was in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">11-17-04, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I logged in tonight to check and while on EQ's site it lists Blackened Rapier as being a one-hand weapon...it is actually Dual Wield (Primary)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannier</div><div class="date">11-18-04, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, primary means primary only, secondary means usable in primary or secondary.<br />
<br />
Presumably this is to allow them to make some nice dual weild weapons meant to be used only one to a person and you cannot put one in each hand and go to town.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've found vast amounts of errors in the weapon stats listed on the sites. I think much of that stuff was collected during early beta before final stats were set on the items.</div></div><hr />
