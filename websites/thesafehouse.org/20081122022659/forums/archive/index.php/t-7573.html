<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-26-01, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a bunch of posts which have been moved to the Recruiting Room. For good intentions, they were centered around recruiting for a guild. I suppose the moderators, though yes I think they equally deserved to be in here since it's PvP. Anyway do not sweat it they weren't deleted, you didn't commit any heinous crime. Check the Recruiting Room they are all safe and sound there. And yes hopefully people will check the threads out still. We have a few weeks maybe more, that ought to be enough time to round up people, and then the time in-game before guilds creation is allowed.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I am overstepping my bounds, mods/admins, but I posted that a post like this one would be made earlier and with more posts concerning the &quot;deleted&quot; threads I took the initiative. Delete this if you feel it should be.<br />

I think you're all just a bunch of meanies who like to delete posts because you have a personal hatred of the people making them. Just because posts with the same names, made by the same people, with the same contents are in different forums doesn't mean that you're not being icky bad people and deleting their posts.</div></div><hr />

I think the non-moderator populace with some backstabbing skills should sharpen their knives in self defense.<br />
