I'm also on Rodcet by the way. It was petitioned, /bug'ed, etc. The GM said he'd look into it to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. Since then, we've done him twice with no issues at all.<br />
<br />
On a semi-related note, some time after that, we killed Rhags 1 and 2 in Ssra only to have AL not show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if it's actually tied to Rallos though, because we've done VZ and had him de-pop as stated when nobody has been in the zone but us, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 2 months ago, we went to do VZ, and while we were moving up to him, another guild moved in on RZ.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Analia of Innoruuk</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what happens is when you get a real vallon to 60% there is 1 tick or 6 seconds before the next wave spawns.<br />
<br />
If your guild is high on DPS and you kill him before the next wave actually spawns the script will bug out.<br />
<br />
If your guild is having trouble with bugged out scripts, try getting the real vallon to under 60% then backing off for 6-10 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sebbi Fyrewalker</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip Analia, I was with Flee when it bugged out on us but hopefully that'll help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that this has something to do with both VZ and RZ being engaged at the same time. <br />
<br />
Why? Becuase we have done VZ twice since the time it stopped on us, and both times we had lots more DPS than we had the night the script stopped, and it completed both times, but nobody was killing RZ either of the last two times either.<br />
<br />
We have very high DPS. Sometimes its hard to find the right VZ and actually get into position and get attack turned on before its dead. Nearly all of our rogues have Ifirs now, and I would say that the majority of our melee have elemental weapons. Our casters have all of their spells. A typical raid force for us anymore is 70-75 people. Last time we did RZ, I think we had 6 adds. He went down very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Flee101</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may also be the zone lag caused by the extra people in zone for RZ slows down the script.  Similar to zone lag delaying AE's and melee from mobs, it could slow down the trigger check for the next wave.  With high dps and lag, VZ may be dead before the trigger check is able to check VZ's health and trigger the next wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ghalid Soulsaver</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has nothing to do with Rallos and Vallon being engaged at the same time.  Guild on my server did him and had him poof and Rallos wasn't even up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_lb12345</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It also seems to happen if ANY of VZ's &quot;images&quot; are touching ANY wall when they die. Its almost a surefire way to have the PP not spawn. I've witnessed the event a few times and the one time I saw it succeed was when they werent touching any walls. A friend confirmed this for me in Tribunal server also (I am from Karana).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that this has something to do with both VZ and TZ being engaged at the same time.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the typo in the earlier post.<br />
<br />
I do not believe RZ has anything to do with this bug. Edited by: Bigmeeno at: 10/22/03 6:57 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's happened twice to us before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have never done VZ while RZ was engaged. So no, the only time the script has failed for us was when someone else was killing the real TZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karadin</div><div class="date">10-23-03, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were the only guild in the zone, RZ wasn't up, nor was TZ.  Killed the first wave, and second wave never spawned.  This happened Sunday, Oct 19.  I don't think it has anything to do with RZ script, as other guilds have killed him, both with and without incident, while we were doing the RZ script in the past.  <br />
<br />
It might be the server lag spawn issue such as one sees when 200 people are in Ssra and the L 3 Imperial Guards take an hour or more to respawn (fairly common phenomenon on our server on patch day).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Defy Logic</div><div class="date">11-05-03, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done the event numerous times and have come to find that the event getting bugged has something to do with having copies of VZ still at their spawn points for the next wave.  As a monk, I've tried several methods of splitting/pulling the event from tagging a corner &amp;amp; just trying to get 2-3 at a time to playing with their leashes &amp;amp; FD to split them to singles or doubles.  Most of these splitting tactics is what leads to the bugging of the event.  <br />
<br />
The surefire way that has never failed me with this event is to set up 5 tanks with dedicated healers &amp;amp; have 1 target person to get a different target for each tank then just pull all 5 of them at the same time.  Its easy to pick out which VZ of the 5 is the real one once you know what to look for.  Just make sure you have a couple monks on DP duty making sure they're all pushed into the corner well &amp;amp; the MA will assist off the other tanks that know their mob is a fake.  Even if you dont know how to pick out the real VZ quickly it doesnt really matter if the next wave pops as long as there are no other fakes at their spawns &amp;amp; they're all being killed off in the corner.  Just have the raid in the left corner if you were facing VZ's balcony as there is no repop there &amp;amp; it will give you plenty of room to kill the fakes without aggroing an early wave.  Some fakes are mezzable some are not, the partially slowable ones are mezzable, fully slowable ones are Non-Mezzable.  If your raid is in sync &amp;amp; arent mindless lemmings you can get a couple mezzes down, if not just keep all 5 tanked &amp;amp; dps them down, they dont have very much HP anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eelyen</div><div class="date">11-05-03, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild did him a few days ago to finish our reflagging.  RZ was up and wasn't touched.  But there was 122 people in zone (We had a full raid of apps/twinks) and some other guild had a small number of people in the zone.  The RZ script was untouched and he despawned on the 2nd wave.<br />
<br />
It's more then just 2 scripts at once...there is something else wrong.</div></div><hr />
