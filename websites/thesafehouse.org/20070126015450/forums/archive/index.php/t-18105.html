<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bahamut1</div><div class="date">03-31-05, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a little help with this Heritage quest:<br />
<br />
To start this quest, you have to kill the Lightbringer Wisp in the Commonlands. He spawns near the druid ring just SE of the Nektulos zone. There is only one druid ring in Commonlands. He is a mid-teens mob with no guards but ^^.<br />
<br />
After examining the stone, you will be instructed to show it to someone. Cannix is a NPC standing at a tree just NW of the Crossroads. He tells you to go to a couple spots in Commonlands to power up the stone. Both spots are fallen stone statues lying on the ground. They will be clickable and glow at mouse-over now. One spot is just East of the Ruins of Val'Marr. The other is South of the Freeport Station.<br />
<br />
Go back to Cannix after clicking the stones and then he will tell you to kill Ramanai. He's a large lion with about 3-4 guards. Mid teens ^^ mob and the guards are mid-teens. He spawns in the same area as the Lightbringer Wisp. In fact, their wandering paths cross. I got lucky and after a server reboot, they were both up at the same time and I got the wisp and Ramanai within 15 minutes of each other. Others claim it takes hours and hours to find one or the other. Currently there is no information, that I know of, of placeholders or spawn cycle. I know though that they can spawn at the same time. I was looking at Ramanai while fighting the Wisp thinking I'm coming back for you...<br />
<br />
Now go back to Cannix, and he will want you to kill a couple of orc captains. SIDE NOTE: If you have not done the Bloodskull Valley quest, start it NOW. To start this quest, go to the wounded scout near Ruins of Val'Marr and talk to him. He will also ask you to kill some orc leaders.<br />
<br />
There is a secret to the orcs. Not much of a secret really, but the orc leaders are thus - Glan Mostyn, Commander Du'Nar, Commander Grik'Sna, Lieutenant Vrah'Kna, Captian Ogof, Captain Gaer, and General Vaul'Taug. Now these guys are each other's ph. ONLY ONE of these guys will be up at any given time. When you kill one of these guys, one of the others will randomly spawn within a minute or so. Glan is a wanderer and will spawn near the ruined towers, he's alone, no guards, high teen ^^. Du'Nar spawns WAY west of the ruined towers and wanders with a few guards. He's 20th ^^ with high teen guards. Grik'Sna spawns just East of the East tower and same level and guards as Du'Nar. Lieutenant spawns inside the West tower and is alone around 20th ^^. The Captians spawn in the middle of the towers and also have guards. They are both around 20th ^^. The general spawns at the top of the East tower. He has no guards with him, but there are two elite guards upstairs by him, if they are grey, they will not attack when you attack the general. He is low twenties ^^.<br />
<br />
After wiping out the orc leaders for a while, go back to Cannix and now he'll send you to kill the High Priest. Going back to Ruins of Val'Marr, go south till you see a clickable tree. The clickable starts an unrelated quest. There also is supposedly another spawn spot within sight just NW of this location. I couldn't confirm it. Near this tree there is a pile of debris that works like the normal spawns. It spawns four groups of undead crusaders/disciples. When you kill all four groups, the BIG GUY will spawn. This guy will either be a diplomat with guards, or the High Priest. Keep killing this spawn cycle till you get the High Priest. He's low 20's ^^ mob with guards.<br />
<br />
Go back to Cannix. Now you're Bloodskull Valley quest pays off. You get to go there, AND TAKE a GOOD GROUP, i'm not even kidding. We had a group of high twenties and all the mobs were grey. We did it incorrectly, and we almost died, BUT it was the most incredible fight I've ever experienced. My heart was pounding.<br />
<br />
As soon as you zone in, there will be a lookout standing there. He will immediately turn tail and run, KILL HIM FAST. If he gets away, get ready for a REALLY big fight. Just beyond him there are 5 groups of orcs about 4-5 orcs per group. It is possible, if you killed the lookout, to pull each group individually. There will be about 4 waves of 5 groups of orcs, and it's almost non-stop fighting from then on. If anyone is alive at the end of this, then you've finished it, General Drull will spawn on the last wave. All the orcs are low 20's and the General is ^^^. If you get the lookout and have a good healer, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
Go back to Cannix and the ending is different depending on your alliance. If you are good, he will say, &quot;I'm not giving it to you&quot;, but then thugs appear and kill him and take the stone, just kill them, and take the stone yourself. If you are evil, he will say, &quot;Here you go...&quot;, but then thugs appear and kill him and take the stone, again, kill them, and take the stone yourself. The thugs are Lucan Executioner ^^ and 2 thugs. After the BSV instance, this will be a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
One of the best quests I've ever done, really fun and exciting in some parts. I think some of the camping is repetitive, but if you get lucky you could do it in a couple days easy.</div></div><hr />

(standard solo level 19, should be trivial to kill.)<br />
<br />
on a side note, if click on the stone to be a household item, can you change it back into armor?</div></div><hr />

I tried this with the Dwarven Work Boots and it works fine. You can remove the &quot;mounting&quot; after turning it into a housel trophy. You can also repurchase the original reward if you have done the quest from the Shady Swashbuckler.</div></div><hr />
