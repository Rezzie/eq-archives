Not completely safe for faction overts, A rebel got cocky and buzzed a Imp.. the imp shot him off and db'd him heh, funny even if I'm a rebel. <br />
Of course there are the bugs..Like the cloning of your vehicle, that you can't store so... this happens..<br />
Kinda laggy<br />
<br />
Bio- Engineer can actually make large changes to a creatures stats, not just clones of wild ones.. Like a womprat with dewback like stats. They also have atleast double the amount of skins to use now.<br />
<br />
Anyway..<br />

December 16, 2003 Update Notes:<br />
<br />
Major Publish Features: <br />
<br />
Vehicles: Vehicles are now available to players. The first three vehicles will be the Speeder Bike (RoTJ), Swoop Bike (AoTC) and the X34 Landspeeder (ANH). Advanced Vehicle Guide <br />
<br />
Player Cities: The number of Player Cities has currently been doubled, making the caps to 20 for all planets that are currently 10 and 50 for all planets that are currently at 25. The new limits are as follows (The first number is the total cap. The second is how many can be rank 3 or above. The third is how many can grow to rank 4 or above.): <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Corellia: 20, 15, 10 <br />
Dantooine: 50, 30, 20 <br />
Lok: 50, 30, 20 <br />

Content: <br />
The Nightsister cave has been added to the game world. <br />
Added various heralds throughout the world to lead players to dungeons. <br />
There will now be a chance for boss type creatures to spawn from mission targets. <br />
<br />
Creature Balance: All creatures in the game have been balanced under one unifying scheme. <br />
<br />
Creature Handler: The creature handler profession has been re-organized. Among the many changes are: The &quot;control level&quot; skillmod has been removed. You can call any pet up to the limit of your additional pets skillmod, but no more levels at one time than your &quot;tame level&quot; skillmod. The tame level skillmod also determines the maximum level pet you can call or tame. The Tame Level skillmod has been redistributed throughout the tree, so only master creature handlers can call the highest level pets. The Transfer command has moved to the Master Creature Handler skillbox. The &quot;train as mount&quot; ability has moved to Management IV. See below for further details. <br />
<br />
Creature Trade-In Program: With the Creature Handler changes that are going into effect, players with pets from levels 10-15 will no long be usable, there will be a pet trade-in program. Player get attached to their pets, players will be able to visit Creature Handler NPC?s and get a device to drag to the datapad. The device will transform their pets, carrying over it?s name and commands to the new pet. The new pet will be of the same type, but of the correct level. Your favorite pet will stay your favorite pet   <br />
<br />
GUI: <br />
Added waypoints to places of interests (POI?s). For example missions, bunkers, caves, and exploration areas. <br />
Add a &quot;Points of Interest&quot; tab. This tab holds a list of waypoints to interesting places on the current planet. <br />
<br />
Jedi <br />
Jedi now get a TEF for equipping a saber when in combat. <br />
They also get a TEF when entering combat with a saber equipped.</div></div><hr />

Played with the speeder bike.  Pretty cool.  haven't seen the bugged cloning yet.  Pretty damn nice though.  Especially wandering into a city and seeing a few vehicles parked here and there.  Added a lot to the feel.<br />

I strive to improve my living conditions by hoarding gold, food, and sometimes keys and potions. I love adventure, fighting, and particularly winning - especially when there's a prize at stake. I occasionally get lost inside buildings and can't find the exit. I need food badly. &amp;lt;A HREF=&quot;http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl&quot;&gt;What Video Game Character Are You?&amp;lt;/A&gt;<br />
