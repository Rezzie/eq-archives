Priest is now a healer rather than cleric/enchanter hybrid.  Enchanter component given to Mage.  I dislike it,  I liked the extra responsibilities given to each class.  <br />
 <br />
The rest state.. well i'm not in beta so I can't say what it'd be like to actually play under it.  But it sounds flakey to me.  If I start off with a 200% bonus, then that 200% bonus is what is normal to me.  so when my 300xp mob turns into a 100xp mob I'll be quite pissed.  It's a big flaw in DAoC, and it'll stink if it doesn't change in WoW.  No one is satisfied in a group if you're not maxing out the group bonus+camp bonus in DAoC.   <br />
 <br />
I haven't heard a thing about druids or the other class that was added.  Perhaps there should have been an NDA, just to keep the mystery around the game up until an open beta.<br />
<br />
*that now used to be a not.  typo!</div></div><hr />

What makes the responsibilites &quot;extra&quot;? To whose game are you comparing? EQ? DnD? If your box is EQ, then you really need to get out of it. EQ2 won't even have the same class boundaries as EQ, why should a game made by another company set in a different game world?</div></div><hr />

Hey, i'm not in EQ.  Used to be, but not anymore.  I'm waiting for the next big thing.  Maybe phase3 can salvage what was borked in phase2.</div></div><hr />

Rest assured that Priests are much more than EQ Clerics.  They have more to do than sit in a CH chain.  They simply aren't CC any longer.  For what it's worth, Mages are pretty much too powerful now that they have sleep, so expect that to change eventually.</div></div><hr />

Unless they change it, it breaks too many elements of the game's boundaries.<br />
<br />
I'd be just as content to see it go, completely.</div></div><hr />
