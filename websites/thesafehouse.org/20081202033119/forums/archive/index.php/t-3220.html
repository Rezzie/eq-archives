<br />
My new computer still hasnt arrived, so I'm still devouring everything in the manual till I can play, but I'm thinking 14 Wizard/6 Rogue for my first char to aspire to. Something like 2/1, 2/6, 14/6 for progression. If you dont understand that, dont worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-01-02, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">20 rogue.  Duh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">07-01-02, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I'd bother with the 6 in rogue.<br />
20 wizard would be a lot better IMO.  You get level 9 spells, and if you go pixie familiar, you get a pretty darn good rogue familiar.  And since you'd only be a 6 rogue, your melee would be seriously lacking anyways. &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />

Ranger adds a bit of punch and the bard can do almost everything else. bit of magic, bit of healing. Given you are such a small party (1-3 depending on Henchthing and familiar status), the jack of all trades bard is surprisingly effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not needed any other henchman other than Tomi, the rogue.  Along with Tomi, I summon a Skeleton Warrior/Chieftan and the 3 of us rock!!<br />
<br />
Dire Spider was cool for the poisoning, but Dire Bear is just a pain in the ass!  He's just too big and dumb.  Get's in mine and Tomi's way too much, so I stay with Animating the Skeletal Warrior/Chieftan/Knight.<br />

<br />
the lvl 1 ranger thing gave me ambidex and duel wield for free<br />
but probably wasnt needed  <br />
<br />
I cant come up with another class i enjoyed as much as my first one though, ive tried barbarians fighers clerics mages, so far nothing beats the versitily of rogues in this game.  <br />
<br />
My guy was able to tank dragons while his henchman (them monk) whiddled away from behind.  I just dont see how you can beat improved evasion, I almost never got hit by magic, breathweapons or anything else after getting that feat.<br />
<br />
Another nice combo i discovered was Rod of the Ghost (casts etheral vistage 10/3 dmg absorbtion) and Greater belt of the swordsman ( 20/- slash dmg absorbtion)  using those in combination i was almost invicible for the duration of the spell seeing as id wager 70% of the attacks made on you by NPCs are slash attacks and those are rarely for over 30 dmg</div></div><hr />

Talk about an ass kicker.  I have 110+ hitpoints (silly how they do max hitpoints) and a huge +str.  I use two-weapon fighting all the time with my Scimitar (made in act I) and my short sword (also made in act I).  The short sword &quot;procs&quot; daze, which allow me to sneak attack like mad.  Usually on both attacks that round then it wears off.  Another great part to my arsenal is having the bard lady with me who almost always casts haste.<br />
<br />
I can take the hits and dish them out.  Try taking 5 invisible stalkers on all at once with only 3 cure serious potions =)<br />

7 Fighter 7 Rogue 1 Ranger Halfling (he hates spiders more than anything in the world, hence the ranger for racial enemy)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Syllestrae FV</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm playing in one of the custom built worlds online (server character only).  <br />
<br />
Have a pure cleric, and finding it gets along really well.  With extend spell feat, you can buff yourself with 1d4+1 to any stat except DEX (including dex if you pick a domain that gives cat's grace as bonus spell), and the buffs won't wear off until after your rest timer resets.<br />
<br />
I chose Sun &amp;amp; Healing domains, so I'm pretty much an undead fighter.  With 16-19 Cha (base 14) I don't have much trouble turning, and I can destroy huge swaths of zombies and such    Extra turning means I can turn until the cows come home.<br />
<br />
Healing domain makes all your healing spells act as if empowered (they heal 150% normal), which really helps out in group play.  For some reason I have higher AC than most warriors I group with, so it helps to be able to cure 20 HP damage with one cure light when they go chargin off and get themselves all beat up.<br />
<br />
The pets thing is kind of insane.  I dunno why they changed the duration from 1 rnd / level to 24 hours, there was absolutely no need to do that.  It gets even worse when you start buffing the pet (adding Str / dex / con).<br />
<br />
I think there's a lot of little changes they made to &quot;help&quot; certain classes &quot;get by&quot;, that instead broke the class to some degree.<br />
<br />
When you're out of combat, you always take 20, which means if you drop 1 point in unlock or disable trap n such you can remove most traps / locks aimed at low level rogues.  Taking 20's always been available, was just supposed to take longer than 5 RL seconds  <br />
