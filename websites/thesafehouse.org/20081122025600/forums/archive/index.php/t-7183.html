<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FeroceFV</div><div class="date">02-27-03, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, all you rogues out there.  Please excuse the shameless plug.  I'm a bard on the Firiona Vie server, and I wanted to invite you all to try out a little experiment a bunch of us from the EQDiva boards have started. <br />
<br />
A while back, one of us suggested that some of us get together on a server and play in all-bard groups.  This seemed like a pretty cool idea to us, so after some discussion, we created Molto Expressivo.<br />
<br />
Molto Expressivo is a team-oriented all-bard guild on the Firiona Vie server. All members have an Italian musical term as their name. Bards are the most versatile class in the game, and with our ability to fill any role in a group, we have found that we can fight very effectively grouped with only bards. The possibilities and challenges of all-bard groups makes for loads of fun.<br />
<br />
We've had to come up with different ways of taking down mobs.  One trick we do is, rather than having one person tank, we share the aggro around the group, and our regeneration song is enough to keep everyone healthy.  We also do group AE using some of our DoTs.  Down the road, we're looking at doing more intricate AE fights, when we get slows, fear kiting, group kiting, and a whole group using charmed mobs to take down our opponents very quickly.  The versatility of our class has spawned a lot of neat ideas that we'd love to try out in groups and raids.  However, if we're going to make our dream of all-bard groups and raids a reality, we'll need some more people.  At present, we have over 30 members, we're growing steadily, and we'd like to bring in more.<br />
<br />
In Molto Expressivo, we fight together and level together. We have set goals for levelling each week, and we help each other to get to the weekly level goal. Most of us are alternate characters, so having a level limit isn't really all that constricting.  For those of us that play more, there are trade skills, quests, farming, raids, and PLing our newbies up to our level to keep them busy.<br />
<br />
Right now, our target level range is between 26 and 40.  Catching up with us will be easy, if you want to try us out.  The bard is one of the most effective soloing classes in the game, and we love helping to outfit and level our new recruits. We got one of our newbies from level 2 to level 7 the other day with belt turn-ins alone, and I regularly make banded suits for our newbies.  Of course, we'll expect you to put forward some effort to catch up, but for an experienced player, the early levels are quite easy, and we bards have our own, very effective way of power levelling people. Playing a bard is pretty easy at the lower levels, but as you get more experience, it gets trickier.  You'll have plenty of experienced company with you in the guild to talk you through song twisting, fear kiting, chant kiting, charm kiting, and even swarm kiting, so if the class seems a bit tough, don't worry.<br />
<br />
The Firiona Vie server is a PvE server with a twist. There are almost no NO-DROP items in the game, making many quests and items much more readily available without excessive camping times. Additionally, there is a trivial loot code that prevents high levelled people from farming valuable magic and lore items off of content designed for lower-levelled players. The server is one of the youngest in the game, and does not suffer much of the overcrowding that plagues other servers. As you might imagin, this makes for a unique and more dynamic economy, as players of all levels can acquire and sell items to players of both lower and higher levels. Most of the players on Firiona Vie are experienced players, and the role-playing friendly atmosphere is pretty neat. There is no common tongue on FV, but learning new languages is pretty easy, and you can find teachers in our guild without much trouble.<br />
<br />
If you want to know more, join the molto channel and chat with our members, or check out our forum on the EQDiva message boards:<br />
pub142.ezboard.com/feqdiv...questfrm83<br />
Or take a look at our new website:<br />
213.133.103.14/~molto/<br />
<br />
If you're wanting to have a change of pace from your main character, give Molto Expressivo a try. Just follow the following steps.<br />
<br />
1. Create a bard on the Firiona Vie server. <br />
<br />
2. Select an Italian musical term for a name. See the link below for some italian musical terms:<br />
www.pianoinstructors.com/.../term.html<br />
<br />
3. Choose whatever race you want. Bards can be Human, Half-Elf, Wood Elf, or Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
4. Choose whatever religion you want. Agnostic, Rallos Zek, and Veeshan are the most popular choices to date. <br />
<br />
5. Assign your stat points any way you want to. Most melee-oriented bards put all their points into stamina. Crowd controlling bards prefer to put their points into charisma and dexterity. All-Around bards tend to break up their starting points between strength, dexterity, charisma, agility, intelligence, and stamina. <br />
<br />
6. When you enter Norrath, join molto, our chat channel, and say hello!<br />
<br />
7. Type /who all molto and say hello to the guild members.<br />
<br />
8. Put your character in the registry found in our forum, register with Guildmagic and Magelo.<br />
<br />
If there aren't many people around, we have our peak times on Thursday afternoons and on weekends during the day. As we get more members, this will change. We are still relatively new, and most of our members are alternate characters.<br />
<br />
Come hop on the bardwagon! We are all relatively low-level at this point, so catching up will be pretty simple. The sooner we play together, the better we will play together.  It's a nice change of pace for people with bards or rogues as their mains.  <br />
<br />
I hope to see some of you soon.<br />
<br />

I was an enchanter, and there was a shaman. Rogues didnt drop the mob as fast as you think they would. More like a typical group. Rogues werent epiced but had bloodpts, parana dagger, and rabid (jakodie fang?) Excuse my memory. But It felt more like a normal damaging group. In theory it sounds great, but i didnt experience any greatness. Oh well just thought id tell you all my experience. <br />
<br />
I do think rogues need to be fixed up, their regular fast attacks (mediocre damage) just doesnt cut it, And duels were mopped up a lot of the time. I play sullon on good team, I do fair fine against melees and perhaps casters if i can avoid a root or snare. But hybrids devour me, and yes i use poisons and clickies like i was Bill Gates.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you guys, but I dont step onto enemy territory without at least one parnter. Even lowbie zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FeroceFV</div><div class="date">02-27-03, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, thanks for the nice responses.  The reasons I'm posting are two-fold.  First, we would like to recruit people now, rather than later, because our level range is pretty easy to get to quickly now; this is a shameless plug thread.    The second is that there are loads of good players who don't go to the EQDiva boards, and we are interested in recruiting people regardless of what they play as their main.<br />
<br />
In response to how all-bard groups work, it really depends on the level of the group and their experience working together.  We are interested in finding new ways to take down mobs.  With all the stuff bards can do, we will have plenty of experimenting to do.  A few of our ideas:<br />
<br />
AE group damage.  While we can't nuke, one of our DoTs stacks up.  With everyone twisting that song in, meleeing, and singing every stackable buff we can sing, we have found a good way for us to take down mobs.<br />
<br />
Group Kiting.  Between our DoTs and our DDs, we will be able to do some reasonable damage at distance.  This will become more viable as we get more DoTs, as our ranged DoTs don't stack.<br />
<br />
Group Fear Kiting.  Two people handle the fearing and snaring, all the others focus on damage, with our dots and baby nukes.<br />
<br />
Group Charm Kiting.  Five people charm mobs, one coordinates and snares the target mob.  We haven't gotten high enough to try this yet, but the idea has some merit.<br />
<br />
Group Chain Runing: By off-setting our casting of rune, we will be able to absorb a lot of damage.  This, combined with our regen, could allow us to go toe-to-toe with some pretty tough mobs.<br />
<br />
Crazy Crowd Control.  Having a group of 6 people who can mez allows for some pretty wicked camp breaking ability, especially in tight situations.  It could also make us valuable to other guild's raids.<br />
<br />
Combinations of the above techniques.<br />
<br />
Other ideas... There are a lot of nifty tricks we can pull that we haven't thought through much.  We welcome new ideas, and new people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are looking for experienced players from any class who are looking to try something DIFFERENT.  Most of us are experienced Bards from other servers, so you would learn your Bardic talents from some good players.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we are having a blast.  No, we will probably never be uber, but that's not what it's about.  We all have our mains for traditional EQ play.<br />

Thus far, we have effectively done AE, single target burns, and demonstrated our ability to handle lots of adds.  With charm, a whole new world of possibilities opens up.  There's still good opportunities to join!  We can help you catch up quickly with belt and bone chips quests, some mild twinkage (banded and grimling mining picks), and the majority of our characters are a ways from this week's level goal.  If you're at all interested, give us a try.<br />

<br />
Heh.  Not in the least.  <br />
<br />
I am a member of Molto Espressivo.  I tell you that it is a great way to get a little variety into my week.  I play 1 or 2 days a week with Molto Espressivo, for a few hours at a session.  There is an energy to it that isn't typically there to my main's play.  This fits well, the name of the guild means playing music &quot;With Feeling&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I enjoy my main, but there is a creativity of play, and a mindset of supporting one another in Molto Espressivo that is very refreshing.  Thinking in that creative way occassionally is impacting my play on my main as well.  I am better for it.<br />
<br />
As to the viability of all-bard grouping... <br />
<br />
It can't be done in the typical chanter/cleric/warrior paradigm and succeed for too long.  <br />
<br />
It can be done however.   Just needs a new paradigm.  We have experimented with some things that didn't work, and we have had great successes as well.  We keep experimenting and are eagerly anticipating some future experiments.  <br />
<br />
So c'mon outside the box with us if you are so inclined.  Its great out here.  If you still think its a RSI, that's cool.  We will just have to have our fun without you.  <br />

<br />
Our level range system and overall strategy have evolved somewhat.  our target grouping range is that of a level 30 player; that is, from 20 to 45.  Long term, we're looking to get everyone to 51, and then consolidate, do AA's, and do some raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all relative. Im a 65 bard with &gt;200aa and 3 years played and lemme fuggin tell you, my fingers have been physically deformed by the bard class. I'm not joking. If I could do it over I wouldn't make a bard. RSI is a huge problem, it's cumulative, and it will get you too if you play too much. In fact I wouldn't recommend the bard class to a addict/fulltime player. At concert hall I always here people talking about RSI and ways to minimize it....</div></div><hr />
