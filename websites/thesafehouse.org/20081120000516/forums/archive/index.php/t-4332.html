So far... she's much like Fricka but her name's different and she's much shorter (those in beta look up Fala a -gasp- gnome rogue).<br />
<br />
I'm finding combat to be pretty much the same but I haven't gotten duel wield yet (should get it tonight). The new skill system threw me for a loop since one has to spend skill points to raise attributes like agility now. Also you gain a skill point per every 600 xp gained from killing mobs now so potentially you can have more than before... yet trade and class skills cost more now.<br />
<br />
More later, I gotta go play a little  <br />
<br />
P.S. All Alliance rogues (and try to join too if you are Horde, I'm curious to see if it works)  /join rogue for some roguely banter   <br />

How long does it take you to get fatigued on your rogue character ?<br />
<br />
Or are you playing til you lose well rested then logging to an alt for 8 hours ? ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
can test that by playing down to normal rest, and seeing SP gains Tikker Gimblestan<br />

But since nobody in the Undead area ever groups and it's all solo questing from 1 to 15 mostly, I don't end up getting a whole lot from kills.  Tradeskills aren't too expensive at the first level, but OMG they waste skill points to increase your caps and get Leather II, Leather III or whatever.  Like 50sp and 50 skill points for Leather II.
