<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise Manasponge</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moving them to the warder area must be new then because Last year I farmed my faction and never got one, they are no drop and we would have noticed since the symbols alone were enough to annoy the hell out of us.<br />
<br />
This year when I redid my faction (don't ask) They were almost more common then whips.<br />
<br />
I'd assume that the iksar chars complained so they made them more plentiful?</div></div><hr />

Previously they were only found in Nurga.  There was a change a while ago that put the Overseer and the stonechanters there though.</div></div><hr />
