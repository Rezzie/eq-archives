<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">04-15-06, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Gloves and gauntlets no longer show up on characters' heads when equipped. They now show up on torsos. We're getting close on this one, folks. Thanks for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
- Laeric The Wise's Test Of Brainpower to gain access to his tower has been revised. All of his questions dealing with the female anatomy have been removed due to players having a 0% success rate.<br />
<br />
- Added the feat &quot;Improved Continence&quot;. Once used, adventurers will no longer wet themselves in dungeons if they haven't stopped at a camp or town in more than an hour. Feat is only available for dwarves.<br />
<br />
- Players should no longer receive falling damage when sitting down.<br />
<br />
    - The Vault of Night is now available to explore, the dangerous &quot;Dragon's Vault&quot; this patch is named after in which you'll come face to face with an incredible beast. What kind of beast? It's a surprise!<br />
<br />
    - Kobolds now have 39 teeth instead of 40. We apologize to all the players who wrote in to complain about this inaccuracy.<br />
<br />
- That whole AC system for armor with those + symbols and THAC0 and saving throws was overly complicated. Every weapon will always hit on every swing for 10 damage now, leaving players to dress their characters up how they want without stressing over armor values and attack ratings.<br />
<br />
- Adjusted the pitch and yaw on the F-16.<br />
<br />
- For added security against hackers and password stealers, players can only complete the login process once they've rolled a d20.<br />
<br />
- The &quot;Astronaut&quot; class is now available. There was resistance at first, but once it was explained that they fit into D&amp;D lore because the astronauts appeared through a wormhole, everyone was on board. Class is only available for dwarves.<br />
<br />
- Talking to party members will no longer set them as enemies and automatically place you in combat with them. It now works as an AOE fear effect, causing them to run away from you for ten seconds.<br />
<br />
- Removed subliminal Satanic messages urging players to murder their parents. We apologize for any trouble this might have caused.<br />
<br />
- Upon entering combat, players will now hear the pulse-pounding hard rock stylings of &quot;Here Comes The Boom&quot; by P.O.D. Upon exiting combat, the song will start again.<br />
<br />
- Due to high demand, every building in the game will now have a fully furnished basement for players to meet up and rest in.<br />
<br />
- Each time your character casts Magic Missile, he or she will call out the ancient power word &quot;Hadoken&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Dungeons were too dark and depressing. To lighten things up, throw pillows have been strategically placed at particularly dreary locales.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else miss this, I just managed to catch it, I like the Hadoken, heh.</div></div><hr />
