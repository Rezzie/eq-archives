<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monte Cook, one of the authors of D&amp;amp;D 3.0 and author of many other books (including the upcoming Arcana Unearthed), has spoken out on the revised editions.  Keeping in mind that not only has he a competing project (Unearthed Arcana, an 'alternate' player's handbook), but also an attachment to the rules that he penned just 2 years ago, it's an interesting read.<br />

edit Arcana Unearthed, Unearthed Arcana...what's the dif?   Edited by: Llabak Tharr at: 7/14/03 12:04 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">really liked his review, I think I agree on pretty much everything he says. I particularly hate how they've turned it into such a miniatures-required game. <br />
<br />
when my friends want to play d&amp;amp;d this christmas when we all get together, I'm seriously going to try and convince them to play Arcana Unearthed (not unearthed arcana, that's an upcoming wizards product :P) instead of 3.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Miniatures suck, period.  If you like them fine, but they should not be required to play.  As he mentioned, I think I would have to house rule back to 3.0 the weapon system and the &quot;squares&quot; vs movement.  Of course, until I sit down and read (and eventually find a gaming group in this area   , I will not really know what the good, bad, and ugly happens to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Miniatures has grown on me quite a bit.  I played my first game of D&amp;amp;D back in oh, 1981 or so, and when you're 8 years old you don't have the cash to blow on minis so we just kinda kept track of things in our heads.  We never really worried about any facing or placement or whatever.  We just slugged it out with the baddies until they were all dead!  RAR!<br />
<br />
I just started playing again last fall after a many year hiatus, and 3.0's rules really are geared towards using miniatures.  Rules on AOOs and flanking are pretty much designed with minis in mind - someone has to be keeping track of who is where - and many feats/abilities require knowing exactly where someone is relative to the baddies.  <br />
<br />
The thing that I find relatively noxious is the line of minis that they're releasing in conjunction with the new rules.  They're debuting a new &quot;campaign&quot; run through the RPGA at gencon, and guess what?  If you shell out the cash for certain minis you get in-game benefits.  Oh, and they've disallowed online play for the new campaign as well - I guess people who play online won't buy their super bonus Lidda the Halfling mini.  Or something.<br />
<br />
D&amp;amp;D the Gathering?  No thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Telurinon</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like miniatures quite a bit.  My current D&amp;amp;D game doesn't use them, though, so it's not that big of an issue for me.<br />
<br />
The changes to the weapon system just sound like crap and the changing of the duration of stat improvement spells to 1 min/level instead of 1 hour/level just plain sucks.<br />
<br />
I doubt I will buy the books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love miniatures ... painting them at least    Can be helpful to have them 'simulate' the battles in game as well.  But the new D&amp;amp;D mini's are AWFUL.  They're pre-painted plastic garbage and they're making 'em collectible.  You buy a starter and boosters with random rare, uncommon, and common minis.  Bleh.<br />
<br />
Just not a good idea when you can get excellent metal minis from Reaper Miniatures for cheap (not to mention the ones you actually WANT) or just buy Mage Knight ... same exact type of figures and you can play a whole different game with 'em too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, people were saying that a lot right after Wizards bought TSR (R.I.P.). It took 'em a while but it looks like they're doing it, after all.   Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it would be intresting(for me at least) to read what devs thought of 2e and R2e when it was released.  I think it's kind of funny, I think it's kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...the title reminded me of a discussion we had during a gaming session. The Paladin was off in his own world in the players handbook (he is infamous for rolling his d20, then picking it up and saying &quot;Oh yeah, that hit.&quot;) Me and the other guys were talking about one of them just breaking up with his girlfriend and how badly he missed the sex, then we were like, &quot;Man soandso needs a girl,&quot; (the Paladin) and all the sudden he says, &quot;I could get a horse!&quot; completly oblivious to what we were talking about.<br />
<br />
Man we still laugh about that. Anyone someone says something totally at the wrong time one of us says, &quot;I could get a horse!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lindianae</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been out of D&amp;amp;D playing for about 3 years so I'm not familiar with version 3 or any of the changes. However what strikes me as odd is that I always thought the intention was the books were to be a guide not hard an fast rules as that article implies. For example he says that wizards pay too much to scribe spells in version 3. Well if thats the case DMs can easily set the cost to a better level or does every DM not just use the rules as written.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">07-14-03, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't be that adverse to using miniatures, I can definitely see where they come in handy, but we never seem to have any damn room for our character sheets, dice, etc. having to deal with miniatures would just add to it heh.<br />
<br />
that and I'd much rather buy an extra gaming book than enough miniatures :P if I was using them, I'd want a lot - I'm the kind of person that would just be a bit irritated if I had to use a goblin miniature to represent a minotaur or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_namelessshaman</div><div class="date">07-15-03, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monte is aware of those issues (him writing on 3.0 and Arcana Unearthed (AU)), and he mentions those in his review. <br />
AU was also started before 3erevised was scheduled to come out.<br />
AU is also nothing like 3e revised, its more like the eqrpg, wheel of time , or call of cthulhu.<br />
AU is Monte's product, unearthed arcana was a first edition AD&amp;amp;D product released more than a decade ago, that's the diff /grin<br />
<br />
I pretty much agree with what Monte has to say as well.<br />
<br />
As far as miniatures go, it sort of have to goes with what Lindianae has to say about scribing spells. It's your game, you can change whatever you want. However dnd3e (and revised) was built with the idea that everybody knew how to play the same game.<br />
In EQ everyone plays the same game, there are no house rules, thus when you talk EQ everyone is talking the same game.<br />
So many people were using miniatures it was decided that common rules for those would be handy, especially with many of the living campaigns and RPGA -- all these people need a common reference for them to talk the same game.<br />
<br />
You can change scribing costs, you can play without miniatures, but to create a common ground for people to start with and for all those RPGA people who basically have to play &quot;by the rules&quot;, they came up with someone for miniatures and for something more reasonable for scribing costs.<br />
<br />
The new miniatures they are releasing, I agree with Llabak, they are noxious. Randomly packed plastic miniatures (similar to heroclix without the rules and clicky-base). I don't want random figures. I want to pick out the one I want and move on. I'm hoping the aftermarket will provide the ones I would want for a comparable price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took a little more work at times when we did not want to use a visual representation, but neither was my group anal about it being &quot;perfect&quot;.<br />
<br />
After all, it is a game and we were trying to just have fun, not have a rules' lawyer convention.</div></div><hr />
