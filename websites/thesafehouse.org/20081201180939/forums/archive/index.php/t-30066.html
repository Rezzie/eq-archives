I would actually consider LoTR:O if halflings weren't called hobbits. I just really hate that term and refuse to play anything else :P<br />
<br />
Also, the sheer number of of &quot;Lleggiolas&quot; high elves would make me hang myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pakesso</div><div class="date">05-19-07, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL Good point! The funny thing is, i think i just put in my own application to the Fluff B*tch term i used loosely in other threads. Although the game isn't hardcore, it's enjoyable. It's kinda -lite. Quest after quest and everything is kinda made to lead you along. :P Not hardcore at all. The game just runs really well too, that's the semi-sell for me. If Vanguard ran this well i don't think i'd have flinched. I'm still level 40, so i don't have to worry about what's ahead for me. It's 10 levels and i'll be alright. :) Level 50 Rogue is the sh*t. :) Anyway, LOTRO...the game is fun, and so far the Burglers/Rogues are fun to play. I didn't think it would look as good as it does. It's hard to compare Vanguard to LOTRO, graphicwise. Anyway, I'm spending a little time in LOTRO to get my feet wet. I'll install Vanguard again when I get my new PC next week. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiddenpaw</div><div class="date">05-20-07, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing it because it will run on my wifes machine so it's something we can play together, plus it's fun, I still play VG as well though, being unemployed I have time to spend on two games. Plus the 9.99 subscription for LOTRO makes it affordable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I prefer the term &quot;hobbits&quot; for the game, they just look so &quot;hobbitty&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
You have to play them with the shoe graphics turned off of course. Burglars / Rogues on the game are fun, I haven't raced up the level ladder yet so I can't give my opinion on that level but that's the whole point of this game to me, it's just something I'm playing super casually and having fun roleplaying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tybalt</div><div class="date">05-21-07, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on Landroval too (as Valdecir).  I picked up the game as a favor to my brother who was playing.  I was not planning on enjoying it at all.  I got hooked hard though.  The graphics are so much more polished.  The world is very pretty and a joy to wander through.  The player models are much more simplistic though.  I went for two weeks before I crashed, and only encountered one quest bug so far, although even that quest worked fine when I repeated it 15 minutes later.  There is little lag, hitching or crashing.<br />
<br />
I went back into vanguard... the other day and the lag and stutters were overwhelming.  The graphics now look so bland compared to LoTRO.  I crashed after zoning twice while traveling, when I got to New Targonor to port to Qalia, the zone was down (again), so I had to stand there and wait and finally gave up and logged.  when I went to say goodnight to my guild, I had the guild chat bug and could not do so.<br />
<br />
LoTRO actually works, works well, and is polished and pretty.  It is not perfect, but Vanguard is in such bad shape right now that is very vulnerable to losing people to any game that works.<br />
<br />
It will take time to fix what is ailing Vanguard.  I am debating wheter to come back and give it a try in 6 months to a year, or stick it out as a part time player.  My disgust over how crafting has been handled lately is tipping me in favor of cancelling though.<br />
<br />
If you want to stay with Vanguard... don't play LoTRO, you might just be seduced away by the fact that it actually works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiddenpaw</div><div class="date">05-21-07, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also on nimrodel but planning to make one on Landroval to play with friends at some point.<br />
I played VG for 6 or so hours last night and had my usual 3 crash related deaths, waited 5 hours to find a group, etc... but one of the things it definitely has over LOTRO, and this is purely a matter of personal preference, is that VG has a much more blurred line between good and evil that makes for a more gritty feeling world that you just don't have in LOTRO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-22-07, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked this game up a week or so ago, and got Hooked pretty bad off the start.<br />
<br />
The game was fun, graphics were real nice (400 fps?!, 2000 in the Startup Movie!).  Game was polished and was streamlined.  But somewhere along the way, the game lost its swagger.  The Monster Play was kind of Cheeseball, and didn't really hold my interest.  I mean, it was fun and all, but just no 'pizazz' to it.<br />
<br />
All in all, the game was fun, dont know if its my inability to play games for hours at a time anymore, but I just couldn't find myself sitting down for a LOTR:O grind.  And in order for me to really enjoy and stick with a game, i need to be able to grind.  And I just couldnt do that in LOTR:O.<br />
<br />
Guess thats why I went back to EQ, I much rather have 'Camps' than 'Crawling.'</div></div><hr />
