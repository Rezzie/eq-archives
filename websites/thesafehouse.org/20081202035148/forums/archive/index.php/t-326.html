I saw this posted on the EQ forum and another post in the main lounge I think.  In my humble opinion (which is always right) it should be legal to shoot people like that.  That ass deserved way more than getting banned.  Although I did like the way the guides delt with it (Poopiepants for a last name is classic). Glip the Gnome <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-13-00, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kind of two minds on this issue.<br />
<br />
On one hand, yeah, the guy was being a complete JERK.  Definitely deserves banning.<br />
<br />
On the other hand... was he just trying to show how much it takes to get banned?  That was just excessive.  His actions should have been dealt with way before they finally were.  The way he phrased the last portion of the article makes it seem like he was trying to prove a point... almost.  Unfortunately he implies that if/when he returns it will be with similair behavior.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bayler</div><div class="date">04-13-00, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't believe this person's intentions were in any way noble.  Yeah, he latched on to the &quot;see how hard it is to get suspended&quot; line, but basically he was just out for attention and a feeling of power.<br />
<br />
In general, I love EQ's policies with guides and GMs: they are always polite; they take time and examine situations before making decisions; they try to respond to every request.<br />
<br />
In this case, though, that system failed.  They should have dealt with the situation much more quickly and decisively.  We should not have seen a number of guides and GMs come and go before anything happened.  I could understand following a chain of apprentice guide, guide, and GM - that's reasonable.  Someone needed to realize, &quot;Okay, this guy is a disturbance and needs to be neutrallized immediately.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He should not have had the oportunity to continue to annoy the players in the zone while each guide to come along tried to talk some reason into him.  He should have been muted, or summoned to some mystical penalty box, where they could talk to him.<br />
<br />
Say you were at a real-life play/banquet/mall, and someone started making a scene like this.  You'd be unhappy if security guards came up one by one and tried to talk to him, while he continued to make a scene.  You'd then be very unhappy if police showed up and wandered off one by one and tried to talk to him while he continued to disrupt your day.<br />
<br />
(I recognize, of course, that I only have the troublemaker's own account of the situation, and that it may be misleading.)<br />
<br />
In general, I'm impressed with Verant's commitment to a pleasant gaming experience; this situation just fell through the cracks.<br />
<br />
I have complete contempt for narrator of the article, as well as anyone who would tout him as a hero.<br />

<br />
Poopiepants...I don't condone abuse of GM powers, but that was priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">04-13-00, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bayler, rest assured I am not touting him as a hero, nor am I buying right into the idea that he had any noble cause.  I'm just raising the QUESTION.  Devil's advocate and all that.  Please note my last two sentences which indicate that I didn't really buy into it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bayler</div><div class="date">04-13-00, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Notwen - I didn't mean to suggest that you or Glip had  supported the narrator's cause.  I appologise for coming across that way.<br />
<br />
I'm not clear on what Mifune's (the thread's creator) attitude toward the issue is, so I didn't mean to point a finger at him, either.<br />
<br />
I'll eagerly listen to explorations into the the good and bad of this incident.  But I will look down upon anyone who's got nothing better to say than an unthinking anti-authority line of &quot;Verant SUCKS!  Stick it to THE MAN, DUDE!&quot;<br />
<br />
(Honestly, I find that the Safehouse has few - if any - people of that sort.)<br />

<br />
And I agree with you on general maturity level among Safehousers.  There's a reason it's widely held to be the best of the class specific message boards.  <br />
<br />
While I think the incident does (perhaps intentionally, probably not) demonstrate just how hard it is to get banned I don't think any good will come of it.  Nothing will really change because of it.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I've discussed this with some real life friends... most of them viewed the incident as a player who had become disenchanted with the game and simply decided to go out in a blaze of &quot;glory.&quot;  That is probably closest to the truth.  Any point made is likely to be incidental.<br />
