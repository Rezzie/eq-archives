<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Crazy Lowfyr Wildforge</div><div class="date">12-23-02, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi.  Uber cleric on Vazaelle here.<br />
<br />
*SMACK*<br />
<br />
    Hahaha, I've been thinking about it, and you have a very painful road ahead of you, chummer, because everyone really needs 200.<br />
<br />
    What you need to do is find a zone where your bish arse can pull a mob to the zoneline, and then zone out when you get owned.  With 19 defense, I'm guessing you have buffed somewhere around 580 - 620 ac. Which, by the way, is only about 100 - 40 ac less than my AC naked.  Whee.<br />
<br />
    I thought about it, and here's what you have to do.   Get thyself to Velks, gimp boy.  Find a group, tell them you'd like to root their mob, and stand at point blank to work on defense.  NOTE: this isn't going to work if there are rogues in the group.  <br />
<br />
   It's going to take a decent amount of charisma to get them to let you do it.  I'm hoping your interpersonal skills are better than your defense.  Luckily, people tend to let clerics do whatever the hell they want.  Of course, that's from the perspective of a non-suck one, which, you aren't at the moment.<br />
<br />
   So basically, keep rooting, and step in and out of aggro, when you see fit.  Also, wear some AGI gear, AGI boosts your chances to get defense upgrades.  And for God's sakes, don't let yourself fall below 40 percent health.  If you're bored, you can practice hand to hand while you do it.<br />
<br />

Since the pet is an NPC, you can skill up on it. You'll want them to create the weakest blue pet possible so that it doesn't kick your ass too quickly. Back pet off when low on health, heal, rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />

You could root him to back off and heal yourself, then go stand up by him again.  You'll need a ranger or druid to harmony one out for you.<br />

<br />
I have to say that powerlevling is the BEST way to get your defense up, it just went up as the mobs wailed on me.  By the time I stopped plvling in the high 30's and went 100% groupage, I already had over 150 defense, and by the time I was 60 I had got 190+ defense from just getting random heal aggro (always exciting to get that defense point from being slapped, hehe)</div></div><hr />

Now that some pet classes get the /pet hold command to make their pet not attack under any circumstances, it seems to me that dueling a pet using /pet hold would be a great way to max all weapon skills.<br />

<br />
I duelled a chanter friend and let his hasted pet beat on me; I gained something like 4 Defence in 2 hours.  For reference, I was ~58th at the time, with ~215 Defense.  I was buffed with shammie Str/Agi/Dex buffs and KEI the whole time.

You're going to be getting your ass handed to you at first, so to make it easier... find a blue con enchanter pet, load em with two daggers, haste em, then put all the AC buffs/gear you have on yourself, and let the pet rip you up for a while.</div></div><hr />
