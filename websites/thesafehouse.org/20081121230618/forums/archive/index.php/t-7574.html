I seriously doubt they will allow fear or charm since they deemed them bugged but who knows I sure miss fear in PvP thou.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are good unless the target have good MR wich all will have, especially if the server is coin only (wich I think I read they where leaning towards).<br />

It really depends on if you want a good PvP class, a good PvE class, or a balance between. I'd say as far as PvP, wizzies are the best bar none, but getting to the levels they rule at is the main problem.<br />

Getting SoW at lvl 9 dont hurt either on a fresh server, downside is getting money for both spells and equipment.<br />
<br />
And I have to admit (in conradiction to what I wrote above) that an enchanter isnt bad on a fresh server as LirinTZ kindly pointed out.<br />
<br />
Its interesting to consider starting points also, the human cities of Freeport and Quenos will probarbly in total Anarchy since the citicens can be from all 3 factions, same for Gnomes and Erudites. Safest starting point if you want to get some safe speedy leveling done in the beginning will probarbly be Cabilis since Iksars only can worship Cazic and there are no PC enemys close bye.<br />
<br />
But as always, play the class/race combo YOU find to be most fun otherwise you will get bored and start over.<br />

<br />
There will be hoards of druids and necros, all trying to be the first to 50, then to 60 within the first month.  Necros can solo to 50+ wearing silk armor, druids to 50+ in patchwork.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lanath TVyl</div><div class="date">05-29-01, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My belief based on Vallon Zek will be:<br />
<br />
1. Druids<br />
2. Chanters<br />
3. Mages<br />
4. SKs<br />
5. Warriors<br />
...<br />
Last: Wizards<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Druids are way more versatile. About the same ports and tons more easy to level. Chanters are devastating until resists get up in the 85-100 range. Mage pets kick ass and with any kind of assist the earth pet on low level folks sucks. <br />
<br />
Sks/Warriors are in the middle of the pack until they get resist gear then they leap up to the top. Cast your heart out against a tank with 100 resists.<br />
<br />
I have a sweet spot for shammy due to the dots/dog combo but they get it so late who cares. Necros suck just because. Kill em and if you are dotted just die. Makes a good excuse to have a cleric around.<br />
<br />
Last would be wizzies. Why? They are nerfed so badly that they will only be taxis. Under this scheme, the most dangerous spell they have (rains) will be worthless due to the number of teams. Ask the lighties on VZ how often the xteam groups cast rain. Its not very often. Wizzies are eggshell assassins. If they hide around a zone you can get ganked but anything that disrupts their cast kills them. (Like necro/druid/shammy dots or pets or tanks...) <br />

90 MR loss is a little hard to make up for. even for a caster with nice buffs, let alone a melee with none. Way to go verant, keep buffing up the classes that already have the advantages, and let the melees become shoping malls again. Yay for forethought.<br />

If they can cast a mez through your slicing and dicing.. you're dead.  You won't be able to escape - because their nukes have a small stun on them.  This small stun that breaks mez gives them time enough to start casting another mez before you're even mobile again.<br />

Hard to master but Ive fought some good bards in my day.  I wont go into my dealings vs a bard too much cuz Im gonna make one on the new server.<br />
<br />
But if your asking the VERY best class for pvp then go on your current server find a level 60 shadowknight and duel him.<br />
SK can take down any class period.<br />
<br />
On Vz we have Splorge one mean SK...feel lucky he got DQ'd for goin LD in Vz's BotB cuz Im sure if he woulda won he would be bringing home the all Server BotB trophy to Vz.<br />
<br />
I talk highly of this guy even though he's in an enemy guild and race to my rogue on Vz.  He's just plain deadly...<br />

I've never feared a bard, and I don't think I ever will.  Not neccesarily b/c they don't have skills, but just because they're singing at me hehe.<br />
<br />
Now I know a couple higher level bards that kick some serious butt, Cytoplasm being one of them on VZ, but &quot;fear&quot; is not a term I'd use for the bard class.  And usually they aren't played well and simply prove to be annoying.<br />
<br />
Feared classes?  Shadow Knights, Necros, a good shaman, wizzies at higher levels, druids sometimes (although I have trouble fearing them as well).  Still for me the scariest sight is an SK or Warrior with a bigass axe bearing down on me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Venytir</div><div class="date">06-09-01, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO chanters won't be as good as everyone says they will, neither will bards. Firstly, everyone can be rooted. So selo's won't mean anything. Secondly, if you have ever played an untwinked enchanter, that mez/nuke/remez technique will drain your mana waaaay to quickly for you to every kill anything. So basically, you might be able to take something down to low life if you are lucky. Tanks VS chanters = tanks win. Moreover, any smart pvp knows that you can dot yourself with a low level dot and you are unmezable. So just stack on a disease cloud or something and that chanter is screwed. Personally, I don't think it's going to matter what class most people play. As usual, it is skill, not the class, that defines who wins and who loses. Any good pvp will easily defeat a bad pvp no matter what class they choose (excluding possibly clerics for obvious reasons).</div></div><hr />

Ok first of all, that is a great song and should not be misquoted. Are you even getting the actual meaning of the song or do you just think &quot;it totally rocks dude&quot;?<br />
<br />
Secondly, yours sounds better? Yours makes absolutely no sense. &quot;The ever waves of grain, to lesser human beings.&quot; Read that sentence outloud to yourself and tell me how much sense it makes. It should read: &quot;Feed amber waves of grain, to lesser human beings...&quot; with the closing of the line: &quot;...zero feelings&quot; tagged on there. Now that sounds alot better, doesn't it? <br />

A lot of people suggest Shaman but they are dead wrong.  The pet is a joke and 75 PR/DR, 90 CR/MR is total Shaman spell immunity -- their spells are way too resistable.  Add 60 to those resists at high levels for level 60 malo, but still...  Necro Druid and Wizard are all at the top because of completely UNRESISTABLE damage spells (at least for PvP purposes).<br />
<br />
Good *defensive* PvP classes<br />
<br />
Bard - Selos, best resist buffers, hymn overwrites most of the unresistable DOT lines, songs that overwrite other debuffs too, dispel every 3 seconds, largest selection of spell types for unpredictability.<br />
<br />
Druid - SoW/SoC, best rooters (they hold easier), counteract poison/disease, bufs for all resists, regen stacks over some offensive spells, heals, hide skill - endure fire overwrites malo<br />
<br />
Shaman - SoW/SoC for escape, counteract poison/abolish disease, bufs for all resists, regen stacks over some offensive spells (most of these nerfed though), STR bufs overwrite weaken line, heals. <br />
<br />
Cleric - bufs for all resists, best HP/AC bufs, best + fastest heals (duh), invuln.<br />
<br />
Necro - regen &quot;heals&quot; overwrite most unresistable DOTs, buf cold/disease/magic resist - shieldling overwrites malo, screaming terror to buy time, shadowstep, instant invis items<br />
<br />
For Sullon Zek, there isn't much reward for PKing (just coin).  However, there is a hefty penalty for getting PKed - you lose xp like death to a MOB.  So defense is better to have IMO.</div></div><hr />

That 'oh-I'll-just-kite-this-red-mob-around-the-zone-trick' isn't going to work out too well when some caster notices them and casts ROOT....  <br />
<br />
Necros are troublesome, but if you can sneak up on them while they are soloing.  Necros tend to use cannibalize, dark pact, and other life-draining spells because they depend upon their pet to take care of their opposition.  If you can sneak up on one while their pet is fighting and they are around half health, you can probably put the big hurt on them before they can mount an effective defense.  Then all you have to do is deal with the mob...  Assuming that it is even a mob that will aggro on you.  <br />
<br />
Plus, I don't see as many necros and druids as we are used to seeing on regular servers.  Most people use their druids and necros to twink out their other characters.  They just use these two classes because they see them as easiest to level up in the beginning.</div></div><hr />

Yes<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
Wizard<br />
Best ambush class. If they're ready and you aren't, you are dead. They make a nice crunching noise when you hit them while they are spending 10 minutes or so medding their mana back...  <br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
New server so  less equipment around. Less equipment around = much less effective rogues. It's going to be a real test, dividing people who know how to play rogues well from those who can't<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Decent hp, MR boost. No method of immobilising enemies, so just run from them. No escape/stealth.<br />
<br />
Magician<br />
Until people start getting their MR up, sure  <br />
<br />
Monk<br />
Like warriors, but wil less health and no MR boost.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW you missed all of the hybrids off and they are very nasty pvp classes: <br />
Paladin - offence isn't that hot but they are damned difficult to kill. And flash of light is annoying.<br />
Bard - insanely difficult to kill, has resist buffs, speed buffs, shadowstep, etc, etc.<br />
ranger - snare, fast melee damage, damage shields, heals, track...when it works.<br />
SK - Shadowstep, pet (for interrupting casters), &amp;lt;whatever&gt;skin line of spells, darkness for snares, virtually unresitable lifetaps.</div></div><hr />
