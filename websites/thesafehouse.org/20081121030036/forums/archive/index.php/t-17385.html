<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently, connections have been made with the O'Gaming site and the dreaded IGE Network Empire.  (http://www.vanguardsoh.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=10251)<br />
<br />
Other interesting tidbits have been cropping up about the IGE network in discussions on the Sigil forums. I knew these guys had infiltrated the MMORPG scene, but they are getting pretty stealthy about it. O'Gaming being a quiet partner is just one of many examples. Thottbot is implicated as well.<br />
<br />
This thread here (http://www.vanguardsoh.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=10234) points to a bit of internet detective work here (http://www.corpnews.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1790&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0).<br />
<br />
It may be old news to some, but IGE's cover may have been blown wide open with its recent exposure through an impromptu interview, et al. goings on. Regardless of your stance on cash for pixel trading, I'm curious how other companies and industries will follow suit.<br />
<br />
Rest assured, our hallowed halls are still privately owned by rogues for the rogues. :)<br />
<br />
Drama... drama... drama... Remember, this is all from forum musings, but Sigil must have seen something to take it seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">02-15-05, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In related news, today Age of Vanguard (http://www.ageofvanguard.com/) recieved an email from IGE's Chief Strategic Officer, offering to purchase their site. Age of Vanguard is another Vanguard affiliate site, and promptly posted their response on their front page, rejecting his offer.<br />
<br />
For note, the name of the IGE reprsentative is on the Safehouse's word filter list. So I'm pretty sure you can guess who it was  :D</div></div><hr />

Actually I think they're NOT being stealthy about it anymore. They have been trying to make inroads with community sites for awhile now (I'm sure some of us remember an particular attempt) but this time their deeds have come to light.</div></div><hr />
