Now i understand that you're an all-knowing 54 wizard/bard/chimpanzee, but if you don't play rogue how could you possibly know what WE need? Suggestions/questions are fine, but 3 page posts with descriptions of abilities/spells (not even gonna touch that one) that rogues should have? 11 pages about taking away our ability to pickpocket? &amp;lt;looks around&gt; did i miss something? I'm not saying don't post, post all you want. Don't tell me how to play my rogue. Make a rogue, get him/her past 50: then post all the crap you want (incluing THIS POST), because you'll KNOW what you're talking about.<br />

Quite honestly, some Enchanters and Shaman I've met out there know the Rogue class better than some of the rogues here..... <br />
<br />
But I do think that coming to a class-specific board and posting about why one of theat class's certain skills or abilities should be nerfed or done away with entirely seems wrong to me.  The 'Pickpocketing' threads that are brought up about once a month here have mostly other classes berating the rogue class and we here trying to defend it.  I honestly don't think there's anymore that can be said about that subject; it truly is a dead horse--leave it be.  If you ARE a rogue, you know the truth behind pickpocketing.  If you are NOT a rogue -- play one first and understand the role before you assume anything.  It's as simple as that.  We will all have varying opinions at all times, but at least Rogues have a perspective on the situation that non-rogues don't... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qutsemnie</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha i have some of the most controversial opinions on what they should do to rogues and i live eat and breath rogues.  (and yes i do favor nerfing pickpocket so it only works on unagrod mobs because thats all i ever use it for rawr~  but it should also WORK BETTER ON UNAGROD MOBS~ but thats another post)<br />
<br />
Anyway i get tells all the time from strangers telling me they like my ideas.  My ideas are basically in favor of destroying the twink rogue that you twinkers love.<br />
<br />
Alot of people see the rogue as a toon you get on when you want to bang out some cheap easy damage then when they want to play in a more complicated way that actually takes concentration but gives you greater potential for a rewarding experience they get on another toon. <br />
<br />
Ive known of this phenom for atleast a year and a half.  I can first recall noticing it when a bard friend said they really loved playing their rogue cause its fun.  I said whats fun about sounds to me like a bard would be fun?  They said standing their and doing sick damage was fun.<br />
<br />
Thats all your average twinker cares about that rogues stay a &quot;no attention stand there and do damage class&quot;.  These people actually oppose making the class complicated to play because they escape to the rogue.  If it was complicated they wouldnt be happy with the class at all even if with the complication they could do cooler stuff.  They dont care about cooler stuff on their rogue.  If they wanted to do cooler stuff they would get on their other toon.   What they want from rogues is nice simple easy damage.<br />
<br />
AND I LOATHE YOU (who ever you might be).<br />
Stop hold the class down cause you want it to stay your oasis of simplicity in a sea of having to think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno 'bout Rogues being 'Stand there and do easy damage'.  I find it rathering involved to constantly have to 'dance' around to stay opposite the Tank, who inevitably seems to not have the slightest bit of clue why Rogues don't do much damage when the back of a mob is in a wall... ;) <br />
<br />
Plus Scouting seems to be a biggy lately.  Rogues have to sneak ahead of the group and check for traps, mob placement or boss locations in the dungeons.  Of course, SoS kinda took a lot of the challenge out of doing that since there's maybe like .001% chance a mob in a dungeon will see through your SoS (Although I do have to contest that the 'beholders' in the Deepest Guk dungeons aren't fooled very easily...or at least they weren't before I got SoS....will hafta check again).<br />
<br />
It's those subtle utilities that make the class fun by me.  Not just standing there slapping your Backstab button every 5.5 seconds.<br />

Yeah, you can make ANY class a &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; class.  It also nets you a dead toon, and possibly a dead reputation.<br />
<br />
I don't mind other folks coming here and trying to &quot;educate&quot; us rogues about &quot;rouges&quot;.  Sometimes it's kinda entertaining.  But seriously, most of the time we get an insight as to what the rest of Norrath thinks of us &quot;sneaky bastiges&quot; (that's really cool, Coins).  Without people to bounce ideas off of, when would we learn?<br />
<br />
I think the gist of the original post, though, is simply frustration with folks coming to our board, starting posts that degrade rogues and thinking they're the know-all resource for our class.  That, I agree, is annoying.  However, it happens everywhere, not just here...and as long as we're a free board (and we always will be), we're going to have to take the fruits and nuts along with out meat and potatoes.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;P.S. -- The fruits and nuts reference is not intended to degrade dr00ds and ranjas...though I won't stop it from being implied that way  &gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must excuse myself.....I have to head over to the BST boards and tell them how much I love their knockback pet procs and that nothing ever should ever be changed about it because they are just fine the way they are and any rogue who ever complains about not being able to backstab a mob past halfway thru a fight because its back is planted in the wall (every fight) is just a slacker or a complainer.  And I will try not to pickpocket anyone while I'm there.<br />

wow, clearly owned.  FYI druid is retired, rogue is my main, and i've gotten him past 60. if i had a 20-30 rogue alt and i posted a rant like that i'd be fully open to criticism, or one-liners from ppl like yourself.  All i'm saying is don't tell me how to do my job, this goes for any class, i wouldnt want someone telling me how to quad when i'm on my druid, you woulndt want someone to tell you how to smack things with your Warrior.<br />

Maybe this is what you are getting called on.  If 54 isn't high enough for your qualifications, maybe 62 isn't high enough for others qualifications.<br />
