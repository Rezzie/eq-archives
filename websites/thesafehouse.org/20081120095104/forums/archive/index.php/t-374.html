We have also seen the heros break on a monologue where they say their &quot;final&quot; words. such as in &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;, where the norse men and the arab, said their prayer for entry into valhalla. My question to you, and if you so desire, this will be an exercise in creativity, what would your final words or your prayer be. I have one in mind but I can't put it into words just yet, though I did have a nice addition when the Norse leader sat down and died in front of the towns defense in the same movie. here is your chance, step up to the mic and let it roll my fellow shadow walkers.<br />

&quot;They have finnally consumed me as I knew they would--&quot; he looked up at the pale blue sky, appreciateing it for the last and first time, &quot;To think, I buried my head in the shadows for so long that I never once saw it... They will take me as I am, cold, bitter, and now most of all-- lost...&quot; The orc jammed a rusty sword between Kooran's upper ribs shouting a maniacal battle cry. Kooran froze up, muscles tightening with the cold tense grip of death upon them, he stared vacantly at the ever darker sky. &quot;The shadows--&quot; He grimaced, and coughed up some blood. &quot;My blood?-- Wasted in such a way another life gone from this, the only place it grows?&quot; He thought. His head pulled him  dizzily through his lifetime.His muscles relaxed as the life left them... His dying breath was well used, &quot;To your arms I fall, for I never saw them as I should have, my protectoret-- shadow.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled, a painful smirk of releif that the end had come.<br />

&quot;Hack, cough weeze, this looks like the end of the brave Relvart. To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether it is nobler in spirit to have suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune....etc etc etc. It made for quite a death scene, but it pissed people the hell off too.<br />

But My death prayer is from the only movie I ever saw that dethroned Braveheart on my favorite flick list: GLADIATOR. My death quote would just happen to be: &quot;What we do in life...Echoes in eternity.&quot; Just a note tho, my favorite part was when Ceasar asked him his name and he gave the famous &quot;I am the husband of a murdered wife, Father of a murdered son..&quot; speach. If you haven't seen it...rent it as soon as its released!</div></div><hr />
