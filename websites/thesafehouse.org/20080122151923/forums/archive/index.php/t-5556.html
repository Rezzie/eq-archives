Combines work again! YAY! Now I can work on the shawl quest again!!!!!<br />
Melee Part II! <br />
A new story has been added to your storybook! <br />
<br />
<br />
The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor spell, item and quest text fixes that are too numerous to list here. <br />
<br />
We'd like to thank all of the players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee changes. We'd also like to send a special thanks to all of the players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta servers. All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements you've seen in the melee classes. <br />
<br />
Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything else that you feel requires attention. It does make a difference. <br />
<br />
Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes. <br />
<br />
- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use. <br />
- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines. <br />
- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage. <br />
- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management. <br />
- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling. <br />
- Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes. <br />
<br />
The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes. You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power. We will continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment. <br />
<br />
We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed. Class balance is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention. <br />
<br />
Thanks for helping make EverQuest a great game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Items <br />
------------------------ <br />
We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics. The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future. <br />
Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in crafting them. <br />
The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders below level 50. <br />
The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt. <br />
Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo. <br />
Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly. <br />
All bolas that can proc will now do so. <br />
All items that had the &quot;Cleave&quot; series of effects removed, have had them returned. <br />
<br />
The drop rate for the following Epic Quest items has been increased slightly: <br />
<br />
- Essence of a Vampire <br />
- Decrepit Hide <br />
- Staff of Elemental Mastery (earth) <br />
<br />
<br />
Expedition zones <br />
------------------------- <br />
You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept another expedition zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskills <br />
------------------------- <br />
In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill interface it was necessary to remove all learned and favorite recipes. However the system should now work better overall. <br />
The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced. <br />
Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable. <br />
If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker with a deluxe toolkit kit. If you are a gnome, please tinker away. <br />
You should now be able to properly search for recipes. <br />
The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted. <br />
<br />
<br />
Berserkers <br />
------------------------- <br />
Some berserker abilities have had their endurance cost changed. <br />
The duration of Confusing Strike has been reduced. <br />
Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 6. <br />
The berserker guildmaster in the Plane of Knowledge has been taught throwing and parry and is ready to train berserkers in their use. <br />
<br />
<br />
Spells <br />
------------------------- <br />
Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often. <br />
Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly. <br />
The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work as intended. <br />
<br />
<br />
NPC's <br />
------------------------- <br />
Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis. <br />
Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should now speak with you correctly. <br />
If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], he will return to you any items you've just given him. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tribute <br />
------------------------- <br />
A few items have had their tribute value adjusted. <br />
Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly. <br />
You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside for favor. <br />
Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
Alternate Advancement <br />
------------------------- <br />
Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability was successfully initiated.  What's up with this?!?<br />
Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high in level. <br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous <br />
------------------------- <br />
Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic. <br />
The monk &quot;Phantom&quot; line of abilities should no longer be resisted in the level 65 &quot;hard&quot; LDoN Adventures. <br />
The rogue's &quot;Assassin's Strike&quot; skill line ability will be re-introduced with the next update. <br />
The Shining Bloodstone will now be restricted to 2-handed weapons. Any who have placed this augmentation in a 1-handed weapon will find the augmentation on their cursor when they log in. If you find that you have no practical use for the 2-handed augmentation, please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made available to you. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
To make a long story short:  Nothing new for rogues in this patch.  Unless you were one of the lucky few who had The Shining Bloodstone, in which case you were nerfed. <br />

I figure that would make a BIG difference, however today I hit deadly precision just to check out how much endurance I had at the end and I noticed about ZERO difference.  Normally it takes around half of my end to use deadly precision it now takes..... around half.  anyone else having this issue or is 340 end not suppose to make any noticable difference in this system??<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and.... no END on the epic?? WTF is with that? thought end was suppose to be approx the same as mana for half classes.... unless I am crazy half classes get mana on their epics...  <br />

<br />
I'd say that would make a difference .. instead of disc timers being the limiting factor, how much endurance you have will be the limiting factor. .theoretically making you reuse discs faster till you're ooe (out of endurance)<br />

The list on the patch message are all things that were already added.  Nowhere does it mention anything new regarding any melee abilities.  I guess we can hope we log in to find some new disciplines, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
On another note, Brenlo pulled a hilarious joke on the shaman.  In a post on the Crucible, he had promised that an improvement to shaman healing would be made soon.  Well, in this patch, changes were made to some cleric, druid, shaman and paladin heals.  Most had their mana cost reduced and the amount healed improved.  One paladin spell had both the amount healed and mana cost raised slightly.  The shaman spell had the mana cost raised moderately, and the amount healed stayed the exact same.<br />

<br />
If the item previously had +mana, it now also has +endurance for the same number.<br />
<br />
Prior to today, Duelist was taking just under 3 bubbles of endurance. Deadeye was taking about 2.5. Now, Duelist takes about 1.7, and Deadeye takes about 1.4 or so.<br />
<br />
Haste, ATK, Regen and several other stats are specifically spelled out with the numbers. I had an item that had Veng 6 which I added a Veng 4 augment to. Previously, it would show as Veng 6 + Veng 4. Now it shows as Attack +50. <br />
<br />
The one thing I saw that I was wondering about was on the Cap of Flowing Time, it says Haste 40. Why do PoTime gods drop lower haste items than dragons or gods prior to PoTime? Haste belt off of MM in HoHb has 41% haste. Haste bracer from PoE rings has 41%. Saryrn (PoTime) only has 40% haste though????</div></div><hr />

There are a few AE's in GoD raid fights that drain endurance FAST.  I went from 100% enddurance to 0% within 20 sec of getting hit with one ae.  By the time I realized I had no endurance left it was too late, couldnt use any disc's during the fight. Tahngarth Alarius</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Saulami</div><div class="date">03-11-04, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding endurance. Many Rogue only items have no endurance yet pretty much everything that a rogue could use that have mana (mostly because they are RNG or SHM usable) have endurance. What's interesting is the endurance in every case was equal to the mana on the item if it had mana. There are a lot of out of whack items like the highest hp droppable rogue arms Farwater with 90hps have only 35 endurance since it's mana is 35 while trash items like 1k necklaces have 75 (amulet of unseen horrors). They need to put a little more thought into the endurance given and not make it based off mana. Really screws us over. The one nice thing is the LDON armor have a very nice amount of endurance on almost all the pieces. I do have a question. Does anyone know if the +20 hp +20 mana augments that you buy add +20 endurance once you augment your armor with them?<br />

Look at Crystalized Serpent Eye, 110hp/50mana, +50 END<br />
<br />
Look at wand of everlasting water (pretty much caster item) 100hp/mana, +100 END<br />
<br />
So looks like they ran a script on most items to copy the mana to the endurance property, items that have no mana received no endurance.<br />
<br />
Pretty retarded IMO considering most melee's that use endurance will have a @#%$ of items without endurance, while most casters that do not, will have it.<br />
<br />
Misc items without endurance, Flayed Barb mask, Crown of the Kromzek Kings, Spirit Wracked Cord, Bile Etched Obsidian Choker, Pauldrons of the Deep Flame, etc etc the list goes on.<br />

Most of Mrylokar's stuff doesn't have any stats period. Edited by: Nocte at: 3/11/04 11:50 am</div></div><hr />

That's what I thought too initially, with exceptions made for ornate and elemental armor sets. But then a friend linked me that 50hp monk bracer from King Tormax. It has no mana on it and has 30 endurance. Edited by: Nocte at: 3/11/04 11:51 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably a combination of a sql script ran that basically,<br />
<br />
if expansion .eqs. PoP .or. expansion .gtr. PoP then add_endur <br />
if item_xyz has mana .and. add_endur then convert mana to endurance<br />
<br />
Then a body went through and added endurance to random Veilous and Luclin items.<br />
<br />
My Tor Vingus from the Deep (Luclin) got it, my Reapers ring (Velious) had +END added when it had no mana prior.<br />

Just takes time.  And its all certain people have been working on for a month from what I hear.<br />
<br />
Two things conspicuously missing END though is the planar flag charm and the adventurer's stone.  Especially considering the charm is given to you based on your class. Edited by: Nocte at: 3/11/04 11:49 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Yes and no. Epics had mana+hp = 100. Rogue epic has 100hp so it has 0 mana/end.<br />
<br />
 Really until they put in assassins strike end does absolutely nothing for me at all. I already could use all my discs back to back, now I have over twice as much end and nothing to spend it on.   And I am not entirely sure the +end is working as intended, more testing on that later though.<br />
<br />
 Oh, a time rogue got thousands of end this patch... 2940 end by my count.   For referance using duelist completely costs 300 end, DP another 240, nimble 275.  815 end total. <br />
<br />
 So at least in theory using all the disciplnes back to back should use about less than 1/3 of the end bonus I got with that patch.</div></div><hr />

A set of spell changes just appeared on test, including an update to several shammy heals.  The notable one, in my non-shammy bard opinion, was that Quiescence had its heal amount upped to 350 hp/tick from 300, and the mana cost to 234 from 200.</div></div><hr />
