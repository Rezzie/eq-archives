ADV announced that there won't be any new licenses announced (no suprise- they announced 15 or so titles at Anime Expo.<br />
<br />
Personally, the only ones I'm looking forward to:<br />
<br />
PlanetES - A space drama. It's an amazing anime about life in space. Something of a &quot;slice of life&quot; drama. (5/5 rating from me)<br />
<br />
Le Portrait de Petit Cossette - A very surreal show, lots of symbolical image. I haven't watched the 2nd episode yet so I'm not sure what it's all about yet, will probably update soon as I watch the 2nd episode.<br />
<br />
Koi Kaze - Man, I can't say enough about this series. This is one of my favorite series of all time. Mainly because it's so REAL. It is easily the most controversial anime to come to USA, ever. The artwork is beautiful. The character designs are odd, but will grow on you.<br />
<br />
It is a story about a 22 year old man that works at a dead-end job. When he was 10 years old, he was separated from his 2 year old sister (divorce). He never saw his mother and sister again afterwards. 12 years later, his sister moves to a nearby school. In order to reduce the commute time, she moves in with her brother and father. (She is a 14 year old high school girl).<br />
<br />
Without getting too much into the story, they fall in love with each other. They must deal with the turbulent emotions within them and find an answer on what to do about their relationship. I'll let you know this now- don't expect a, &quot;suprise! they're not blood related!&quot;. There's no good convinent excuse to make this relationship &quot;okay&quot; by moral standards.<br />
<br />
They must fight against their feelings and the people around them and come upon a decision.<br />
<br />
It is truly a great anime that only comes once a decade. Most people will not watch it due to what is being explored in the anime. It was quite an emotional roller-coaster that put Kimi ga Nozomu Ein to shame.<br />
<br />
Can you tell I'm highly anticipating it?! :p<br />
<br />
Not sure what the other licensing companies announced. There's rumors of Asagiri no Miko (Maidens of the Morning Mist), and Da Capo being licensed. All in all, a decent announcement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Planetes is a weird series for me.  It's one of those shows that I WANT to like.  I like the style, I like the idea, I like the characters.  But everytime I was getting ready to watch an episode I got this impending sense of dread similar to when I'm about to embark upon a household chore I've been putting off for weeks.  <br />
<br />
Doesn't make sense, I know.  <br />
<br />
The most surprising licenses for Otakon, to me, are Human Scramble, Jubei-Chan 2 (expected it from Bandai), and Grappler Baki from Funi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I felt the same way in the beginning with PlanetES, also. Around the middle of their run, I finally loved it. The Von Braugh (Mission to Jupiter) story is incredible. A great mix of courage, desire, greed, ambition, love and despair. Watching these events made me think to myself, &quot;I don't know what to say about this, but it seems so... human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quite amazing, really.<br />
<br />
<br />
/addednote/ PlanetES the manga is VERY different from the anime, I suggest picking it up. Vol. 1-3 have already been released in US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matheren</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm happy that they're finally releasing Tokyo Underground over here. got to see episodes 2-5 at a local con last year, and damn how I've missed that show :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funimation announces Fullmetal Alchemist to be 16 DVD's at $25 MSRP.<br />
<br />
Looks like I won't be buying it for a long time. How disappointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey its better than conan DVD ,  3-4 episode per DVD , each is going to be 19,99<br />
<br />
going to cost way too much to follow it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, considering FMA will be 12, 3 episode DVD's, and 4, 4 episode DVD's, for 25 dollars... I'd say Conan is giving you a better bang for the buck :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decrescendo</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad Grappler Baki got liscenced.  Fansubbing for that series pretty much evaporated, and I really want to see the rest of it.  I never did find the last 2 episodes of the first season, so yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notwen</div><div class="date">08-01-04, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the FMA pricing really has me bummed... I love that show, and was my most anticipated R1 release for next year.  Now I doubt I'm gonna be buying it for a while, instead waiting for cheap boxed sets and/or bundles.  <br />
<br />
... unless they REALLY wow me with the LE items...</div></div><hr />
