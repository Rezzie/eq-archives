<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">07-11-02, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got the game, and was gonna play through it as a multi-class, rogue(1) and monk the rest of the way.  I figured I could get the rogue lockpick skills and such that way, since I guess the NPC rogue is pretty gimpy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, is there any point in going rogue only partway, or are the traps and locks going to be too high for a multiclass rogue to pick them?<br />
<br />
Can I even keep upping my pick lock and disarm trap skills beyond skill 4 if I leave my rogue class at 1?<br />

<br />
So if you are using the rogue henchman there is absolutely no reason to level in rogue at all, he will always have higher skills than you have. ShadowCross Bladesong<br />

<br />
Still, you might be able to do some of the locks with tools. Could get pricey though.</div></div><hr />
