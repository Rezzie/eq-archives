As of now, the NDA for the EverQuest II Beta is officially lifted. We encourage our beta testers to share the experiences they've had in beta with the rest of the EverQuest II community. Many more people who enrolled in the EverQuest II beta program can expect beta keys in their inboxes in the very near future. In addition, in the past few weeks we've let the Legends and Lords of EverQuest players in, and we would like to thank them for their support. We now have four Beta servers up and running including one French and one German server and we've let in over 30,000 players since July. In the near future that number will grow far past that. Keep an eye on your inbox!</div></div><hr />

It would be interesting to see some stats.<br />
<br />
1. How many of them currently play EQ<br />
2. How many of them quit EQ and are now trying EQ2<br />
3. How many have never played EQ.<br />
4. Of those who are currently playing EQ how many are considering abandoning it all together in favor of EQ2.</div></div><hr />
