<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HiddenWarrior</div><div class="date">11-27-07, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I'm new here so be gentle. <br />
<br />
I haven't really bothered with questing for the really nice gear for my rogue.  I was half heartedly playing this class, thinking I would change to something else, until I hit my 40s and decided I'd stick with it.  So now I'm level 47/48 with pretty poor gear :ontome <br />
<br />
So... where in the world do I start?  I have a solid group of RL folks I play with that are willing to help, I just need some direction.  There are too many quests here to sort through, though I have started, and some don't say what level they are for.  My hunch is get a good BP and weapons, then get all the rest but I'm not really sure.<br />
<br />
Here are my stats in a nutshell: <br />
Hit Points  5541  <br />
Endurance  100  <br />
Energy  1718  <br />
Strength 357  <br />
Constitution  212  <br />
Dexterity 478  <br />
Vitality  101  <br />
Intelligence  63  <br />
Wisdom 63  <br />
Armor Class  1437  <br />
Melee Attack 745  <br />
Defense  4921 <br />
<br />
The folks I play with told me if I wanted to continue from this point I need better stuff.  I've seen the gorgalok (sp?) swamp armor and I think I'd like that, but after spending weeks and weeks helping others get their swamp armor drops... I'm not sure I want to go thru this again.  Is that the only way to get good gear at this level?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swag</div><div class="date">11-27-07, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most crafted and some drops are better than Swamp armor. I've taken a more general &quot;play the game a lot and farm the plat to buy stuff or farm the drops worth having&quot; approach.<br />
<br />
As far as your stats go, they don't really say much about your gear at high levels. at 50 it's all about %mods, such as crit, avoidance, and damage. Just glancing at the stats however, you need to get your str up by a couple hundred and could probably drop back on dex a bit if you needed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">11-27-07, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gorgalok  swamp armor is pretty good, but if you don't want to spend that much time farming mobs and trying to get a core of ezigoth, go for crafted.<br />
<br />
If you can, buy flawless cavalier's jagged armor. You can add little effects like health, or end regen, or melee avoidance to those pieces as well, but it will reduce the amount of +crit you get.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, you can buy striking weapons from a T5 weaponsmith, but it will be expensive to buy all this stuff.<br />
<br />
If you want to camp/quest for some stuff, have you done the helm quest in Rhaz Inkur? While working on that quest, you should be able to get the necessary faction to start the Arazmus weapon quest in Afrit as well. The longest part of the Arazmus weapon is collecting the coin bags necessary to be able to start it. (1 bag = 50 faction). If you are a good race and have not factioned there before, you will need 60 bags to be able to start the quest, and another 20 bags to finish it. The other parts really don't take too long though.<br />
<br />
That will give you a nice dagger with particle effect, and you will probably get a Djarn's Longsword of Accuracy from Djarn while you work on the Legendary helm quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HiddenWarrior</div><div class="date">11-27-07, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah sorry about the stats listing - I couldn't get a link to VGPlayers to work.  Every piece of my armor, except maybe two or three, has a %crit chance on it from 15-25%.  I think... at least that's what I always shoot for.  And thank you for telling me my STR is low. I've been all over the VG forums asking what my STR, AC and other stats should be and never get any decent feedback.<br />
<br />
Have not done the helm quest in RI yet...but I am so glad to hear Afrit is a key place to be. I've been there since...level 45?  44?  I am up to the 10bag armor quests and I think I have one that calls for 30 now?  or more?  I know it is some ungodly amount.  But its not really a &quot;quest&quot; go kill this and that, its just, get the bags and turn them in.  At any rate it sounds like I am already working on a good faction.<br />
<br />
I like your plan too Swag - make money and buy crafted.  I need to start auctioning for crafters and tell them what I need instead of picking thru stuff on the broker.  /sigh  Do they sell lotto tickets in VG?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />

<br />
You might want to double check that. No piece of armor has 15% crit on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
15% total aint easy either :p<br />
<br />
Swamp takes ages, and as swag is saying, crafting is better, i'd rather harvest for a week then do swamp.<br />
<br />
RI helmet is very nice to have, and i agree again with swag, get that str up by at least 150 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
... yeah, I checked and its not a % its just straight pts.  So between 6 pieces of armor I've got +45 critical melee hit chance.  Not %. <br />
<br />
I put all my pts in DEX because I was thinking if I get enough crits, nothing else will matter.  But, my END runs out so fast that it doesn't matter how many crits I get because I end up standing there doing nothing, waiting for it to regen.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sublimatiion</div><div class="date">11-29-07, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can buy all the pieces necessary for the Swamp armor for the Arm, Waist and Wrist slots, no farming for pieces required.  That's what I did, plus the arms have +melee damage.<br />
<br />
For Jewelry, you can get Lucent Medals for awesome Rings, Earrings, Mask and Cloak.  Could also get Hegenerian's Cloak and the Mask of the Feral Warrior, which I highly recommend getting.  There's a thread with information about it in the Quest Planning Room somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxin</div><div class="date">04-15-08, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as gear goes, the best I can offer is the stuff that you get from compleating the Hagnerian quests.<br />
<br />
Pulsating Earring of the Lucent Hero (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1392279/)<br />
Felzekar, Helm of Dominion (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1350826/)<br />
Pulsating Mask of the Lucent Hero (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1392271/)<br />
Pulsating Ring of the Lucent Hero (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1392296/)<br />
Hegnerian's Breastplate of Defiance (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1401519/)<br />
Durable Bracers of the Timeweaver (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1418414/)<br />
Durable Timeworn Belt (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1401503/)<br />
Pulsating Ring of the Lucent Hero (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1392296/)<br />
Hegnerian's Leggings of Defiance (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1401515/)<br />
Durable Boots of the Phage (http://vg.curse.com/database/items/details/1418405/)<br />
<br />
Now this isn't all the stuff, but it wasn't all that hard to get these, other then the helm. The current end all be all of daggers IMHO is Akym's Dagger.</div></div><hr />
