Never seen those char models before and they were stunning. I got a good SS but I have no place to post it. The gobbs were slain in less than 1 minute from when they popped so very few people saw them, maybe around 15 people max. They had fins on em like they were water dwelling creatures and when hailed one of them stated that they would dry up if not in water (or something of the sorts).<br />
If these models show whats to come in SoL, I am impressed. OR....I had too many beers.<br />

It's been in since the start of RoK, actually, but I don't think it's been used until now.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they were supposed to be the inhabitants of Veksar the unimpleminted zone in the lake??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vermintide</div><div class="date">08-02-01, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The story is that the zone was completed, but it had alot of problems with vertical agro or some such nonsense because the dungeon was built up and down but is of course full of water.<br />
<br />
I'd really like them to fix it.  Those goblins are cool.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this GM event means they have fixed it, and maybe they are putting it in soon.<br />
<br />
Or maybe not. Edited by: Vermintide at: 8/2/01 7:22:21 pm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tular the Most Ill</div><div class="date">08-06-01, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just go to the bottom of the lake where the building with the big dome is and find the entrance on one of the sides of it. There's a few bloodgills protecting it. You can go inside and try to zone but you just get kicked back. There is a neat feature(tm) where you can get where the zone would be and there's a thin line of dry land so ya don't need to come up for air.</div></div><hr />

However.. they could have also just chosen a random monster skin to mess around with some n00bs... [b]..Samea Padrino..<br />

Uhm, not long after that I was in login/chat room of EQ and by chance whatshisface the ranger lead programmer (or whatever) guy who had the FA (you know), whose name slips my mind (starts with an 'A'), and he was taking questions, so I asked him about the underwater zone in loio.  He said they were working on implementing it within the next couple weeks.  Like I said, this was about 2 or so months after Kunark came out.  So releasing it now, they'd be just about on time  <br />

Anyway, I tried to zone into veksar a LOT.  I mean, its very tempting when hunting the bloodgills   <br />
