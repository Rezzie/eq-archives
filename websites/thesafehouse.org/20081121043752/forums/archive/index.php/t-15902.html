<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pilfer</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone! I've been looking for information on the level 20 Rogue/Swashbuckler quest and thought I'd post what I was able to gather to share with any aspiring Safehouse-Swashies (tm) out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
*****WARNING.....SPOILER BELOW......***********<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You must be level 18 to start this quest:<br />
<br />
Part 1<br />
<br />
Go to the Qeynos Harbor, find the NPC halfling dressed in black armor and talk to him. He'll tell you to go sneak around Blackburrow.<br />
<br />
Travel to Blackburrow, activate your sneak and travel to the &quot;Brewers Room&quot;, which is locarted where the spiders are; jump in the water and look underwater for the tunnel.<br />
<br />
At this point, all you'll need to do is walk around the Brewers' Room and watch your quest window...it will eventually say &quot;Return to talk to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Head back to Qeynos Harbor, talk to the halfling in black armor and he'll then initiate....<br />
<br />
<br />
PART 2<br />
<br />
The halfling will ask you to go &quot;snoop&quot; around around a clandestine meeting in South Qeynos.<br />
<br />
Zone into SQ, run thru that first gate in front of you. There are 3 rows of buildings in SQ, the one on your right is the one you want. There are several alleys in between the houses...i  believe the one you want is the 2nd or 3rd. When you turn down it, it'll be on your left. You'll know it's the right door because it'll highlight like a &quot;zone-in&quot; would.<br />
<br />
 note: Some people are recommending you activate both Sneak and Snoop<br />
<br />
Zone in. Some times the quest piece is in the same place, other times it isn't. Go through the doorway in front of you, make a sharp left and head down the stairs. Follow this room all the way around and open the door. In the far corner of the room is a table with books on it. Right-click on the books and choose &quot;inspect&quot;, you will either find something or not. If you don't find anything you'll have to zone out and wait the quest recycle time (9-15 mins, i forget which).<br />
<br />
If you find there are no books at all (and people have posted that that's happened) some have found them upstairs, however, be careful. There is a &quot;boss&quot; mob that will see thru your snoop/sneak and will pummel you but good. Be prepared to sprint to the zone. Also, many have had their sneak/snoop pop once they're found the &quot;evidence&quot;, so, be prepared to sprint in that case as well.<br />
<br />
Part 3<br />
<br />
Return to the halfling and talk to him. He gives you a rapier whose effect is a haste buff and, if you're not level 20 when you do this, you will become a Swashbuckler the moment you ding 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and I'm thrilled to find the Safehouse still going strong!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are actually multiple spots the info can be in, for the secont part, and not all of them are obvious.<br />
<br />
The easiest spot is in the basement, in the desk next to the Dark Elf (who can be either male or female)<br />
<br />
The second spot is in the back of the large room in the greenhouse/actic. This area is patrolled by two guards who can see through stealth, but its easy enough to time your movement so you're on the opposite side from them while you go look<br />
<br />
The third spot is behind a secret panel on a ledge right over the entrance door. Go up the stairs to get to the ledge, open the panel and you'll find a chest inside a hidden storage area. You cant get inside the area, but you can examine the chest from the opening.<br />
<br />
I believe there is a fourth hiding place in the room behind the door on the second floor. There's a bored guard behind this door who is really tough and can see through stealth. Dont open this door, unless you enjoy dying. Let the mish reset and hope it lands in one of the other 3 spots next time.<br />
<br />
<br />
The named boss will spawn on you shortly after you get the goods. Not sure who he is or what the deal is with him since he attacked not only me, but all the guards as well. So I'm guessing he's some sort of rival to you after the same information. But thats just guessing. I was running too quickly to the door to socialize with him. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lashiec</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when you hail the runt in the harbor after finishing the quest he mentions a rival that you may or may not see later on.<br />
<br />
after reading your post the dialogue makes more sense now (no boss NPC spawned when i did the quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvorn</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll predict the named boss will come into play later in your career. He saw you and  knows who you are. Seems like a great lead in to set up a future quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyy Daugg</div><div class="date">12-02-04, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how do you know that the effect on this thing is a haste buff, or that there is any effect at all?  Every item I've gotten gives no info on effects at all.  I'm not doubting you, I'd just like to know how I can find these things out.  I'm using the rapier now, and I get no buff proc from it that I can tell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">01-31-05, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to be a citizen of the appropriate city to take the quest. So sneaking wont work, but doing the betrayal quest to change citizenship will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Artisian</div><div class="date">02-14-05, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here’s what I suggest for the “Path of the Swashbuckler”.<br />
<br />
If you are level 18, just hold off on this little quest until you are 19. Why? Why not! Don’t tell me you are all in a hurry to do this when you aren’t even close to dinging 20!! &amp;lt;LOL&gt; No, seriously though, you get a much better “sneak” called Smuggler’s Talent at level 19. This allows you to sneak at a faster pace and also move unnoticed past some of the mobs who could see through your sneak/snoop (and I am not saying named/boss mobs can’t see you, because they can).<br />
<br />
OK, with that alone in mind, let me continue with a little more detail. I really found this site helpful while doing the quest but I just wanted to clear up the locations in a couple areas.<br />
<br />
First, yes, you go to Arrel Silvertongue in Qeynos Harbor. Hmm… so much for clearing up locations, I did not get a loc on him while I was there, but he’s not hard to find. When you pop on the dock, just run toward the market people and turn to your right and he’s on the next segment of docking (wearing dark clothes). Can’t really miss him.<br />
<br />
Arrel will send you on a journey to Blackburrow to do some investigating. You will want to zone into Blackburrow through the underwater tunnel route in Antonica. To find the entrance, run to Sir Jaeger’s Camp (on the Southern end of Antonica) and you will see islands off to the South. The first island is called Wooded Isle. Run across the log to the other island called Memorial Isle. When on that Island, go to the Southern edge of it and look down… you will see a ledge you can run down to before you hit the water. Then look SE, at the mountain range, and you will see an entrance there. That’s to Blackburrow. You will be able to swim a ways through there before having to use your Smuggler’s Talent (I strongly suggest you wait until you get this because the mobs inside the cave before you zone into Blackburrow CAN see through your sneak/snoop!!). You will be alright unsmuggled when you have to swim under water – but keep an eye open for a clearing and come up right away when you see the chance to. From that point on, cast Smuggler’s Talent and follow the tunnel the rest of the way to the zone.<br />
<br />
Once inside, follow the path all the way until you see a cove to your right. Keep moving around in there and some kind of currier runs past and down the tunnel (away from you). This is where my journal updated and I was to go back and talk with Arrel Silvertongue again. The exact name of the currier, I cannot say for sure because my screen was really dark and the mob was moving faster than I could target him. <br />
<br />
Now, once you zone out of Blackburrow and slink past the mobs, to get back in the water again, take Smuggler’s Talent off yourself so you don’t drown while you swim back &amp;lt;lol&gt;. Nope, not talking from experience, but I could just imagine that happening!<br />
<br />
When you talk with Arrel Silvertongue, he then chats with you a while and then sends you on your merry way to South Qeynos to zone in and snoop around the meeting place. Now this is where I got lost… looking for the building.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but what is mentioned on the site, here, and what is written in the Prima Official Game Guide for EQ II for The Path of the Swashbuckler clash. None the less, I picked to do what I read here. Will continue that way I guess &#61514;. Prima mentions how you have to get past the guards and pick a lock. Also mentions the very same thing for a Troubador… so… I listen to what people wrote here and followed their advice. The way it’s mentioned here, is to investigate a stack of books. Picking a lock doesn’t sound too far off, and that’s what I had to do in my last quest… but anyway… on with the rest of the story!<br />
<br />
When you zone into SQ from Qeynos Harbor, run directly East and into the next section there (or gate, as it was mentioned in here – it’s past the benches). Once inside there, head down the path to the right (as if you were going to run to the stables). The building you are looking for will be on your right and directly East of “The Tin Soldier” building and West of the “Coldwind Stables”. Where you want to turn for the entrance to this instant zone is right after passing “The Tin Soldier”. Make a right-hand turn and it’s the first door on your left. Location is: 548.70, -17.30, 256.92.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have a fresh Pathfinder on yourself (just in case things go bad) and use Smuggler’s Talent. Once again, this will save you from being seen by any of the mobs. <br />
Zone in and take a look around the room a little. Where the two guards are standing, go through that door, stop, turn left, go down the steps and keep going… pass those Sabertooth Negotiators (or whatever they are called… they look like regular Gnolls to me) and just keep on going until you find a door. Open the door and you will see a desk to your left, across the room, with books on it. Go up to the desk and inspect it.<br />
<br />
When you do this, Voltari il’Ferceri will spawn upstairs, near the SQ zone in/out and say, “Ah ha! You’ll not get away so easily! I, Voltari il’Ferceri, shall defeat thee!”  :beatup <br />
<br />
He then goes and starts beating one of the Sabertooth Negotiators right where you have to go by to zone out. I did not stand around to see if he could see me or not and just high-tailed it the heck out of there! &amp;lt;LOL&gt;<br />
<br />
Zone out and go back to Arrel Silvertongue for your reward  :D .</div></div><hr />
