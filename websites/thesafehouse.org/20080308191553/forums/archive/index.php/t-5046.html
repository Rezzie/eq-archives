<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">04-28-02, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having thought about what I would most like (Mostly heavier initial hit...) I've changed (Tweaked) my template a bit.  Most of this is coming from points freed up by training stealth a bit less (Not having 50 for a few more realm ranks will not unduly bother me) and calculating more exactly what envenom level I need for Lifebane.<br />
I'm operating on the assumption that I will hit rank 3 if not before, then not long after level 50.<br />
<br />
Stealth 36<br />
Will be near maxed with items and realm bonuses.  Will max eventually.  At 41 I'm not hurting too much with my 39 modified stealth, so the difference from mid 40s to 50 should be minimal.<br />
Blades 39<br />
I want my damage.  This also gives me the Fire Blade-Spectrum Blade chain to try out.  Hopefully will be 50 or above with items.<br />
Envenom 37<br />
+11 items (+5 gem (Infernal Gem of Venom), +4 gloves(Diamond Seal leather, or Epics), +2 necklace (Master Assassin Pendant)) and +2 from realm when I hit rank 3.<br />
CD 7<br />
While I do like having a greater chance of applying two poisons, I just don't engage in extended combat in RvR often enough for this to come into play.  The 7 in it is whatever I had leftover.<br />
CS 46<br />
Hib has only one +CS item that I know of, and that's in a slot I'm using for envenom.  I can most likely max blades with items, but CS needs to be naturally high.  And perhaps someday Rib Seperator will be worth it.<br />

<br />
I've modified my &quot;Hedge My Bets&quot; template to this:<br />
<br />
 Stealth 35:  I still want Safe Fall IV, but... yeah, now that you mention it, I haven't really been having any problems with my current Stealth of 33 (modified to 43), and that's only going to get better.<br />
<br />
 Piercing 34:  A nice solid 2/3 should be sufficient.  The 39 style is part of a chain that doesn't compare favorably to the CS styles.  (Thanks Val!)<br />
<br />
 Envenom 37:  Same reasons... it's enough for Lifebane with items and ranks.<br />
<br />
 Celtic Dual 6:  Where it is now, seems to be doing fine.<br />
<br />
 Critical Strike 44:  The extra points to my PA damage cap should help a bit on low HP targets, and a few levels of Dodger might actually get me evading in RvR to set up the long evade chain for high HP targets.  +CS items, if I ever get any, still help.<br />
<br />
 Realm Abilities:  Current top of the list is See Hidden, Augmented Quickness, Dodger, Mastery of Stealth.  Other tempting possibilities are Tireless, Avoidance of Magic, Wild Arcana, Rain of Annihilation, First Aid.  What I actually go with will depend strongly on how things are actually implemented, of course.<br />
<br />
That leaves me with enough spare points to boost Stealth to 40 if I feel like I'm getting seen too much, or Critical Strike to 50 if I'm comfortable with that and end up using Rib Separation enough to justify it.<br />
<br />
All of which assumes that I'll start getting XP again.    Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is very close to identical to mine:<br />
<br />
42critical<br />
40pierce<br />
37envenom<br />
36stealth<br />
18dual<br />
<br />
I call it the Jack-of-all-Shades template.<br />
<br />
IMO, weaponskill and CS should be kept about the same, with a higher CS being OK in Hibernia since there is such a dearth of +CS items.  I tear people apart, and don't rely on finding sitting people or casters, usually just look for chainmail (leather/studded/reinf in your case).    I figure my PA cap will be close to 700, which is good enough for me.  I care more about two-shotting clerics than one-shotting mages.<br />
<br />
I had my template as having 35 stealth, which I still think is OK, but I already trained that 36th pt (48.5 now, woo).  Argument for not having 50 stealth: only other assassins ever see me because they're moving so slowly also.  Argument for having 50 stealth: I am getting really sick of other assassins seeing me first.  Also, I don't want to have to wear these Unseelie Boots (etc) forever.  36 is still pretty min-max-a-riffic, though.<br />
<br />
37 envenom... been thinking about maybe 36.  I'm at 95k realm points now, and I spend most of my time getting exp, so it's not like R4 is going to be that hard... can I do without Lifebane until then?  I think I may have just convinced myself.<br />
<br />
Celtic Dual is where we differ, and you're not wrong, but here's my reasoning.  The main difference in our templates (if you take one pt off your CS and put it in weapon to match mine) is 3 pts of CS versus 11 pts of CD.  Up to 20, raising CD is cheap.  CD isn't worthless, it's just not worth it at higher spec.  Which is going to help you more: 27 higher PA cap (and slightly higher bonuses on styles), or 5% higher chance to swing both weapons?  My offhand can add 100 damage or more to my PA, let alone the fact that it has a chance to go off every round of every fight.  My best opener without a critical (my best opener   with a critical resulted in a one-shotted Thane) was 614 PA + 71 venom + 100 offhand = 785, and I was level 47 at the time.  Not bad for a sub-50 (no 16.2 weapon) Nightshade.  Two poisons land, your offhand can proc, etc...  this issue isn't vital but consider it.<br />
<br />
PS: Above is 50 spec.  Current (rank 3):<br />
<br />
40+2 critical<br />
39+11 pierce<br />
33+12 envenom<br />
36+12 stealth<br />
18+2 dual<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consistancy is my concern with CD.   If I raise CS over CD, I will see a benefit on every PA.  At 50, I'll have a 38.5% chance of swinging my second blade for x damage.  Over time I will average (y + 5) + .385 * 100 damage.  (y being the average PA, and assuming the extra CS spec will add 5 points average)<br />
Should those points be used for an extra 5%  DW I'd expect to average y + .435 * 100 damage, which both work out to y + 43.5 if you do 100 damage on the offhand swing.  Granted, expecting 2 points in CS to raise my average PA by 5 points is completely unscientific, but I'd rather see my damage increase every time I attack than 43.5% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;but I'd rather see my damage increase every time I attack than 43.5% of the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The flaw in this logic is that you only PA once per battle, whereas CD is checked &quot;every time you attack&quot;.  The damage increase on non-hidden CS styles for 2 pts of CS is probably pretty minimal.  There are other intangibles to CD, such as landing two venoms early or right away.<br />
<br />
As I said, though, I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm also not saying high CS isn't good, just that IMONSHO*, the return on investment is probably better raising one skill many points from a low spec than another skill a few points at a high spec.<br />
<br />
My only suggestion is to go with 44/15 CS/CD instead of 46/7.  Same styles and general flavor of your current template.  I don't think you'll regret it, but feel free to ignore me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ciardha Sidhe</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might be worth finding out if the 39 Blade style is really worth it.  Last time I raised my Piercing spec, a single training raised my Weapon Skill by 4 points.  I'm having a hard time justifying the points to bring Piercing from 34 to 39 since the biggest benefit I see to that is +20 Weapon Skill.  (I'll check that again at 43, since I'm scheduled for a couple of Piercing trains then.)<br />
<br />
Personally, I might be able to raise my Weapon Skill just as much or more by raising Stealth/Envenom closer to natural 40 and then swapping out Stealth/Envenom gear for Strength gear.  I'm still nowhere near my Strength item cap, even though I'm floating within 2 points of my Dexterity item cap - I don't know if that trend continues in the high 40s.  Since you're using Blades, you probably already have more Strength gear on than I do, don't know how close you are to the cap though.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.  Have to ponder the changes coming to combat, but I think I'll put that in a separate thread. Edited by: Ciardha Sidhe at: 4/29/02 12:24:16 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My STR, DEX, CON, Stealth, and Envenom bonuses are all maxed, and QCK is close.  Weapon spec is good.  The DF armor is really good, and the epic armor is even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that all the styles I use in battle (For me at least.. I don't get a diamondback =( are CS styles.  Thus the bonuses for all of my styles are based on CS.  Perhaps it won't add 5 damage to every swing, but it will affect it every time..  Also, I do want to get the 44th CS style, even though I doubt I will get to use it much.<br />
I find CD too random.  I foresee at 50 my battles not lasting beyond Stunning Stab - That's when I run and let poison finish them off, or let them use up their Purge, if they have it.  During each of the 3 rounds of melee I will have a 60%-55% chance of NOT swinging both weapons.  While the total chance of not swinging is much less .6^3 = 21%.  For a 21% chance of getting no benefit out of CD, I choose to get a much smaller benefit out of PA, CD, and SS.  <br />
I'd rather switch weapons between PA and CD to guarantee as much as I can a second poison landing.<br />
<br />
In the end I think this is a taste question.  CD spec has higher damage potential, but the points in CS will result in a higher low end.</div></div><hr />

I really feel that I hurt weaponskill wise compared to pierce shades, due to the partial dex base in pierce.  I'm completely maxed from items on Strength, so I need as much weaponspec as I can get.  (I currently use two epic falcatas.. +5 blades each I think.  My glimmerspirit sword is also +4 or so for the heavy PA damage.)<br />
That's my biggest regret going blades:  The limited weaponskill.<br />

Realm Skills.. I currently have 14 points to spend (Or will)<br />
See Hidden: 8<br />
Then either<br />
Augmented Quickness level 2: 4 (Prereq points)<br />

Augmented Strength is on my list, but it's a lot lower than a few other things, so I'll probably never end up getting it.</div></div><hr />
