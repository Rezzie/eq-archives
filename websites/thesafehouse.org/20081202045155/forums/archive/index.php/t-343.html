I found a druid and he sowed me for the hefty price of 5 plat. On to Kith I go. I come to the entrance<br />
and see a bunch of people sitting there. Hahah losers, to scared to venture into the depths of Kith,<br />
and they 20 seasons above me. Well I take off running, don't want to lose my SoW in the middle of<br />
my trip. Suddenly, hit for 362 damage!! Gasp must run!!! AHHHH!!! HELP RISEN COMMANDER ON MY <br />
ARSE!!! Doh, dead. Greldek shouts to his guild, Damnit will someone come clear this spawn for me?!!?<br />
A fellow guild member replies, which spawn would that be? Greldek shouts to guild,&quot;Kithicor!&quot;.<br />
&quot;Heheh good luck. Where did you die?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh.. somewhere in the middle I think.&quot; <br />
about 20 guild members reply with, LOL idot  .<br />
So I run back to Kithicor and shout, &quot;Any one wanna pull my corpse for 50 plat?&quot; Got a tell from a <br />
necro, and said he'd do it, since he was right by my body anyways. It was then and there, that I <br />
decided I'm gonna hafta show those unead of kithicor who the boss really is.... in about 30 levels.<br />

<br />
Just curious - are there things in Kith that can see through our hide?  I've always assumed that if I don't mind the pace, I'll be safe sneak/hiding through. Bayler<br />

I spend alot of time losing levels in Kith. Kinda sad really   Greldek Draegonbayte                                         &quot;Life is short and hard like a body building elf.&quot; -Bloodhound Gang</div></div><hr />

I have used a tactic several times now that seems to work. Some players will follow a fool into kithicor using them as an early warning system for kos npc's. When i was a wee pup I led several of these PC trains. I ussually died, and they lived. Recently I decided to turn the tables on a few of these PC trains and use my guile (all of these were wall runs to wc btw). So up over a crest. num lock, hide, sneak. WOOSH the train (ussualy just 1 or 2 players). Then unhide, unsneak, numlock. The nice thing about the nasty undead kos in this area is rarely will a PC be able to make it to a zone. I would hate a backwash of these.<br />
<br />
PS: I don't ussualy go at night, unless I need to log soon, and it's a corpse retrieval.<br />

I stuck to the path and I traversed the whole thing at night while sneaking and hiding. Slow going but I assume that if you keep moving that they won't aggro on you.</div></div><hr />

When I came across him it was day time and was red to me at 30. I got lucky and he missed his BS, woot!<br />

Least I allways have though I havnt done the journey in about a month so not sure if the spawn spots have changed.</div></div><hr />

I usually stop to re-sneak/hide at Rivervale then proceed on.  If I have made it to the burned out house unmolested then I know I am scott free. Joonling Gutseeker<br />
