He'd actually grown up a lot during the course of the show.  The problem is the fillers reverted him back to the way he was at the very beginning of the show.  In fact, they made him even stupider.</div></div><hr />

Oh man, total nerdgasm mode.  That opening scene was freaking awsome.<br />
<br />
Hilarious that Naruto is the only one still a Genin.  And Neji is a jounin already!<br />
<br />
We found out the name for what Naruto and Gaara are:  Jinchuuriki<br />
<br />
Other than that, for an hour long episode, nothing much happened because it was like they were introducing the show all over again.  And it ends right before the good stuff!Should probably rename this thread Naruto: Shippuden since that what all the subbers are calling it.</div></div><hr />

The pacing is painful.It's nothing they haven't done all throughout the series.  For example, in Kakashi vs. Zabuza 1.  When 30 seconds after they summoned water dragons, they showed them doing it again.<br />

One thing I do miss though is when the did flashbacks the little black and white hex marks they'd do.  I always liked those.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a difficult time watching the show. At first, I thought it may just be me, and that Naruto was this slow in the past. But as episodes go by, the show just feels slow, the animation is so bad that the cost-saving stuff is so apparent. I mean, please, if Kyoto Animation can give their shows the treatment they do, Naruto can get a movie-esque budget for each episode.<br />
<br />
I found the battles and stuff exciting in the manga, but for some reason or other, it's extremely dull now.<br />

I think I also will be sticking to the manga, at least until Sakura's first fight.</div></div><hr />

The current storyline gets much better once Team Kakashi shows up to help out the Sand (there are some really interesting/cool fights and lots of action).  Of course, with the way the anime series is going, that's also probably 10 episodes away, and all the stuff in between is dull, plus the fights will be drawn out over too many episodes making them feel weak.  <br />

Just as an example, the pursuit of Konkoru after Sasori / Deidara was about three pages, maybe four?  Instead of a whole 1 hour special...<br />

Gimmie something like Full Moon o Sagashite or Aishiteruze Baby, those are the type of stories that I can appreciate when put into a stationary drawn form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I only mentioned it because I had, up until recently, avoided the manga thinking it wouldn't be enjoyable.  But personally, I got tired of waiting for the story to progress as infinite stall tactics were used to delay progression, so I decided to give the manga a shot.<br />

Good episode.  The speeches by Naruto and Sakura in the second half were particularly awsome.  Nice to see some of the character depth back.<br />

Yeah, that's bad as well.<br />

You'd think with the mega-cash cow that Naruto is they could afford some top-rate animation for the show.  Unfortunately they apparently just see it as am opportunity for profit margins to grow exponentially larger...</div></div><hr />

Ya. Its sad to say but I agree. Naruto has just turned into a cash cow =/. Also doesn't help that otaku will prob buy it anyway =/. <br />

I actually think that's why he's always using Sharingan, because he's blind without it.  Which I think is a rather interesting drawback to using something that powerful.</div></div><hr />

It's just sloooooow.  Lots of scenes where everyone is just standing around.  And where they repeat stuff over and over.<br />

I guess they've slowed it down to one manga chapter an episode.  Which you assume would be to avoid filler.<br />
<br />
Problem is, they already did 2 years of filler.  They don't have to do both.  You have eons of filler it means you don't have to slow down the real episodes.<br />
<br />
I dunno...just bored.  Naruto has been jumping on logs for like 4 episodes.</div></div><hr />

they have a lot of no episode weeks<br />

the animation is near filler style, and not just because the fights are taking so long, but its just really poor quality, just look at the scenes of guy lee and the others, or of sakura randomly hitting the iron sand...its pretty sad.<br />

episode 1-2 were really really good, and i just thought that maybe it would continue to be good...but its just....bad.</div></div><hr />

Naruto starts going Kyuubi2 and then does...absolutely nothing.<br />

<br />
i read the manga for quite a while, but quit in june i think...but from what i remember, to what i just saw, most of the episode and the last few actually were quite a bit different then the manga.<br />
<br />
anyway, there is a lot of debate about the mangekyo sharingan's, but the majority believe the different eye shapes and subsequent powers from them are from how they attained there individual sharingan.  for example, itachi went with the legend and killed his best friend to get mangekyo.  kakashi obviously didn't kill his best friend, but got the eye from him, as well as he has lost a lot over the years in terms of friends, and students.  just a guess.  sasuke's looks different too.<br />
<br />
the pacing of naruto is sucking a lot, the manga had way more action during those fight scenes, and its freaking still pictures!  you'd think with it coming out every 2 weeks it would suck less, the anime is a long way from catching up to the manga as well.</div></div><hr />

There was nothing about it I didn't like.  And there wasn't even any battling in it.  It just hit every note perfectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus the new opening just has me psyched.  So much going on.  So many new people.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden I'm just right back into this show.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I liked it a lot - I won't even try to hide that I got misty eyes at some scenes. But then I'm weak for death scenes and ppl saying their farewells.<br />
<br />
The next arc is pretty interesting, you should keep watching.<br />
<br />
It moves the story back to other &quot;loose ends&quot; from the original Naruto series before fillers started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This series is finally ****ing back today!  And I mean back, back.  Back to being ****ing awsome.<br />
<br />
4-Tails Naruto is the ****!  The **** I say!<br />
<br />
<br />
And the 3 minutes they spent revealing Yamato's origins we pretty good too!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the 4-tailed is awesome - wait for the fight next time - Orichimaru has some stuff to say about that too :) I can't even try to imagine what the 5- or 6-tailed cloak might be like... *shiver*<br />
<br />
Besides, it was obvious it's going to be great since Orichimaru and Kabuto are involved :)</div></div><hr />

I dunno, this whole episode I wanted to shout at the screen, &quot;DO SOMETHING!&quot; Still awesome, but... man, felt like DBZ with all the dead space and powering up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">12-21-07, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone else was saying that on the anime forum I visit, but I honestly didn't notice it.  I mean, I was aware that there was alot of standing around, but I didn't care because I was so anxious to see what happened when he finally did.<br />

<br />
<br />
No Naruto till Jan 10th sucks balls!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">12-21-07, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, the biggest problem I have with the Kyuubi Cloak thing is that whenever it comes out since the timeskip, Naruto stands there looking all pissed for a while, maybe hits something with enough force to cause the rest of their body to be sucked into the point of impact, and then stands there looking all pissed for a while whilst everybody just... looks at him. I'm anxious as HELL to see him do something, but so far he has shot a hadoken from his mouth, and punched Oro 10 miles through the forest and only left a scratch on the guy's face...<br />
<br />
Oh, and made gigantic craters wherever he was standing. I want to see him kill somebody already! (Preferably artist dude)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">likenew</div><div class="date">12-21-07, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">all thats happening is they keep building up, making you believe some great action scenes are going to take place....but then they don't.  naruto is far from back compared to before the timeskip.  i think the animators from the fillers have been doing the all of these episodes, because its the same boring action.  the manga had more action, and those were still pictures!<br />
<br />
also, dbz's powerup episodes were better, much better.</div></div><hr />

Talk about a new low.</div></div><hr />

And I've seen them all.</div></div><hr />
