<br />
for me its <br />
<br />
random action<br />
    roll a 1d3 (1d6/2 round up) for tagets actions- lasts 1 round per caster level -reroll every time the target gets a turn to find its action that round.<br />
 1  it does nothing<br />
 2  runs away from caster at max moment rate<br />
 3  attacks closest thing to it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends ... if I am playing and look for sheer usefulness and power, Magic Missile (Number of missiles = level/3. Damage per missile 1d4. Interrupts spellcasting and is frighteningly fast)<br />
<br />
For versatility and fun ideas, I love Grease. It summons super-slippery grease to where the caster wishes it. Whether you use it for making monsters fall over, getting the barbarian through the doors in halfling houses, or sliding down a slope on a shield, it's a complete blast.<br />
<br />
When I'm DM'ing, nothing even comes close to Limited Wish. It allows the player to make a wish, but if he words himself badly (or I simply don't think he should get his wish fulfilled), it can go horribly awry. For example, the wish &quot;I wish I could stay this happy for the rest of my life&quot; may result in immediate death, or &quot;I wish for a horde of summoned monsters to assist me in my battle&quot; may result in 30 bunnies appearing out of nowhere to attack the opponents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wall of Force summons a big indestructable wall (or sphere) proportional to your level which is transparent and Wall of Iron just brings a big iron wall proportional to your level.<br />
<br />
You can do so much awesome things with those spells.<br />

Other than that - <br />
Cantrip is extremely fun to mess around with and any of the higher Phantasmal forces (illusion spells) are a blast too. Glip the Gnome<br />

L1, never misses, no save, 1d4+1 (is that right?), extra missile every 3 levels, 1 seg cast time.<br />
<br />
After about L3 or 4, when stuff turns immune to sleep, mm was about the only 1st level spell I'd ever keep memorized!</div></div><hr />

Rego Herbam 25 I  think. Animates and controls a tree.<br />
<br />
To normal warriors its invincible. Hit it with a sword? I don't think so. No central nervous system, doesnt feel pain, made of solid wood. Sap still running, so it burns very badly, you will NOT get time to cut it down and it has many many branched to hit you with. One or two of these can take down an army.<br />

With eyes closed. Then flee. Risky, but can produce fine results.<br />
<br />
Contact Hound of Tindalos. A creature which, when it notices someone will relentlessly pursue the person through time and space and brutally kill them<br />

Needless to say, you do NOT cast this yourself. Leave it in a book you think is at risk of being stolen. Title the spell 'Call Loyal Defender' or 'Summon Source of Knowledge' or similar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a mage who is in command of a mercenary company, and I like to sit in my tent, and conjure a globe shaped scrying point over the battle field and have the view surround me, and I stand in the center.  It's like my own little Membari holographic command room thingy to lead the battle with.  It really wows the subordinates too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kehvrynne</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer &quot;thinking rogue's&quot; spells like  Item,  Rope Trick,  Audible Glamour,  Change Self, and  Sleep.  Much more elegant than messy stuff like  Magic Missile or  Fireball.  I once overcame a chance encounter with a minotaur with judicious use of Audible Glamour.  The entire party was at best Level 3, and were foolish enough to close for melee.  <br />

Dunno if they changed them in 3rd ed. But in any event, Continual Light/Darkness. Sounds like an odd choice I know but there's just been so damned many times I've thought to myself &quot;Screw a vorpal sword, what we really need right now is a little light so at least we'll know exactly what is about to eat us&quot;. Or in the case of a blind-fighting specialist rogue &quot;What I really need right now is a lot less light&quot;.<br />
<br />
I tend to like more subtle spells more, like cantrip, rope trick, silence. They're just a lot more fun. Everybody sees the fireball coming, I like to disappoint those everybody.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reverse gravity + Bag of Tricks:<br />
<br />
pull out some furry balls, have a sorcerer reverse gravity on them. lift them a few hundred feet into the air.<br />
<br />
say the magic word.<br />
*POOF*<br />
rhinocerous's rain from the sky.<br />
<br />
or Puddle of Grease (girl in my last campaign had this as her main weapon)<br />
<br />
make a puddle of grease under your opponent--he has to beat your role + caster level or he falls, and has to do that every turn.<br />
<br />
now, set the grease on fire. a monk with flaming fists, or something, will do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Qutsemnie</div><div class="date">04-07-02, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dunno 3rd edition. 2nd edition i played over the table and thought i knew well. took a break got into baldurs gate and explored just how broke d and d was...<br />
<br />
most underrated spell:<br />
horror... 3 casters line up with horror odds are in a player with 9 for saves vs spells is running.  and its AE....   name level characters fleeing in terror from 3 3rd level casters by the dozen (just as an image not as a use)!  i mean lets say your fighting a group of 6 characters with a 5!!! for save versus spells.  they have a 75% chance of saving the first horror. they only have a 56% chance of saving against both however. and finally to save against all 3 they only have a 42 % chance.  so here we have very very strong characters 6 of them such that they have a 5 sv spells yet 3 to 4 of them will run on the first wave of 3 blast of a 2nd level spell.  nifty.  i abused this spell in bladurs gate.  <br />
<br />
It gets worse when used with that 4th level spell that lets you load up two 2nd level spells as casting time 1 abilities.   sigh that was 6 horrors! of those starting 6 odds are only 1 of them will stand and fight.  the other 5 are effectively out of it unless that one that saved on luck can do something to counteract horror.  and this was with a save versus spells of 5!!! a really awesome save number.   <br />
<br />
i agree about magic missle.  generally stoneskin prior to the encounter + mirror image either on condition of sighting enemy or cast first round.  after that three casters again can do brutal things with magic missle.  i went with that or chain casting horror depending on if there was one guy that had to die or many people that had to die.<br />
<br />
haste was strong to but it was never represented right in baldurs gate 2.  it had an age component that kept it from being abused in the 2nd edition rule.  so i still stand with horror.<br />
<br />
also note that clerics of certain gods could:<br />
1) change their str to 25<br />
2) hit for max damage every time<br />
3) give themselves the thaco of a warrior.<br />
by stacking spells all at once...  woot. that was fun and broke too. such a cleric had to be dispelled. but good luck cause i hit you with 6 horrors at casting time of 1. laugh<br />
<br />
yar that can come back at you.  one of the funniest things in Baldurs gate 2 was taking on those casters that tried to take you in for using magic.  thats where i got all this stuff from. those guys dont break any rules.  so you can go at them just like they go at you. and its a puzzle but its solvable and fun. going melee will never do it though =)<br />
<br />
though melee + haste + other thaco buffage was by far the easiest way to play the game it wasnt the most powerful way to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
generally though good dms prevent spell abuse. using the same technique in many encounters is boring anyhow. but baldurs gate 2 was an interesting simulator.  bet they learned somethings about d&amp;amp;D and made some positive changes.  D&amp;amp;D has a history of reacting well to that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Audrie</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In one of our game, we have a blade singer (blade dancer?). A blade dancer can cast a spell (from a certain list) as a free action if he does a full attack action.<br />
<br />
Among these spells is true strike...<br />
<br />
Comes the great powerful demon with his +5 vorpal keen sword, blade dancer gets initiative, gets in close quarter, makes a full attack action. He then cast true strike has a free action and says: &quot;I make a disarm!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now THAT is an original way of using true strike... Makes for a sure disarm... So that is why it is one of my favorite spell.<br />
<br />
Note: You could use true strike in a previous round, then move in close combat and make a single attack at +20 (that attck could be a disarm).<br />
<br />
2nd note: Get improve disarm, prevent these annpying attack of opportunity!</div></div><hr />
