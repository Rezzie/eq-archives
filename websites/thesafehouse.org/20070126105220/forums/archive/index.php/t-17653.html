I than follow the quest through to winterspring. Without giving much away you will than find yourself in the lake outside the ruins of Caer Darrow hehe :) Funny lady that one. Anyway I meet with Jeziba and he says he is a sculptor, a scupltor of Heroes. I am than asked to read the catalogue of the wayward and get back to him, but I never was given said catalogue&gt;? Anyone else messed around with this quest? Let me know. Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually no, that's a different quest, from the Catalogue of Malyfous (sp?) in Winterspring.  <br />
<br />
And IMO dropping 300g on it is well worth it if you end up with the other rare drops - just don't drive yourself crazy trying to get them, take them as they come.</div></div><hr />
