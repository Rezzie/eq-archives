<br />
As to a post-apocolyptic D20 system ... no ideas off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Dragonstar?<br />
Fading Suns?<br />
Darwin's World?<br />
Traveller?<br />
All the futuristic ones I could think of ... not sure how many are post apocolyptic though. Edited by: Lady Kaylan at: 6/5/03 11:00 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is Shadowrun post-apocalypse, or just cyberpunk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">06-05-03, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shadowrun is Cyberpunk Style.<br />
Twilight 2000 was awsome, but wasnt d20.  I still remember my Spec-Ops jumping off a cliffside 7 story building with a parachute after sniping the drivers of the vehicles coming up on the place.<br />
Had another guy that was strong enough to carry his own FAV when it couldent cover rough terrain.</div></div><hr />

If you like playing every role playing game by the same rule set, I guess it works. Personally, I think it can sap the vitality and soul of certain genre to design it by the rules, as opposed to designing the rules by it. &quot;It's like every chatroom cliche crawled into Safehouse to die&quot; -Caowyth<br />

<br />
overall I didn't like it. I didn't think d20 fit modern stuff like gunplay whatsoever, and wouldn't like it for a futuristic setting either.<br />
<br />
so far as I've seen, d20 was designed for fantasy and has worked best for that. if I want modern, I'll use world of darkness d10 or something. if I want futuristic, I'll play shadowrun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TribalGeek</div><div class="date">06-05-03, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how does rifts play i heard there is no game board and everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">06-05-03, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same as your typical RPG ... imagination, pencil &amp;amp; paper, and bucketloads of dice.  There's the main sourcebook and then shitloads of add-ons.  There's basically one book for every major land mass in the world and then all kinds of other junk as well (the Atlantis and Japan books were some of my faves).  The ability scores and skill system will be totally different than anything you're used to (this is assuming you've at least played D&amp;amp;D) but it's still pretty simple to learn.<br />
<br />
Rifts by far is one of my favorite settings / systems.  One of the things I like most about it was you could combine all the other Palldium games into it.  We usually played with a ton of Robotech mechs and used TMNT for mutant creation.  Also bust open the Ninja's &amp;amp; Superspies book for cool martial arts and gadgets.<br />
<br />
I don't know where you live Tribal, but if you're interested in picking up any Rifts books (or any books by Palladium) and near a Wizards of the Coast / The Game Keepers store, they're all 70% off cover price.  Can't beat that ... roughly equates to $7-8 per book.</div></div><hr />

If it's a Game Keeper near you, don't bother ... most likely won't have a good selection.  If it's a WotC it should be worth it to go ... usually have tons and tons of books to get rid of.</div></div><hr />
