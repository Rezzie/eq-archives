<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tham</div><div class="date">09-27-06, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It used to be when I started playing EQ in Sept of 00', that the guilds, and the members were fiercely loyal to each other. It was very difficult to join a guild, but once you did, in most cases, you never left. The guild members were devoted to each other and the guild name. <br />
They would do their best to group with each other first, porters would go out of their way to offer rides to fellow members. When someone needed help with a quest or mob or a corpse run, guild members would drop what they were doing to help out. <br />
<br />
Today it seems the atmosphere is much different. Current guilds seem to be a mish mash collection of individuals who will fight with each other, ignore requests for assistance and quit the guild at the drop of a hat if something doesn’t go their way or directly benefit them. <br />
My goal with Violation is to return to the basic principles that guilds were initially created with, while at the same time, staying competitive, having fun, and advancing into the content of Vanguard. This can only be successful by having outstanding members who are mature, dedicated and driven to succeed. <br />
<br />
