<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brandyn Aquilius</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is base damage calculated?  So far I have this:<br />
<br />
dps x delay x quality x quality x condition<br />
<br />
So how does level fit into the equation?<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone knows exactly how delay is affected by quickness, please let me know that too. Aurra Sing - 33 InfiltratorDracos DivinusAlbion, Igraine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Squink McPoke</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to take into account the spec level of the weapon type that you're hitting with too.<br />
<br />
Unspec'ed you'll do 25-100% damage. 2/3 spec you'll do 75-125% of base damage, etc, on up to 100-150% base damage at full spec.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, not sure if you're asking about base damage to be used in the above calculation, or base damage as in normal melee hit.<br />
<br />
Level plays into it passively.  It affects the con of the mobs you fight (your level compared to theirs), and against lower con mobs you do extra damage, against higher con mobs you do less damage.  Having a higher level also affects the con of the weapon you're using, and your DPS cap for the level. -- Huff McTuff, 41 Nightshade, Pendragon<br />

I'm asking how the game figures out what your base damage would be if it was exactly 100%.<br />
<br />
Yeah, what damage is used in the calculation.<br />
<br />
So if a level 20 char has a weapon:<br />
<br />
dps = 10.0<br />
delaly = 3.0<br />
qua = 100%<br />
cond = 100%<br />
<br />
Then base damage (dps x dly x qua x qua x con) = 30?<br />
<br />
Then do you add your level?  i.e. 30 + 20 = base damage of 50?<br />
<br />
Then how exacly does target con factor in?  Subtract target level from char level?  So If char level is 20 and target is 15 then 30 + (20-15) = 35?<br />
<br />
Target level 25: 30 + (20 - 25) = 25?<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is that I'm trying to build a calculator that will show how much damage a character of a given specializaton can do against a target of a given level/con.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I'd like it to be able to provide damage ranges for syles as well, but lets keep it &quot;simple&quot; for now, and just try to figure out what that base damage is.  Any help? Aurra Sing - 33 InfiltratorDracos DivinusAlbion, Igraine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dither DAoC</div><div class="date">02-20-02, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is very hard to calculate, because of AF, and how it might relate to weaponskill.  The most raw form of the equation is damage * spd * qua * con, which makes sense, but isn't really provable yet.  Any other modifications are really speculative, and are also very hard to pinpoint.  Static tests vs exact same monster/player are really the only way to accurately test something like this, with pvp being the best option, because you know the other player's af beforehand.  Unfortunately, absorb also comes into play somewhere, and its role is also questioned a lot, with many people thinking absorb is the %chance to completely absorb a blow, as opposed to a %reduction to damage dealt.<br />
<br />
I think they have done a neat job at making DAoC harder to min-max than many people thought it would be. Dither Disgustipated<br />
