<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zyvalla</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody know the repop time on Renux?<br />
<br />
I just cannot understand the logic behind it.  Shamans can make a bearskin bag to combine potions for a simple tailoring combine.  Any rogue with the skill can make a GM Assassin's vial as a tradeskill trophy.  So why does Renux despawn on a successful completion of the quest for the seal and have such a LONG respawn time to come back?<br />
<br />
I spent COUNTLESS hours faming old-world green crap to get all the pieces for the old useless poisons.  Luckily, I still had my old eyerazzia.  I run to WK with all 10 items in hand only to find Renux not there.  WHY?!  The stats on seal are exaclty the same as the vial, except that it summons a bag to stack poisons.  Is that so overpowered that we can only have ONE come into the game every few days?  What kind of STUPID crap is that?  <br />
<br />
So now I have to carry around 10 useless items (well, 9 USELESS items and the vial) for weeks on end until I can get lucky enough to find that npc up because somebody decides to have an EVIL sense of humor and torment the players.  Like I have nothing better to do that sit in WK staring at the walls while all my companions level and spend countless more hours on bugged flag scripts.<br />
<br />
This is absolutely REDICULOUS!<br />

She is in a hurry to return the items which were stolen, so it only makes sense that she vanishes once she has obtained the replacements.<br />
<br />
The respawn rate is a tad slow, but stackable poisons are worth the wait IMHO.<br />

This morning, I got up early (about 4 hours sleep), and she was still not up.  I waited an hour this morning and never saw her.  It seems more like RL days than game days to me. /cry<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dasche</div><div class="date">10-29-02, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was there waiting for Renux, Gindlin Toxfodder despawned and respawned 3 times (once each EQ day) before she finally showed up again.  She seems set to 4 EQ days (a little under 5 hours).  When I went back later that day with my friend to witness his turn in there were two Renux Herkanors up, occupying the same space, was trippy looking when her idle animation was going.  Both responded when he hailed, was pretty funny.  One despawned from the turn in and the other was left there for whoever came by next.</div></div><hr />

I was annoyed, because Gindlen depopped at the same time.  I was about to leave when he repopped, leaving himself and 2 Renuxes on different timers for their idle animations.  Definitely weird.

<br />
I sat for over 3 hours last night, the first 9 pm gametime nothng happened.  Next gameday, Toxfodder debopped and repopped twice, then at 9 pm, she spawned.  And sure enough, would not talk to me.  That evil EVIL wench!<br />
<br />
My luck, another rogue was there waiting, so that rogue got the seal, while I got to run to Qeynos and shove mead down Tumpy's throat, then tell Hanns that there's a mole about a hundred times.<br />
<br />
I run back and sit there another hour and a half, get mad and log to sleep.  This morning early, I log in and wait for the next 9 pm gametime, and no spawn.  Then I have to come to work.<br />
<br />
For anyone working on this damnable quest, before you sit and wait on that lowlife wench, run to Qeynos and check faction.  It takes less time to run check faction than it does to wait for her, then have to check and fix.  And it would seem that killing the goof for our epic was a faction hit, plus killing her again and again for friends epics and for the HE mask.  <br />

I talked to her, found my faction was froaked and went and got my faction up. As I'm running back over someone else is doing the hand in and she poofs.<br />
<br />
Next day (RL) we're doing Ragefire and waiting for a couple of epople to get online. I toddle over at about 3pm game time and voila, shes there.<br />
<br />
Both times both her and Tox have been up together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zyvalla</div><div class="date">10-31-02, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By shoving mead down Trumpy and telling Hanns he ha a mole, you can go apprehensive to ally in a few hours.  With the spawn rate and faction hits on bandits, it would take weeks to make that kind of move, and killing bandits isn't worth the time.<br />
<br />
First night, I left a druid there watching for her, while I ran all over killing every bandit in site and killing the giants and anything else that moved, mostly because I was bored.<br />
<br />
She will miss a spawn.  I guess my luck, I got there almost every missed spawn.<br />

<br />
Why is the Dev Team so moronic as to make us befriend the Circle of Unseen Hands, who has no major quests?  who you spend hours screwing over in the course of gaining our epics?  and now who we must kiss-butt with in order to get our GMAS?  Is the Dev Team at Verant aware there is a story line to our quests?  are they hopelessly moronic?  or just a bunch of sadists?<br />
<br />
Anyways, not wanting to rape my Qeynos faction entirely, I set off killing bandits.  Lots of Karana bandits.  As far as the Karana Bandits were concerned, Death Incarnate was 3 feet tall and had furry feet.  <br />
<br />
And 305 Karana Bandits later, I was DUBIOUS with Renux.<br />
<br />
Sadly, one cannot do the mole mission with Hanns unless you are amiable.  I tried by sneaking behind him to obtain an indiff faction and he said something about needing to do more to further our ends.  &amp;lt;sigh&gt;<br />
<br />
So guess I'll be killing another 1000 Bandits to get to amiable... just so I can stack poison.... sheesh... &amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&quot;http://www.face-pic.com/pics/f/a/faegin.2.jpg&quot; BORDER=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &amp;lt;/center&gt;<br />

<br />
Total Count = 618 Dead Karana Bandits - moved from Scowling to Apprehensive<br />
<br />
Edited: At 885 Karana Bandits, I hit Indiff... so I ran over and sure enough, Hanns accepted my report of the &quot;mole in the High Pass guards&quot;... made a hot key and 15 minutes of clicking later was ally...<br />
<br />
Glad someone pointed out the Indiff issue... I would have tried to kill my way to amiable for no reason... now I just need to make my GMAV and I'll be all set  <br />

<br />
I placed the required objects in the box and hit the combine button. I then gave her the box back and she ate it saying that I should improve my faction.<br />

Just a warning. This quest seems to be bugged in a similar fashion to the Shaman epic. My petition has been esculated to the GM for whatever that is worth.<br />
