<br />
Been told just to drop down from somewhere (anyone know where a map is thottbot doesnt have one) then just clear the room and kill him, rinse repeat till you get the Toxic Revenger.  <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you enter the instance, walk straight out, clearing any mobs necessary.  There will be a very small set of stairs leading down from where you are to either your right or left (can't remember), then another set a short distance away leading up.  You want to drop down in the big open area near the set of stairs leading up.<br />
<br />
At level 31 I stealthed and fell the whole way without dieing, regened health near the wall, took out the nearest ooze, then waited for Viscous to wander nearby and ganked him, looted dagger and bugged out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started soloing him at 35, probably could have done it sooner if I had my tatics down right and wasnt using old equipment.  Kept trying to take him on without clearing a slime/horror out of the way first, mistake.<br />
Be sure to clear yourself some fighting room before you take him on.  Adds are the death of you if you dont.</div></div><hr />

going to try my luck with this once i get some time off</div></div><hr />

Its in the northwest down a tunnel.  Take the elevator down and head to one end of the tunnel there.  Both go to an enterence but the right hand path has a locked door in front of it.  The left path takes you to the 'front door'<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you didnt know.  Gnomeragen has a bunch of leper gnomes outside of it.  Shows your in the right area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Viscous Fallout (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html?wmob=7079), if you want info on other drops or whatever.<br />
<br />
Toxic Revenger (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=9453) is the same damage/delay as Tigerbane (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=1465). Tigerbane gives you +18 attack vs. beasts (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?wspell=19691), while TR has a 5/5 nature AE DoT (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?wspell=11790). It requires 33 instead of 27, but if you're doing it at 35 then it's a moot point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slothy</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Biggest Difference is:  Tigersbane is random drop... where as Toxic Revenger is off a specific monster in an instance thats apparently easy to get to and to solo.</div></div><hr />

Called &quot;AH&quot; in Ironforge. =) Got the pair for 2g and some change, which seemed worth it to me.<br />

Though I am planning on helping a friend a few levels lower get a TR...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
btw, what weapons should I go pick up to compliment this?  lvl 34 at the moment most likely solo, possibly duo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Underdawg Darogue</div><div class="date">01-09-05, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Midnight mace is nice.  Course at 34 I use Ziggler mainhand and midnight mace offhand.  Ziggler is a dagger and 6dps higher then Revenger.  Mace is 28.5dps. off hand or main hand. I actually have a second mace for main hand when I feel like just burning down with SS.</div></div><hr />

I kept getting the Acidic walkers but it worked out well since my fiancee is a priest and they were a good upgrade for him. Once you get the hang of this, its fairly fast to run thru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaelte</div><div class="date">01-11-05, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it at level 33 on my third or fourth kill...  I've killed him a couple other times since then (for the heck of it) and so far I've seen two EB staves, two walkers, and one Revenger...  I think there's another kill or two in there somewhere, but I don't remember the loot so /shrug.<br />
<br />
That reminds me, does anybody know how long you have to be away from an instance before you can start a new one?  I spread out my Ooze kills over a couple days because I didn't know exactly how long the wait was.<br />

<br />
Do it solo, have some random guildy group invite you, AFTER you leave... do it again, leave again, leave group, rinse repeat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khype</div><div class="date">04-07-06, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomeregan is in Dun Morogh, the dwarf/gnome starting area off Ironforge.  Outside the tunnel to the instance are newbie mobs (level 10ish) and two of these guard the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Once in the tunnel, you encounter mid20s gnomes (horde may also be attacked by the fleeing exiles, no clue how tough they are?)  You go down the tunnel, take a U turn and take the elevator thing down.  Below are more mid 20s gnomes, go past them and up the ramp to the &quot;train&quot; area, you will see Invaders/Pillagers mid20s elite mobs.  If stealthed, give the green glowing ones a wide berth because they can area poison you which will drop your stealth.  Take a left and you will pass an open area (this is where hordies get teleported in from Ratchet FYI) and keep going along the upper path or lower path until you see the instance line.<br />
<br />
Once inside the instance, move up till you can see a MoB, all of this first hall is safe from static spawns or roamers.  Up here are more invaders/pillagers, again some are irradiated so be wary if stealthing past them and don't waste time trying to PP these green glowing ones unless you also want to fight them.  You should be within sight of a big circular hole, there are a few options from here depending on your time/luck/skill:<br />
<br />
The simple option: go stealth, wait for wanderers to go away and walk straight off the ledge.  if you aggro something, don't move and either vanish or kill it on the spot, re-stealth and proceed to step F below.<br />
<br />
The semi-simple option: stealth up, walk left to the &quot;clean room&quot; (you are still avoiding the green ones right?) and proceed to step C below.<br />
<br />
The long haul: kill your way to the &quot;clean room.&quot;  Have slowing poison or item because they do run.  Watch for the fast moving roamers to add, a couple of the normal spawns roam slowly as well.  If sapping grouped pairs, try to sap the non irradiated one.  Right before the clean room are 3 tied mobs;  You can stealth past, kill all 3 at once, sap one or get lucky and use evade/return/vanish tactics to seperate them.<br />
<br />
Step C: Once in the clean room, the NPCs are friendly to alliance (hordies go back to The Simple Option above) and there is a mailbox and a vendor on gnomer exile faction to sell to, but he doesn't repair.   Walk to the mailbox and look down, you will see a 2 spawn on your left.  There is also a roamer, so if killing the 2-spawn wait and pull the roamer up to the clean room first. Tip: if you pull one of these back into the clean room, near the vendor, and fight it there one of the NPCs usually casts on you a [priest's stamina buff.] Take the left and you are in the fallout room.<br />
<br />
Step F: In the fallout room, the area leading to the clean room is safe.  If you jumped but didn't aggro anything then freeze, wait for stealth to recycle and sneak to the clean room entrance.  If you aggro something, fight it on the spot, pull it to the clean room side or vanish.  From the clean room opening facing in, start to pull the MoBs on the right side.  ***IF*** there is a **Corrosive Lurker**  DO NOT fight these without either a good 15 levels on them or damage poison(s) because they can drop your melee damage down to 1 and then you can only kill them with combo moves or poisons (non-rogue spellcasters will have an obviously smaller problem but this is a rogue forum.)  After pulling two or 3 of the spawns on the right to the clean room entrance and dispatching them, you can move up and wait for the oversized water elemental, &quot;Vicious Fallout&quot; to wander over to be dispatched.  He isn't noticably harder than anything else you have fought so far.<br />
<br />
Hint: Do not solo past fallout room unless you can handle 10+ of these MoBs by yourself because you **will** set off an alarm-o-bot!</div></div><hr />
