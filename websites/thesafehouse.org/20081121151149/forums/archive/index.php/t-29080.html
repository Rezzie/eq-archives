<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">03-21-07, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to make sure everyone knew about these available quests that involve the Wardship of the Sleeping Moon, Ruins of Vol Tuniel, and Thelaseen chunks in Southern Thestra.<br />
<br />
These are a series of quests that yield class specific armor (called Migenzo's armor for us rogues), with pretty nice stats and supposedly a set bonus will be added within the next 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
They are faction based so it will take a bit of time, but I think they are worth it. All the pieces are rare, with the exception of the BP, Legs, and Shoulders being Heroic.<br />
Basically, heres the breakdown.<br />
<br />
You start with zero faction and get to do a few simple quests as well as a repeatable quest to kill bloodhowlers. The bloodhowler quest gives 500 faction in addition to the 100 faction you get for killing the 100 bloodhowlers. Once you reach 2500 &quot;dynamic&quot; faction, you can continue doing the repeatable bloodhowler quest or you can move down into Vol Tuniel to the Recondite Threshold and start doing quests involving the VT dungeons.<br />
<br />
Armor pieces can drop from anything that gives +Celestine Wardship faction, and as rogues we want the &quot;Ancient Ragged&quot; line. To create Migenzo's armor pieces, you need to look at the armor piece you have and it will have an inscription in the tooltip that says something like &quot;Rul Delso Rore&quot;, which means you need a Rul candle, a Delso rune, and Rore tome. Candles drop from the same mobs that armor drops from. Runes only drop from named mobs, but have a 100% drop rate. Tomes are groundspawns that litter the various troglodyte ruins around VT and Thelaseen. The last thing you need to create the armor is a catalyst. These are free from an npc in Wardship of the Sleeping Moon, but are faction based.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Full&quot; faction required to get each catalyst is:<br />
Tier 1 for Belt, Bracers, and Reinforcement - 2000<br />
Tier 2 for Helm, Gloves, and Boots - 5000<br />
Tier 3 for Shoulders, BP, and Legs - 11000<br />
<br />
The armor is created by taking the armor piece, the 3 components, and the catalyst to the ancient ritual stone in the SW area of Thelaseen. It looks like a floating orb with a pillar of light shooting vertically from it. It has 3 golem guards, that will either need to be killed or trained away. Then all you do is right click the orb and it will make your armor. Keep in mind though, you cannot select which armor it makes. If you have 2 armor pieces and have the components to make 1 or the other, you dont select which one it makes.<br />
<br />
As you gain faction it opens up new quests that take you deeper and deeper into Vol Tuniel and into Thelaseen, Lair of the Drake Riders, so make sure you are checking the Recondite Threshold and the Wardship periodically for these quests. Also the faction grind is not too bad. Mobs in each dungeon give at least 2 faction per kill, and scale up to 4 faction per kill, while nameds can give anywhere from 20-50 faction. Also quest turn ins net anywhere from 500-800 faction each. I have 16.5k faction right now, and all of that has simply been completing quests and exploring these two beautiful premier dungeons.<br />
<br />
You also get other rewards from the quest including 2 nice weapons, the Axe of Portents, and the Sword of Potents. Both of which can morph into different weapon types (i.e. Sword of portents can be a dagger, short sword, or long sword). Perfect for keeping all your skills up without carrying multiple weapons.<br />
Additionally, around about 11k full faction you get a quest for either a nice bow or an orb that summons heroic throwing daggers with 1252 damage (About 5x the damage on anything comparable). Once they fix ranged damage, those are going to be a beast.<br />
Both the bow and the orb are upgradeable to legendary versions also if you desire.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have had a blast down here the last few weeks, and have gone from level 28 to 38, without ever intentionally grinding out exp (double exp weekends helped though). Just wanted to share the information with my fellow rogues, now on to what you all want to see. Oh, I should be making my BP and Legs within the next day or so, but so far it has a dark blue look. Its pretty nice.<br />

<br />
(Those throwing daggers are upgradeable to 1496 damage through the legendary quest)<br />
<br />
Edit 1: Legendary throwing daggers from the &quot;Ancient Weapons of Leth Verael&quot; quest are due for a damage nerf. Cylus stated that anyone expecting a 1252 or 1496 damage ranged item needs a reality check :)<br />
<br />
Edit 2: Adjusted faction numbers<br />
Have fun!<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to mention that evil races will have an uphill battle. You have to start with -8200 faction rather than at zero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+1<br />
<br />
Heh, you are welcome.<br />
One thing I didn't state in my first post though is that tier 1 is doable in a group of 3, or maybe 2, depending on levels and class. Tier 2 and Tier 3 and any dungeon quests will require a full group though.<br />
<br />
Bloodhowlers and overland Troglodyte camps are anywhere from 27-34 3-dot.<br />
Vol Tuniel is 32-37 3-5 dot. Thelaseen, Lair of the Drake Riders is 35-38 3-5 dot with a few 6-dots.<br />
<br />
Tier 2 and 3 runes and tomes are pretty much exclusively restricted to the dungeons. While you can get T3 armor drops fighting the tier 1 trog camps, its very rare. They are much more prevalent in the dungeons. Armor has a good drop rate too. We average a piece about every 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
All the armor sets are named in the same convention as ours, and unfortunately I dont remember the individual names.<br />
<br />
I think sorcerers armor is called Svifwin's xxxxx, but I cant get Curse to come up right now to validate that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silverblade</div><div class="date">03-22-07, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Factions are not right.<br />
Tier 1 Catalyst = +2001 full rating, (4000 dynamic for non-evil races).<br />
Tier 2 Catalyst = +5001<br />
Tier 3 Catalyst = +11001<br />
Weapon Quest = +12001 to obtain the quest<br />
Weapon upgrade = +15001 (I'm not 100% sure on this one but almost sure)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stabbas</div><div class="date">03-22-07, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there must be different faction for different races.<br />
I got the 1st Catalyst at +2k Full Rating, 2nd at +5k and 3rd at +11k, and the final weapon quest at +11.9k. The faction is either bugged or different for each race. Also I have yet to find the Axe of Portents quest, But was able to take the Dagger quest? Is this again to do with Race / Faction... Im now capped at 20k faction (Dynamic) thats +11900 Full Rating.. Ive completed all the armor now and the weapon quests to Ledgendary...<br />
Also would like to add that the Orb is currently bugged, the summoned daggers hit for the same damage as lvl 1 throwing daggers, there is a fix to be added soon.<br />
<br />
Nice Guide. But unsure on a few things with this faction and missing quest :pulid<br />
<br />
Stabbas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">03-22-07, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can one of you really explain the difference between full and dynamic faction to me? I just go buy the parenthetical number when stating factions. i.e.<br />
<br />
Your faction with Celestine Ward has increased by 2 (16000).<br />
<br />
So, as a wood elf, I got the threshhold quests at 2500 faction, and the catalysts were available at 4k, 7.5k, 13.5k.<br />
<br />
Edit: I received the axe of portents for completing the third Vol Tuniel quest (to visit the throne of Vol Tuniel).<br />
I definitely had less than 10k (dynamic faction?) when I got the quest.<br />
<br />
Im finally almost done with my armor quests as well. I need a Kel candle, 2 Sar candles, and 2 Rigva runes. Im unsure whether or not I will take the daggers to legendary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stabbas</div><div class="date">03-22-07, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do /showfaction, you will see that there are 2 types of rating. Dynamic Rating and Full Rating, Dynamic from what i can gather is your kill count faction, for instance.. Killing Bloodhowler - Your Faction with Celestine Ward increases by 1... Full Rating is you current standing with celestine ward. For Instance 2000 is +2000, this means if you started with -8100 full rating faction you have gotten 10100 Dynamic Faction.<br />
<br />
The factions I have shown in above posts are Full Rated faction. 2k, 5k, 11k, 11.9k <br />
<br />
This means because i started at -8100 Ive gotten, because im capped, 20k Dynamic Faction.<br />
<br />
PS- with axe quest did it come from Recondite Threshold and Was there any prequests? Or did it come from Wardship town itself? Cheers ^ and hope that explains the faction thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zincarla Khazidhea</div><div class="date">03-22-07, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the explanation Stabbas. I'll check that /showfaction command next time I am on.<br />
<br />
The axe of portents reward came from the third step in the Vol Tuniel Quests. The first step was &quot;The ceremony of Vol Tuniel&quot; and the second step was &quot;The reawakening of Vol Tuniel&quot;, although I forget what the third step was called.<br />
<br />
They were given by an NPC in the west ruined building of the Recondite Threshhold of down in Vol Tuniel.</div></div><hr />

You can summon stacks of 50 every 10 minutes. They are not no rent so you can stockpile them. I just use them for random pulling right now or to keep my skills up and have about 500 in inventory. It would be great if they would add a bandolier though.<br />
<br />
Their damage is going to get retuned though. One of the Devs posted over on vanguardservers.com that anyone who thinks 1252 damage on a ranged item is realistic...needs a reality check of their own :)<br />
<br />
I doubt I will do the legendary upgrade to the quest because of the rarity of T3 candles, but unlimited ranged items is a great asset to have.</div></div><hr />

Can't remember the name but he's standing on the small platform on the outside of the building with the banker in the Wardship outpost.<br />
Walk up the stairs to the bank from the square with the statue and he should be right there.</div></div><hr />
