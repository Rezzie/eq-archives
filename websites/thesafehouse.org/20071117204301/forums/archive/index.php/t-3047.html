Are they any good?<br />
Do they add anything or are they just fluff? Kheldor DeWinter - 50 Inf - Pellinor<br />

Yeah, I think it's pretty good, but I'm biased  <br />
<br />
It makes the Commonlands, Freeport, Ro, and Ocean of Tears into something more for a pnp game. <br />
There are maps that fit together better than the zones really do. <br />
There are stats for the major personalities of the area.<br />
<br />
It is mostly &quot;fluff&quot; (as opposed to crunch stuff) but it does have some crunchy stuff in it. <br />
Some monsters that haven't been converted to eqrpg yet.<br />
There are some feats for learning at various places, like the arcane school in Freeport.</div></div><hr />

If I would shed my skin, the layers left,<br />
But not the lessons learned<br />
It would not undo what I have done<br />
Or grant forgiveness in some better days to come</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems the Befallen book hasn't been released yet. I had misread another site where some people at Fanfaire got hold of some copies as a promo thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Waiting for Befallen, should be on shelves end of next week.... mmm... buying Befallen then going to see X-Men 2... mmm.... and I'll be done with school to boot! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">05-12-03, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are good books.  Even for non-tabletop players, they are a good read.   They have wealths of information about the areas and even several specific NPCs.  They make the world really come to life, but they are by no means a necessity to run a good campaign. <br />

<br />
Doesn't stop it from being good, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of it may be contradictory to you because you didn't see the material that author was working with. Or in some cases, there was no lore to begin with.<br />
<br />
Though some of it is just plain contradictory and there is nothing to be done about that.<br />
<br />
However, all the material does go back through Sony and they do &quot;okay&quot; all the material before it is printed. For whatever that is worth to you.</div></div><hr />
