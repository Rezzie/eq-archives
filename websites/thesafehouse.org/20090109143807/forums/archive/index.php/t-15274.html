I have not seen anything official yet. Can anyone confirm this, at up to this point, rumor?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">11-07-04, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest waiting for a week or two to see if those who preordered cry bloody murder at server downtime.  Unless they've been able to do some stellar work over the past few days EQ2 will most likely have its share of server downtime for the first few weeks of initial release.</div></div><hr />

yeah, they ported 418 of us to Antonica to try crash it, and it didnt.<br />
Then, when all the GMs left and ppl tried enter Qeynos back, it crashed prolly repetitively and doors were blocked long...<br />
<br />
__________________________________________<br />
<br />
An hour before beta ended they patched short and i hoped it'll be beta-end happening of sorts (big dragon burning down all Qeynos, or whatnot..).<br />
<br />
But it was only a systemwide message like 10 and 4 minutes before shutdown to the contents of: &quot;thank you for helping us test EQ2, blah, blah&quot;.<br />
<br />
I managed to drawn once in the pond before the final shutdown to see how it is (there is message &quot;Ulthien sleeps with the fishes&quot;) and then spent the last 2 minutes dancing on the zone entrance with few more other peeps.<br />
<br />
Goodbye my rusty armor!  <br />
