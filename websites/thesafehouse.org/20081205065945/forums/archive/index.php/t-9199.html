<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Build-up and spine burst are VERY important for a spines scrapper. Get 'em at 4 and 6, Reconstruction at 10, QR at 16. You can put off Integration until your 20s, and I doubt health/stamina will be all that hot for you as you'll have to dump a lot of slots into them to make them even noticeable- but by the time you've got room to get them, you'll know if you need them or not.<br />
<br />
As for slots, 6 in barb swipe/lunge and either spine burst or impale, whichever you find yourself using more, 3-4ish in the one you use less. 5-6 in Fast Healing and QR, and 3-4ish in Build Up (for recharge reduction enhancements). The rest is mostly a personal preference, but you'll probably want to slot up Ripper a lot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree on Build Up, it's essential for when something needs to get dead fast.  I haven't slotted it significantly though, and don't feel the need to.  YMMV if you mind downtime more than I do.<br />
<br />
I find Impale is my bread and butter, and I hardly used Spine Burst through my teens (it was handy early when I needed another attack, and it's making a comeback post-Quills, as I take on large groups more).  With regen secondary it may be easier to keep up with Burst's significant end drain, though, and it's slow can be quite helpful.  Impale is nice simply because you can play blaster on many bosses and lts who you don't want to close with.  Either because they've got sick melee damage (warriors, freakshow) or crippling but short range debuffs (sorcerors, storm shamans).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Spine Burst a ton, but I was swarm/dark and tended to fight swarms of whites and yellows with Build Up. I suppose that might not work well if your only defensive skill is Combat Jumping ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">El Sorriso</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you're right and I dont think I need Stamina, then I also dont need Health or Swift.  This opens up room for not only Burst spines, Build up, and 3 others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">injijo</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find Dull pain to be incredibly awesome.  It's like a get out of jail free card.  It makes soloing or duoing with other scrappers unfairly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">is barb swipe really needed? I suggest you drop it, get lunge, and get build up as early as possible... a good period of double damage is...well, you can't pass it up in your right mind :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grendl nighthunter</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took barb swipe &amp;amp; lunge as my 1st two powers, &amp;amp; I wouldnt change that if I rebuilt today.  The effects of fast heal are going to be negligible at the lower levels, when you need the attacks more than a passive, slow heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">El Sorriso</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd hate to think what my low levels would be like with only Lunge and brawl.  Even now Barb Swipe is a staple.<br />
<br />
   I think I will take the advice to get build up tho.  : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grendl nighthunter</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I justhit 18 a couple of nights ago... instead of taking quills at that lvl, I took Dull Pain.  Although I was REALLY wanting Quills, I took DP because I was gettnig sick of my missions taking so long, due to there being an obscene number of orange con mobs on my missions.   With nothing at all slotted in it, it gives me +195 Hps to start a fight, very handy... That &amp;amp; Reconstruction are incredibly handy powers.  <br />
<br />
Two things made me iffy on quills.. <br />
<br />
1) Its long recharge timer<br />
<br />
2) I had read nothing on how extreme its end drain was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, I am at a loss on my slotting as is...  Every odd level, I place 1 slot in a regen power &amp;amp; a slot in a spines power....  Its slow going to get things where I want them to be....  But I hope in the long run, it will pay off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its pretty much an accepted fact if you want to keep IH up and integration you pretty much need stamina and QR slotted pretty decently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grendl nighthunter</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh, when you say accepted fact, is that something you have learned 1st hand?  I ask because working my way up to Stamina would be quite a hit on my template.<br />
<br />
edit: I asume you are suggesting I 6 slot QR, &amp;amp; Stamina as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things made me iffy on quills.. <br />

The recharge isn't that bad, it's not too much longer than Impale.  I've actually never really paid attention.  It's long enough that if you're stunned and it drops you're screwed for this fight, but not so long that you have to conserve it.<br />
<br />
The end cost is fairly significant, it basically nullifies my standing regen (as a reflexes scrapper, not regen).  Probably costs about as much as a couple Spine Bursts over the course of a big fight.</div></div><hr />
