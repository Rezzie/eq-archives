<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gunshotwound</div><div class="date">07-25-02, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since a thrust of 3 at level 20 still gives me 2/3s spec ((spec/player level)+1.25)/2), wouldn't it be just better to spec<br />
all CS,ENV,STEALTH and maybe some dual wield?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of respec here, and of just relying on CS for my styles rather than confounding my abilities with thrust styles, cs styles and some DW styles.<br />
<br />
If I keep thrust at 2/3s (using the above published formula), I shouldn't be too badly off.</div></div><hr />

That formula is not your spec, it is average damage IF your spec is LESS than 2/3 of your level.<br />

Actually, I've said repeatedly that weapon specialization is very important to CS. Somehow, the word just never spread. <br />
<br />
Weapon specialization controls your base melee damage, in the way that we described on the Herald. This is the first I've heard of the &quot;Step Theory&quot;, and I can tell you flat out it's not accurate. It's a smooth algorithm, with no sudden thresholds, every point of weapon specialization moves your minimum damage up (and therefore reduces your damage variance). <br />
<br />
With no specialization, your damage varies from 25-125% of your base (which is determined by your weapon's stats and your level). From there to 2/3 specialization, the minimum damage you will do is increased linearly up to the 75% mark, at 2/3 specialization it will be 75-125% of base per swing. Past 2/3 both minimum and maximum raise until at 100% spec your range is 100-150%. Points from items *do* count in this calculation. <br />
<br />
If you are unspecced in your weapon, you are gutting your melee capability, there's just no other way to say it. And since Assassin characters are in fact melee classes, gutting your melee guts your effectiveness as a class. You don't need (and probably don't want) 100% spec in your weapon skills, but you most certainly want them somewhere between 1/2 and 2/3. <br />

Given the above information, it is not hard to determine the equations for the lines defining MIN and MAX damage.<br />
<br />
MIN: (((spec/level)*.75))+.25)*100%<br />
MAX: The greater of 125% or (((spec/level)*.75)+.75)*100%<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming Dave's comment means CS spec determines MAX damage, ,and weapon spec determines MIN damage:<br />
<br />
At level 20, with only 3 spec in thrust, and assuming MAX CS, <br />
points spent in both lines: 214<br />
MIN: ((3/20)*.75 + .25)*100%=36.25%<br />
MAX: ((20/20)*.75+.75)*100%=150%<br />
the average damage woudl run (36.25+150)/2=93.125%<br />
but individual numbers would be sporadic.  You might see a really high hit, followed by a really crappy one.<br />
<br />
I would much rather have lower CS, ,and higher weapon:<br />
Say 13 weapon, 13 CS, points spent in both lines: 180<br />
MIN: ((13/20)*.75+.25)*100%=73.75%<br />
MAX: ((13/20)*.75+.75)*100%=123.75%<br />
AVG: (73.75+123.75)/2=98.75%<br />
Damage will be MUCH more consistent AND your regular melee fighting won't suffer.  <br />
<br />
With 13CS/13weap at level 20, I've spent LESS points than you AND get more consistent damage, though not as high  MAX damage.  Plus, I have 34 more points to spend on Envenom or Stealth, than you had.<br />

<br />
Look at the &quot;increased ramp&quot; on damage.<br />
<br />
I try and keep all my higher assassins over 85% weapon, after the half dings over 90%<br />
<br />
As far as I know its the only area Mythic's &quot;Diminishing Return Rule&quot; doesn't apply. You get TWICE the return on a train point over 75% of level trained as you do below it.<br />
