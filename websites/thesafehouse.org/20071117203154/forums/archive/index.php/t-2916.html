<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">03-19-02, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know its being converted to third edition, but one thing that always bothered me was the goofy combat system.  Why would a ship suddenly loose all of its hull points and then break apart instantly?  So...<br />
<br />
I traded some Magic cards for the 3 box sets of the Warhammer Man-O-War game, now out of print.  I am in process of converting the system over.  Combat is sweet in that system.  Both have a galleon, and I am using that as the conversion formula.  Unfortunately, my time is a lot shorter then I would prefer.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone have these resources and want to help out?   Turlo Lomon<br />

<br />
It's called catastropic depressurization.  When the hull is breached, the atmosphere inside blows out, tearing the ship to pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never played Spelljammer, though. I just read a brief description of it once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">03-19-02, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ships do carry their own atmosphere.  They have gravity planes, etc.  The ships currently use Hull Points (HPs) for damage.  The Man-O-War system has wonderful hit location, and damage saves.  (works very quickly in actual play too).  Its just a matter of making the ships larger.<br />

Since everything is out of print, it is hard to find.  So, Caowyth...you think my idea for a new combat system might work? (From Spelljammer perspective)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">03-20-02, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Turlo, I played a lot of Spelljammer &quot;back-in-the-day&quot; and I always ended up winging the ship-to-ship combat, but that was mostly because I wanted to focus the campaigns on individual interaction. I haven't played Man-o-War, but have heard good things about it, I think the major problem you're going to run into in the conversion is the lack of vectored movement. (in space, you don't have to be &quot;turned toward&quot; the direction you're moving) I would suggest at least skimming the Battlefleet Gothic rules or (probably better yet) the Dream Pod 9 rules for space combat in Jovian Chronicles. Just a couple of suggestions. Don't get discouraged, man, it sounds like a fun project.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing you might have to do is some conversion for spell damage and range tables, and somehow account for the Z axis.<br />
