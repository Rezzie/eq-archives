<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaranHB</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, hello!<br />
<br />
Up until pretty recently I've been enjoying my Freeport Half elf rogue immensely. However recently I'm noticing that my damage is becomming sub-par, my debuffs are barely noticeable, and my defense is laughable. Now don't get me wrong I'm not flaming the class or anything here. If I'm noticing that my effectiveness is going down then there must be something I am doing wrong.  Of course I know my skills are lacking with most if not all of them being apprentice 2 at level 18 (still haven't seen a single adept 1 rogue skill drop or for sale on runnyeye)<br />
<br />
So here we go with the meat and potatos of my questions:<br />
1. Can Rogue/brigand stuns be used for crowd control?<br />
<br />
2. Are we simply a stand-behind-them-and-stab class?<br />
<br />
3. Besides the obviously cool use of smuggle, is there anything that we excel at that a rogue/brigand can stand and proudly say &quot;thats my job!&quot; to?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice,<br />
Daran, Runnyeye server</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry I don't have an answer for you myself as I haven't gotten my Rogue past lvl 12.  haven't been able to play for 2 weeks &amp;lt;Christmas and RL getting in my way&gt; but be patient someone will have some good answers for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agra</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll want to keep all your armor in the green-orange con range, as well as your weapons.  Worst case, buy it from the NPC armor/weapon-smiths.  Best case, buy pristine crafted, or quest for the armor/weapons.<br />
<br />
You'll also want to keep an eye on your disarm traps skill, and get used to the relative changes in tracking range as you level.  Tracking becomes far more valuable after level 20.<br />
<br />
With gear upgrades if I use a shield, I can certainly tank well enough, but you have to work  on your skills too.  On the plus side, they go up on greys, so there's no reason not to practice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyez</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know about you, but my lvl 21 Swashbuckler does some great damage, front or back (LOT more from behind though, no question).  I can off-tank moderatly well (any figher class is better than me though), and the use of disarm trap is something that only us scouts have.  Track is invaluable for questing.  At lvl 25 we get evac, which I understand no one else gets.<br />
<br />
If your damage is getting low, look for some quests to upgrade your weapons (you'll get a new one at 20), and DO NOT forget about poisons.  even the lowest level poisons are worthwhile.  It's a 12 hour buff that gives you a random proc for 12-30 damage.<br />
<br />
And yes... Smuggle is REALLY sweet.  Very useful to get to certain areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, make sure you use poisons.  They really do help (admittedly not as much at 18, but at 20 when you can use the new tier you will notice a huge difference).<br />
<br />
But yeah, gear is probably one of the biggest things.  If you find yourself seriously lacking money, you can do some wholesaler tasks to make some extra silver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I keep seeing this mentioned but I can't find ANY mention of what it IS.<br />
<br />
What the heck is a wholesaler task and how do I find it?<br />
<br />
I need money bad!<br />

When you First enter Qeynos after getting off of IoR, you should be able to find a Tradskilling society in your starting community.  They look like cellar doors (most of the time) and always have an NPC near them that tells you if you can enter that particular society or not.  Look around your community till you find the one you can enter.<br />
<br />
Once you enter this instance the first person you will see is an NPC who offers you a quest to collect different Tier 2 resources for which you will recieve 12s upon completion. These are the Wholsalers.<br />
(I may be wrong, but I think you have to be at least tradeskill lvl 10 and have picked either Outfitter, Provisioner, or Scholar as your profession to do this quest) <br />
<br />
Additionally once you reach tradeskill lvl 10 You will be able to enter a SECOND tradeskill society in your community which is geared to your new profession. (Outfitter, Provisioner and Scholar)  This new society has an NPC which offers you rewards for creating a certain number of crafted items.  Such as Arrows, furniture, clothes etc. etc.  You recieve substantially more money for doing this, although I have not completed a crafting order yet so I am unsure how much.<br />
<br />
You can use ATL + W to get waypoints to each society in a zone to make them easier to locate the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilkata Tasavalt</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Montag...had finally figured out what those Societies were tonight...I guess I had joined one back on my first day of not knowing what I was doing...and was very confused when I couldn't join any other ones.<br />
<br />
But....just for the record..<br />
<br />
I am, of course, a Freeport citizen.  Dark Elf, you see. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montag McCleaud</div><div class="date">12-11-04, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the societies and society quests different in Freeport?  Im gonna have to check that out.<br />
<br />
I have a 14 Dark Elf Cleric over there but I have not played her much and have done no tradeskilling.  Dont think I have even joined a society yet.</div></div><hr />
