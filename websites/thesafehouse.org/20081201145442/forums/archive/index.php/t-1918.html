This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay. <br />

Why not just GIVE them a level 65 toon fully Time geared all spells/aa points ect already in place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dazzler Twodirks</div><div class="date">10-16-03, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point is instead of balancing melees they're making the game more newbie friendly every patch.<br />
<br />
I remember hitting SH while waiting for the boat or walking somewhere.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon it'll be just like test where you can get a loaded 25th toon for no effort.<br />
<br />
Fix the rest of the game THEN worry about the newbie players.<br />
Not like there isn't enough of us high levels that will take a few mins out to explain things when they ask.<br />
<br />
I've taken newbies on city tours before and explained to them how the game works.<br />
<br />
Just add a FAQ NPC to the newbie yard that they can hail and have preset Q/A for anything they can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">10-16-03, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is great. This and the new find feature (and the paths in bazaar as well) won't just make life easier for the newbies but for me as well. I hate having to press that stupid sense heading button. It had a point before LoY I will grant you. Now however, it's just the button you press so you'll eventually get the arrow. If I don't have to press a button that does absolutely nothing else for me several thousand times to get that arrow I'm glad. It's a skill that should have been phased out when they put ingame maps in, but since they're not doing that this is good.<br />
<br />
As for the bag. So what, it's a minor thing in an economy where you can quite possibly have a few hundred plat in the bank and heckuva lot nicer gear than I had by the time you're 24th. That's untwinked btw. Yes, you do need to know what to hunt to do that but if you do a bit of research it's easy.<br />
<br />
I also think that adding something small like this is probably easier and a lot quicker to do than balance melees given that the game is inherently unbalanced in favor of casting classes. Adding a bag to the player starting kit does not (or at least should not) take the same people who should be focusing on the melee problem. It's a little like asking &quot;Why isn't the tradeskill guy fixing melee issues rather than putting in these new recipes?&quot;. I mean, would you really like the melee issues to be fixed by someone who may not even know what the problem is? To be fair yeah, that fix is way way overdue. But don't automatically assume that the people who are putting the new things in have anything to do with the melee fix.<br />
<br />
Given how often I've had to explain to a true newbie how to speak in the various channels, or even just reply to me, I also think those who really need the most basic help aren't going to be asking for it because they don't know how. That and most of the time I run from newbies to avoid the inevitable &quot;can I have spare stuff plz&quot; spam. Yes, I do help some, I'm just disheartened by how many beg rather than ask a smart question like how they can make cash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure eventually it will be, DAOC does this already, the fact is this game is getting old, with more and more players hitting 65,  growth will stagnate if they dont do it.<br />
<br />
The point being, that at low levels its almost impossible to get a group as it is, my guess is that they will eventually do it, we cant really whine, cause we leveled the hard way, when we where leveling up, places like lower guk and solb would be packed, even if you started in the kunark era, you still had it good, Lake of Ill Omen was packed with 100+ everynight, and so was sebilis, only problem was lack of spawns, now everyones either in a raiding guild or doing exp in PoP, most newbie and mid level dungeons are deserted, even places that used to be so popular like sebilis, has turned into a bring your own group dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the next crop of fantasy-based MMORPG's coming out, including WoW and EQ2, they are probably trying to get the last of the 'undecided' market out there - consisting of folks that have been considering playing EQ, have friends who do play EQ, etc. - to get on board EQ.<br />
<br />
Of course, these 'perks' for newbies hardly matter when it's a second account for someone - because the second account is always twinked.</div></div><hr />

Why when I was your age we used to have to click that sense heading every dang time it came up! Most of us didn't even know what key mapping was! Let alone how to use it! Course we coulda just dropped a sword on the ground and it would always point north for some reason... weird magnetic swords.. but that woulda risked loosing a high quality rusty sword! They were worth a few loafs of bread at least! You could feed yourself for a week with that rusty sword! Dang kids these days, no sense of worth, always wastin their coppers, they're &quot;too good&quot; to carry around rusty weapons to sell!
