<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eiger DAOC</div><div class="date">02-12-02, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm a Shadowblade, who has been lurking, but now have a question.<br />
<br />
I choose SB for other reasons than 2 handers, but from reading this board, it sounds like I should be using one?  I'm only 10th, so maybe things change, but my Bastard Sword and Left Axe seem to work better.  My Build?  Approximately:<br />
<br />
6 LA<br />
7 Sword<br />
7 CA<br />
3 Stealth (auto-trained)<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong?  Do 2 handers only work better if you DON'T train LA?  Or do they only help with higher level styles?  What's the deal?  I don't want to miss out on what may be an advantage in an already difficult-enough class.<br />
<br />
Oh, and while I'm asking questions... I was planning on going completely without envenom.  It doesn't sound that great, and I personally don't like messing with &quot;Ammunition&quot; (I'd NEVER play an archer), or having to reapply poisons between every fight.  If I have any ability, I want to be able to use it.  Anyway, am I really gimping myself, or will I be ok if I can last without Envenom until a certain level?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your answers,<br />

<br />
2h provides a higher base damage for opening CS styles (the bonus remains the same) and has a higher cap (due to being slower and 2h's 30% cap bonus).  To optimally take advantage of that front loaded damage, you'd want very high weapon and CS spec.<br />
<br />
At low levels, you're really best off focusing on 2 skills.  Either weapon + CS with 2h backstabs or else weapon + left axe with left axe styles.  You can dabble a bit in a 3rd skill, but focusing on keeping 2 near level will help you the most in early PvE.  Eventually, you'll want to up stealth more than just letting it auto-train, but early on, it works fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so the 2-Hander only helps with Damage CAP, that makes sense.  And I haven't seen a difference, because I'm not near the cap.<br />
<br />
And yes, as well as going with no Envenom, I had planned to give LA a rest for a while, now that I've got the Ravager Style.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

PS: I noticed that I abbreviated Critical Strike as CA (thought it was Crit Attack).  I'll figure it all out eventually</div></div><hr />

This is currently not applicable as 2handed weapon is massively reduced and opening strikes overall now pretty much suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only case i ever use a 2h weapon is if im going for a 1 shot kill<br />
<br />
otherwise its always 1h/la<br />
<br />
i find the 2h nearly useless when trying to take out opposing archers (most notably rangers because of speed spell) as they often hit that spell before my CD lands because of the long delay.<br />
<br />
there has been a very big discussion about this over on the VN boards, i just dont see the &quot;huge advantage&quot; of a 2h weapon overall, with the exception of the 1 shot kills.</div></div><hr />
