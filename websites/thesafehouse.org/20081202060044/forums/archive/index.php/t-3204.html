<br />
starting in chapter 1,ive tried to pickpocket most merchants,and non hostile monsters/npcs. everytime i attempt it i get the &quot; X has no money or items&quot; message.<br />
<br />
just curious,the skill in relation to the solo game,seems to be completely useless.<br />
<br />
by comparision your traps and lockpicking skills are done very well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and by succesful, I mean yeilding items/gold... most of them all have been sucessful<br />
