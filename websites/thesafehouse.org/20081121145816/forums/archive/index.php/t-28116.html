I have pretty good equipment, I consistently succeed against +2/2-dot mobs, both with and without getting the drop on them from sneak. But in PvP, I am constantly getting ganked. Main reason: impossible to get the drop on an enemy player using sneak. Is anyone able to hold their own in PvP? Strategies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vis</div><div class="date">02-06-07, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah you've got no chance.  The best you can do, is be real careful, stealth up to someone from behind, get lucky they or their group cant see you.  Open with a ravage, then get a backstab in if they're unaware and dont move, then you have them at best, at half life.  Then you get rooted and killed, or they heal and you get killed, or you get melee'd and kited and killed.<br />
<br />
The best luck I've had is doing the above.  You get them to half health, and they run away scared knowing that you've got nothing left lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorsauce</div><div class="date">03-05-07, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally dont see why everyone thinks the rogue sucks in VG pvp.  Ive had great success so far.  I got my gnome rogue to level 12 and went to Taheans Vengeance in Thestra to pvp.  <br />
<br />
Note: I made sure my skills were maxed, this includes hide, stealth, pearcing, parry and all things necessary to win a pvp fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i never had an issue sneaking up on someone.  I was spotted a couple times by people who were higher level than me but only when i was really close. And even then i could easily make a quick get away using sprint/smoke bomb.  In fact out of 5 or so hours of pvping i only had 1 death to a ranger who was 2 levels my senior.  If the fight went bad...smoke bomb is always ready and i vanish in a cloud of smoke never to be seen agian.  The survivability of the rogue class in pvp truly is amazing. Smoke bomb is imo one of the best pvp skills in the game.  Learn to use it in conjuction with Flash powder, knee break, and sprint and your survivability will increase greatly. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are a couple of annoying things like:<br />
<br />
*In stealth form you move really slow.  This can make it a pain in the ass if your trying to land a Backstab on a moving target.  Im sure once you get smoke trick this is less of an annoyance, but none the less it sucks.  Note: in upcoming patch were suposed to be able to move faster in stealth, so well see what happens then.<br />
<br />
<br />
*You cant hit your stealth hotkey to break stealth in pvp combat.  If a person does not hit you and just runs away this can be a pain in the ass.  I have to go out of my way to click the &quot;un-stealth&quot; button on the interface to get out of stealth and give chase.  Also you can also hit sprint to break it but its not always up.  When giving chase every second counts.  Im sure its a bug and will be fixed over time.</div></div><hr />

Umm Rogues are underhanded fighters. Since when do we have to righteous and &quot;fair&quot;?  :pulid</div></div><hr />

<br />
Masters of stealth, oh wait no thats the bard, who can go in and out of stealth during a fight to make you die of dizzyness and aggrivation out of having to retarget him 900 times during a fight. Oh or a sorc, who's invis cast time is getting reduced so he can recast mid fight, in comabt and make US the masters of stealth, detarget him and run away, full speed. <br />
<br />
Oh but wait, we can uh.... stealth... really slow, like so we can RP and say &quot;Im master of stealth and uh... im sneaky and slow, but i have no real purpose in pvp cause if anyone has 2 damn eyes on their fat little heads they can see me 10 miles away&quot;  <br />
<br />
Yeah, that stealth... ******* invis can blow me. Cheap and over powered in PvP, and anyone who says otherwise is ignorant.</div></div><hr />

See invis does not let a person see stealth.  <br />
<br />
Undead mobs see invis.<br />
<br />
Some mobs also see invis.<br />
<br />
Stealth works on undead and normal mobs if your skill is high enough.<br />
<br />
As of TODAY's update you now move faster in stealth.<br />
<br />
I fail to see the problem with stealth.  I use it everyday in pvp with GREAT success.  Ive walked by people +2 levels higher than me and they had no clue i was even there.  Now granted they may not hav had detection up...but oh well.  Works for me.</div></div><hr />

Seems to work every time.  Max stealth skill is nice :) <br />

I just wish I didn't have to stealth away in order to survive!</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried it yet, but does flashpowder throw you into combat?  Because once in combat, we can't stealth anymore... unlike some other classes.</div></div><hr />

My problem with stealth is this.<br />
I can sometimes, if not most of the time, SEE Rogues that are at least 10+lv above me while they are in Stealth mode.<br />
<br />
Everytime I have a chance, I ask other Rogues and players if they can See me in Stealth and/or how they feel about their Stealth.<br />
Most of the time, they state how gimp stelth is and I feel the same way.<br />
I personally just cannot see a constant dynamic on how Stealth is suppose to work.<br />
<br />
Why can someone that is obviously WAY underlevel than you able to see you when you are Stealthed?<br />
I am talking about being able to see the +10lv Rogue in Stealth mode from Max Clip range!<br />
Is that how stealth is suppose to work?</div></div><hr />

<br />
   If the other characters detection skill is up high enough, then they will see you and what I'm noticing is that the higher I get in level (21) the harder it is to PvP on an even basis.  I killed a Psi the other day, but got owned by an SK who somehow saw me no matter where I was... he said he maxed out his skills and it was easier to see stealth.  I also think there are resist checks for flash powder because it has failed.  The main nemesis for me so far is any class that can invis, or slow me down... but I'm going to try the untargeting the PvP fighter to see if I can get smokebomb to work... that may make a difference in survivability.<br />
<br />
     Our main dps is when we are stealthed, we get percentage increase for damage and if we can stay in stealth for a few, then we can do good damage.  Only problem is that if their dodge and parry skills are maxed, they there is a chance some of our most devastating hits, well,.... won't hit.  <br />
<br />
     All I can say is that, if you are being extremely successful in PvP as a rogue, then take a close look at what you are doing and how you are fighting... most of the other people I've talked to about rogues seem to agree that we do great in groups, but as far as solo PvP, or PvE for that matter, we have to work harder than everyone else to win and we rarely win, but rather scurry away.</div></div><hr />
