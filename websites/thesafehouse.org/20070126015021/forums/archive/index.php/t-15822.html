Now, I went searching in the water and found a temple that had tons of sirens around it, but got no update for the quest.  On the EQ2 official forums someone said that for the heritage jboots quest the shrine spawns at night in the southwest corner outside a worm hole.  I found that shrine, inspected it, got this message:  The shrine is made of an odd material and is covered with brilliant runes.  It hums in a hypnotic rhythm almost forcing you into a trance.  Still no quest update.  So, has anyone done the History of the Koada'Dal, Part II?</div></div><hr />

I swam directly overhead until I was over the center of the shrine, then swam down until I was standing on top of it.  I remember I had to move around a bit to get the update, and then I aggroed the sirens.  I managed to live somehow (barely!).<br />

If you're looking in the far west shore of TS, you're looking at the right spot.<br />
