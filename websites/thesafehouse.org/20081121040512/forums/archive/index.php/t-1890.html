Can't watch more than a few minutes of the show, but last week<br />
<br />
They were eating dinner. Waitress brings a dish.<br />
Jessica: I don't eat buffalo.<br />
Laughter.<br />
Random Chick: They are buffalo wings.<br />
Jessica:Buffalo Wings? I still won't eat it.<br />
Nick: It's chicken, every see a buffalo with wings?<br />
Jessica: Ohh, didn't think about it like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
She is so @#%$ stupid it boggles the mind. On the other hand she has a body that won't quit.<br />
<br />
 <br />

(Her and Anna Nicole Smith)<br />
<br />
It really does make me wonder how people this stupid can survive. I am honestly surprised they haven't just stabbed themselves to see the pretty blood or something. ~</div></div><hr />

All exageration aside, Jessica Simpson is much more ditzy than she is stupid.  Anna Nicole has the IQ of a mentally challenged rock.  Jessica Simpson just has...bouts of stupidity :P &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ...

She said &quot;I'm not a very good tryer-clotheser-oner.&quot;<br />

That's more than just ditzy.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Dude, I just put my hand on my scanner, and it scanned, and I got a hand...so I could get like a girl to put her boobs on the scanner, and I'd get boobs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Him (having been sick for 2 days): ...yeah I'm better today, but I wouldn't want to try, like, milk or anything.<br />
Me: Yet you are cooking a steak as we speak<br />
Him: Yeah, man, I need some fiber!<br />
Me: *pause* There's no fiber in steak.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Nick Lachey beats wife to death with crowbar, claims mental distress&quot;<br />

Nick:  &quot;I know I married her for her bod and not her brain... but DAMN, she didn't even know Chicken of the Sea was tuna!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkefang</div><div class="date">10-07-03, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think Jessica Simpson necessarily is as jaw-droppingly stupid as Anna Nicole, she is a product of what happens to child performers with bad parents.  Apparently, she spent her entire childhood on the road.  She never really went to school and never read anything.  She hasn't ever even done stuff like go shopping or do any kind of chores.  All she has ever done is perform like her parents trained her to do, like people train seals to toot horns for fish.  <br />
<br />
When she got married and moved into her own house, it was the first time she ever had to do anything, or even think, on her own.  Its very sad, if you think about it.  And its not like her music is cutting edge material that has changed the face of music forever.  Its the happy crap kind of junk that nobody over 11 years old listens to anyway.</div></div><hr />
