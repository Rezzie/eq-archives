These would be ones found on merchants or monsters.  If anyone has any, i'd gladly pay well for em.<br />
<br />
Secondly:  Stealth.  Do you actually fade a little more when you skill up?  So like a rogue with 100 Stealth would actually look more transparent than a new rogue with a skill of 1?</div></div><hr />

Not that I can tell. My rogue has Rank 2 in stealth and has about 145-150 skill and she looks the same as she did when she was rank 1 with 1 skill.</div></div><hr />

To NPCs and persons not in your group, your transparency increases the greater the disparity between your stealth skill and their level check to see you.</div></div><hr />
