Heres a little hint to all the people the want to hunt rares in tenebrous, bring a tracker, they are ALL roamers, there is almost always at least one rare up, I grab one pull him to Katta and dot kite him around the tree by the entrance, once dead heal to full, head out and track to another, damn near always theres another rare up.... Awesome exp for my Bard  <br />
(The only exception to the roamers seems to be the coterie vampyres as they are all static spawns, and if you see a black wolf and 2 grey wolves, bring help to kill them, they hurt   The black one HT'd me for 526pts then landed a 27 pt dot on me.....

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ziann</div><div class="date">12-31-01, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no offense but the discussion might be better for the bard board.  however, to reiterate... yes Lambent &gt; Bravados.  Sure, theyre pretty close but Ac 20 and what etiquates to 45 hps is better than ac 21 and a bunch of minimal stats. *especially* if you take into account the jump in difficulty of the quests.  Im more of a hp person i guess, id wear lambent, Im sure if my friends and I were around level 43 theyd rather hit Lower Guk or Mistmoore for a comperable (if not slightly better) breastplate, then Mons Letalius to clear Stonegrabbers any day.<br />
<br />
Also, I dont think anyone said they were expecting more or some uber armor from these quests.  Im fine with the reward, Im still doing the quests, Im still having fun doing them, I didnt expect to upgrade my Breastplate of Eradication with the result so honestly I could really care less what the stats are. /shrug Edited by: Ziann  at: 12/31/01 7:42:39 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been camping the mighty underbulk for about 20 hours and NEVER had one spawn. There are eight 'placeholder' underbulks in twilight. Since it's almost always only ME in the zone, I can keep about 6-7 dead at any one time.<br />
<br />
One day I never had a named pop.<br />
<br />
The next I had 4 pop (two of those where duplicates)<br />
<br />
The next day I had 2 pop (both cunning underbulks).<br />
<br />
It's simply re-goddang- diculous .... I know that's part of camping, but again I'm talking about TI vs. Reward</div></div><hr />

Despite the fact that I've been focusing on just the monk pants, I am not one single piece closer than I was four days ago. I've been auctioning in zones and NFP looking to trade components, but no one responds. Before this stuff takes off, there will have to be a lot more people doing the quests. Most people I talk to aren't even aware of the quests.<br />
<br />
I've been working the hidden area in T. Sea and have not seen one other person there, usually no more than a few people in zone total. I'm always amazed each time a new named pops that I haven't seen before, it's really amazing the number of rares in there. I switched all my xp over to AAXP just so the place doesn't totally green out on me before I get the jar of ointment (lvl 54 atm).<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's getting frustrating at this point. Maybe if they implement the bazaar feature so we can leave our toons logged in with the quest components for sale, things might pick up.</div></div><hr />

However, the Bo Stick is correct.  I will check in on the other items soon.  However, everyone make sure to ask the quest people themselves before possibly spending ages collecting the wrong stuffs.<br />

These things seem to be RARE.  Only have 3 after hours of alien, coterie, wolf rockhopper etc etc slaughter.  And if we focus on one certain piece it's pretty much gauranteed that certain rare will never pop.  Like today we killed wolves and stonegrabbers in dawnshroud for prolly 3 hours, only got one rare to pop. It's addicting in a strange masochistic way I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
clarification- the white marble bowl is off the coterie cohert not the messenger<br />
<br />
primitive totem- dawnshroud off Sambata Primitive.. spawned in the middle room between advisor and keeper rooms.. also the gilded worker spawns there too<br />
<br />
Mark of rage- Enraged Sun revenant - scarlet<br />
<br />
chunk of condensed flame isnt an unknown item..it also doesnt fit the profile of the other items since its not lore and is stackable and drops off many many mobs.. its used to make magic arrows.<br />
<br />
It seems there definitely is certain places the static mobs spawn (I.E. rockhoppers/sambatas in DP, thought leeches in ML, etc) for example the Cunning Rockhopper in Dawn always spawns where the Rockhopper Ravager is to the right of the Elder spawn.. also when the sambatas are up thats the spot the Vieled guide and the Naturalist spawn..   In the middle room next to the tunnel to the Leader/Age old room spawns the stealthy rockhopper, the witherer sambata and the sambata nectar collector.. it seems most spots like this have 2 spawns (of each type of mob).. also in thought leech cave the dark thought leech and the solstice horror spawn on the first stationary spot on the right going in.. and the Powerful and Battle horror spawn at the one on the left... I can only kill a few of these by myself before the 4 wandering ones start respawning and I have a hard time single pulling the room w/4 leeches in it because of their aggro radii but i'm getting a partner to map it a bit more..

<br />
By the way, it's really odd to notice that Dex is present on vrtually *ALL* items, regardless of class that uses it.<br />
<br />
It seems they used a general sort of template, by which they constructed the different sets. AC and weight will probably vary from class to class, but they used several templates in any case ...<br />
<br />
Hitpoint / Mana Template:<br />
Casters (Wis and Int): A = 2 HP, 5 Mana, B = 3 HP, 5 Mana, C = 5 HP, 10 Mana, D = 10 HP, 20 Mana<br />
Hybrids: A = 5 HP, 2 Mana, B = 5 HP, 3 Mana, C = 10 HP, 5 Mana, D = 20 HP, 10 Mana<br />
Melee: A = 8 HP, B = 8 HP, C = Unknown (around 12-14, though), D = 25 HP<br />
<br />
Class Template (Primary stat, Secondary stat, Tertiary stat):<br />
Bard:  Str, Cha, Dex<br />
Beastlord: Str, Wis, Dex<br />
Cleric: Unknown (   assumption: Wis, Sta, Dex)<br />
Druid: Wis, Sta, Dex<br />
Enchanter: Int, Cha, Dex<br />
Magician: Unknown (   assumption: Int, Dex, Str)<br />
Necromancer: Int, Dex, Str<br />
Monks: Str, Sta, Dex<br />
Paladin: Str, Wis, Dex<br />
Ranger: Str, Wis, Dex<br />
Rogue: Str, Dex, Agi<br />
Shadowknight: Str, Int, Dex<br />
Shaman: Wis, Str, Cha<br />
Warrior: Str, Sta, Dex<br />
Wizard: Int, Dex, Str<br />
<br />
Armor pieces template (which HP Template, value of Prim, Sec and Third stat, Save on the item):<br />
<br />
Neck: A, 3, 3, 1, Sv Poison 1<br />
Face: A, 3, 3, 1, Sv Magic 1<br />
Head: B, 3, 3, 1, Sv Magic 1<br />
Chest: D, 8, 5, 3, Sv Magic, Cold, Fire 2<br />
Shoulders: B, 3, 3, 1, Sv Magic 1<br />
Back: B, 4, 3, 1, Sv Fire, Cold 1<br />
Arms:    yet unknown<br />
Wrists: A, 3, 3, 1, Sv Fire 1<br />
Hands: B, 3, 3, 1, Sv Disease 1<br />
Waist:    yet unknown<br />
Legs: C, 4, 3, 1, Sv Cold 1<br />
Feet:    yet unknown<br />
Weapon: D, 8, 5, 3, Sv Poison, Disease 3<br />
<br />
  Note: When you look at Melee BPs, it uses Template D for the HPs, which would be 25 HPs. Bards are melee, but yet their BP has only 8 HPs (see screenshot on page 14 or so of this thread) - which would be Template A or B. This seems to be an error.

<br />
For the person asking questions on the drummer, I've hunted this area a lot. And this is what I've noticed:<br />
<br />
Never gotten a rare to spawn at a static point, all have been wanderers (might just be coincidence,  but I don't think so). Killing a cral ligi won't cause a cral ligi to spawn next, it could be any of the mobs that spawn in there.<br />
<br />
There are so many rares, its just a matter of time and luck until you get the one you want.<br />
<br />
Also,  as for misc drops, some of them (think its vas ren only) drop a chunk of condensed ice. <br />
<br />
As always, if you're on Veeshan and want to trade items, I need monk and druid pieces and have tons of everything else.<br />
<br />
Peace<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ulkaur</div><div class="date">01-04-02, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have hunted in Tenebrous mountains and noticed something with the Coteries.  The trooper has always spawned in the spot closest to the entrance to Katta at the first small mausoleum.  The coterie mercenary has always spawned at the next one over between the two little buildins if looking from the zone wall.<br />
<br />
Coterie centurions have dropped cloud jewels and dire sonic wolves have dropped sun jewels. I also got a sun jewel off a stonegrabber in Mons Letalis.  I do not believe there is any hidden feature for the gems, just that they drop off mobs of at least a certain level in these quest zones.  In four weeks I have gotten three jewels.<br />
<br />
Someone gave me a couple of items on Tarrew Marr last night and is going to get me the mob names of what dropped them.  They are Mark of Fear and engraved gold statuette.<br />
<br />
Also a tip.  If you turn your log on before you kill a mob you can go back and verify mob name and what you looted. I've done a couple of corrections to items with question marks and incorrect names as I've found them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Colcannon</div><div class="date">01-04-02, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another followup to my spawn theory...<br />
<br />
Perhaps it has nothing to do with what day of the week it  is after all.  I've been killing underbulks for the past 5 days or so. There are only 8 in the zone and I have been pretty much the only one doing so. Perhaps the 'day' was nothing more than me killing PHs the best one person can and it taking a day to go through this whole cycle.<br />
<br />
What I am seeing, folks, is the same &amp;lt;named&gt; is spawning multiple times and THEN it starts on the next name. So to kill a mighty underbulk perhaps you would need to kill placeholders and then 3-4 fiery underbulks before the spawn table is updated. <br />
<br />
Edit: well... just when I think I have it figured out....<br />
Yesterday's spawn rate totally ruined this theory. I had 7 unique named spawned and only two were duplicates. Back to the drawing board.<br />
Count = 0<br />
Kill placeholder<br />
&amp;lt;current named MOB&gt; spawns <br />
Count = Count +1<br />
Kill &amp;lt;current named MOB&gt;<br />
<br />
Now, when the mob respawns it will either be <br />
    A. Placeholder<br />
    B. If Count &amp;lt; X (3 or 4) then <br />
         &amp;lt;current named MOB&gt; spawns <br />
        else<br />
         Count = 0<br />
         &amp;lt;next named MOB in table&gt; spawns and becomes &amp;lt;current named MOB&gt;<br />
           <br />
         end if<br />
<br />
<br />

As i recall, all the mobs in his little tower are also on his faction, and i think some of the other quest mobs in the zone are as well, however, some are on Katta faction. so you might need to go kill some vampyres in tenebrous or something to raise faction.

(the thread was so long i couldnt be bothered reading it all). But from what i have seen, when a unique (quest type) mob is killed another spawns about 2-5 mins later. I'm guessing the way to get your mob to spawn is kill the currently spawned quest mob till yours pops. I tried this in tenebrous. Each time i killed a quest mob another would spawn very soon after. I killed about 4 of these in a row (in between killing coterie) so i'm pretty sure this is how you get them to spawn. Each mob was different also. They were all the Tro jeg type model with different names (not all were Tro jeg tribe but i forget the other names). Hope this is helpful.</div></div><hr />

You can make clickable links by using some EZCodes. I have disabled EZCodes in this message so I can type the syntax and get it displayed - but normally it converts it to a clickable link. There are two ways:<br />
<br />
this-is-my-link<br />
<br />
this-is-the-name-I-give-my-link<br />
<br />
The advantage of the latter is that you can name your link whatever you want. Also, note that EZBoard does NOT want the ' http:// ' start of the URL, you must leave that one out. Use square brackets.<br />

Mark of Soul, Drops in Scarlet Desert on a Rockhopper.  I've seen it once and did not note which hopper, but I am certain it was a hopper since the only oddly named MOB I've dropped there, outsided the Dardened Sunflower, were all Rockhoppers.<br />
<br />
Just as a note, I have encountered 3 oddly named MOB in SD.  The Sluggish Sunflower drops shields, a nice one for int casters: 15 AC, 6 str, 6 int and some saves.  The Sluggish Sunflower I slew twice and it dropped a shield each time.  The second one was not special.  There is something like an Insane Sun Revenant that drops equipment. Possessed Sun Revanant drops the Ring of Possession, a 2 int 5 svCFM ring.<br />

<br />
How many of these mobs have you fought? I don't know many lv35's that could stand up to mobs that proc a 250dd and hit for around a 100(quite often and at 60 with resists up to 252 damn hard to resist even partially,) mobs in letalis hitting for 130, vampires in tenebrous tapping for 200(way too often,) and not to mention a slow proc, and 2 other procs(only tro jeg proc lands on me, so no idea what they all do.) This being said, doing this in a zone where about 1/3 of the mobs are still light blue(some blue) at 60. Another annoying thing is you have to basically go kos with all aliens, and once you are even at 60 you get alot of aggro. I personally know that at lv35 I wouldn't want to be hunting in letalis or tenebrous. Scarlet, Twilight and Dawnshroud sure, but some of those mobs are crazy(like the extremely bugged rockhopper/sambata area.) I wasn't expecting kael armor from these quests, but the rewards so far are just plain bad for time invested/risk. Totally unbalanced, I just hope there is more then meets the eye here, or else I just wasted the majority of my Luclin hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Crested Spaulders AC 11 +5 Sta, drop off a 30ish mob in Mistmoore and are far easier to get and comparable in quality.  The majority of these pieces are far harder to get than their stats warrant.  While I agree they shouldn't be Kael quality, PoF/PoH quality wouldn't be far out of line.  Having things like AC 17 chain BPs and Priest/Caster Bracers that only add 3 Int/Wis is just poor design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
positive:<br />
<br />
- the time and resources the designers of these quests put into them to create over 500 unique items, named mobs, and confirming spawns and quest turn-ins must have been a serious project.  these quests are pretty epic in themselves from a design standpoint.  would they put that much into them if it wasnt for something big?  big is not a set of armor arguably equal to sol ro armor or common ec fodder in some cases.  i dont know how VI works on the inside but if the quest guys and girls made these huge quests only to find out the item guys and girls made the rewards a pile of darkwing bat dung id be peeing in some coffee.<br />
<br />
- these quests encompass a vast majority of the expansion.  these are the biggest and most involved quests found in luclin, heck in everquest.  the biggest problem is the lack of people doing them, clearing spawns, etc.  it makes it very hard without people hunting and trading.  to get that economy flowing there must be something down the road to stimulate interest...maybe?<br />
<br />
negative:<br />
<br />
- the risk vs. reward in luclin is pretty stank across the board, this is just another example.  feels almost like they havent released the game yet, were all gonna be set to level 1 and when we level up we can work for this armor on our way.<br />
<br />
- no one has found anything to lead us to believe this is for some sort of larger picture<br />
<br />
- this is VI were talking about, chances are theyll decide the time and effort is not worth the reward from a targeted level quest point of view and theyll add a couple ac and stats and call it fixed.  on the bard board i suggested maybe adding small skill % increases like a lot of the luclin loot has. that would add some flavor to the armor.  not only that but at the targeted levels for the armor the % skill increases would actually be pretty useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
just some random thoughts, sorry to add non-item/spawn info to the thread but something to think about i suppose.  personally im of the school of thought that theyll add some ac and stats and call it balanced.  hope im wrong and that these are steps to a phatter lewt.  dont get me wrong though im having fun doing the quests, worthy reward or no it beats grinding experience to me sometimes.

I have to have 2 freaking alts in the bazaar to hold all this stuff and after over 100 items found i've only gotten 4 jewels to drop off mobs (2 sky and 2 astral grr) and now i'm kos to many factions I wasnt before and i've gotten ***BETTER*** items off of non quest mobs from same area like warlord in oasis and the grol baku bodyguard in scarlet (ac 15 +5 sta +20 hp bracer i think, very very nice, and ac 8 +3 str/wis/int sleeves and all/all).... luclin saw a very large number of items that surpass older items (+20 wis shields, +20 wis gloves, AC 15 range slots, +40 cha +15 int +15% alteration ac 20 masks, 20 ac earrings, Haste shoulder items, etc etc etc) verant could have been a little less stingy with stats on these.. the quests and the hunt for the mobs is really fun (and addicting) but i guess its a journey=reward thing.   I thought there would be +% on these.. that would have made these really fun.. like +5% alchemy on shaman bp, +10% evocation on wizard robe, +5% dodge on monk mask, +10% 1hs on warrior sword, +10% string instruments on bard gloves, etc etc etc... each class getting 14 items w/+% on them even if it was +2 or +3% would have been fun..<br />
<br />
on another note, it would be cool if these were like the set armors in Diablo II where the more you have the more stats each piece has.. so if you had a full set of warrior gear on you'd get like +100 AC +30 str +30 dex +30 sta +300hp or something... but that wont happen.. Oh well sony says like 70% of quests havent been found/solved yet (or is it 30% i forget) maybe there is another use for these..<br />
<br />
If not they are nice slot filling items for int casters at least who might be wearing some raw silk or cloth or gossimer or crystalline silk in a slot or 3 at 55 + ( i know a few that do )... the int caster robes are really nice.. better than sentry/guardian/SMR's.. too bad the melee stuff sucks so bad for 45+   and I agree many of these mobs are wayyy too hard for a couple of high 30's or low 40's.. but then again this would be a good thing for a full group of 40's to do instead of the sol b/lower guk grind or trying to take group space in velketors..<br />
<br />
Epic armor would be nice though    Whats the deal w/beta testers not being able to say anything about this stuff?  I understand the non-disclosure stuff but it just seems like w/the anonamity (sp?) of the internet someone would have posted this stuff by now if there was.. if you are on druzzil and want to trade some items let me know   i'm looking for shaman/warrior/beastlord/magician stuff   and buying jewels</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iscandar</div><div class="date">01-09-02, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a theory on spawns in Scarlett Desert:<br />
<br />
It appears (I'll list evidence that I believe supports the theory in a sec), that for every mob type (lightcrawler, sunflower, cheetah etc), there is a single placeholder for the named.  It is my theory, that there is one spawn, that has the possibility of being any of the named for that mob type, as well as a normal mob.  AND, they seem to spawn in certain areas, instead of being spawned anywhere in the zone.<br />
<br />
Example:  The scarlett cheetah.  Last week, while wandering Scarlett, I ran into (quite literally), &quot;an imposing cheetah&quot;.  Of course I nuked it.  Then I went to a nearby wall to med up.  As soon as I stood, I noticed &quot;an imposing cheetah&quot; again.  So, I nuked it again, and ooc'ed to the zone that the gem of awe as at X location.  Once again, I went back to med up.  I stood back up, and wandered about some more.  About 2.5 hours later, I was wandering through that same area again, and found &quot;a light cheetah&quot;.  I rooted him (uninvising myself) and was immediately mobbed by a flower, 2 lightcrawlers and of course the cheetah that resisted heh.  Dead wizard.  I ran back, grabbed my corpse, and sat to med back up.  I stood up, and in the very same area, the &quot;Light cheetah&quot; was still there.  I nuked him (being a wee bit more careful this time lol).  Last night, I ran through, and once again saw a named cheetah, in the very same area (didn't grab him in time, a ranger got him).  <br />
<br />
Now, the Sunflowers seem to be on a similar cycle, only in a slightly different (but overlaping in some areas) area.<br />
<br />
I've never seen 2 named, same mob-type, at the same time.  (for instance I've never seen 2 named cheetahs up at the same time). But I HAVE seen 2 different mob-type, named spawns at the same time. (Last night I saw the Imposing cheetah, and wild lightcrawler standing virtually on top of eachother).  I'm not a tracker, so my observations on what's up at what time could be off (hell, everything I've seen could be way off), but this is what I've seen thus far, and my theory on the spawns in Scarlett. <br />
<br />
Just a lil info that might be helpful if you're pulling your hair out over spawns =P Edited by: Iscandar  at: 1/9/02 9:07:52 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night in Tenebrous Mts, I saw 2 Grol Baku Earthmasters up at the same time.  I dont think verant would make the spawn code for rares in SD different from TM (programers are lazy    )<br />
<br />
<br />
/agree Petercorbin<br />
<br />
I'm convinced that the guys who design quests (and quest rewards) are different from the guys who come up with critter drops.  There is no parity between the long quest/skimpy reward and the Monty Hall drop items.  IMHO, if you find a quest worthy of your time, do it early and often for it is soon to be nerfed (A LA LSoEE).<br />

I've been hunting in the area of SD very close to TS zone out and have yet to see a named sunflower, sun revenant/reaver, or lightcrawler spawn.<br />
<br />
In support of this observation, the named Sambata and Rockoppers in DS were static spawn and each seemed to have a PH at a fixed location.  I know I only have a very small sample of evidence, but it is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Could you look at a map from www.eqatlas.com and give an approximate loc for where you were?  As a non-tracker, I'm becoming increasingly frustrated by not seeing any names as compared to the plethora I would run into in DS.<br />

The few named sunflowers I've seen have all (yep, all) been in the area around the Twilight zone, from the Plateau, over to the little pond by the Vas Ren camp (listed as 7 on the map).  They all seem to roam, but within, or at the very least, INTO this area.  For the Sun revs, I just kept killing the revs at the ruins (5), and named ones would pop.  They're not social, so pulling singles isn't difficult at all.  I have 5 full backpacks of Twilight quest pieces now... and all I want is that Sunflower fruit LOL</div></div><hr />

Approach the luclin quests like baseball cards. Collect 'em, trade 'em, sell 'em. If you get a monopoly, go grab some decent twinkage. But don't spend 50+ hours camping a spawn. If you're that hardcore, apply those 50 hours camping something that drops better gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Teneb, the &amp;lt;named&gt; coterie have been spawning in the same place.... the camp close to the gnome guy (Daskin?). I've seen the mob that drops Mark of Nature in the same place each and every time. Static and non wandering.<br />
<br />
I went nuts trying to figure out the spawn cycle in the hidden area of Twilight (about 60 hours) and just when I thought I had it figured out, some other variable would present itself.<br />
<br />
I think the best generalization we can make is A) some mobs are static and some are wandering and B) respawn tables can vary from zone to zone.</div></div><hr />

The reason I ask is because it  seems like almost no one on Xegony is doing these quests, and I'd really like to.<br />

updated excel spreadsheet with new submitted item drop/locs.

Also added completed item stats to the quest worksheet.  Btw, the spreadsheet is optimized for 1024x768 resolution, sorry if it looks different at lower res.  feel free to do anything you want with the information on the spreadsheet, its basically just a summary of collected data and things ive found as well, just another medium for the info.  Please email me (ziann@rochester.rr.com) any corrections to the quest summary and post here for any item drop/mob corrections.  thanks and good luck finding what you are looking for.<br />

<br />
This MoB has been reported to drop numerous different quest items. Frankly, by virtue of its name and the fact that it has been reported for all those different drops, I *think* the Scavenger Minnow can drop any and all quest items for these quests. The one that is dropped is purely random, though.<br />
<br />
If this is true - and someone should farm him for a while to see if this is indeed the case - then it's a bit pointless to fill him in on the item lists, since he could be placed at any spot then. At the same token, the spots he is currently filling will then also have another MoB that can drop it - the actual MoB like all the other items.</div></div><hr />

However, I've yet to see any mob drop anything that the Scavenger Minnow has also dropped.  With the number of items we've found so far and the number of items we know the scavenger minnow drops, seems like we should have found at least one if that was the case.  I think the more likely situation is that all of the rares on the minnow cycle are named &quot;scavenger minnow&quot;.  They drop different things because they are different mobs, just with the same name.  But time will tell, and if it turns out that your suggestion is the case, I've already been watching for it and will update the tables accordingly.<br />

On the scavenger minnow, so far only one item per class has been on a scavenger minnow, so they may have different pieces depending on what spot the minnow spawned in, but I'm thinking they just gave one piece per class to the minnow and it's just a random when you kill it which piece you get.

<br />
Do those of you who spend a lot of time on these quests think it's possible for a Level 42 Paladin to kill things in the &quot;hidden area&quot; in Twilight Sea?<br />
<br />
I'd be keeping some EB potions on me and some in the bank (for CR, if needed).<br />
<br />
The problem is, during the hours I'm on there doesn't seem to be many (any?) people doing these quests on Xegony.</div></div><hr />

Lots of stuff was adding when I was pulling with my 54th necro that was light blue. You might be able to find a corner to pull to.<br />
<br />
I would go in invis as minnows that are blue at 54 guard the entrance and them suckers bite hard and fast.</div></div><hr />

Looks like I'll have to hunt Mons Letalis, as it seems to be the only place that drops quest items that's reasonably solo-able for me.<br />
<br />
I can do  some mobs in Tenebrous... but the &quot;named&quot; ones wander near the middle of the zone.  Not exactly a safe place to rest after a battle!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_NappyOne</div><div class="date">01-11-02, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have personally gotten the Darkened Shaft from the Darkened Sunflower in the Scarlet Desert.  Everyone else who has slain the Darkened Sunflower, and posted here, has gotten the Vial of Dark Earth.  I have not studied the drops that closely, but the only MOB that drops multiple items I am aware of is the Scavenger Minnow in TS.  Several MOB of the same name have different drops, but the ones I have glanced at are all in different zones - mostly Rockhoppers in ML, DSP and SD.<br />
<br />
The makes me curious as to where the other Darkened Sunflowers were slain.  The one I got was near the ramp to the plateau in SD, and I am fairly sure it did not wander in, but spawned right there.  It is possible that Darkened Sunflowers will have different drops depending on where they spawn.  If this is true, the same may hold for Minnows.  On the other hand, VI may have just put both on the same MOB and it is just pure chance that no one else who has posted never got a Darkened Shaft.<br />
<br />
There is a joke in there somewhere, but I will leave that as an exercise for the reader.<br />

The mark of souls could be the same as the shaman mark of soul, both are reported to drop in SD.  Also, the cleric mark of remedy might be the mark of redemption, and the wizard mark of force might actually be the mark of energy.  Anyone tested any of these or checked back with the quest givers?</div></div><hr />

I would dearly love to have the Cleric BP, Boots &amp;amp; Greaves... and the Paladin BP, Vambraces, Collar &amp;amp; Mask.<br />
<br />
It'd be great for twinking my young Dwarven Warrior &amp;amp; Vah Shir Shamaness, too.  Given how collecting the items is a group thing, I can imagine that it'd be fairly easy to do... depending on who was hunting with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Killing the mobs that drop the items isn't hard, ,but that's a big difference between collecting the items you need for the armor.<br />
<br />
My 56 druid and 54 monk spent a couple of weeks clearing the T. Sea hidden area and never saw the one named mob I was after...I think they really messed up with the insane number of rares in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will ask, how do you get a Named alien to spawn?<br />
<br />
I have hunted behind the waterfall area where only<br />
<br />
spiritwards and guardians spawn of the vas ren, grol baku<br />
<br />
and cral ligi varieties.<br />
<br />
  I have also hunted around this BIG BOWL thing at about<br />
<br />
p3480, p1126 where warders, guardians, spiritwards, and <br />
<br />
occaisional shaman or workers spawn.<br />
<br />
SO FAR NO NAMEDS.<br />
<br />
  Specifically i am looking for polished ivory idol off the grol<br />
baku idolist and painted ornament off the cral ligi painter.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Any help in where in the Secret Oasis they seem to spawn,<br />
<br />
or if you on Bertoxx, give me a tell if you have the idol or<br />
<br />
ornament for trade!<br />
<br />
Many Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />
