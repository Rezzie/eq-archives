<br />
Now, I need your advice/opinion on something.  Do you think I should wait until the new PvP server comes out before I start a new character or just go ahead and make one on an existing PvP server?<br />
<br />
I currently have a couple mid-to-high level characters on a blue server (mage and rogue) and actually, I made a barbarian shaman on Vallon Zek this weekend.  I'm only level 9 but so far I absolutely love the shaman class.  My concern is I don't want to start over on the new PvP server if it turns out to be better than the existing ones.  What are your opinions on this matter?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your help!</div></div><hr />

Don't get too attached.  When the new server goes live then, start a character on it.  You'll have some experience from the other PvP servers to guide you on character selection and general PvP etiquette. If, you can't be good. at least, be good at it.Majestyk, Rogue,Shanks,Vallon Zek!Edited by: MajestykVZ at: 5/7/01 11:38:11 am</div></div><hr />

I'm personally rooting for this change.<br />
<br />
Do as Majestyk suggests and perhaps ye won't need to abandoned your characters when the time comes.<br />
<br />
And, hmm a Barbarian shaman eh?  Ye picked a good team. ::smiles::               Fricka       of the Vallon Zek Shanks<br />

I will be heading there not sure what I will be playing.  Probably not another Rogue, not that I don't love my Rogue just want to try something else.<br />
<br />
Options so far are...Iskar Monk, DE, Gnome, or Erudite Enchanter, or Erudite Sk.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything more about the new server and whats going to happen with it?</div></div><hr />

I am betting it's gonna crash the first night like Vallon (or Tallon? don't remember, I was playing on Rallos that night anyway hehe) did. Dunno if they will split it though.<br />
<br />
Me and a friend are considering an attempt at an 'uber guild' depending on the server rules. We'll probably tag everyone we meet, and then send officers (rogues most likely, since no one else can get to the other cities that fast) to get even more recruits. We've got a few months of planning I imagine, so hopefully we can iron out all the wrinkles. May just start a rogue and join the OBR though ;p<br />

<br />
for the poster I would go with the rallos/team server advice. they are each as different to each other as pvp is to pve.  you can look me up on rallos most nights under the name on the sig not the post. Ill give ya a hand with some gear and a bag or 3. Diabalein Avidya <br />
