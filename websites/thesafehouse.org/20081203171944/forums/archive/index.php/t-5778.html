<br />
This should be the first kill on Solusek Ro, and the third guild to ever take down Trakanon.<br />
<br />
Just like my guild did this weekend, Paradigm also spent every day of this last weekend down in Lower Sebilis, and managed to take him down on sunday evening in the second (?) attempt.<br />
<br />
AFAIK drops were Rogue (damn, could have been mine   ) and Ranger BP.<br />
<br />
My kudos and Grats to Paradigm, and Grats to Sasprina who probably got the BP.<br />

<br />
She even didn't bother to answer when i sent her tells whenever she got a new level or so.<br />
She doesn't evene notice other rogues if the stand directly infront of her, talking/emoting to her.<br />
<br />
Well, guess being a rogue in Paradigm makes you something better than the rest of the server, although Tallyn is much better. Haven't seen him on much lately though.</div></div><hr />

I'm reading the safehouse for a while now, even after i stopped playing my rogue and began to start a new life as a ranger. But i miss my rogue-life a little *g*<br />
I hope Verant will be at the &quot;Spiel 2000&quot;.<br />
Hey, we could meet there  <br />
<br />
I moved to Tallon Zek now, because i was frustrated that the only thing you can change on blue servers was your own level. Leveling never was my goal, but roleplaying.<br />
So the Race-War Servers were ideal for me, and my forming guild.<br />

<br />
But she dont say much in tells/say to anyone, dunno why, just the way she is I guess, nothing about being in PD or whatever, shame on you! : )<br />
<br />
Tallyn has quit the game :( Maja Graddnos &lt; Paradigm &gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">08-01-00, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, &quot;Sassy&quot; might be a nice person, but i can expect a certain level of politeness, even if i'm not a person that talks much.<br />
But once someone sends me a tell to congrat me on my new level, or if someone stands before me and welcomes me, i DO expect some kind of reaction.<br />
She don't has to small-talk with me, but at least she could say thanks. No reaction at all is rude and ignorant.<br />
<br />
<br />
ACK???<br />
Tallyn quit the game?????<br />
Why is he still listed as a PD member then? What about his items? (esp. FSS   )</div></div><hr />

I'm just one of those people that notices tells mostly and miss alot of other random stuff.  I have talked to you before but unfortunately it was usually either when I was deep in a dungeon or had just been summoned to open some door in Sebilis or Charsis.<br />
<br />
Anyway thank you, I try to answer people alot, but I am busy quite often, get alot of attention, and worst of all get alot of battle spam   Sassprinia Tunaria<br />

<br />
1. There were times when you were standing at zone-in in Sebilis, not doing anything, but you ignored me. But it's okay, that why people can have different personalities. I try to answer ALL tells i get, even if it is only &quot;sorry, no time&quot; or &quot;thanks&quot;... doesn't take too long, i managed that even while being in Trak's lair.<br />
<br />
2. Change your sig. You're 59 already, or did i miss some deaths?</div></div><hr />

I don't intentionally ignore anyone, I just have a bad habit of not reading anything thats not yellow, green, or purple.  And alot of the time anything thats not purple.  It's too bad there isn't some type of option to disable or reduce the spam from our weapons, it's fun seeing all the hits but it does get in the way of communication. Sassprinia Tunaria<br />

<br />
I did group with you once already in Karnor... I was feeling useless though. Group with a rogue 57 when you are 47 and you get my feeling.. ... &amp;lt;hugs Sassprina&gt;<br />
<br />
But you were nice to me... <br />
<br />
So once again congratulations for your Breastplate... ...<br />
<br />
I wish I could see how it looks like on Barbarian... Just like the Wovenshadow in fact...&amp;lt;sighs&gt;<br />

See you all in game, and peace between rogues... ... &amp;lt;hugs all her friends&gt; Samanea Nightwish<br />

<br />
First, congrats on your new BP!  And congrats to all of Paradigm on the kill.  I know you guys studied him for a few days (3 I think?).<br />
<br />
Also, there is options in the Chat Filter section to disable certain types of spam.  I just recently turned off my misses so that helps sometimes, and when in the Planes I turn off ALL others hits.  I also killed the bard spam as well now, which helps ALOT :0) Poke Swiftdagger<br />

Server wouldn't give me the name I wanted, came from an old AD&amp;amp;D campaign from years and years ago.<br />
<br />
I turned everything off including the wonderfull new burn spam thing.  With a chanter around though I'm still doomed to miss some tells, and worse off learn to ignore any white text. Sassprinia Tunaria<br />
