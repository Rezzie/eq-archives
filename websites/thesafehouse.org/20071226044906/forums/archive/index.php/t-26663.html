<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">11-04-06, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a pseudo-anime thread in that I'm very interested in seeing 'Paprika' and hope it does well enough to earn a nomination, but according to this (http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2006/06.11.03.html) press release there may be five nominees for Best Animated Feature this year.<br />
<br />
“Arthur and the Invisibles,” “Happy Feet” and “Paprika” still have to be released but I'm guessing that since last I heard Paprika was supposed to be released in March, Sony probably pushed to have a limited release to increase its odds of a nomination.<br />
<br />
In four of its five previous years (with the exception of 2002 when 'Spirited Away' won), there have been fewer than 16 films submitted for consideration so there have only been three nominees in the category.</div></div><hr />
