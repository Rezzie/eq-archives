 <br />
A friend of mine remembered this anime from when he was a child (he's in his mid-30's now), and one of our other friends just happened to know the title from the description.  He searched high and low and finally found a set of DVD's of this childhood favorite.<br />
 <br />
The issue is that the subs on these are REALLY bad, and I promised that I'd ask you guys [namely Stalk who lists this as one of his favorite series] if there are any better subs out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">02-01-07, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Passed on the info - hopefully he buys me dinner on Friday as thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-01-07, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind only 17 of the 113 episodes have been subbed. They've been working on it since 2004 for an average of 6 episodes per year. So it won't be finishing anytime soon. That being said, they are also subbing Captain Harlock, Queen Millennia, and have finished Space Symphony Maetel. All are based on the same Leji Matsumoto universe that Galaxy Express 999 is. So he may find those interesting as well.</div></div><hr />
