<br />
I have played EQ for years, played afew other games too but never gone into PVP.  Myself, (the rogue), husband(warrior) and other friends(druid and priest,) are totally hooked on WoW now.  The 4 of us gave PVP a go the other night - just dueling amongst ourselves.  Had a riot, was great fun.  My question is this :- what is the best advice you can give a rogue who has no PvP exp.  I have just hit 30.  Got my poison skill up to 102, so have 3 poisons open to me atm.  I have taken up alchemy so I can brew agil, str, defense and magic resist potions (skill 161)  My talents have gone alot into the stealth line, very few in assassination, a little in combat.(Just how I see the &quot;character&quot; of my rogue being, not built for a particular play style.)<br />
<br />
So for a beginner at PvP, what is the best single piece of advice you can give?  Thanks in adavance,<br />

The only advice I have is: red = dead, kill them before they kill you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deser</div><div class="date">04-13-05, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats not 100% true shankd.<br />
<br />
It really depends on what server you are on and how large the population is.<br />
<br />
Im on Daggerspine and have been questing in Stranglethorn recently. Sure ive been ganked but a lot of the time both sides just ignore each other. Around Grom Gol and the Expedition Camp can sometimes get a little hairy but if you are questing its not too bad if you are solo. Just make sure you are always aware of whats going on around you - especially in an area like Stranglethorn where there are A LOT of the opposite faction.<br />
<br />
As for tips...I play a hunter so I cant give you anything other than what has worked on me when facing a rogue. If you get the jump on the other person you should be in pretty good shape if you open with a stun move. Thats the only time I have a problem with rogues. Against a hunter you should always ignore the pet and hope that he doesnt have his &quot;Track Hidden&quot; ability active. <br />
<br />
And a little side-note. You can play however you want but I recommend not attacking someone while they are mid-fight or directly after the fight when they are low on HPs. There are plenty of people that do it but I think its just a common courtesy. I dont mind getting ganked ten times in a row but if I get jumped while im mid-fight it pisses me off to no end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont even mind that so much. Dont get me wrong it still pisses me off but its better than jumping in midfight and not allowing you to loot whatever you are fighting. This is especially frustrating when you are questing for mob drops. At least if they wait for you to loot and then kill you, you already have the quest item you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larlana Lavode</div><div class="date">04-13-05, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on my mood and what's been happening lately.  If I get ganked while in the middle of fighting a mob, then yeah, there will be repercussions to other side in the same manner.  If that hasn't been happening for a while, then sure, I'll wait until they have killed their mob, and then jump in and give them plenty of steel to taste.  Played too long in the honorable fashion to keep up that way.....let it fall upon the opposition and how they fight.  Change your ways, then sure, I can do the same.  Don't?  Oh well, reap that which you sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">04-13-05, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh yeah, definitely only half-hearted sarcasm.. I have to roll my eyes a little bit because it seems silly in context, but I really do appreciate it. At least if they wait, the mob won't have a chance of getting the killing blow accidentally (unless you were gonna die, anyway.)</div></div><hr />

I just /moo them, you get so close, you insult them to let them know that they're dead, and let them go on with their buisness ;).<br />
<br />
or I death ray them, if they die in that one shot, I leave them alone, let them get their body. If they don't die I giggle and run off.<br />
<br />
The only time I really get vindictive and grudgelike, is when the horde tries to take my ore. Once I killed a troll 6 times cause he kept coming back and taking my mithril/iron... eventually he stopped. (I waited until he began to mine to attack him, sometimes /tapping etc :) It was mean!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deser</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id have to agree with you there Jaesin. The best part of PvP (or anything that involves competition really) is the **** talking aspect of it. If someone of the opposite faction is halfway through a fight and halfway dead and you come up on them - they know they're screwed if you decide to be a **** and gank em. Thats one of my favorite parts of the whole PvP game.<br />
<br />
And you also hit on the other great part about it. If a person is being a **** then you have a choice other than &quot;taddling&quot; to a GM. That alliance keeps jacking my mobs or ore deposit or whatever - simple solution: shoot em in the back with an arrow. That happens a couple times and theyll prob leave your stuff alone....unless they are a moron and it takes em six times to learn....</div></div><hr />

Even if I dont plan on fighting someone ill usually toss a Concussion Arrow at the other team if I am running by them...thats always a good time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bender</div><div class="date">04-18-05, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a paladin in Azshara about a month ago when I was grinding through 52-53 that was as dumb as a box of rocks.  He was 51 I believe, and he kept trying to kill the stuff I was grinding on.  I went up and sapped him, just kinda like hey, I am here leave or die.  He stayed.  So I killed him, he came back, I killed him again.  I ended up killing him 21 times that night because he would not leave my area alone and there weren't enough mobs around for both of us to grind on.  He brought a 50 hunter, I would sap him kill the hunter then kill him, probably did that 5 or 6 times and the hunter smartened up and left.  The paladin stayed, and died more.  I finally got tired after probably an hour and a half of killing him, and went to bed.  The next day, I came back and an hour or so later he came again, just to die another 15 or so times that day.  I normally don't grief people, but if your taking my mobs and there aren't enough to share, I am going to kill you.  How hard is that to figure out?<br />
<br />
So six times is nothing!</div></div><hr />
