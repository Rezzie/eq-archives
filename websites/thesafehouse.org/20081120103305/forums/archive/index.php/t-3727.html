<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Flapjax</div><div class="date">07-18-03, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've done Bert a few times (2 successes) but not nearly as many times as the encounter has done us (about 8 or so failures).  Of those failures half were do to some pusling agro from upstairs or mistakes that consumed the clock.  But the other half of our failures are linked to getting kings under control on inc.<br />
<br />
To behonest I dont really think its the kings in as much as the extra 5 to 10 adds associated with each king who like to clobber MA and clerics.  I am curious how other guild pull the kings and deal with them (and the adds).  We fight at the zone down area and CC all the adds.  When it works its nice and clean but when chaos intervenes and king drops a MA or two and some clerics we lose valuable time doing CRs/rebuffing and are left with five or ten minutes to kill Bert... bastard has despawned on us mid-fight three times.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what are some ideas on king control that have worked for you?  I was thinking you could pull the trash mobs assocuated with each king's spawn point prior to the actual kings spawning.  Is that possible?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

P.S. I hate chaos... if Bert ring is all about flipping a coin and head you win tails you lose then I probably need to quit EQ.</div></div><hr />

Have someone aggro and run them away from the camp spot, name mob walks back solo or with just 1-2 adds while the rest camp the corpse/fd.. much more feasible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Flapjax</div><div class="date">07-18-03, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm interesting, I guess thats why they put all those extra hallways in CoDb.  So I'm assuming the adds that are &quot;skipped&quot; stack up with each successive king spawn? <br />
<br />
I really like the idea cause it frees us up from killing CC mobs... a real time consumer and we always seem behind the eight-ball. i.e., the two-hr timer.<br />

<br />
All we used to do is the pattern of kings isn't that hard to tell after one go, and you can more or less have rooms already cleared and ready before most kings even spawn since you already know the order they spawn in.<br />
<br />
The amount of time before the first king spawns seems to vary but especially after that its pretty basic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the most common problem with Bert event.  When someone ports down to bert area there is a very good chance that person will pick up pusling aggro.<br />
<br />
The pusling aggro itself is not a big deal but when there is a group up top who can't handle the puslings and they wipe or zone out leaving a damaged pusling, the summons start.<br />
<br />
We had this happen to us and eventually we had to camp out and come back to lose the aggro.  It cost us about 20 minutes.  Cost us the event ultimately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its like.<br />
<br />
45 mobs, first king, 4 mobs, king, 4 mobs, king, 4 mobs, king, 45 mobs, king, 4 mobs, king, 3 mobs, king, 2 mobs, king, 1 mob, king. Kill 8th king and king 9 10 11 12 spawn.<br />
<br />
Something like this, its been a while and i would have to dig through my hard drive do find the 100% exact numbers.<br />

That's how we've always done it and at least 2 times we've had 35+ minutes to prep for Bert.<br />
<br />
A good example is: arete.iambored.com/BertoxDead2.wmv<br />
<br />
You'll notice that the kings are never in camp alone, we always just DA pull the whole friggin' pad and CC it. Its good practice for RZ and gives your enchanters a fun time to make up for all the boring bitch work they do. Edited by: Dagny Blazestorm at: 7/19/03 7:18 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can pacify it pretty easily, you get a king and maybe 2 or 3 adds at most, often less.  Take 2 enchanters that work together well and it's not too difficult.<br />
<br />
It works cause it's how we did it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">07-20-03, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how can you have pacify work if you have all the mobs touching each other?  HoN/Pacification doesn't work when the mob's hitboxes coincide with one another.  Only once you have them aggroed and run off can you pacify the 1-2 mobs that path with the name back to spawn point.  They changed how the Bert mobs spawn a few months back when they changed Bert's spawn point to the East section, making him static.</div></div><hr />

Mezzables to chanters, others to tanks.  It may take a few minutes but every named pull will (or should) go flawlessly.<br />
<br />
Not only does this ensure you don't overlap (2 chanters/tank on the same mob) but it also puts real aggro on each one.  The mobs usually go after the clerics because they only have associative aggro, as soon as real aggro is generated (a heal for example), the generator gets swarmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That may be why.  I haven't done Bert in a few months now.  Our server has a good agreement going for backflags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a SK/Pallie taunt off the king before it even hits the monk and pull him to a warrior. Chanters have 11 seconds to mes all the mobs on the monk.<br />
<br />
Have everyone kill the king then assist an MA on the adds.<br />
<br />
Necros can be used to help mes.<br />
<br />
We did it this way twice with about 70 people and had 15 min left when bertox went down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Midi Brell</div><div class="date">07-21-03, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stop makign it so hard on yourselves.<br />
<br />
Use a couple monks to pull.<br />
<br />
Camp folsk in one of the hallways (we use NE), and then monks pull.  In order to get splits, one trains the zone out, mobs start to reset, and second monk pulls.  So what if you get 3-4 adds.  With this method you wont get 8-10 tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_solesk</div><div class="date">07-21-03, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we roam the 4 kings in a circular pattern. we send a da bard / paladin running into the room to grab aggro. the chanters mez the adds. the tank grabs the king.  works surprisingly well. pretargeting at least the king and the first few adds helps.  you avoid the middle spawns all together(which in my opinion is a huge time waster since they keep respawning), end up with over 30 minutes left for bert, and if you do it right end up o the side bert is facing with the room cleared so you can med/buff up before pulling him.  just get a da order setup and rotate through it as you roam the platforms.<br />
<br />
we've also never had a problem with pulsings up top. if your late we just require that you die and get dragged.  although i have seen them bugged for other raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">07-22-03, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the puslings up top add when there's an exp group up there.  If anyone has low hp aggro, they warp down.  If that group zones out, they warp down.</div></div><hr />

You can single every King to your camp with 2 monks, an pull item and some brain.<br />
(brain aka aggro and mob movement speed).</div></div><hr />

I died there and missed the spawn of the next king, but since we had killed the first time 44 mobs till the first king spawned i am willing to bet, that the next 4 kings spawn with exact 4 killed mobs between each spawn.<br />

<br />
<br />
The rest of the Mob dont matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, for the person who are to lazy to read all, i will compress it a bit:<br />
<br />
BERTOX RING EVENT:<br />
<br />
You kill Spectre, after you did it you have a break of 6 Minutes.<br />
After this break mobs will pop and the Eventcounter starts to tick.<br />
From this momement on you have 120 minutes to kill 12 Kings and Bertox.<br />
<br />
<br />
After you killed -&gt; 44 &amp;lt;- trashmobs the first wave of kings will spawn.<br />
<br />
The first wave spawn like:<br />
<br />
King / Kill 4 Trashmobs / King / Kill 4 Trashmobs / King / Kill 4 Trashmobs / King.<br />
<br />
THIS IS STATIC AND DONT CHANGE<br />
<br />
After you spawned the first 4 kings you have to kill another AROUND 40 Trashmobs (let me survive between the 2 waves and kings and i tell you an exact number).<br />
<br />
Then the second wave of kings spawn like this:<br />
<br />
King / Kill 4 Trashmobs / King / kill 3 Trashmobs / King / Kill 2 Trashmobs / King.<br />
<br />
THIS IS STATIC AND WONT CHANGE.<br />
<br />
After the second wave of Kings spawned you DONT HAVE TO KILL ANY TRASHMOBS ANYMORE &amp;lt;- READ THIS.<br />
<br />
After you killed the 8th King, the last 4 Kings will spawn at once.<br />
<br />
After you killed the 12th King, Bertox will spawn.<br />

I can assure you this is 100% incorrect.  Kings 1-8 are linked directly to trash kills and 9-12 directly to 1-8 all dying.<br />

I can double reassure that this is 100% correct too. I've looked at my logs and every single zone wide emote signalling the pop of a king comes immediately after the death of some trash mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*shrug* check your logs. i told you when kings will spawn.<br />
<br />
King  1-8 are direct linked to trashmobs. Static. In the bertox ring there is absolute ZERO random in it.<br />
<br />
Kill around 45 mobs, first 4 kings spawn. Kill another around 45 mobs. Second 4 king spawn. Kill King 8, King 9-12 spawn. Kill King 12, Bertox spawn.<br />
<br />
No clue why ppl have to repeat given facts again and again and again. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eelyen</div><div class="date">09-25-03, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the strat.<br />
<br />
1. Trigger Event<br />
2. Move to a side room and clear it upon spawn.<br />
3. Move around from room to room.<br />
4. Have a Paladin, SK, or Necro run in each room with DA.  This absorbs HTs. Rush in.<br />
5. If King is up among the group, kill king first, mez the rest (j00 gimp trainers)<br />
6. Kill Bertox.<br />
<br />
This strat will save you a hell of a lot more time then trying to single the king out and wasting several minutes to pull him.  Just engage him and the adds.  They are easy to root/mez/slow.  Just have a DA person get aggro first so everyone can rush in and not have chaos take hold. Edited by: Eelyen at: 9/25/03 5:10 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
- is all the fighting done in one location (a la ring event) or do you have to move room to room?<br />
- is it worth trying to simply AE the trash mobs?<br />
- do you have to worry about those annoying skeletons that pops on the death of a PC (as in the HP cycle).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kalledar</div><div class="date">10-01-03, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can fight in the same room, or move around, it's up to you. We fight in the main room (the one you zone into when you click the chair) in a corner of it. Which corner doesn't really matter until the end, when Bertoxxulous spawns in that room. He has fairly small aggro range, but gigantic melee range. Bertoxxulous spawns on the opposite side of room from the ramp to the trigger mob.<br />
<br />
You can AE the trash mobs if you have a strong AE group of people, but AE is certainly not necessary to defeat the ring. Either way works, do what you are better at.<br />
<br />
No mobs spawn as a result of someone dying in the ring.<br />
<br />
If you fight the ring in the main room, you will want to leave that room before spawning Bertoxxulous. Bert spawns when you kill the 4th fat king (Grummus model). The 4 fat kings spawn after you kill the first 8 kings. Some of the fat ones are really hard, compared to earlier kings. One has the lifetap that Raex/Vindor have. One has a nasty stun which makes it hard for the MT to keep aggro. The other 2 fat ones are easier.</div></div><hr />

Did the whole ring in 1hour 13min.<br />
<br />
Key to do it fast is AE the living daylights out of the mobs. We dont split anything, we just pull the King with its adds to camp ( A corner, we use the one with the trash ) Knights / Warriors pickup the adds, 1 warrior assigned to the nameds pick him up, get them all in the corner and AE the living daylights out of them. No splitting no difficult strats.<br />
<br />
Before the last king we move to a corridor where we pull the last king to ( we split this one ) kill that king, spawn bert, pull bert, set rampage, aow tank him. You win. Grats</div></div><hr />

Let me get this straight.<br />
You pull the King with its adds into a corner and AE the King with the adds to death?<br />
Kings are not immune to stuns?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Muji Valoran</div><div class="date">10-06-03, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the way we do it. Kill the trigger where ever, then head to north pad. Wait for it to spawn, takes a few min, maybe like 8min. When trash spawns it spawns in the side hallways then paths to center of room is asigned to (4 king rooms). So destroy that first set of mobs that roam into north pad, then prepare to move alot (helps keep afk down if raid knows it will be moving alot). Move in a clockwork motion from north pad to east pad to south pad ect. Stop just at the top or bottom of ramp into room and give a sec or 2 for people to catch up. Once set send in a da person to eat Ht's/initial agro and mez kill. Kill fast and move to next fast.<br />
<br />
 I have it timed out perfect so we do 2 rounds of trash north pad to west pad. 1 round of named from north pad west pad. 1 round of trash from north pad to west pad. 1 round of named from north pad to west pad. When ya kill west pad (8th king) it triggers last 4 kings, so we kill adds first, kill king then kill king that pops. So last set of named will be from west to south with the west one being killed already cause he poped there on top of ya.<br />
<br />
The last set ive done 2 ways and both work just as well. After 9th is dead (west pad for us) we proceed to north named and kill him. Then we kill east named (yay 5k procer, here is where we make bets on number of deaths). Leaves one last named which is slightly easier then 5k proc guy so hopefully no deaths on him. Can either pull south named to east pad and kill them there or run to south pad and kill then come back the way ya came back to east pad.<br />
<br />
Reason we like the east pad kill spot is cause bertox is right there down the west ramp waiting for you to pull him and never wanted to try to pull him through room of adds we never killed in center of room, they wont add if you just snag him up the ramp into east pad. The rest solely depends on MTs, healing, and positioning of the pull/kill.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Obviously our first few times didnt go this way, took us awhile to have the DPS for it to work out perfect like that. Cant figure out what exactly what triggers the first set of kings. I think I do recall noticing it spawning off a death of an elite one time but not positive. Elites were my guess on triggers but since my way works well for us I dont change a thing. Repop is definattly timed though on the trash, im pretty sure of that one. Edited by: Muji Valoran at: 10/6/03 6:47 am</div></div><hr />

Moving around has its advantages, but speed is not one of them.  While you are running you are not killing, and if you are not killing you are wasting time.</div></div><hr />
