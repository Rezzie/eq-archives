<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shylah</div><div class="date">10-25-02, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple questions that I've been trying to find answers to by looking a the different posts but am having some issues.  I'll just rattle them off and if someone could be so kind as to reply or at least link to an appropriate post I would be most appreciative.<br />
<br />
1) Advanced Poison Vials - These are crafted only?  I have a 250 Make Poison skill, but my pottery is pathetic (in the 140 range).  Like many, I chose not to hunt for pelts to make my vials when I could simply go buy them.  If they are crafted-only, are they droppable?  And what is the specific recipie including pelt type(s)?<br />
<br />
I actually had some other questions, but most of them are answered in this thread started by TibisHatter (Thanks for a great topic, btw).  The remainder are about different actual specific recipies, but those seem to be surfacing as their found so I'll not ask about them either --  lots of posts on that topic.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any specific info. <br />

Combine one peridot and one sealed poison vial in a toolbox, trivial at skill 70.  Bit more expensive, but less running around/farming skins. -- Squink McPoke, 61 Assassin, Lanys T'vyl. Hat.<br />
