<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kanaellars</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is WAY too much information to post underneath the original thread... and it isnt finished yet... but here are some glimpses into how I would build the barbarian NPC that Llabak was asking about here.<br />
<br />
Step 1:<br />
4d6, re-roll 1s, drop lowest<br />
18<br />
14<br />
12<br />
10<br />
13<br />
17<br />
<br />
Step 2:<br />
Assign stats<br />
STR* * * * 18 + 4<br />
Strength gets the highest roll because barbarians are all about damage.<br />
DEX* * * * 14 + 2<br />
Dex gets roll #3 because dexterity is added to armor class, give the lightly armored barbarian better ability to shrug off blows.<br />
CON* * * * 17 + 3<br />
Con gets the second roll because after dealing damage, the ability to take it (ie hit points) is also very important.<br />
INT* * * * 10 + 0<br />
WIS* * * * 13 + 1<br />
CHR* * * * 12 + 1<br />
<br />
Step 3:<br />
Choose race<br />
Human<br />
Racial bonuses: 1 extra feat at first level.<br />
* * * * 4 extra skill points at first level<br />
* * * * 1 additional skill point per level<br />
<br />
Step 4:<br />
Choose class<br />
Barbarian<br />
15 hp (1d12 + 3 from con)<br />
Base attack + 1<br />
Saves +2/+0/+0<br />
skill points - 16 [(4+0) x4]<br />
fast movement<br />
illiteracy<br />
rage 1/day<br />
<br />
Step 5:<br />
Choose feats<br />
Level 1 feat - Bullheaded (FR pg 34) Will + 1, Intimidate + 2<br />
This barbarian needs to be an imposing figure. High intimidation and a strong will support this idea.<br />
Bonus feat - Thug (FR pg 3     Initiative +2, Intimidate + 2<br />
Brabarians often hold position through power. The fast and fearsome thug is a master at this.<br />
<br />
Step 6:<br />
Skills* * * * * * * * * * * * ranks* * * * +stat* * * * +other* * * * =total<br />
Climb (str)* * * * * * * * 2* * * * 4* * * * * * * * 6<br />
Craft (int)* * * * * * * * 0* * * * 0* * * * * * * * 0<br />
Handle animal (cha)* * * * 1* * * * 1* * * * * * * * 2<br />
Intimidate (cha)* * * * 4* * * * 1* * * * 4* * * * 9<br />
Jump (str)* * * * * * * * 3* * * * 4* * * * * * * * 7<br />
Listen (wis)* * * * * * * * 4* * * * 2* * * * * * * * 6<br />
Ride (dex)* * * * * * * * 1* * * * 2* * * * * * * * 3<br />
Survival (wis)* * * * * * * * 4* * * * 2* * * * * * * * 6<br />
Swim (str)* * * * * * * * 1* * * * 4* * * * * * * * 5<br />
<br />
Step 7:<br />
Advance to level 18<br />
<br />
Step 7a:<br />
Figure stat increases<br />
Level 4 -* * * * Str + 1* * * * (STR 19 +4)<br />
Level 8 -* * * * Str + 1* * * * (STR 20 +5)<br />
Level 12 -* * * * Con + 1 (CON 18 +4)<br />
Level 16 -* * * * Con + 1 (CON 19 +4)<br />
<br />
Step 7b:<br />
Figure feats<br />
Level 3 -* * * * Endurance - Increases characters endurance, giving +4 on all checks that require extended activity.<br />
Level 6 -* * * * Diehard* * * * Character automatically stabilizes when reduced to negative HP and can continue to act REQ: Endurance.<br />
Level 9 -* * * * Power Attack -Subtract from hit to add to damage.<br />
Level 12 - Imp. Overrun - Adds +4 to strength checks when attempting an overrun, and the target may not choose to avoid.<br />
Level 15 - Imp. Initiative - +4 Initiative<br />
Level 18 - Leadership - Explained in DMG.<br />
<br />
Step 7c:<br />
Hit Points: (1d12 per level)<br />
Level 1* * * * 12* * * * + 3* * * * = 15<br />
Level 2* * * * 7* * * * + 3* * * * = 10<br />
Level 3* * * * 8* * * * + 3* * * * = 11<br />
Level 4* * * * 10* * * * + 3* * * * = 13<br />
Level 5* * * * 8* * * * + 3* * * * = 11<br />
Level 6* * * * 6* * * * + 3* * * * = 9<br />
Level 7* * * * 8* * * * + 3* * * * = 11<br />
Level 8* * * * 6* * * * + 3* * * * = 9<br />
Level 9* * * * 9* * * * + 3* * * * = 12<br />
Level 10* * * * 8* * * * + 3* * * * = 11<br />
Level 11* * * * 9* * * * + 3* * * * = 12<br />
Level 12* * * * 8* * * * + 4* * * * = 12<br />
Level 13* * * * 6* * * * + 4* * * * = 10<br />
Level 14* * * * 9* * * * + 4* * * * = 13<br />
Level 15* * * * 7* * * * + 4* * * * = 11<br />
Level 16* * * * 7* * * * + 4* * * * = 11<br />
Level 17* * * * 9* * * * + 4* * * * = 13<br />
Level 18* * * * 12* * * * + 4* * * * = 16<br />
TOTAL = 210<br />
<br />
Step 7d:<br />

<br />
Thanks!  That's exactly what I was looking for!  I wouldn't have thought of diehard as a feat, but that's a great idea   <br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, don't worry about equipment, thanks    That's not something that I'll need to deal with for several years at least, and who knows what might have changed by then.  The stat block was pretty much all I needed. Edited by: Llabak Tharr at: 11/2/03 4:15 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quote:Amulet of Tribal Bones – Adds + 4 natural armor and doubles any damage reduction the wearer my possess.<br />
Its an amulet of Natural armor +4 with a nifty added<br />
<br />
Quote:Armor of the Forest’s Protector – A suit of +3 Leather Armor that adds +20 to hide checks when hiding within a forest. Allows the wearer to cast invisibility on himself once per day.<br />
Basic + 3 leather with magic camoflauge and a once a day power. Give it a fancy name and its done.<br />
<br />
Quote:Axe of Angry Chaos – A +4 Chaotic Keen Great axe of Thunder.<br />
Its a basic weapon created with DMG rules and give a nice name.<br />
<br />
Quote:Belt of Mighty Health - This leather belt adds +6 to the wearer’s constitution<br />
I renamed it, but there is a belt in the DMG that does the same thing.<br />
<br />
Quote:Boots of the Forest walker – These boots add +20 to the wearers move silently checks when moving through a forest terrain. The boots are continually affected by a Pass without Trace spell.<br />
I took 2 pair of boots and put thier powers together, then I put on a restriction to make them a little more specialised... then added the nice name.<br />
<br />
Quote:Cloak of Resistance – Adds +6 to all saving throws.<br />
Straight from the DMG.<br />
<br />
Quote:Gloves of Immense Strength – These leather gloves add +6 to the wearer’s strength.<br />
My own variation of an item. There are 'Gauntlets of Ogre Strength', but I cant see a lightly armored barbarian wearing steel gauntlets, so I modified.<br />
<br />
Quote:Helm of Leadership and Command – This helm adds +6 to the wearer’s charisma when dealing with Nobles or those within a military group. The Helm also allows the wearer to cast Sanctuary as a cleric of equal level once per day.<br />
This helm I just made up myself.<br />
<br />
Quote:Ring of Bonding – These rings come in pairs or sets. All wearer’s of one of the rings in a set can at any time sense the other members health and condition, as well as know if they are resting, in combat, or a general idea of their current activity. Finally, as long as they are on the same plane, wearer’s may concentrate in order to obtain knowledge of which direction another member of the link is in. (NOTE: assuming in this case the druid would have the other one)<br />
This is a ring that one of my friends came up with for our group to have a while back.<br />
<br />
Quote:Ring of Deflection – Adds a deflection bonus of +6 to the wearer’s armor class.<br />
Not sure on name, but its a basic from the DMG.<br />
<br />
