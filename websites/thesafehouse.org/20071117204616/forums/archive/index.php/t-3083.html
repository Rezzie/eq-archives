<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Orcmauler</div><div class="date">07-10-03, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I roleplayed a dwarf rogue I usually went one of two routes.  <br />
First was the thief taker, I.E. being as that dwarves are usually great miners and gemworkers, lesser races tend to think we are easy pickings for taking our pretties.  Takers concentrated on combat/hide/move silent as they would be stalkers more so than &quot;stealers&quot;<br />
<br />
My second flavor was a trappist (my own sort of word).  This one had a little gnome in him I am sure, as his favorite activity was designing and setting traps for critters and enemies alike.  This one concentrated on find/remove traps, pick locks, and traps.  If in an underground setting this guy had options to set up deadfalls and such.  <br />
<br />
In the Dragonlance setting you have a lot of variance to work with as well.  If you are pre-age of chaos, you can be a hill dwarf determined on finding the riches of your clan that the mountain dwarves stole, or any other play on the clan vs clan rivalries.<br />

Post Age of Chaos A treasure hunter, determined on finding lost treasures stolen by the dragon overlords or dark knights, as well as searching for a new homeland.</div></div><hr />
