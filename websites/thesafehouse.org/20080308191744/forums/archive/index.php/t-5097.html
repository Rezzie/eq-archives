<br />
Anyway, assuming the current formula follows:<br />
<br />
Your chance of being detected is ( Your stealth specialization / oponents level ). <br />
<br />
This would mean that a level 1 stealther with 1 stealth would be totally hidden against someone of the same level. 1/1 = 1. Which would basically mean that you're totally hidden correct?<br />
<br />
now say the level 1 stealther with 1 stealth is up against a level 2, that makes stealth percentage at 50% yes?<br />
<br />
If you were level 2 with 2 stealth up against a level 1 then you would have 200% stealth percentage.<br />
<br />
I've done tests on this and the stealth for lower levels seems extremely weak when even compared to that of the same level, hell at level 2 i saw my friend with 2 stealth at roughly 8 paces. Am I missing something? I hardly find the current proposed stealth formula as effective when I consider the information I've derived from testing. Perhaps there's some other formula?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_zeemee</div><div class="date">06-11-02, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For every point under 50 when dealing with a level 50 non detect hidden class (assassin). The range with which your stealth bubble is breakable is increased by 20 range. (125 is the length of a horse) When dealing with assassins with detect hidden, the number is bumped to 50 or approximately 40% of a horses length. <br />
So, yes, 50 stealth is important. How important is all in the eyes of the beholder. You see, stealth is on a pulsing effect. Every three seconds, your char's stealth bubble appears. If you are within range of someone in that time with that bubble the size it is, you will get spotted. The smallest bubble you will ever have is 125, adding 20 to that seems like no big deal. <br />
the formula: <br />
with 23 stealth going against a 35 assassin the range of his detection is: <br />
(35 (his level) - 23 (your stealth) ) times 50 (12 times 50 = 600) + 125 = 725 <br />
125 is the length of a horse. 725 = he can see you from 6 horse lengths away.... =/ <br />
with a non detect hidden type it would be: <br />
(35 - 23) times 20 (20*12= 240) + 125 = 365 or right around 3 horses length. <br />
If they are in that radius of you during one of the three second interval stealth pulses to the server, they will see you. <br />
(Board post) I actually tested this on Pendragon with an Inf on one account and a NS on the other. There was no difference in stealth detection between 100% stealth and 120% stealth. There was also no difference in stealth detection between 100% base stealth and 100% stealth while including bonuses. <br />

<br />
This equation is so lame, it makes stealth relatively useless for anyone who isn't full spec in stealth.  I am 2/3 spec in stealth and I only use it in some rare occasions because I get seen too easily and I move as slow as molasses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cephlen</div><div class="date">06-22-02, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But does this formula take into account stealth after item bonuses and realm rank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_zeemee</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nordvrede</div><div class="date">07-03-02, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then how exactly do 40ish rogues take out 50th casters with PA? I've seen it done quite a few times, so it can't all just be the guy on the caster's computer wasn't paying attention  <br />
<br />
How do you line up front attacks on people if Stealth pulse might pop ya into view? I'm curious to know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_zeemee</div><div class="date">07-03-02, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not from my hgh level experience.... but I would come up from behind so he cant see you and walk thru him then /stick and PA. that would allow for the least amount of time for the 3 second pulse to check your visibilty. <br />
<br />
For comparison... When I PA a purple MOB while in a group I dont even do that. I usually just walk up and Pow. But sometimes I get destealthed and sometimes I dont. I do get away with many PA' and that is on a purple con not a red.<br />
<br />
Another tactic I use is i line up from the side and run up to the casters frontal area... and just as i reach that zone I push /stick and then PA.<br />
