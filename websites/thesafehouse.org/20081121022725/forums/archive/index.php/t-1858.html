<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Office space...cubicle...  You get the drift.  Low tolerance, minimal privacy.  We each get a recycle bin and a trash can.  There are custodial technicians (janitors) that come around and empty them once a day.  Do you all remember Captain Caveman from this post?<br />
<br />
Well, anyway, this guy is nyuck-nyucking it up with the guy in the cubicle next to mine when he suddenly has a coughing fit.  Now, I'm not talking like clearing his throat or a &quot;ahem&quot; type cough.  I'm talking the &quot;I think there is phlegm in the lowest vestibules of my lungs, I'm going to dislodge it now&quot; type of cough.  So he starts this gutteral, gurgling, cough that sounds like the velociraptors off of Jurassic Park, and comes up with what has to be the biggest lung cookie on the planet.  He looks around for a second, and the closest thing he sees is my innocent little trashcan.  <br />
<br />
PTOOEY!<br />
<br />
For a moment I'm shocked as this giant gob of green @#%$ just &quot;PLOPS&quot; into my waste recepticle.  When I finally overcome my shock (and make sure that whatever it was his lungs just gave birth to isn't going to jump out of the trash can and pull an Alien type of mutation and skitter across the floor) I look up to give him the classic, &quot;You are a stupid @#%$ and deserve to die&quot; look, but he's already back to talking to his buddy.  <br />
<br />
I absolutely love it.  THAT's the reason I came to work here!  I REMEMBER NOW!  I wanted to come in and watch some middle aged, disgusting, unshaven, unkempt, caveman bark up a snot milkshake into my trashcan.  I @#%$ LOVE THIS JOB!  The next time I'm here and noone else is around I'm going to TAKE A @#%$ IN YOUR DESK DRAWER AND WHIZ ALL OVER YOUR CHAIR!  It's the same freaking principal as what you just did.  You might as well just cover one nosril and pump a wad out of the open one right into the can.  That way you don't have to make that face that makes you look constipated when you have to bring up that mucous!<br />
<br />
On a positive note...I skipped breakfast today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Housekeeping can't seem to keep from putting it right next to the printer instead of back under my desk, and folks put paper in the trashcan instead of in the recycle bin.<br />
<br />
See?  Totally lame compared to this lungbutter story!<br />
<br />
I appreciate that I don't have to work where Kai does, though I hope he stays where he is so that I can have entertaining rants to read when I am actually able to take a minute or two from my work and relax. (Back In Black)<br />

It's either a space alien that will live under your bed and force you to kill, or it's a suspiciously concieved baby that will draw the presence of Jane Fonda for the next week.<br />
<br />
Either way.. ditch the can. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

But not in the trash can, I wouldn't want my nose that close to a loogie... that can would have to be moved someplace out of my sight post-haste.  <br />
<br />
Ugh... I am queasy just thinking about it.  blargh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is it that people insist on giving their positions totaly bogus titles.  Listen Pedro, you're a garbageman not a custodial technician, now go take out the garbage.  And get back into your chair little Timmy, you're a lifeguard not an aquatic safety administrator.  My ex roommate dropped out of college to be an interstate transportation payment collection agent.  I hope he likes the tollbooth on the Jersey Turnpike!  If your job doesnt require you to wear pants at all times you should not have a 4 word title!<br />

<br />
Edit:  And I would call that less of a &quot;hijacking&quot; and more of a &quot;running at the plane during takeoff and getting run over by the landing gear.&quot;<br />

<br />
In which case, the offender doesn't have a desk to dump the goop on... unless in gov't positions, janitors get desks.</div></div><hr />
