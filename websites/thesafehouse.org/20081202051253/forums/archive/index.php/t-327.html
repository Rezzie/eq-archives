<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Slink</div><div class="date">04-14-00, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rain had just let up as he snuck down the gorge<br />
into dagnors cauldron. A merchant is rumoured to live<br />
on an island somewhere in the lake around these parts.<br />
Not any merchant tho, one who specializes in poison.<br />
Slink had heard of this man while visiting the temple<br />
of solusek ro.  &quot;Take this note to Conium Darkblade<br />
in Dagnors Cauldron&quot;. Could this &quot;Conium&quot; be the same<br />
man who deals with poison? If he isn't already dead,<br />
I shall soon find out. A low grunt nearby caused Slink<br />
to abandon his thoughts and stop, dead in his tracks. <br />
His skills as a rogue immidiatly took over. Hide in <br />
the shadows was his first thought. Once he has <br />
succesfuly hidden, he began sneaking towards the <br />
grunting noise. As he approaches another grunt is<br />
heard. Slink peers over the crest of the rock to <br />
see what is making the unpleasant noise. An aqua <br />
goblin comes into view. &quot;By the gods&quot; Slink thought, <br />
&quot;I have to deal with these vermin? I had hoped to come <br />
in find the man I'm looking for and leave, with no problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sneaking slowly back down the rock, Slink heads farther down <br />
the slope in hopes of finding the lake shore. It didn't<br />
take too long, as the light from the moon glistened <br />
on the water. Glancing around the surface, slink<br />
spies the island in the middle of the lake. &quot;I hope<br />
this is the only island here&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
Slowly he lowered himself into the water. The chilly<br />
liquid seeped through his clothes sending shivers<br />
down his spine. &quot;Discomfort must be endured for anything<br />
worth while&quot; That's what he had been told by his Father.<br />
&quot;If something is too easy to get, it's not worth while&quot;<br />
That thought kept him coherent as he swam towards the<br />
island.  &quot;How long will it take me to get there? Are<br />
there any sharks or dangerous snakes in this lake?&quot;<br />
Something brushed past his left foot. &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
A sense of urgency penetrated his brain. &quot;I need to<br />
get there sa fast as I can&quot; Swimming all the harder,<br />
the island started to get closer. <br />
<br />
Upon finally reaching<br />
the island, Slink leaves the water, shivering lightly,<br />
he begins to walk up the rock. As he gets closer to the<br />
center, he realizes, that the rock takes an almost<br />
vertical raise. &quot;There must be an easier way to get up<br />
this then here.&quot; Upon circling the island, he realizes<br />
the truth. There IS no easy way up this island. &quot;Oh well,<br />
i guess i should get started&quot; He moves closer to the<br />
cliff face, and begins to find hand holds that he can use<br />
to get up. Half way up, the physical exhaustion is almost<br />
upon him. &quot;Just a little bit more&quot; he urges himself.<br />
He slowly moves higher up the side. Looking up, he can see<br />
the edge of the cliff. &quot;Just a little farther&quot;. His hands<br />
reach the top of the ledge, just as the exhaustion hits him<br />
in full force. &quot;I can't make it&quot; he thinks. &quot;I'm going to<br />
fall&quot;. &quot;I Can't fall! I've come all this way just to <br />
give up?&quot; he tries a little bit more and slowly but surely<br />
he inches himself to the top.<br />
<br />
After catching his breath, and getting a look of where<br />
he is, he spies a short fellow standing near the ledge.<br />
Looking out towards some type of encampment with a fire.<br />
&quot;That must be where the goblins live&quot; slink thought. &quot;I<br />
must speak with this man&quot;. Slowly standing up, Slink<br />
walks towards the man. &quot;Greetings friend&quot; The stranger<br />
turns around and gives slink the once over. &quot;Can I help<br />
you?&quot;. &quot;I don't know,&quot; slink replied. &quot;Are you Conium<br />
Darkblade?&quot; &quot;That depends who's asking&quot; replied the man.<br />
&quot;Lon the Redeemed in the Temple of Solusek Ro sent me. <br />
I was instructed to give this letter to a man called<br />
Conium Darkblade&quot;. The man bows before Slink. &quot;Lon sent<br />
you did he? I am indeed the man you seek&quot; Slink hands<br />
the letter over to Conium. Conium reads the note from<br />
slink and glances up. &quot;You want the Burning Rapier?&quot; <br />
he asked. &quot;Aye, I do sir, I feel it is a worthy quest&quot;<br />
slink replied. &quot;it is a very long quest, be prepared<br />
to work on it for some time. Here, take this axe and<br />
give it to a man at the top of the world.&quot; said Conium<br />
&quot;Thank you sir,&quot; replied Slink &quot;The main reason why<br />
I am here though, is to ask you, do you deal with<br />
poison? I've heard of a man in Dagnors Cauldron who <br />
is a Master with poison. I've come to learn&quot;  &quot;I've<br />
dealt my fair share of death with the stuff&quot; Conium<br />
replied modestly. &quot;How can I get started?&quot; asked slink.<br />
Conium says, &quot;You can begin by reading this book.&quot;<br />
Conium hands Slink an old tome. &quot;Bring it back after<br />
you have finished it, and I will tell you more.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you sir, You have been most helpful&quot; says Slink.<br />
&quot;You're quite welcome my young friend. Now, Go, before<br />
the goblins begin to wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slink turns around, feeling invigored, he tackles the<br />
cliffs with relative ease as he knows where the<br />
proper hand holds are. He reached the bottom in just<br />
a short time. Looking around he locates the gorge where <br />
he came in. &quot;I need to swim directly towards that,<br />
so I don't get lost&quot; he thought. Securing the axe<br />
tightly onto his pack so it won't fall off in the <br />
water, and wrapping the book in lether, Slink enters<br />
the water. <br />
<br />
After swimming for about 10 minutes, he<br />
reaches the opposite shore. But he is not alone.<br />
He is spied by a goblin, it launches itself at him<br />
to destroy the intruder. Slink is knocked down, but<br />
immidiatly gets to his feet and draws both of his <br />
daggers. &quot;You're going to pay for that, Vermin&quot; Slink<br />
unleashes a barrage of swings at the goblin, unfortunatly<br />
he only hit twice. He sliced the goblin across the forearm<br />
and across the chest. That only infuriated the pale blue<br />
foe. Letting off a howl the goblin counter attacks<br />
hitting slink across the side of the head. &quot;Damn that<br />
hurt&quot; he thought as he swings back. This time he<br />
connected his blades with the goblin 3 times. One slice <br />
across the other arm, another across the cheek of the<br />
goblin, and the last across the abdomen. That's all that<br />
was needed, the slice across the abdomen, split the <br />
goblins stomach open and it started to lose it's innards.<br />
Howling, the for turned and fled towards camp. &quot;No, <br />
I won't let you get there!&quot; Slink runs after the<br />
fataly wounded goblin and launches a final attack at it's<br />
back. Burying his dagger right to the hilt, the goblin drops.<br />
&quot;Whew that was close&quot; panted slink. Just then, 3 more<br />
goblins appear. One begins to cast a spell. &quot;CRAP!&quot;<br />
Slink turns, and starts bolting up the gorge towards <br />
the Butcherblock mountains. Arrows begin to fly past<br />
him. One arrow catches his shoulder and he reels from<br />
the force, some how managing to keep his balance, he<br />
continues his flight through the gorge. He can sense<br />
that they're getting closer, suddenly, green light<br />
flashes around him, and he's stopped Dead in his<br />
tracks. &quot;No! I can't move!!&quot; He bings shouting &quot;Someone<br />
help me! Please!&quot; I'm being attacked in the gorge <br />
and I can't move!&quot; The goblins get closer and closer.<br />
2 of the 3 stop. The one that keeps moving is bigger<br />
then the other 2. Slink thinks &quot;Could this be a tidal<br />
lord?&quot; A sense of dread enters the pit of his stomach.<br />
I'm going to die here, and there's nothing I can do<br />
about it. SMACK. Slink is hit once. SMACK again he<br />
is struck, this time getting the wind knocked out<br />
of him. Another blow catches him on the temple. He falls<br />
to the ground barely concious. He is kicked in the<br />
gut while he's down. &quot;Oof&quot; Trying to stay awake, and<br />
alive, slink tries to think a way out of this ordeal.<br />
He hears footsteps coming up behind him, the twang of<br />
a bow can be heard. One of the goblins drop with an<br />
arrow protruding from it's chest. The caster begins<br />
to run, but is struck by a force beyond the normal<br />
and is ripped to shreds as the fury goes through it's<br />
body. The &quot;Tidal Lord&quot; is about to finish slink off<br />
when a person leaps over slink and begins to hack away<br />
at the goblin. The lord turns and begins to flee as<br />
he can see he is outnumbered and will die if he doesn't.<br />
Green light flashes around him and he stops. &quot;Rooted.&quot;<br />
says a voice. &quot;I'll finish it off&quot; says another.<br />
Slink hears a horrific howl as he blacks out.<br />
<br />
Slink wakes up a short time later. &quot;he's awake. You gave<br />
us a scare friend&quot; You should be more careful around<br />
the aqua goblins. Those Tidal lords can be quite vicious.&quot;<br />
Slink replies &quot;So I've noticed. Thank you both for<br />
saving my life. If you ever have need of me, my blade<br />
is yours.&quot; &quot;We shall put some thought to that, now rest<br />
up.&quot; Slink rolls over and goes back to sleep, relived<br />
to be still alive. He sleeps through the night, and <br />
upon waking up. He realizes that his rescuers have left.<br />
Slink looks up to the sky and thanks Bristlebane for<br />
sending those 2 fine folk to save him. &quot;Looks like my<br />
luck is still holding up. I wonder what I can do today...&quot;<br />
<br />
But that is another story for another time. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is my first attempt at writing. I hope<br />
you enojoyed it.<br />
