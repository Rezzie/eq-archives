<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">05-06-05, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been gone a while, and just started playing again recently.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, last night I was in Desolace with 2 friends (3rd on her way) and we were doing some quests. As we were finishing the last quest, a 44ish rogue jumped us. warrior is 36 and I am 35. We also had a druid which was 45. Anyhow, we obviously took him down quickly.<br />
<br />
Just after he released to begin his walk back our other friend showed up, a human priest. A plan formed in my mind in that instant, and I knew that this rogue would not disappoint me in their lack of ability. <br />
<br />
'Everyone shadowmeld' I said quickly, and the priest asked what was going on. I tried to quickly explain that a rogue had just jumped us and I wanted to kill him again. 'He will never attack me, nobody is that stupid' she said. I chuckled. &quot;Just sit down and start drinking some water.&quot; I said. She was full mana, but that hardly matters. We had all scattered around her and began to hide/meld. The rogue's corpse vanished as he came back to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, he isn't going to come&quot; said the warrior. &quot;Never underestimate the idiocy of a badly played rogue&quot; I replied. 2 seconds later, the priest is stunned. 4 seconds later, the rogue is dead again.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't have been quite so bad, except we are all in the same guild. I am sure nobody from here would ever fall for such an obvious ambush, so I thought I would share it with you for grins.<br />

hmhm another whole GUILD of people that think that hiding + 1% dodge is worth looking as an oversized, creepy bat?</div></div><hr />

Just because you die doesn't mean you give up. Granted you guys had him in both level and numbers.<br />
<br />
Same thing happened to me. I was hunting in StoneWatch Keep. Man the Alliance think they own that place. Anyway...I stumble on a group out there of 2 warriors, a mage, mage, and palidin. I didn't see the palidin and so I started killing the casters then the warriors. I killed the first mage and was killed by the rest of the party because I didn't take down the healer first. <br />
<br />
So I go back....I outright kill the palaidin and the rest of the group falls like a deck of cards. Sometimes you just gotta rethink the way you do stuff. <br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe that's what the rogue was thinking. But most likely he was being stupid.</div></div><hr />

First, it would be ValSharess, which is a dark elven name.<br />
<br />
now to the main event:<br />
<br />
1-I always play an elven rogue, regardless of the game.<br />
2-4 people hardly constitute a whole guild. (although with my guild that is the majority)<br />
3-1 of those 4 was human<br />
4-Druids have to be elven<br />
5-we all started the game together, and figured the same race would make it easier (it did).<br />
6-Anyone who picks a race based on racial bonuses is a fool. For that matter, so are the people who assume others do.<br />
<br />
A creepy bat? As opposed to a midget with a mustache? Talk about creepy.<br />

<br />
Case in point.  One of our top PvP guildie slaps on the /afk tag in a contested zone.  Being a cute cuddly female gnome war, who would wanna attack such an innocent person?!  A rogue of course.  After the rogue's alpha, my friend proceeds to wipe the floor with the rogue.</div></div><hr />

ts ts ask ANY RL girl or woman what they think of the male elf looks in WoW. As long as your club of bats is happy in between themselves, i guess its ok hehehe</div></div><hr />

Once again rogue = cunning. Why wouldn't a smart rogue player try to get all the advantage they can? I'll see your statement and raise you, &quot;anyone who doesn't pick a race based on racial bonuses is a fool.&quot; Function &gt; Looks<br />
<br />
I'm a NE rogue. Higher agi then anyone else. 1% dodge bonus which is not that great. Shadowmeld which is incredible. Not only does it give you another stealth to use if stealth is down and you're out of combat (used it tons of times) but it also raises you're stealth 1 level. A NE rogue is always considered 1 level higher in stealth skill. GG trying to find one without eng items or felhunter or perception. Who cares if I look like a bat? Atleast I can entertain myself with the flips and the rythmic bouncing of my eyes as I run.</div></div><hr />

Imagine my surprise to see this ancient thread at the top of the list still when I finally returned today :p<br />
