<br />
Seems the merchants don't sell any of the arrows he was looking for and he would craft the arrows himself, but he is too slack to go get the material, so if you help him he will give you his old bow.<br />
<br />
All you need to do after getting the quest started is kill 5 antonica hawks that drop the quest feathers/beaks..whatever it was. <br />
<br />
I did it solo at lvl7. Got the quest, ran over to Forest Ruin ( I think, still learning zone names) and you'll find the hawks there.<br />
<br />
Was a very easy quest and although I did it at lvl7 solo, I was not able to equipp the bow till lvl9/10. Not sure. In beta I did it at lvl11 and was able to use right when I got it, on live I did it at 7 and am only lvl8 ATM and still too low to use. Bow skill needs to be 55, at 8 it is only 41.</div></div><hr />
