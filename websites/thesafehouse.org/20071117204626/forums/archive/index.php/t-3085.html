<br />
I'm a newbie D&amp;amp;D 3E player, and have come this far:<br />

We've played a couple of games, but they were very, very rough.  What we've basicly done, since some of the parents don't like D&amp;amp;D, is read up all we can on it, and rename it, Seven Storms.  Regardless, we're broke, and have no money to buy rulebooks and the sort.  Therefore I need someone to fill me in on how Skill points, Feats, and anything else I'd need to know, well...how they work.<br />
<br />
What I've gathered so far, is this:  In a fight, you roll a D20, for STR, if your roll, with all your pluses and minuses, is greater than, or equal to the enemy's AC, you hit.  You then roll a D8 for how many HP you've taken.  Am I correct?  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The chance of attacking is based mostly on your level, with your strength modifier (not strength value) being an addition to your attack roll.  Weapon damage isn't always 1d8, it's often (and usually) something different, depending on the weapon.  If someone smacks you with a giant axe, that's going to hurt more than if they stick you with a dagger.<br />
<br />
If you click on the stickeyed thread in this forum, you'll see a link to the SRD.  With the release of the D20 system the basic rules have all been released as 'open source' more or less, so you can actually get all the rules info from the rulebooks for free online.  If you have the printer and time, you could even print them all out.<br />
<br />
If you're having fun playing the way you're playing, keep at it!  IMHO the point of the game is to roleplay and have fun and the 'rules' stuff is relatively trivial.  I've gone entire sessions without rolling a die once, and had fun.  If you're looking to do more of the combat hack and slash stuff, though, you ought to look at the SRD and read up on the rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Esliim Karnth</div><div class="date">06-29-03, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game IS fun!  It's just that the fights are so ROUGH!  Thanks for your help!  I'll check out that link.  Oh, and are my stats good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">06-29-03, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for every 2 points above(below) 10, you get a +(-)1 to skills/abilities/whathaveyous associated with the applicable stat.  So an 8 would be -1, or a 12 would be +1.  Consequently, there's no reason to have an odd number on most stats.  An 11 wisdom is just as good as a 10 wisdom, for instance.  Again, if you look in the SRD, you should see rules for how to create your stats - a couple ways to roll for them, and a couple ways to 'buy' them.<br />
<br />
Again, it would be wise to read through the rules docs to get a real feel for what the stats represent, and how they affect the mechanics of the game.  Then, ask questions to clarify points on which you already have a basis.  It's hard to provide clear concise answers to questions such as &quot;how are my stats?&quot; if you don't really understand how stats are reflected in gameplay.</div></div><hr />
