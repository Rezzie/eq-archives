It's gonna be with a bunch of strangers at a store. Is there any kind of &quot;D&amp;amp;D etiqutte&quot; I should know about or anything? I dunno what kind of character I'll be playing, but I'm hoping for a Cleric, as I figure that'd be useful for making friends with strangers.</div></div><hr />

The 3.0 cleric's ability to sponaneously cast cure spells make them a bit more of a thinker's character than they used to be.  Don't buy any 3rd edit books though.  The new versions come out in about 2 months and that would be a terrible waste of money.<br />
<br />
Remember to bring dice.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to ask for advice about things if you're confused.<br />
<br />
Don't bitch about the rules.  If you think the DM made a bad call, say what you think, but if they don't agree then let it drop.<br />
<br />
What kind of game are you playing?  Is it just a bunch of people hanging about in the store playing, or is it a RPGA game.  If it's one of the living campaigns, be aware that some people take character death harder than others, so don't treat the other characters lightly (like you might, say, if you were playing a mod with provided characters and your character's persona is 'the grumpy one.'</div></div><hr />
