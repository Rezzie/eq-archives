still no luck, killed everything from scouts to shamans to tribesman to gathers/lookouts/followers etc..<br />
<br />
im guessing it drops more common off another mob in the zone because none of the other shards are *this* rare.<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong, they are rare but not this rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know of two people who killed seers and got a shard each tho.  Scouts seem a 25 minute pop, must kill the seer on his spawn point to stop him gating.  <br />
<br />
So would say drop rate from Seer is pretty decent 50/50 in my experence, problem is he pops about every 4-5 hours of clearing scouts.</div></div><hr />

Been camping him a bit lately and haven't seen any shards (though I did get a pair of slighted pauldrons), so I wouldn't get my hopes up.

<br />
unless someone can deny this assumption that is. i might be very wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
just havent seen another hunter or shaman drop a shard ever again.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is my last shard and oh boy is it fun to camp this sucker.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and btw for whoever said they dont buy that the emp is out of the reach of 99.5% of the EQ population is correct...its roughly 99.6% of the eq population that wont see VT. seeing as how only about 80 people will be getting the piece from the emp for hmm, a year?<br />
<br />
<br />
i am not trying to be cocky, he is just that hard. if you dont believe us, try him. just make sure you have coffins cause its a one shot deal. unless you dont kill blood...dont know what would happen at this point.<br />

While camping shoulders we got 2 Battlemasters, he was 2 for 2 on dropping a shard.

FTR, my guild has ST keys and we still aren't close to Emperor, in my opinion. We had members of the 1 guild on the server currently killing Emperor and perma-farming Ssra come to us and loot the shard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was pretty sucky, and took me about 60 hours of keeping that spawn down.<br />
<br />
Glad I've finished all my Shard camps... Now my bank is happy with 10 shards.</div></div><hr />

2 prohets, 1 seer=3 shards.<br />
<br />
Had a bunch of people from the uber guilds want the shards but none were willing to trade or buy loot rights. Heck wouldn't even give the group KEI. So all 3 got the destroy key.<br />
<br />
All dropped from exactly the same spawn point near akheva. There are three there, two close together, the third a bit further away. I was unable to singly pull the duo at lvl 60. Also tried to single by spell pull for a no go. <br />
<br />
Pull the mobs (2) over the next hill for the least amount of adds. Do not let it gate or be prepared for a bunch of critters!<br />
<br />
Be prepared for MT to be slowed and wiz/healers to be nuked.<br />
<br />
Other items that dropped 2 goranga spears (OK 2HP) and a staff that looked like the burnyia leg ripper.<br />

<br />
The game changes, armor, weapons, skills....all change and areas once thought &quot;impossible except for the elite&quot; are now on rotations with lots of guilds.<br />
<br />
Don't buy the hype, if you get a chance for a shard, squirrel it away for possible future use if you plan on playing EQ for a long time. There may come a time when Verant changes things and VT is attainable by many. Don't be intimidated or led to believe it's a waste of your time to get the shards, it's only a ruse to con people into selling, or worse yet, GIVING those shards to the &quot;elite&quot; so they can by-pass the time requirement of camping for the items.</div></div><hr />

But after having been walked all over by the same uber guilds many times in the past, they will get no help from me without paying through the nose. <br />
<br />
We have had 4-5 groups in hate when one of these guilds zoned in and said: &quot;We are taking over Hate, All your bases belong to us&quot;<br />
<br />
Had groups buffed and getting into position on 60 lvl mobs to watch as a DOOD_01 snares and kites it off, running it around calling for guildies to get there.<br />
<br />
The list goes on. I have something they want=they pay for it or they don't get it, Period.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if someone unafiliated wanted it they would have had it:P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hyarth</div><div class="date">08-17-02, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, my guild still has a couple dozen people bottlenecked at the ME shard.  Its a real pain in the ass sometimes.  But I gotta say this, I don't blame Clan Crimson for destroying those shards.  You reap what you sow.  If you're earned a pisspoor reputation by stomping over &quot;smaller&quot;  people, expect them to remember it and return the favor in kind when granted the opportunity.  Many .. uh .. careless 'uber' people forget that many characters are not only real people sitting behind their own computer, but people with long memories.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, the Emp is no joke.  Its not elitist hype, its the cry of pragmatics.  Don't forget, 'uber' people have memories too.  Whos to say one day you won't be jaunting along when guild X has killed mob Y has nice loot thats going to drop while you happen to be in the area and uber_member_29 says, &quot;Hey, that guy is cool, he gave us a couple of ME shards, lets hook him up.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The 2 easiest camps are the one straight ahead from DS zone (Seer) and the other is the two spawns a little left from AR (Battlemaster). There is another camp in middle of zone but alot of wanderes so guess need good strong group. Another one is the tree between AR and UP spawns some named I forgot but is a wiz type been there only once but spawned named two times in a row one dropped shard.<br />

We are about halfway done with the guy when a train to up is shouted by the same guild as depicted earlier. It went like this:<br />
<br />
Uber dude_01: Train to UP losers move or die I dont care.<br />
Uber dude_02: Losers to die.<br />
Clan: And some people wonder why their guild has a bad rep.<br />
Uber dude_03: Losers to die and I don't care either.<br />
<br />
Uber dude_01: /tell I dont know what your problem is. At least I gave you warning.<br />
<br />
Now do you think one of these people would even suggest that they &quot;hook-up&quot; someone else?<br />
<br />
I find that highly unlikely. <br />
<br />
On the other hand I have taken the guy down a few times since and did give the shard to people that wanted them. Just not from that particulair guild:P</div></div><hr />

Previous to that I had lost the roll on around 10 ME shards over a period of two weeks, but I just have bad luck, hell we camped TG for 3 hours before shard dropped for me, within 15 minutes of leaving a solo wizard got 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pulling the rock by the wall straight out from DSP zoneline...the Seer rock.<br />
<br />
From the map, it looks like the Seer PH is the most south and east goranga of the three...the one NOT right up next to the rock.<br />
<br />
But the seer popped in the place of the far NORTH star...the one right next to the rock and with his back to you if you're north of him looking south from the wall.<br />
<br />
So is the map just a little off, or can any of those 3 scouts spawn a Seer?<br />

<br />
Your reading comprehension skills have improved!  (5)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
For some reason I registered that statement about the Seer PH with the &quot;Spiritseer&quot; discussion just before it...thanks for clarifying what I was too stupid to get before...hehe.<br />
<br />
I can absolutely confirm that the Seer spawns AT LEAST in the far north of those 3 scouts at the rock...the one with his back to you.<br />
<br />
Whether he's the only one...I dunno, but if the others have PH's then I don't see why this one would be different.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the map.  Maybe I'll hit those other spots tonight.<br />
