When a fight is more than 50 players on each side, I dont know what I'm supposed to do.<br />
<br />
Armsman/Paladin/Merc .. tank/deal dmg.<br />
Scouts .. fire away at other archers/casters/tanks from a safe distance.<br />
Wiz .. DD from long range, AoE behind our tanks.<br />
Cabalist .. send pet, nuke, AoE root.<br />
Thuergist .. send pets, nuke, mez, buff tanks.<br />
Sorc .. AoE mez, send pet, nukes.<br />
Clerics .. heals, mez, smite.<br />
Friars .. gimped..<br />
<br />
What I did for the past few months is sneak into thier back line, and try kill a caster before I get killed. Most of the time I get picked off by archers or casters before I can finish off the caster, or sometimes my target gets a heal, and all is lost. Once I attack, there is 0% chance of me ever getting out alive.<br />
<br />
I would like to know what other Infils/NS do in large scale RvR. I know SB can one shot casters, so thier survival rate is definately higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maoudeib</div><div class="date">02-11-02, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In large scale RVR, it's best to coordinate with other stealth players to attack the rear or side of the prey.<br />
<br />
For example, most casters and healers will stick to the back of the army.  So one day in big RVR, me and a minstrel circled around an opposing army and took out a few casters.  One was medding so he got my perf artery.  The minstrel helped finish him off, even with heals we killed him fast.  Then we took out a few more.<br />
<br />
By then our army had advanced.  I'm convinced our coordinated stealthed attack in the back helped our side a great deal.<br />
<br />
Also having 5+ high level assasins helps a great deal for keep attacks.  We can take out npc archers or take out or at least distract enemy forces.  Actually just sneaking up and hitting one with disease and jumping back to the ground outside is often enough.  It's dangerous and if you die in the keep you will likely have to release, so hit quick and jump away fast.  <br />
<br />
You'll cause enough chaos up there to weaken their defenses, and likely cause a few deaths as well.  Instead of attacking the army at the door, they will be watching their backs for more assasins.<br />

I found that doing this will rack up more realm points then trying to sneak your way to the back of a large battle that only lasts 15 secs anyway.<br />
<br />
If it looks like the battle is going to last for a while for some reason I sneak around to the back and wait for the casters/wounded to sit down. Then I sneak up, hit them, and run like hell if they don't die and at the same time mashing the hide hotkey. <br />
<br />
Once Hide kicks in I turn 90 degrees to the left or right so that when other people are running after me they won't run straight over me and unhide me. Next I make my way back over to the back of the battle if it's still there and do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_sammyd11</div><div class="date">02-11-02, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Large Scale RvR try this:<br />
<br />
Wait for troops to engage.  There will constantly be small skirmishes breaking out, with tanks running at each other in the &quot;no man's land&quot;.  When one of these occurs, an enemy nuker will run forward and try to nuke your tanks.  <br />
<br />
Stealth up to him and beat on him - wait until he has begun casting to get real close, and make sure you are picking one near the front, NOT the back (this is for large scale RvR fights that last awhile).  Hit your PA, your stun, and maybe 2 normal attacks and sprint like hell if he's not dead for your side.<br />
<br />
90% of the time you will kill him if orange con or less, and get away.  If you don't get away, you will at least get to sprint for your side and be within rez range.  Stalking to the back and dying/releasing sucks.  If at any point after you attack you start getting hit, turn and sprint for your side, even if he's reeeeeeal close to dying.  If you get away, that guy will die eventually, and you willl get rps.  I almost soloed a red-con caster once, but he got away, and got healed.  5 minutes later someone killed him and I got 350 rps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">02-11-02, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">During a very long keep defenselast night (I think the estimate we had was around 100 or more mids sieging Bledmeer), I had surprising luck doing hit and runs.<br />
Our rangers and casters kept them backed away from the climb points for the most part.  To combat the SBs, I took to jumping down to perf them when I saw them approach.  At one point in the siege there was a nice little pile of kobolds under the climb point that I took =P<br />
I also spent some time trimming of Mids who strayed from the main group.  I found that in the confusion, I could usually get 3 shots off and still run back and get up the wall.  Finally didn't make it sometime around the 3d hour of the siege, but I think my survival rate was pretty good.<br />
During large battles, I try to pick off any casters and archers that get too close to the front line.. 3 shots and run to either make it, or get back to someplace I'll be easily ressed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fandango Darkdance</div><div class="date">02-11-02, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing we are best suited for imo is to sit stealthd a safe distance from the fight and mourn our losses. I also have been given the boring job of stealthing wood in for keep repairs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">02-12-02, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fandango, sometimes you can't contribute to battle, sometimes you can solo a yellow Hero?  Either your ineptitude or your prowess is imagined.<br />
<br />
In a large battle (other than a keep raid, then it's much more specific) I think of myself as a shark swimming around.  I stay around the line of battle (if there is one) or near my Hero or Warden friend.  If I see someone I can drop in 2-3 rounds (0-4 seconds) they go down.  That includes any-color robed caster, blue tanks, yellow non-tanks, and sufficiently-wounded anybody.  In the line-of-battle, if I can kill someone that fast, I can always get away and restealth.  Half the time I'm already leaving to &quot;my side&quot; of the line before anybody but my prey knows I'm there, the other half of the time I take maybe one arrow or one spell before I'm out of range and restealthed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fandango Darkdance</div><div class="date">02-12-02, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe Val, could all just be an illusion. I have not been in a large rvr fight with my shadowblade in a long time. Last time was from a hotel on a laptop. The moving company lost my main machine so when I first started daoc it was either the lap top or an old p 450 with 64 megs of ram and a voodoo 3 card large rvr was not for me.<br />
<br />
Tho I was in a rather large battle last night no real lag or the like. Only problem was I was not on my Shadowblade, tho what I did notice is my AE poison revealed 2 assasins both of wich were promptly beaten to a pulp by skald and thane protector. Who knows maybe with a decent pc and con we can do something, tho I don't plan on finding out anytime soon. I like the smaller battles better so will just stealth past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ubergnome563</div><div class="date">02-13-02, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are without a doubt the best class for assisting somebody and killing them.<br />
<br />
2 Heavy tanks are engages... sneak up,  Perf / CD the enemy tank.  Your tank will win.<br />
<br />
This works with NPCs too.  I was defending a keep once, the doors fell and this level 50 troll warrior engaged a blue con archer in melee.  I waited till the archer was at about 50% health, then snuck up to him and perfed the tank, while the archer tanked for me.  End result:<br />
<br />
Troll down X_X<br />
<br />
Archer alive.<br />
<br />
You can also perf people through keep doors.  This is cheesy, but when you got somebody meleeing a ram though a door, the best way to give them a nasty suprise is to do this... Just sneak up.. target through the door (like they did the ram) /face and perf / CD / SS   then repeat if they do it again.<br />
<br />
We kill casters and archers well too.  And make good *cringe* scouts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fandango Darkdance</div><div class="date">02-13-02, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will have to try the keepdoor thing, sounds like it could be entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_sneekeerz</div><div class="date">02-15-02, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost everything we can do is covered by others in a large scale fight.<br />
<br />
You have archers/casters safely take down other archers/casters from long range. There are abundant of these classes so you dont really have to worry about not enough of them.<br />
<br />
You have tanks to draw fire from enemy and distract enemy tanks.<br />
<br />
Casters assist tanks the best. Especially the AoE ones. So us going in and assist tank with a PA and CD is a moot point. <br />
<br />
All these guys can go on and on and on, while for us, once you do ONE attack, we can either run away and try restealth, or fight like a tank. Now a leather wearing class in exposed melee combat is a very juicy target, and we do gimp damage without our opener. If we take the run back and restealth and do it again style, ever wonder how much dmg casters/archers/tanks have dished out while you're scramling for your life away from enemy lines trying to restealth? Sometimes the battle is already over after you restealth and crawl back to the front.</div></div><hr />
