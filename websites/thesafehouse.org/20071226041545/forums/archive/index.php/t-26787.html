<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">11-13-06, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a review for Ergo Proxy (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=1105) on ANN and it sounded interesting, so I did a little digging and so far have liked what I've found.  It seems a bit BladeRunner-esque and looks to have good production values, so I'm thinking about starting on the series.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I'm already working on Speed Grapher, I also picked up the first episode of Noein (it looked interesting and I like the concept so far), and I was intending to start on Full Metal Panic TSR when it's released tomorrow, so while Ergo Proxy does seem right up my alley I'm going to have to choose to drop at least one.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling Noein is going to end up the odd man out, but I was just wondering about people's opinions on Ergo Proxy, Noein, and whether FMP! TSR is as good as the original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-13-06, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely don't drop TSR. It is great. As for Ergo Proxy and Noein, Noein is considered an all-around better title. If you liked the first few episodes, then it becomes even better later. Comparatively, Ergo Proxy has a very small and dedicated fan following.<br />
<br />
Noein is the safer bet for enjoyment. I watched both, dropped both. But that was due to time constraints, I intend to finish Noein where I didn't have much to say about Ergo Proxy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">11-13-06, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TSR is amazing, Noein is decent to watch, as for Ergo, maybe it's not for me... 1st ep piqued my interest, I gave it a fair 9 eps shot and dropped it. Guess aint my thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">11-13-06, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really liked Lain and Witch Hunter Robin, and I don't mind slower paced anime so I think I'll enjoy Ergo Proxy, but I've been looking at the release schedule for Noein and figure I may be able to afford both.  Noein is a three months between DVD schedule (January, April, and July 2007 for the next three disks) instead of the normal two months per disk, so by the time I'm done with Speed Grapher (March 2007) it'll still be a month away from Noein's third DVD.<br />
<br />
I think following TSR and Ergo Proxy on their two month schedules plus Noein on its three month schedule (plus finishing off Speed Grapher) is going to be my limit though.  I'm trying to think of any other good anime series coming out in the first half of 2007, plus any North American movie releases that I want to get but I can't think of any, though I don't like plotting out my entire DVD buying schedule for the next 3/4 of a year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know what makes you think that Ergo is slow paced, I didn't find it to be so. Just the atmosphere, the feel of the whole didn't sit with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">11-14-06, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to remember someone in a discussion thread on another forum mentioning its pacing being slower than 'normal', whatever that's supposed to mean.  I don't mind the pacing of a story being unusually slow or fast (.hack/sign is a slower paced anime I liked, Excel Saga is a fast paced anime I liked) so long as it fits the way the story it being told.  I think of it as being taken for a journey.  Whether they're going to step on the gas and cover a lot of ground in a short time, or whether they'll slowly cruise through the main plot to build up suspense or curiousity and give me a good amount of time to soak up all the points is less important to me; I can be entertained both ways.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like is when an anime goes fast through something then adds filler (they may as well have just taken their time through the important points and not even done the filler), and I also don't like those insanely long Dragonball type fights.</div></div><hr />
