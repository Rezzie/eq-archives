<br />
For example a 50 Stealth spec inf versus a 40 spec + 10 Stealth in items.<br />

Some people are saying you move faster with a natural skill than with skill gained with + items. Not sure on that myself though.<br />
<br />
When it all comes down to it though the major reason is not having to worry about having items to make you have high stealth.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure who will see whom first...<br />
<br />
BUT I am damn certain which will walk away from his enemies corpse...<br />

<br />
<br />
(i am still testing my theory btw.  I put on my gear at lvl 36 which brings my stealth to 39 and see how well a 42 or 43 assassin can see me.  It is hard to test cause I don't know any 42 or 43 infiltrators on guinevere. hehe) Lohengrin <br />
