I caught the last 10 minutes of it, and it looked pretty silly.  A bunch of poorly acting 'alts' such as a goth, a convincing Miss Cleo impersonator, and who I think is a Native American Shaman have a mansion in which they make the players do some crazy stuff to attune themselves or something.  At the end, the 5 alts vote who they want to get kicked off the show, with the winner of that week's trial casting a tie-breaker (I bet there will ALWAYS be a tie-breaker).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone saw the whole thing and if the rest of it was any less campy than the last few minutes.</div></div><hr />

Body mod dude, total vegan, vodoo lady and the wiccan sound like people I can see hanging out at the local coffee shop.  That could just be Boulder though...<br />
<br />
 The one chick who roomed with the total vegan was a total head case.  She lives in a monastery and is a virgin because that is the only place she can feel safe, but works in NYC?  Then she shows the most clevage on anyone on the show.  Then she pulls the pathetic geek story at the end, awww nobody loves you Charlie Brown, you blockhead!<br />
<br />
 The &quot;real&quot; people are a joke to.  Who would think the mammas girl raised in the church would sit out of the voodoo ritual while the ex-stripper jumps right in?! Shocking.  I do like the cynical barbershop janitor, the rogue of the bunch for sure.  Taunting the vampire the first time he saw him, heh what a bluff. __________<br />

<br />
I like alt-y people though, I might have to watch it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_PandaJoe</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched the whole episode, and thought it was awesome.  They picked the best contestants possible for this show.  A bunch of uptight conservative jackasses who manage to completely destroy any possible sympathy you might have for them.  The alts seemed like the actual normal people (if somewhat insane), while the contestants were mostly annoying jerks.  When they interviewed one of the guys at the beginning, he made a point to (repeatedly) mention how Christian he was.  Later, he was talking to one of the other guys about how he hoped one of the girls wouldn't be voted off because she was hot.  Or the guy who got kicked off, who acted smug when he decided he wasn't going to participate in the voodoo womans ceremony (hell, it was only some dancing.  ok, so she did claim she was possessed at one point, but she was really just pissed).  And the worst was probably the whiny convent girl.  I swear, after she lost the first game thing, she said along the lines of &quot;It's like trying out for cheerleading all over again&quot;.  I'd much rather live with the alts then the contestants.<br />
All in all, a good show, if you like seeing uptight morons being tortured.<br />
<br />
Oh, and not only is the wiccan chick hot, she's got the accent.<br />

It seems they tried to find the most stereotypical and religious people they could.  I'd much rather live with any one of the Alts than the contestants.  Most of them seem to be either extremely conservative, religious or just uptight. For example, one of the men is older and Southern.  He refused to sit next to one of the Alts when they were naked.<br />
<br />
The show is sort of like watching someone trying to get a virgin drunk at a frat party. <br />
