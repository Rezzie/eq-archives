<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been throwing around this idea as a business one in my head.  If there were a maid cafe in a city you either lived in or were visiting as a tourist, staffed by cute Japanese girls, would you go?  <br />
<br />
What kinds of services would you want to see, i.e., maids dancing to Jpop, playing games, photobooths?  Would you like your maid cafe with a manga collection?  Would you want them to speak some Japanese for a genuine experience, or would you prefer an Americanized one?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much do you think it costs?  It's not like you're going to blow $20 at a cafe.  At a maid cafe in Japan, a drink costs $4 and includes a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OpZO</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely wouldn't go. Don't like the feel for anybody involved</div></div><hr />

I think a more feesible business idea would be a cafe where the waitresses dress as diffrent fantasies. You'd have the maid, the cheerleader, the nurse, the librarian, etc. That way you cater to a larger audience. You'd also get hit with the attention Hooters got at first, so becareful about that. You wont like it, but you should probably hire guys to work there as well. Fire fighters, police officers, uh...I dont know what the other female fantasies are, lol, ask a woman. That way youll cover yourself over a sexual discrimination lawsuit.</div></div><hr />

Well, for starters we would only hire my wifes' friends so I don't think we'd get sued, until we had to hire more.  It's true, some sort of weird cosplay/fantasy cafe that alternated costumes (school girl, sailor moon, maid, etc) would be more popular, but the idea was to import something uniquely and distinctly Japanese.  It seems like there is almost the same percentage of &quot;otaku&quot; in the US as in Japan, but perhaps the community is a lot less established and more dispersed.  Americans are less into &quot;kawaii&quot;ness and that is a problem...  I am surprised at how few would go.  The maids working these cafes in Japan are almost celebrities, they're like the new geisha, not really anyone being taken advantage of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I died a little =(...<br />
<br />
As kawaii as some cosplay is i would not want someone to do it esp for me...cosplay should be about representing the char and not doing it for anyone else but yourself. Thats kinda how a cosplayer should feel about it but the fact is i guess that ppl do just look at as pure pleasure rather then an art.<br />
<br />
IMO...Im still a novice about cosplay :P.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also IMO i think it is too early to start doing these type of events/imports at the current time. Hardcore aside the US is not rdy for this radical change...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, how can you love all that is &quot;kawaii&quot; and just say no to maid cafes?<br />
<br />
edit:  Yeah, it may be a bit bleeding edge, but the way trends work in Japan the maid cafe could be gone in a year.  The other thing is in the US sometimes things from Japan which are on the fringe end up mainstream because we don't know that it's fringe in Japan.  If someone created a straight laced maid cafe with a lot of hospitality, and it might attract an unexpected audience.  The fact is we have a rather big geek population that is an untapped market outside of electronics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll admit it is cute but i don't really need the ego boost of someone dressing up as my fav anime fantasy just to make me feel better about myself. (assuming this is the intent of the maid cafe...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I would think the overall attraction is the mystique of Japan itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the maid cafe operates on a level sort of like the geisha for otaku (not the American view of the prostitute, but of the entertainer).  The appeal is shyness, innocence and the good service, with a hint of being naughty or goofy.  Maybe we're a bit too spoiled, as we'd rather just eliminate the middle man of subtlety with Hooters.  After all we have to dumb down Japanese horror movies and walk through step by step anything close to a subtle ending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds close to insulting us because we dont like the idea...<br />
<br />
If you really dont want &quot;real&quot; feedback, then why ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I'm not trying to be insulting, just more like whether the entertainment industry sometimes doesn't give people enough credit.  And yeah, the appeal would be it's Japanese.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no thats not what i said..<br />
<br />
I said alot of the appeal is that its in JAPAN..<br />
<br />
Having it in downtown San Francisco kinda looses the mystique of the whole thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, people like Irish pubs and French cafes in the US... or Olive Garden...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and they also like teppan restaurants..<br />
<br />
But that is comparing apples and oranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd definitely go. The point of maid cafes are not &quot;kawaii&quot; but &quot;moe~&quot;. A subtle but huge difference. Would it work in the US? Maybe in a large city. I could see it lasting a few years in Japantown, San Francisco. But even then, you'd still be hard pressed to find customers other than novelty first-timers. One benifit of Maid cafes are the fact most are  in Akihabara, where you are among equals. It's not like hooters where the &quot;guys&quot; can go.<br />
<br />
I can't see anyone other than the very hardcore and shameless wanting to be regular customers (hi, me). If it was in a seculded area where people wouldn't feel pressured to not be seen there, I can definitely imagine it working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Think this is the big factor if you want this to take off hehe.<br />
<br />
Like Japan, american &quot;otaku&quot; hide themselves in public ;).</div></div><hr />

You're sort of describing Bobby McGees, or how they used to be. There are men and women dressed in outfits and they have sections of the restaurant that sort of match a theme (the Hawaii room for instance). The waiters pretty much act their parts. If you had some anime characters mixed it and had an anime room it wouldn't seem odd.<br />
<br />
However... I think they stopped doing the whole dress up thing, or maybe they only do it on certain nights now? I dunno if the place is even still open really but he last time I went was for lunch and folks didn't dress up, it seemed more like an oddly decorated restaurant than anything special.<br />
<br />
As far as a real Maid Cafe, maybe a Mister Cafe would do better? I saw an article where they opened one in Japan and it seemed to do well. It might do better here because it would get the counter to Hooters angle for those who know nothing of Maid Cafes or anime.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering if an anime version of  Medieval Times (http://www.medievaltimes.com/index2.htm) would work in the US outside of a theme park.  Disney has done some toon based resturants in their parks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrooklynBridge</div><div class="date">07-12-06, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would work in NYC with the support of a good PR firm. Folk here love their little bakery lasses with the short short skirts.</div></div><hr />

Well seeing as if im not mistaken Ragnarok is somewhat of a medieval/anime/fantasy/game *dont even know if thats how it looks like but in my eye's yes* then i can see this actually working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">07-14-06, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're going to keep this under wraps for the time being.  Ideally I hope to have maids advertising at Comicon and Animefest next year.  However, I have a lot of work to do to figure out this business plan as well as some legal stuff before it seems feasible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-14-06, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might want to make an show at AnimeExpo if you want to make a big show of it. That'll get people talking.</div></div><hr />
