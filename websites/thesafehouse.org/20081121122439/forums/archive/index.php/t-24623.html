<br />
Invictus is a mature, focused PvE (Player verses Environment) guild for all races soon to grace Telon. We promote fun, laughter, and camaraderie between guildmates. Invictus is a guild founded on morals, ethics, and, above all else, honor. All members exhibit these traits in the highest degree and represent the guild accordingly through their actions. We will all strive to grow stronger as a whole. Greed does not exist within our ranks, no member is more important than another. We are all in this together, friends helping friends.<br />
<br />
You can see the rest of our charter here (http://www.invictus-vg.com/charter.php)<br />
<br />
We believe that our experience and lighthearted attitude will suit many gaming styles and our intent is to have fun, while we take down the biggest mobs in the game. <br />
