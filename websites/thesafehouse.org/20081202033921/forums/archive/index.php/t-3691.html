Quote:When it comes to information about Jedi, we’re generally going to keep a closed lip. There have been a lot of rumors in the past few months. Some have been true, most haven’t. Here is what I will tell you though:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I expect to see our first Jedi within the next couple of weeks. We’ll let you know when that happens. If someone tells you they have already become a Jedi, they probably aren’t being truthful or are playing a different Star Wars game. We have been making some tweaks to the Jedi system from internal testing (little stuff like final death=loss of all skills, not deletion of character. Effectively it is the same thing, except you don’t have to keep hunting for a new name with your force sensitive slot - unless you want to that is)<br />
<br />
The one rumor I will confirm, this upcoming publish will introduce the Dark Jedi. Currently on the Jedi FAQ we say that it is a future feature. I want to let you know that the future has come. Dark Jedi is one of those features we’ve been working on behind the scenes and it is finally just about through internal testing. Looks like it is just in time.  <br />

The same thing is right.<br />
<br />
Its the same stupid @#%$ that makes me want to not play a jedi, no matter how &quot;rare&quot; they make them to try and make people think they are l33t.<br />
<br />
For those who don't play SWG, your skills are the only thing in the game that you spend xps on, so if you lose your skills when you die, its like your starting over.<br />
<br />
So...yeah, good job Sony, you just keep right on suckin.<br />
<br />
Dark Jedi being in would have made me ecstatic, exept playing a jedi doesn't sound like any @#%$ fun. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

Every review on the net has said it is subpar as it stands.  Every review has also said that the game has the potential to be excellent in the next few months.  Thats where it stands right now.  In the middle and only time will tell if it gets better.<br />
<br />
I am enjoying it for now, but its at the point where alot of the players are just looking forward to the next patch for content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, dont have time to drag up the info. But padawan gets 3 deaths/clone.  Then once you get master jedi you open up the 4th and 5th. <br />

 It's only wrong if you get caught.If  consequences dictate my course of action I should play GOD<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-07-03, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ridah, you really try too hard to get people to like SWG.<br />
<br />
I played SWG for a month (ended a few days ago) and while it really isn't that bad, it didn't give me many memorable situations and the majority of the situations I do remember were frustrating ones (like aggroed mobs popping up right in front of me as I ran, how I lost a battle because my attacks ended up dropping the mob's health and action bars down to slivers while the mob was able to just beat soley on my health bar to knock me out, or a lair of aggroing cats spawning right next to my mineral harvester which I'd just spent 5 minutes running to but couldn't get to it so I could empty the harvester and deposit power).<br />
<br />
The only two good memorable experiences was that I was impressed with how the non-aggro mobs would act around people and how even aggroing mobs would sometimes give you a fake charge to scare you off, and I was also impressed with a gig I joined as an entertainer where we had a whole band going plus a few dancers and it sounded great.  The entertainer was a class I didn't mind playing but it wouldn't be something I'd spend $15/month to do.<br />
<br />
The needlessly complex combat system, the way random mobs/lairs pop up all over the place, and the player generated economy makes the game less attractive than it could otherwise have been.  I've yet to see a player driven economy that works and I still haven't - I think future MMOGs should just stick with a player assisted economy so the developers have some control over the economy.</div></div><hr />

At the moment its not horrible, but bugs and unbalanced classes are ruining it. SoE, at least in EQ from my experience, has been ok about squashing bugs (then again, at the beginning of EQ there were tons of bugs that took a while to fix), but they aren't so good at balancing classes. I think in a few months it will be a decent game but by then it will have gone the way of Anarchy Online - Release sucks, and a year or two later its not a bad game. Oh well. I'm enjoying it, and thats all i, and anyone else who's liking swg, cares about.</div></div><hr />

Nothing else to really say on the matter.  SWG got boring, and EQ hasn't even after 4 years.<br />
<br />
And I couldn't begin to explain why.  Its just the way it is. &quot;Classes are not that out of balance -AbsorEQ&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Subtract the cancels (includes me and everyone I know that played Galaxies...100%) to get the true number of subscribers.<br />
<br />
The net number is certainly a niche product. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">10-07-03, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">**before everyone says this is wrong with swg or that is wrong,im not talking about anything but the most basic elements of gameplay. Im not talking about the bug issues,the lack of money sinks,the screwed up economy,the faction pets,the ch pets,the X class is overpowered issues**<br />
<br />
What SWG has that is good:<br />
<br />
1. best economy model of any game released to date,this includes tradeskill,interdependency of classes reguarding trade system,etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
2. open ended ability to be anything you want at any time you want if you work for it. doesnt really take all that much work either.<br />
<br />
3. good ability to role play,or play as you like.<br />
<br />
4. best all around game design in relation to items and equipment,with the exception that you cant customize it as much as i think you should be able to.<br />
<br />
swg lacks<br />
<br />
5. any kind of content. game has 0 content for anyone whos played for more then 2 months, in relation to the galaxy. you can pretty much see the galaxy,find everything you want,do everything you want be everything you want in this time frame,if you play 10-15 hours a week. <br />
<br />
6. 100% whack a mole gameplay reguarding pve combat. there is no challange,and there are no tools to make pve a challange. Game is designed along eq lines,with advancement through combat for alot of classes. Game basically has 1 format for every combat class to advance,theres no variety in it. <br />
<br />
6a. See above for crafter profressoins,100% craft a mole gameplay. <br />
<br />
7. complete failure as a pvp game. SoE screwed the pooch on this one,they didnt think about it,and are stuck with the old EQ method of pvp, 2 different combat systems,with horrible results.  only way to control pvp is reduce this special attack,or that special attack,or elimate this or that. <br />
<br />
8. basic failure on all professions in the game. Theres no depth to them,and no choices to be made. last game that came out with the hybred profression/xp setup was shadowbane,the depth there at least makes you make some decisions. In SWG theres no depth,so no chioices,your a clone of every other &quot;insert charecter here&quot; in the game.<br />
<br />
9. basic failure on tradeskill system,in that everything everyone makes is the same reguardless of what race you are. Its all identical ,if you can get the same resources/material,and have the same title. Lack of customization really hurts the tradeskill system.<br />
<br />
I'm still playing,why? well i still enjoy the game,and its also alot better then EQ to me anymore. i can be a casual gamer here,in EQ theres no chance of that and hasnt been for years. <br />
<br />
 Potential,swg has a ton of potential. Basically i bought the game even though i knew it was in bad shape,because some of my old guild was playing it, im hoping to hold out as a casual gamer for awile,till they do the space expansion. long way off? yep.  Still the potential of the game is there,however they wont/cant fix the rpg game they have now. If they don't get a killer flight sim going they will have completly destroyed any potential this game ever had.<br />
<br />
Out of my old guild who started up,we got up to around 15-18 people, basically 90% of them are gone now,because the game is still beta. anyone who is thinking about playing,id say wait 6 months to a year. <br />
<br />
Theres no real reason to flame SWG,its no better nor worse then any other game to come out that tried to chase everquest.  it has its good side,and bad side,but so does planetside,shadowbane,daoc,AC2,etc etc etc.There has yet to be a game that really makes some forward leaps like EQ did. All the people who jump up and say Horizons,WOW,etc etc will be great,well hate to disapoint you,but im either in beta or have friends in beta, on every upcoming online game that has some buzz. Frankly they all are going to fall way short of the hype.</div></div><hr />

When you become force sensitive you unlock another slot, the 'force sensitive' slot.  You have to create a brand new character and go from there.  er... around beta time I believe a Jedi instantly became fair game for any player character to kill.  Not sure if they kept that though.

Playing for a little while in the beta was enough to convince me that SWG was a dog of the worst variety.<br />
<br />
Contrast that with the EQ beta that 989 handed out, which convinced me that EQ was the best game EVER.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that the same company that utterly ruined EQ also made SWG.  Take a good hard look at SWG, that's what is coming for EQ and EQ2.  Zero risk and easy advancement, so that the lowest common denominatior (a retarded chimp) can play. ~Dart/Karryn/Bixie Company</div></div><hr />
