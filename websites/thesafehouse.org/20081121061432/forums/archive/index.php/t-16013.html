<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've heard talk of poison in the game, and that it's actually a viable addition to the class. But I still don't know how to find it! Is it tradeskilled or can the actual poisons be bought from vendors? Where can you find merchants that sell the components to make the poisons / or the whole poisons? Which are the best for which situations? There doesn't seem to be much info on them yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coyoteblack</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can buy the poison from merchants it is also player made but for now <br />
it is cheeper to buy from the merchant in less you make it your self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where can I buy the poisons in Qeynos?<br />
<br />
And where would be a good place to start if I wanted to start making poisons myself? Alchemy is the skill, correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CogginsEQ</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe in South Qeynos on the map is a alchemist/poison shop or something, its got an icon on it.  The lower level poisons are upstairs I heard, havent been on to check it out though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elorianne</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I recall, there is a merchant/alchemist in each city suburb that sells low level poisons. Where of course varies from zone to zone but try tracking to any NPC alchemist in one of the suburbs - city alchemists usually sell higher level poisons.<br />

Alchemist SQ downstairs = lower level poisons (also a alch in Starcrest)<br />

To not use poisons is gimping your damage output greatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">12-11-04, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can pretty much buy poisons from any vendor.  Mine aren't the best of course, but I normally get them from the vendor at the crossroads in Antonica.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">12-13-04, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, now for a list of what each poison is and its effect. No use spending precious precious coppers on experimentation!<br />
<br />
I'm half kidding, tested some out earlier but the combat scrolls by too fast for me to notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaxony Silentshadow</div><div class="date">12-17-04, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Caress of the Shadow and Acidic Goo on my rogue, both are available at about any general supplies merchant and reasonably effective at my level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ebonblade</div><div class="date">01-01-05, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a post on EQ2's boards with details on what  poisons do...<br />
<br />

<br />
Seems overall the purple-colored store-bought ones are best, due to the overall large DOT damage, which results in a larger overall DPS.</div></div><hr />
