Can it be soloed, or does &quot;Completing the Ritual&quot; require a fight? If a fight is required, can one set of mistral shards be used to do the quest for an entire group?<br />
<br />
Anyone know what the effects on the swords do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you only need 500 mistral shards for an entire group.  <br />
<br />
The effect on the dmg sword is +10% dmg bonus.  It is fixed now and actually does x1.10 instead of x0.10.  The effect does not stack with stealth.<br />

<br />
You need 500 shards, 1 person has to have all 5 energized shards at the end.<br />
<br />
I completed it tonight.<br />
<br />
Basically, you do 1 of the lesser shrines 3 times and the other 2 once (or whatever you want to do - 5 times total).  Doesn't matter who has the dull shard (100 mistral slivers = 1 dull shard) each time, just have ONE person loot the final energized shard (aka, loot the named guy for his mistral thingy, then loot the pot for energized shard now that ritual is complete).  The lesser shrines are relatively easy, but the confusing part is that you port up to 2 of them, and the third you fight up a cylops ramp (not the big one for shrine of the wind tho).  Easiest way to do it is have one person run around and find the shards on the ground each time, clicky them, then clicky the pot.  Named guy drops, whoever you have as your 5 energized shard person loots named guy, and then clickies pot to get energized shard.  Don't bother hitting the gusts, they are invincible, and cannot even be scratched, and will only lock you in combat.<br />
<br />
That one person now controls the fate of the group, as they take all 5 and start the shrine of the wind.  This one is a bit harder, as they are level 35 4 dots, not 3 dots.  Also, it's a timer, not a &quot;click the shards as you go&quot; thing.  Once again, don't bother hitting the gusts, they are invincible, and cannot even be scratched, and will only lock you in combat.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, go turn in and enjoy your lightning sword.  Even if it looks more like a sword breaker.<br />
<br />
edit:  I'll try to get screenshot up - but it's almost 3am and I have to work in 4.5 hours...  I'll get one tomorrow after work.</div></div><hr />

Nothing scarier than a rogue who is as bag as the local tank popping up behind you going &quot;Uh, 'scuse me, is this yours?&quot; and then stabbing you with a lightning sword.  &lt;nods&gt;<br />

As if Bards wanted the String instrument aand then wanted to go for the sword, would they be able to do that. My guess is that they would not, due to the quest would be gone. I dunno, I'm just asking and seeking info.<br />
