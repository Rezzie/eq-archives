<br />
Hey, you asked  <br />
<br />
You will have a huge variance on your dmg due to the low axe skill, and on top of that variance, your dmg will be divided in half due to using LA. <br />
<br />
If you want a 5 spec build, this is probably the best you are going to get:<br />
<br />
Stealth- 36 <br />
Envenom- 29<br />
Left Axe-39<br />
Axe-39<br />
CS-34<br />
<br />
2 points left over. <br />
<br />
Reasoning - <br />
<br />
Stealth to 36 - Midgard has a ton of high end +stealth items, and with a couple Realm ranks, you will hit 50 eventually, plus with the lag &quot;ping&quot; that stealth takes, you will be just peachy keen.<br />
<br />
Envenom - with items/RRs, you can get that to 40, which is good enough for what we all want envenom to do.<br />
<br />
Axe - 39 helps keep variance in your favor, since you will be dualwielding axes, you can hit 50 axe no sweat for the much needed dmg boost.<br />
<br />
LA - 39 - This gives you the evade chain 39 medium stun style, which is hella useful.<br />
<br />
CS - 34 - All you need with CS for your build is the stun off of the lvl 34 style - points past that will not help you out, as your damage will be coming from LA styles from that point on. If you doubt that, consider this: Doublefrost &gt; Garotte, mainly for the med defensive penalty garotte gives you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
36 Stealth<br />
34 leftaxe <br />
39 axe<br />
29 envenom<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ArmyLT</div><div class="date">07-12-02, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right in saying it is more of a zerk thingy, but at least it has direction now. If you choose to slap some points into LA you cannot go halfway, or your dmg will be pretty disappointing...remember it scales with spec points now. CS does as well, but with Perf/CD, you have the two &quot;main&quot; attacks from that line, the big opener and the 9 second stun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only reason I mention taking it to 39 vs. 34 is because the lvl 39 style is really, really nice. It is the second step in a 2-hit evade chain that lands a medium duration stun which I have found to be especially nice when RVRing, as you can just set up your keys to have this fire off as your main atk style (assuming in general melee) with doublefrost as your backup style...this lets you initiate the evade chain should you evade, and if not, you still smack someone with doublefrost.<br />
<br />
Normally I'm not one to chase chain-based styles, but you might want to look into this one, especially if you plan on buying Dodger.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TheAnimal3737</div><div class="date">07-19-02, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 11 sb that is right now using a sword and an axe.  Yes, it was quite noobish of me, but will this pose problems in the long run?  Can I just get my sword skill and my left axe skill to 39 instead of my axe skill and LA?  Or will I take a damage penalty?<br />
<br />
     Thanks</div></div><hr />
