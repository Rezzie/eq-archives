<br />
<br />
It appears Bioware has really screwed up on security and many paying customers are stuck with heavily used CDkeys.    <br />
<br />
Bioware has also placed our CDkeys in a plain text file named nwncdkey.ini right in the install directory.<br />
<br />
I also liked this response from the Bioware moderator...<br />
Quote:    This is a serious problem, and I'll try to pass it on to someone who can do something about it. (I'm just a lowly moderator    )<br />
<br />
I don't think it's fair to say that nwncdkey.ini is a horrible breach of security. You are supposed to make sure that your files are secure, not BioWare.   If you were using an operating system with proper security features *hint* *hint*, then you wouldn't have to worry about these things. After all, if your files are open, then people could pirate Neverwinter off you. In effect, you have an obligation to BioWare to keep your files secure, not the other way around  (Just kidding, of course).<br />
<br />
I doubt that someone opened up the box, and returned it again. Those sticky strips are sticky. They couldn't have got it off without ripping some of the case... It's possible that it's an entirely un-malevolent error, and no one should be blamed for it.<br />
Of course over a dozen people responded to this by reminding him that the linux client/server are still at least a month away.    Edited by: Ackar at: 6/23/02 11:48:00 am</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ackar</div><div class="date">06-22-02, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several people have discovered that their CD key was in use before they even got their NWN box home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-22-02, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about the patch, does that fix this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ackar</div><div class="date">06-22-02, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The patch was supposed to help against keys generated with the keygens in use.<br />
<br />
But I'm sure the keygens will soon be patched also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pickk Pockket999</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This really annoys me. They claim its not a breach of security because you can run a secure operating system.... but guess what? NWN only runs in administrator mode! I tried setting the directory to administrator rights but that was a no go. So their whole point about a secure operating system is moot unless they are referring to the mythical linux client patch that on the NWN boards bioware even admitted was a long way off.<br />
<br />
Other than that I love this game, altough I have gotten my CD key denied a couple of times already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loreleli</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the message at install : invalid key. <br />
<br />
This was on install, not even registration. The package was factory sealed no tampering.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Best Buys took it back &amp;amp; I was able to exchange it. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I now need a new video card, I have the old voodoo 3 2000 and the drivers are messed up. Spent 2 hrs. trying to download it. The link page 3dfx and my google search found doesn't have a working download...grr...<br />
<br />
Ok, the card is almost 3 years old, but still...it works. EQ runs fine on it :P<br />
<br />
Hopefully, next week, I'll get the ge force card &amp;amp; be able to run the game. <br />
<br />
Right now, it is uber slow &amp;amp; unplayable. Graphics do look sweet though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, just go buy a new video card. There are only community drivers that support the latest version of DX, and they are wonky to say the least.<br />
