Well thanks in advance, i was thinking of playing my old rogue again and compare to my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AssassinLynxxe</div><div class="date">12-04-02, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a friend of mine has a 56 monk, played a few times and dont really like it all that much.. as far as dmg they just... melee as we do and for a backstab (comparing) they kick.. not as much dmg.. IMO monks are second class rogues. I don't see any other way to explain a monk. =P<br />
FD is cool though, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Koer</div><div class="date">12-04-02, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played a monk to 40 (I know, not quite what yer looking for, but anyways) and I found that monks are rogues that have a kick instead of backstab and pull a lot more.  Feign was nice, but really other than for pulling it was basically a way to cheat death to be honest.  Didn't do all that much raiding, at that level you are a little constrained.<br />
<br />
IMO, the classes are very similar.  I enjoy the pure carnage (more damage) of the Rogue over the pulling styles of the Monk. Koer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">12-04-02, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 3 main characters I play at the moment are a monk (55), Rogue (52) and Ranger (51).  Now we all know rangers suck, so I won't even mention him any further other than to say to check out his permanent bazaar stall *grin*<br />
<br />
Now with monks, the damage capabilities get unfathomable.  With the new damage 'nerf' monks got, it is a bit harder to solo than it used to be, but with the ablity to overwhelm the mobs with pure and total damage, it's really just a question of 'kill them before they get a chance to kill you'.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I love my monk, but with monks its all Hit-Hit-Hit-FD-Mend-Hit-Hit.  Not a whole lotta skill involved with the melee aspect of it.  Sure, FD-Pulling is an artform in itself and I will say no other FDing class, even SKs can do it with the same finesse.  Once you master FD-pulling, there isn't a group around that won't want ya practically.<br />
<br />
If you're into more than just 'pummel 'em til they stop moving' gameplay, rogues are amazing.  Of all the classes I've played, Rogues have been my favorite just because of the grand array of abilities they get, even the meak and insignificant ones like disarm traps.  With a Rogue, the Hit-Hit-Hit-Backstab-Evade-Pickpocket-Hit-Hit they do is more like a dance; especailly when trying ot keep the tank on the opposite side of the mobs you're fighting, as they inevitably always begin to turn, hehe.  <br />
<br />
From a Roleplaying point of view, Monks aren't nearly what you'd expect them to be, but rogues are.  In all the ol' B-rated king fu flicks you've seen, monks are the ironfisted, stern-will, don't fight unless it's necessary kind of character; not what they are in this game.  Monks have become a utility rather than a class these days.  You want straight, manaless, non-positional damage dealing?  Get a monk.  You want FD-splitting?  Get a monk.  Perfect class to have in tight areas where you can't maneuver in to get in a backstab.<br />
<br />
Now look at rogues.  Small (sometimes, hehe.  Big ol' barbarians are the least likely of rogues but seem to pull it off somehow *grin*), wiry, agile, nimble and devious.  Steal your money (pickpocket) and stab you (backstab), then vanish in a trace (evade, hide, sneak).  It adds more of an actual feel for the game when you have to actually pay attention to the fights rather than turn on auto-attack then go get some food and come back to find the mob dead.  I'd like some of that ability, true, but to know that I have to pay attention and evade at just the right time, or backstab at just the right time makes it more entertaining.<br />
<br />
I'll never give up my monk or my rogue, but will say that of the melee classes, these have the most entertainment value in my opinion.<br />
<br />

They also can do really well solo until the end game. The classes are different and have different uses. Hard to compare them fairly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DISCOPOPE</div><div class="date">12-05-02, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">monks are great for exploring.<br />
the dammage output is pretty decent.<br />
fd pulling and bare ass cring are your main duties.<br />
you get to where you have the pathing memorised for every decent exp camp in the game. <br />
the equiptment selection and collection game will make you crazy though. its no fun haggling with everyone for all/all gear. oh, yeah, and Sethbor is my BIZNATCH.</div></div><hr />
