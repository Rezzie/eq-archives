Snagged this power set with dark blast as a secondary, it's got tons of damage prevention measures... I'm basically a controller :P<br />
<br />
here's my hero planner text file. -- added short discriptions of the powers.<br />
<br />
Edited: Switched rain and pit<br />
<br />
Archetype: Defender<br />
Primary Powers - Buff/Debuff : Storm Summoning<br />
Secondary Powers - Ranged : Dark Blast<br />
Slot[01] Level 1 (Starting Primary) : O2 Boost - heal<br />
Slot[02] Level 1 (Starting Secondary) : Dark Blast - nuke<br />
Slot[03] Level 2 : Gloom - nuke<br />
Slot[04] Level 4 : Moonbeam - snipe<br />
Slot[05] Level 6 : Snow Storm - toggle slow AE around target<br />
Slot[06] Level 8 : Recall Friend - summon friend<br />
Slot[07] Level 10 : Freezing Rain - targeted AE Slow/reduce defense/reduce damage resistance/knockdown<br />
Slot[08] Level 12 : Hurricane - pbaoe toggle knockback and accuracy reducer<br />
Slot[09] Level 14 : Teleport<br />
-----I am here-----<br />
Slot[10] Level 16 : Steamy Mist - pbaoe resist damage/stealth <br />
Slot[11] Level 18 : Hover<br />
Slot[12] Level 20 : Thunder Clap - targeted AE disorient<br />
Slot[13] Level 22 : Gale - cone knockback<br />
Slot[14] Level 24 : Tenebrous Tentacles - cone immbolize<br />
Slot[15] Level 26 : Torrent - cone knockback<br />

Slot[20] Level 38 : Blackstar - pbaoe extreme damage<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: level 12.<br />
<br />
Holy crap, hurricane, I cannot say enough about this power. It takes relatively little endurance, and it's... incredible. Pin them in a corner, watch the AE guys go nuts while they can't do any damage to you. A MUST HAVE.<br />
<br />
Edit: level 14.<br />
teleport is fun, but dangerous, looks like hover is a must.<br />
<br />
Edit: level 15.<br />
<br />
I realized that having steamy mist earlier then later would be better then an area effect disorient.<br />
<br />
edit: level 16.<br />
Steamy mist purchased, more particle clouds going everywhere, don't regret it in the least, not much hits us now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">o2 burst is fairly endurance intensive, but sidekicked to a level 30, in a group of 8, with another healer... we were able to hold up pretty well thanks to my slows and the ice controllers slows. I assume my heal will be much better by the time I get to that level.<br />
<br />
Storm Defender is not meant to be a healer, by no means, but as a back up healer, I find it sufficent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'll him so then, he said he wants to be a healer but I think he'd still rather do Storm Summoning (no idea why). Thanks for the input ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a good tank, they heal fine.  The slows and steamy mist make up for the wimpier heals.  Starts out a bit dicey (give lucks and respites to tank) but as the tank builds up his defensive powers, it gets better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">level 8 and 9 I was doing fine healing a fire tanker we had... did get real tricky when we had life mages and energy mages sploding all over us...<br />
<br />
<br />
but, so far I'm doing fine, that was in a group of 6 btw with me as the only healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good, thanks guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-13-04, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, level 10, and I'm astonished at how *well* freezing rain works. ups my damage 35%, slows them, knocks them down, makes them run... throw a snowstorm on the center and they all turn, and stay there cause they're too slowed to run... they don't attack cause they're feared, and they're constantly falling on their bums. Long recharge, medium duration, however, damage resistance and defence down... it's WORTH IT ASAP!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get Hurricane asap.  It allows you to function as a pseudo-tank, provides crowd control near any corner, and is the bastion/freezone for the other ranged type folks.  <br />
<br />
Here's my build so far...<br />
<br />
Slot[01] Level 1 (Starting Primary) : O2 Boost <br />
Slot[02] Level 1 (Starting Secondary) : Power Bolt <br />
Slot[03] Level 2 : Power Blast <br />
Slot[04] Level 4 : Snow Storm <br />
Slot[05] Level 6 : Hover <br />
Slot[06] Level 8 : Freezing Rain <br />
Slot[07] Level 10 : Energy Torrent <br />
Slot[08] Level 12 : Hurricane <br />
Slot[09] Level 14 : Fly <br />
Slot[10] Level 16 : Sniper Blast <br />
Slot[11] Level 18 : Swift<br />
Slot[12] Level 20 : Steamy Mist <br />
Slot[13] Level 22 : Health <br />
Slot[14] Level 24 : Stamina<br />
<br />
I highly recommend getting the health line for stamina too - eventually you will be running 2-3 toggles in any battle, Snowstorm, Hurricane, and Steamy Mist.  Swift also offsets the slow-down effect that steamy mist hits you with when its up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a mind controller with Storms as secondary.  Nice to hear about the storm stuff.  I was beginning to wonder if I'd made a bad combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pharroh</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Magic Storm/Psychic Defender named Eryk on Liberty.<br />
<br />
It is working out well.  I am having no problem keeping people alive, in spite of only having one heal.  This is probably due to the large array of defense buffs and damage debuffs that come with the Storm power set.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of Storm Defenders, actually.  I haven't really met anybody else who has Psychic as their second power set though.  I am very happy with the amount of damage that I can do with Psychic.<br />
<br />
As I understand O2 Boost is really the second-best single-target heal there is, after the Empathy one, so we're not *too* far behind in healing.  Empathy does get group heals, regen, and a complete heal (which takes the Defender's HP, rather than Endurance, to cast).<br />
<br />
I don't think I would be able to solo as effectively if I had chosen Empathy, also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hurricane is incredible... and possibly overpowered. However, I can't nuke nearly as much as I used to, I'm a much larger group player now though<br />
<br />
<br />
The above poster is right, I actually put our tanker out of a job, tight hallways are your friend, I was simply pushing the enemies through into a huge ball. told the range attackers to stay near me and no one got hurt while the blasters AEed the crap out of them... was a blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">get a storm defender in doors and it's absolutely wild. at level 13 I was locking down level 15 lost bosses by using hurricane to throw them into a corner and standing there... went through that entire mission with 4 defenders :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand O2 Boost is really the second-best single-target heal there is, after the Empathy one, so we're not *too* far behind in healing.

<br />
Agreed on the soloing part. :)<br />
<br />
But the Empathy Absorb pain isn't a Complete heal. It just effectively works that way on anyone but a Tanker who is down to 1/3 health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-21-04, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't overlook Gale.<br />
<br />
I know, you are thinking... Who needs that much knockback?<br />
<br />
Since you are getting hover, try this out for size.<br />
<br />
Hover directly over your tank, and the swarm of baddies. Cast Gale at one in the swarm.<br />
<br />
It knocks them all down for the same amount of time they'd normally be knocked back, but they don't move anywhere. They all jsut lay down for several seconds.<br />
<br />
Plus, you can use it in the normal way to get the badguys far away when the @#$% hits the fan, or to pile em up in the corner.<br />
<br />
Great addition for Crowd Control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DizzyKid</div><div class="date">05-22-04, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't use Gale often with my Fire/Storm Controller, but I find it really helpful for knocking mobs outside of my storm back into it. With AoE root, I don't really have to worry about overshooting the mobs already in the storm out of it. With Storm, Rain, and 6 slotted Smoke; it's as effective as keeping them on their backs if you can keep any LT's and/or Bosses held.<br />
<br />
--DK--</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-22-04, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could really use a reliable knockback when I'm trying to position a boss in a corner...<br />
<br />
working out how I can get gale early... think I can fit it in at 18. will rework the orignal post to reflect this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it worth getting gale over thunderclap if your primary tactic is hurricane?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-22-04, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking of thunderclap..Shaman in Dark Astoria use it, and i believe there is a bug attached to it. It turns off all my toggels, but it also gives an instant refresh to rain of fire *or any spell i just cast before the clap*. How do you report bugs ingame?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-23-04, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a few complaints...<br />
<br />
I picked up steamy mist, look at all the stuff I throw off now.<br />
 Complaint 1 (http://www.geocities.com/sing4absolution/complaint.txt)<br />
<br />
and if I ever wanted to play first person?...  first person  (http://www.geocities.com/sing4absolution/firstperson.txt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...I'm starting to find this combination rather boring.<br />
<br />
I throw on hurricane, I throw on steamy mist, throw out a snowstorm, drop a rain, and run around.<br />
<br />
It's stupidly effective, and incredibly boring. Contemplating bringing it further, I'm going to go to at least 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dime</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's really sick is a ice/storm controller.  Pretty much slow the mobs down so much in recharge they only attack once the whole fight.  It's mostly a toggle power set so make sure to get stamina at 20 if you do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hurricane - pbaoe toggle knockback and accuracy reducer <br />
<br />
Oh how I hate to be on the receiving end of this power.. Storm Shamans anyone? *cringe*</div></div><hr />
