So yes, the Xev respawning of Rage for each of the clerics contesting the spawn    did in fact happen and the above message from Brenlo also tells us of an upcoming change to the spawn.<br />

Anyway make Rage spawnable similar to Faydedar.  Who the hell cares how many Water Sprinklers are on the server.  If I was a GM i would give any cleric that asked me one just for the torture Verant put all players through camping it in the very messed up Sol, and the even 5x more messed up SF.</div></div><hr />

GM-Admins report to Lead-GMs.  Lead-GMs are team leaders and report to Brenlo. <br />

Again, this is what he posted on the Guide board, and quite frankly I don't care what you think ...This was posted here to <br />
1) Let players know that what was reported to have happened on Xev did in fact happen but was done as an exception.<br />

Get a bunch of clerics together and have several of them bitch to GMs, and pre-arrange a couple sideline clerics to stay quiet until the next day.  At which point all clerics involved get a free ragefire spawning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hika Mindsong</div><div class="date">08-25-02, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The epic is only really powerful for the first one a guild gets, after that it's a nice-to-have not a must-have.  Secondly, epics (Well all quests) should be about &quot;can I defeat the challenge&quot; not about some arbitrary limitation of item entry rates.  Thirdly, Ragefire is badly done because of the HUGE amount of ill will it generates amongst the player base.  VI overestimates the power of the item.  That or they equate desirability with power, which isn't the same thing at all (witness illusion masks that do nothing but are very desired).<br />
<br />
I'd prefer if rage only dropped the cleric bit (no other loot), and have a once every five day handin mob that didn't require an entire guild to camp on a wall in skyfire, but that a cleric could go check now and then.  Worst case, you lose a bit of your time looking for the handin if someone &quot;ganks&quot; it from you.  Otherwise you get two+ guilds mad at each other and a lot of wasted time from staying up for 100 hours to protect your cleric's camp.<br />
<br />
What they said at Fan Faire is outright wrong, unfortunately.  They can still maintain the entry rate without having the huge amount of player animosity that exists.  That or just make rage spawnable and let people get on with their character progressions, and feel GOOD about completing an epic, rather than feeling RELIEVED.<br />

When I was doing my epic, I had to whore myself to many raids before it actually dropped.

Unfortunately, there is very little  real challenge to EverQuest.  The designers' idea of &quot;challenge&quot; is increasing mobs' HP/damage/AC/resists, rare spawns, and rare drops.<br />
<br />
The Qeynos Badge quests seemed to be a step in the right direction.  Too bad it's the exception.</div></div><hr />

This is a rediculous statement.  How else are you going to make an encounter hard?  Verant is building new &quot;ring&quot; encounters but everyone hates them.<br />

The idea being having the bottleneck confined to quests that do not involve other clerics.  Once completed the cleric could thenhand in to spawn their ragefire.<br />
<br />
Once you get your pearl...the quest would then begin to spawn ragefire.  Shift the challenge from being the first to kill rage to difficulty in spawning him.  Keep it so that you must have that pearl in order to begin the quest(ie hand in pearl but npc hands it back) and gives you quest to spawn rage.<br />
<br />
This would facilitate clerics helping each other instead of what we have now.  Guilds may actually help each other too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forgive my ignorance, but isn't Zordakilicus Ragefire (dragon form) a Triggered mob? It's my understanding that he's spawned in exactly the same fashion bard-spawned Trakanon is. <br />
<br />
Hand in the mystical lute to the undead bard, kill it and Trakanon spawns. Hand in the pearl to Zordak Ragefire (human form) kill him and Zordakilicus spawns.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that these two are any different in terms of respawn time, but there are several factors which (in comparing these two) make the Cleric quest so much worse.<br />
<br />
1- THERE ARE A LOT MORE CLERICS than Bards, especially on the 50+ end.<br />
<br />
2- Trakanon isn't the bottleneck for the Bard epic. The White Dragonscale is a LOT worse. You need to get the scale BEFORE Trak (required for lute to spawn him) most 50+ non-uber bards give up at this point.<br />
<br />
3- Zordak spawns in Skyfire, a zone where both druids and wizards can port to. Anybody can get an invis and run to his spawn point. Undead bard requires a crawl through seb juggs. Not exactly a raid-level encounter, but still noteworthy.<br />
<br />
4- Haven't killed Zordakilicus yet, but isn't he easier than Trak?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that the rate at which VI artificially restricts these two epics from entering the game is any different, but the demand for the cleric epic, combined with the low relative difficulty of the Ragefire encounter and its insanely low supply just makes it brutal.<br />
<br />
Rogues - Immagine if the Kithicor DE house had only one mob in it, who spawned randomly once a week, not at server reset and handing the sealed box to spawn V'Ghera caused that NPC to despawn.<br />
<br />
The fix is simple. Make Human Zordak spawn at the end of a Ring event and set the ring event trigger to a REASONABLE respawn rate (8-24hours)<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This was changed a while back.  Now Zordakilicus (dragon form) spawns in Kunark.  Kill him there, go to Sol B and hand the pearl to Zordak, and get a (No Rent, I think) container from him.  Put the drop from Zordakilicus in the box, and hit combine.<br />
<br />
The only bright point about this is that it means that wizards probably have a slightly easier time getting the imbue spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">08-29-02, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Close, Eumerin, but no bonus.<br />
<br />
There's a Zordak Ragefire spawn in Sol B, which is non-agro. He spawns below the banner on the ledge just below the entrance to the Fire Giant castle. Spawn time is once every 24 hours.<br />
<br />
You need to hand that one the Shimmering Pearl that you received as a result of killing Ixiblat Fer in Burning Woods and the Overking Batezid in Chardok. He will hand you a Swirling Pearl in return and despawn, claiming something about returning through Skyfire and laying waste to everything in Norrath.<br />
<br />
There's a Zordak Ragefire spawn in Skyfire, who is KoS to all and level 55. He spawns just in front of the Dragon statue in the northeast corner of the zone, about 0-2 days after the server came back online or 4,5 to 7 days after the previous kill. Once this KoS Human form has been killed a Dragon form will spawn on top of his corpse named Zordakalicus Ragefire. This is a Nagafen clone, but he's level 60 without the banishment thingy that Nagafen uses. Otherwise, he's not too difficult. He drops up to five items that are not related to the Cleric quest, randomly from Nagafen loottables and the set of Blazing armor of Fennin Ro. Next to that he also drops a 2-slot No Drop container called Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire (or something close).<br />
<br />
You need to put the Swirling Pearl into the Heart container and hit combine. The container will vanish and you'll end up with the Heart of Zordak on your cursor, which is No Drop but a regular item so can be placed in a backpack. When turned in, this heart will yield the third and final Orb for the Cleric.</div></div><hr />
