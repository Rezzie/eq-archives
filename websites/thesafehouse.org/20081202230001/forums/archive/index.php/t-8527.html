<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">05-02-02, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok you got me. That's a new one. I've never heard of anyone ever selling one.<br />
<br />
It's honestly not all that difficult to get. Any raid will make it possible, and a gutsy rogue can do it alone. But there is risk involved.<br />
<br />
If the question was &quot;How much plat would I have to give you to go get one for me?&quot; then the answer would probably be something like 3-5k. If I had one banked already, maybe less then.<br />
<br />
But why would you want to buy it? If you want the easy path, you can probably arrange to go up with almost any raid and if you talk to the leader in advance, I'm sure you can get a shot at the book. Or you can go up alone and get it - this is one of my fondest memories of Everquest and a defining moment of being a rogue for me personally. So why would you want to buy it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Antonyo Corleone</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked one up the other day by running through a fully popped, non-raided Hate.  It's really not difficult at all if you know exactly where you're going.  Just be careful, some mobs can see you, particularly a good number of loathing liches.  Most statics won't see you, it's some of the roamers that you have to worry about.<br />
<br />
My method:  Get a wiz to port you up, gate out immediately.  After you get back to portal with book, wiz ports up and evacs you out.  Took a total of 10 mins, and the wizard was never in any danger.  I provided them with the stones, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Inkiewiz</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just do it yourself, you'll be glad you did.  <br />
<br />
When I did the solo run, I was the scaredest I have been in a long, long time.  I nearly chickened out.  Every time I ventured out of the portal building, I saw a spite golem whizzing past, and my wiz friend told me they see invis.  (It went by so quick I couldn't con it.)  I was shaking so bad, I could barely navigate.  I nearly gave up, but my friend kept urging me to go through with it, and I peeped out and then ran for it.  I got lost and mucked around so long, my sow ran out.  I thought I was done for.  Somehow I found my way and got the book, and even managed to use a Thurg gate potion instead of the precious cazic potion to get out.<br />
<br />
It's just an incredible rush.  Con everything, make a hotkey for your escape potion and keep your finger over it.  If something that sees invis is blocking your way, wait for it to wander off.  Know where you're going (on that Hate map with the route marked on it, I had the start and finish points reversed in my head - THAT was confusing), proceed carefully, and you should get your book.  You'll be so proud of yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RoguePitts</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inkiewiz, congradulations, you have almost made me @#%$ my pants :P<br />
<br />
Im planning on going solo sometime this week. All of my friends say that its impossible since lots of stuff wanders there that sees invis. Is this true, and how hard is it, really?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Inkiewiz</div><div class="date">05-06-02, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have to let others speak to whether it's easy or difficult, since I think I got very lucky.  <br />
<br />
I've read a ton of posts on the solo hate run over the last several months.  My impression is that most people made it through alive.  Some people had one death.  (Which will be an unrezzed death if you're truly &quot;solo&quot; and not on a raid.)<br />
<br />
The posts I read all said that only liches and scorned banshees see invis.  I conned everything to make sure, but that said, I didn't run across anything that saw through Hide. I don't know about the spite golems, but if they do see through Hide, you're out of luck because they're super-fast.<br />
<br />
The main argument for doing it solo is that if you go while on a raid (as my wiz friend pointed out when he was nudging me to go through with it), a) most raids don't do the Maestro, so you'll have to go wandering off by yourself anyway; and b) if the book isn't there, you'll have to wait for another raid.<br />
<br />
I went up naked (my wiz friend did too, for security).  All I took with me was the cazic potion (for insta-gate out), Thurg potion (to get out of Cazic), and an invis potion (if the book hadn't been up, I would have invised and camped).<br />
<br />
Have a fresh sow when you go up.  Have your clips turned all the way up, unless lag is a really bad problem for you.<br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;What I wish I'd known&lt;/u&gt;<br />
<br />
Be prepared to be scared.  Things are constantly shouting, which kept making me think I was being attacked.  (I'd never been to Hate before.)  Also, there are a -lot- more mobs than I expected, but again, I didn't see any that saw invis.<br />
<br />
Below is a link to the map I used, with route marked.  (I don't remember who posted it originally.)<br />
<br />
www.strike9.com/file.aspx...PoHmap.jpg<br />
<br />
Note that the spot marked with an X is where you  finish.  You  start in Building 1.  <br />
<br />
The thing marked as a diagonal green line on the map is actually a big arched doorway.  When you go in the doorway, stay to the right, and you'll go up a ramp that winds around the inside of the building.  When you get to the top of the ramp, go straight ahead till you get close to the opposite wall, then veer off to the left (if I remember correctly). <br />
<br />
The book is located at approximately -60, +320.  It does look like a book on a table, but it was smaller than I expected.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I felt the same way u did scared like a little girl, I talked to a 60 rogue that told me to just go get it myself.I'ts easy he says=P whatever died in front of building with no gate potions. so I waited till I found people raiding hate and managed to get rezzed.there just happened to be a raid there, so I ran up and someone had just taken the book=(.  As u all know 10hr rl spawn time in hate is no picnic solo for that matter, so I sat in front of the book and fell asleep hidden out of aagro range from a banshy that could see me, woke up grabbed the book and camped.  I then got a group of rl friends cleric and necro strapped with a coffin included=) I ran out and got whacked on purpose then met friends at bind spot and went back up, got summoned, rezzed, my book and I was happy.  I must agree it has been the best experience so far being a rogue. DON'T BUY IT!! go earn it.  You will not regret it. gl to yas<br />

Load up DE illusion and goto the Caves in EFP and find a DE there talk to her and get a letter you bring back to the cleric guild and hand in.  I'd say 10 round trips would get you to the point where you could walk in the cleric guild as a ally without illusion.  I went to dubious with just 1 letter.  &quot;The Dead&quot; is the hard faction to raise.<br />

<br />
1) Can you detail where the EFP NPC is? Is it the female inkie outside by shoreline?<br />
<br />
2) Does raising DE cleric faction (Priests of Innoruuk) have any effect in Hate, where the faction of 1st floor is Inhabitants of Hate? (2nd floor being KOS to anyone regardless of faction).<br />
<br />
3) From your post, it seems as if you neutralized the &quot;everyone is KOS in PoH&quot; thing and I am curious as to what the 1st floor mobs conned while skulking and/or visible?<br />
<br />
I still want to try for the book with just plain old rogue coolness, but having a way to go non-KOS on 1st floor would be a great little deal for getting paid by gimp zerg guilds to fetch corpses after raid wipeouts. I am a rogue after all.<br />

All of my friends say that its impossible since lots of stuff wanders there that sees invis. Is this true, and how hard is it, really? <br />
<br />
There are mobs that see invis in hate. I wouldn't call it &quot;lots&quot; though.<br />
<br />
There are two types of routine mobs that see invis: loathing liches and scorn banshees. Note that they see invis - they still can't see through sneak so if you're behing them, you're fine.  <br />
<br />
Scorn Banshees do not roam around the streets. Ever. The only place you'll see them is in the Maestro's house. You may have to maneuver around one or two or wait til they move out of the way to sneak by. <br />
<br />
Loathing liches populate the roamer paths quite a bit so you'll surely see some. There may be a couple in the Maestro's house also. The thing about them is that they have a VERY small agro radius. No lie - I've run right by them or almost ran into them coming around a corner and not gotten agro. If you're lower level or if you linger at all, they will agro to be sure. But it's not as bad as it could be.<br />
<br />
So how hard is it really? That's relative.  <br />
<br />
These days I know hate like the back of my hand. I get ported up and start scouting around checking all the mini bosses. Sure there are see invis mobs, but if you know how things work, you may as well be a shadow. If I needed the book today, I would go up fully dressed and be out in under five minutes.<br />
<br />
If you don't know hate well, it's going to be a lot more tense. And frankly a lot more fun. The risk is the thrill, and it makes the reward all the sweeter. If you want to cut your risk down, duel someone and go up naked with just the evac potion. (Frankly this is the smarter way to do it - even on the best day, wierd things can happen.)<br />
<br />
But it's perfectly do-able and you don't need l33t knowledge or amazing luck. If you succeed, you'll know what it means to be a rogue. And if you failed, it's still worth the trip.</div></div><hr />

Thought to myself ok this is going way to smooth, knowing my luck the book would be gone.....  to my surprise it was there stole it ran to corner and gated out with thurg gate potion.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eyston</div><div class="date">06-14-02, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The strategy I used, and saw first posted someplace on The Safehouse was this ...<br />
<br />
I got a cleric, wizard, and myself.  The cleric was able to cast invisibility with some cloak, otherwise you'd need another person to cast invis.  Duel the wizard, kill them.  Go attack a guard, get yourself killed.  Get the wizard, yourself, and person to invis in the same group.  Have the invis person start casting invisiblity on the wizard.  Before they finish, have the wizard start casting port to hate.  After invis lands, that person disbands.  Rogue/Wizard port to hate.  Cleric casts revive on the Wizard.  Wizard arrives in hate, gets a revive, is gone instantly.  Rogue SH's fast.<br />
<br />
I ran to the book, picked it up, and CT gated out.  I then got rezzed back to the cleric.  Coulda been rezzed straight out of hate, but I was a wuss.<br />
<br />
This worked nicely because my wizard friend really, really wasn't excited about having to port me to hate solo.  This way is pretty much wizard friendly.<br />

<br />
Came down and was visably shaking for 1/2 hour afterwards. <br />
My Wizard friend came up with me and was invis in the port in room while I went looking.  Of course, i had the location wrong so 5 mins of walking around in Hate looking for somethign in the wrong place isnt the easiest way to do things.<br />
<br />
I sent a tell to a 60 rogue who said its upstairs........  I thought that was the 2nd floor of hate.. but I realised that the above map was actually meaning to go UP the ramp and across the floor... so i got that and snuck back to port in room.<br />

After almost runing into a liche, we evac'd out and presto!  one shaking rogue.<br />

<br />
I don't understand coffins, but am thinking that might be my best bet since I'll probably die omw back to port in, or as soon as I relog.  BTW my INVS dropped when I camped - so no more invis other than sneak hide - too bad sneak hide won't stay down when you log  <br />

Run to Gatehouse and have a wizzie port up, grab you, and evac.  Cost will be 105p for a hatestone.<br />
<br />
2) Don't log the char back in.  Using an alt, find out when the next Hate raid scheduled is.  Talk to the raid leader, explain you're camped out solo in Hate, and could use a ride out.  Have him give a /tell to your alt letting you know when it's safe to log in.<br />
<br />
3) Log in and die.  Port up a wizzie, a cleric, a necro, a chanter, a tank, and you.  Necro summons your corpse, cleric resses you, then wizzie evacs everyone out.  Chanter and tank keep an eye out for patrol aggro while you're being summonned/ressed.  Cost will be 105p for a hatestone plus ~150p for a coffin (ask the necro for specifics on which coffin he needs).<br />
<br />
4) Invest the time in leading Fungus Caller quest raids to get a Tiny Cloak of Darkest Night so you can camp invis'd.  *wink*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thurgadin Gate potions are crafted and No Drop.  They are part of the shawl quest but can be done repeatedly if you know what to do.  Look up the quest specifics for info.  I don't know about the other gate potions though, I've heard of them but never needed one.</div></div><hr />

However, I don't suggest anyone spend the 1k on it, if it can collapse like it did on me.  Sure zero cast time is nice, but failure sux.  Take 2  <br />
<br />
Did get out of PoH last night, but only after I died 2x.  Once on my way back to the port in site.  Once when the necro that went up to get me out used the coffin at ent.... that seemed to invite alot of company    Wiz / Cleric / Nec gate - I'm standing there takn some abuse &amp;amp; die.  I still wonder why i went dressed the 2nd time up /shrug<br />
<br />
We port back up again, loot both corpses this time, and TP out.  It's THAT easy!  lol.<br />
<br />
3 port stones = roughly 375pp<br />
broken gate potion = roughly 1kpp<br />
port hos to get me close to neriak to buy a stone after each failure = 100pp<br />
Seeing your frineds gate and leave you to die, having 2 full xp deaths, but getting your epic piece (naked) - priceless.</div></div><hr />

I was shaking so hard I could barely move around.  I went up the night before because there was a raid going on.  A rogue needed the book so I just camped at the safespot.  Upon waking up the next day, I went the alternate route from the safespot to the Maestro's house instead of going from the portal house.  Well, needless to say I got lost.  Once I realized that I had no idea where I was, I was sure I was gonna get seen by something.  Monsters whispering things, wanders casting spells and other creepy things.  Nevously conning everything, I finally found the Maestro's house and promptly made my way inside to see a scorn banshee and a loathing lich running around in the lower room along with about 4 other creatures of Hate.  Luckly, they had their backs turned, so I took the oportunity to run to the ram on the inside of the wall and made my way upstairs.  Following the information given to me, I made my way to the book and gaffled it from the table with a nasty looking vampire not knowing what had just happened.  Praying for my potion to work correctly, I held on to the book and drank the potion.  Back in Rivervale, I was congratulated by friends on my newest accomplishment.  The denizens' of Hate had no idea what had just hit them.<br />

1.  Will any gate potion be ok, or must i pay for an insta port potion?    <br />

2.  What about H/Sing back to the safe point if 30 sec. is to long to gate on the spot?<br />

<br />
In previous posts people have discussed doing the leatherfoot raider's skullcap quest, which has one charge of an instant casting self gate to West Commons.<br />
<br />
Well, I was in the bazaar the other day, and decided to see if anybody was selling one, since the item isn't no drop.<br />
<br />
To my luck, I was able to find 2 &quot;with charges&quot; for 200pp or less each, instead of 1000pp+ for the gate potion, and I don't think these can &quot;collapse&quot; like a gate can.<br />
<br />
Just load up the bazaar search window, and search for &quot;raider&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure you inspect the item ON THE TRADER, not via the search window, to confirm that charges are still on the item.  It appears that any item with charges will show up with full max charges on the search screen, regardless if the actual item on the Trader does or not.  I saw a cap for 50pp, bought it, then realize it had no charge, hehe, the guy was nice and gave me my money back though =P Edited by: Skewert at: 8/4/02 11:43:34 am</div></div><hr />

I had found one and &quot;lost&quot; it on the turn-in. What I didn't know is that the skin had been taken into account and I just needed to give another one of the skins that was wrong (the Grizzly one).<br />
So, if any HLF is willing to do the quest (yep, is HLF only), needed skins for the Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap (good stuff!) is:<br />
- A Shark skin (eat up the Hammerhead at Freeport Dock)<br />
- A Thick Grizzly Bear Skin (from Karanas) - The skin must be 5.0<br />
- A Polar Bear Skin (from polar bear cubs in Halas newbie zone) - The skin must be 5.0<br />
- An Alligator Skin (from Bull Alligators in Innothule Swamps) - The bottleneck of the quest<br />
- A dragoon Dirk + the cap resulting from the skins turn-in gives the REAL cap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RageDemon</div><div class="date">12-05-02, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, doing it solo was quite a challenge and was one of the most fun times I've had in 3.5 years of EQ (god...)<br />
<br />
Went up at around level 51 I think, on my Vah Shir Rogue... I've already had experience with the zone as my monk so I knew where things were.  I just had to watch every side for liches and banshees.  When the coast was clear, I moved.<br />
<br />
Port in was probably the roughest part of the trip actually.  Wizard self-runed himself with his spells and epic.  Ported up.  I hit hide/sneak as fast as I could, as I saw a cleric and golem swing around the corner and started beating the wizard.  He got out fine though, damn epic rune :P<br />
<br />
The experience was simply amazing and it kept you on your toes.  I do believe the quest was designed (or the storyline at least) was for the rogue to sneak through Plane of Hate to 'retrieve' the book.  That's what I did and I had a blast doing it, as well as the wizzy (guildmate of course... don't think any random wizard has the balls).<br />
<br />
Man up, grow some balls, and do things solo   (aside from porter).  It's so worth it and like what others said, you'll be proud of yourself for doing so.<br />
<br />
(Well, what encouraged me to go solo was the fact that public denied me twice to be able to loot book, so I'm like f--- that, I'm getting it now.  Ported up about 5 hours before their raid in the early morning and got it  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rathkon</div><div class="date">01-21-03, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got my Book a couple days ago.  Was always worried about getting it since i decided to even try for the epic.  Am unguilded and just a casual player mainly just play saturdays.   Figured I'd just wait till a rl friends guild was going and get it despite the &quot;you should solo it&quot; point of view.  I understand it, but also don't like dieing needlesly.     <br />
<br />
Then when we were about to quit for the night, bertox went down and my friend mentions hey don't the Planes come up depoped.  I think well okay maybe I'll try this.   So I start planning how I can get up there to get book, hopefully it pops with the zone.  My shamen friend (thanks Baldrick) finds a wizard(forgot his name but it was very nice of him) from his guild in chat, so I have my ride if i can get the stone. Con my other friend who plays a darkelf enchanter(Maelific) to go get the stone when the server comes up, and we'll all meet in the nexus.  I go buy a potion of frost, wasn't thinking about the 30sec cast, just looking for a gate to anywhere to get back out, just in case.  <br />
<br />
So the server comes up we all log on and start getting everything.  I meet the wizard give him the stone and port to hate.  Nonething in view I h/s and tell him just to gate, I have the potion I'll just use it to get back.  Start off following the path on one of the maps.  First corner I take I see a spite golem. About crapped my pants since I thought the zone was depoped and he was right in front of me taking up my whole screen.  After my breathing slows down a bit and I realize I'm not dead yet and the zone IS poped, I follow the path a little more carefully.  Missed the house somehow ended up behind it so had to walk around half of it.  Looks like a party in there, lots of mobs.  Luckily none saw through h/s.  Head up the stairs, and accross to the bedroom.  Just 1 mob can't even remember what it was so put my back to the wall and waited for her to move out of the way.  Grab the book rehide and put my back to the corner (not a corner but edge toward the balcony, but not too close).  Get ready to drink potion.. finger going down.. the mob all of a sudden starts running like a bat out of hell out of the room.  I'm like crap I'm dead.  But I stop before I hit the button, and she stopped at the exit of the room, and wasn't after me.  By now my hands are shaking, I thought it was funny, despite that fact.     Move over to the corner past the table, put my back to the corner. Drink the potion. Crap this is taking a while. Longest 30secs I've had in EQ. Port into everfrost. <br />
<br />
Definately an adventure. Scared you bet, but after getting it well worth doing it solo with a full pop. I think my hands were shaking for a good 10 minutes after that.  Took out renux 20 minutes later, so just have to talk to stanos, find some help and slay general, and hopefully he drops the quill, but figure I'll cross that bridge when i get there.   <br />
<br />
I know longish story, I think it's just something about accomplishing the book solo that makes you have to find someone to tell the tale to.     If nothing else glad this forum is here to write into. /e whistles a happy tune.<br />

I looked at the map they they linked, and it took me about 2 minutes to sneak to the book, it was there, I snatched and told the cleric to rez me.  Well when he tried he got a message saying my corpse was too old to be rez'd.  The corpse was only about 15 minutes old.  So then i'm thinking great, i'm stuck, no gate potion.  So i start sneaking back to the zone in and make it there fine with out any problems.<br />
<br />
So far so good, then my luck runs out.  I'm sitting in the room with S/H on talking to my wizard friend and telling him I need him to come back and get me.  So he has to go back to nek and get another stone.  While I'm waiting, a revultant rat comes barging in and kills me.  So apparently they can see thru invis or something. I dont know, i know i snuck past alot of rats on the way there and back, i have no idea how I got this agro.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. i hook up with the wizard, we port back up.. soon as we get there, he starts casting evac and i quickly loot the book of my corpse.<br />
<br />
So it cost me about 5% exp in level 51 but well worth it.  Renux... here I come!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kanolth</div><div class="date">04-14-03, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reminds me of the time I camped out when the guild was getting wiped in Hate. I spent two hours guiding invisible clerics through the lich infested bottom level. I moved ahead of them, and after studying the path routines of the liches, I acted as point man and gave the all clear whenever it was all clear.<br />
I got the book while being part of a raid, but the CR through a repopping bottom level really got the adrenaline going. I have done a number of CRs for those who were killed while scouting and here are a few tips. <br />
<br />
1.) During TPW, rogue camp out immediately, Log back in after a few minutes and ht the H/S hotkeys as soon as the viewscreen comes up. Rogues are one of the best for CRs because of their great sneak ability.<br />
2.) Loathing liches can see invis, but cannot hear a sneaking rogue. I snuck right by one... came within a few virtual feet of it while it's back was turned and went happily on my way. I almost ran into a lich, but I guess the aggro radius was so small it didn't aggro on me.<br />
3.) Rats cannot see invis. Don't know how you got aggroed by one.<br />
4.)The entire top level consists of mobs that cannot see invis!<br />
5.) If you want to drag corpses to a safe spot, there is one right up the ramp to the second level. Just spend a few minutes watching mobs; path routines before leading a cleric to that safe spot. Dont have a map so cannot tell you exact loc, but the safespot was used in excess of half and hour for CRs. Rezz the bards and the rest of the clerics, and have the bards and rogues pull the corpses if your raid was wiped on top level. <br />
<br />
Note: Safe spot does have mobs around there during full repop, but this is assuming your raid killed them all already, leaving that safe spot effectively safe.<br />
<br />
Anyways have fun in Hate, and gratz to those who go the book the gutsy way.</div></div><hr />

One of the people I most respect was telling another rogue that a *real* rogue would go up and solo their book from Hate.<br />
<br />
I decided that I was going to be a *real* rogue too :-)<br />
<br />
I have several accounts and PCs.  I ended up 3 boxing the whole event.  I setup at the GFay wiz spires.  With my rogue on the 1st PC I took a poke at the Nexus Sicon and clicky rezzed my rogue with my cleric on the 2nd PC.  Once rez effects were done I drank a SoW potion then used my wizard on the 3rd PC to invis the rogue.  Ported up and hit gate with Wizard as soon as I landed.  Did some quick scouting to see if it was safe to drop invis and switch to hide/sneak.  <br />
<br />
Took about 3 mins to get to the book.  I took the wall to safe spot to stairs route.  Triple conning everything I saw...<br />
<br />
There was 1 mob kinda close to the table, wasn't sure if i'd get agro picking up the book so I started the rez from my cleric before I picked up the book.  Got the rez message box, picked up book and clicked yes to rez and I was gone... That mob never did agro.<br />
<br />
It was lots of fun.  Reminded me of when I 1st started playing EQ and was scared to death to leave west freeport cause east comonlands was deadly!<br />

I've never had it myself, but have seen a few reports over the years of it to believe it. They have a very low agro radius though .. so just don't run over them and you should be allright.<br />
<br />
The link to the map isn't working for me (maybe a temporary problem), but I'm one of the rogues who first compiled the Ragebringer spoiler, and one thing I corrected was the safeest route to the book, but by then everyone seemed to have bookmarked a slighty riskier route). The map shouldn't show you approaching the Maestro house from the Safespot area, but instead approach from the Eastern edge of the zone via the fountain. This is actually a safer route (as there can be Scorn Banshees in the southern alcoves of the Maestros house that can aggro as you pass by - thankfully this is quite rare as well)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What i did was i had my lvl 65 epic cleric friend and a wizzy meet in Shadowhaven. The Wizzy and myself both attacked guards and died so we had three hour rez timers on our corpses. The wizzy then ported the two of us up. The cleric began 96% rezzing the wizzy as he was porting, so as soon as he got into hate he had a rez box and instantly got rezzed back down. Then the cleric did the same for me. If it took longer than 5 minutes to get the book the cleric would rez me again and another rez window would appear so i would be able to instantly get out. <br />
<br />
However.... as i found out make sure your sneak / hide skills are maxed and you are higher than lvl 47. Some stuff saw me while i was invised and i died. Lucily there was a raid going on the next day and they rezed me up and i got the book, with a full spawn in the masteros house. However on the way out i got killed by the Mastero himself somehow. Anyway i waited till they killd him then they rezzed me again and i was able to get out. Anyway it was tons of fun and I actuall want to go up solo in the new hate someday just to see what its like.

The map that appears here pub146.ezboard.com/fthesa...6632.topic on the boards is perfect. I ported up with a wizard who cast TL to Bind on me, and ported out. The first run, I made it to the building fine, and the book was not up. Unsure of myself, I exited the building and looked around a bit. I entered another building where a see thru sneak/hide mob appeared and started beating on me. Since I had taken too much time, I ran back to the path to the BOS house and although I had a gate potion on me, I didn't want to waste the 300pp, and died. The second trip up the next day, the book was not up again, but I recovered my corpse and the gate potion and accepted the TL to bind. The third trip, the book was up, I grabbed it and I accepted the TL to Bind. It took less than 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to know if this is a static spawn there now with the new Hate revamp, or if its a random mob there.  I got as close to him as I'd like to and dont know if I could hug the walls (the entrance is pretty small) without getting agro from him.

-If you don't know hate well even with the map its easy to make a wrong turn just keep following the semi straight line until you can see the steps to the mastero then turn into the building opposite.<br />
<br />
-If you have a see invis mob on one side of the bridge it is possible to jump up on the rail (opposite side) and not gain aggro.<br />
