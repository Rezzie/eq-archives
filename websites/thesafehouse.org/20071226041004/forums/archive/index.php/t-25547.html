<br />
Basically some death god drops his death note. The death note is found by some human. And now whoever owns the death note has the power to kill anyone whos name is written into it. What will this human do with this power?<br />
<br />
(Just a note there are rules for the death note so its a little more complex then just putting down a name).</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: Just emphasizing, the following spoiler is massive and will almost certainly end a good amount of enjoyment for you. Don't read unless you have finished up to vol. 7. --Stalk<br />
<br />
once one of the two dies, and the new guy is introduced, I felt the series kinda started sucking, so I dropped it a little bit after that point.<br />
<br />
Definately something I recommend you pick up, it was an interesting read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">08-12-06, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes no spoilers yet plz hehe :P. Im only up to vol 3 due to vol 4 not being available =(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">08-19-06, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Vol 1-6 where awesome. Vol 5 and 6 had pretty good humor also. <br />
<br />
This spoiler contains spoilers for the end of volume 6 --Stalk<br />
<br />

Vol 7<br />

Ya once L died and they introduced those two new players I was like &quot;ooooooooookkkkkk&quot;. There character types are just not as intertaining. The one dude is too much like the first L and the other dude is too much like Light. I think they will kill off light and make it so its Second L vs Third Crazy L. Which is sad really..=/.</div></div><hr />

That joke went way over my head. I am often too serious for his own good.</div></div><hr />

....you are also talking in third person for some odd reason? :rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">God, I don't know what's with me. I actually originally wrote that as &quot;Stalk is often too serious for my own good&quot; then I realized, wait, why am I talking in third person? So I changed it to &quot;I am often too serious for his own good&quot; because I was going to change the third person references.<br />
<br />
Guess that failed miserably. :kroe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">09-08-06, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is pretty amusing. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-14-07, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dropped it after volume 7 as well, but decieded to complete it after it got picked up again. the next 2-3 volumes were dull, but it got pretty exciting again towards the end and was probably worth reading.</div></div><hr />
