<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cheb KB</div><div class="date">11-23-02, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a level 35 Shaman looking to solo and am having a hard time finding places with good exp to do so.<br />
<br />
I was EW for a while soloing the Ulthorks but there seems to be to many high level(46+) people quading them.<br />
<br />
I've tried OT but it seems a little low and the loot is only so-so.<br />
<br />
Tried RM and the Hill Giants, but again there seems to be to many higher level(48+) people there.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there were any Non-Luclin places that a Shaman could solo getting more then 1 spawn in 10 minutes. =/<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Find a decently twinked monk around your level and duo there, its SICK exp(I went from 30-40 there in like a week if I remember correctly) Nothin but smooth. . .<br />

He said non-Luclin places Frostbyt.  <br />
<br />
At 36, hmm.  Try Great Divide killing Drakkel Dire Wolves over towards the Eastern Wastes zoneline.  There are usually plenty of the puppies around there.<br />
<br />
You could also possibly solo some of the zone mobs in Lower Guk, either Live or Dead side. Baroness Delissandra Splitshadow - Half-Elven Assassin - &quot;Far Seekers&quot; - The Rathe<br />
