As usual, I've prepared a handy guide with summaries and airing dates. This season seems to lean more on the comedy and romance side of things, but there's a good amount of mecha thrown into the mix as well. With 37 new anime this winter, there's a good selection to choose from.&lt;br&gt;<br />

Les Miserables Shoujo Cossette - Saw the title, went YAY COSSETTE!!! ...then realized 'oh, not THAT Cossette. Bugger.'<br />
SHUFFLE! Memories - Hope KnKF does it again.<br />
 <br />
Prolly not gonna pick up anything new, unless there's some kinda break-out hit. Even then, I'm pretty critical of new series nowadays. With so much less time to watch, anything that has some minor (usually stereotypical) fault usually gets dropped, quick.<br />

What you see on Adult swim has been subtitled quite a while before.<br />

As for Japanese, as far as I know, I am the only one here who knows language well enough to understand raws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-14-07, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nodame Cantabile A+<br />
<br />
Lenilya pay attention~<br />
<br />
This is very similar to Honey and Clover. I really loved this show. It's a story about a perfectionist young man praticing the piano, fustrated with his situation, ends up being sent into a class for failures.<br />
<br />
There, he meets Nodame, an very unique pianist. Upon visiting her apartment... it turns out to be a dump. Chiaki starts cleaning, taking care of her, playing the piano with her.<br />
<br />
The great thing about this show is how natural it all felt, leading up to the climax of sorts at the end of the episode. I thought it was wonderful. I'm happy there are still more shows like Honey and Clover, and highly looking forward to this one.<br />
<br />
It's very music oriented, where Honey and Clover was art oriented. I don't know how the music is, and the climax duet was lost on me even though I know what they were trying to portray. Two thumbs up from me.<br />
<br />
Genshiken OVA A<br />
<br />
Still great, with the introduction of two new members. Ogiue was so cute. A lot of the trademark Genshiken humor is in this one, and gives us something to look forward to. I recommend watching the first season before this one.<br />
<br />
Di Gi Charat Winter Garden B<br />
<br />
The show was pretty good, it was interesting to see the Di Gi Charat characters looking more human. The story revolves around Dejiko, who is a young adult that works at a bakery and lives with her sister.<br />
<br />
She meets a young man, and it's a nice love story as far as the first episode goes. It's a good show for the romance crowd.<br />
<br />
Shuffle! Memories<br />
<br />
No rating, it's basically a rehash of the first season as far as the first episode goes.<br />
<br />
Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora D-<br />
<br />
Ugh. This show is so nonsensical that it's not even funny at all. Horses jumping 5 stories high climbing on falling rocks, a guy who rips a girl's shirt open upon meeting her and the girl falling in love as a result -_- random dreams of princes, flowers, this fails as shoujo, fails harder as whatever it was trying to be. Pass.</div></div><hr />

Something not Season 3 of H&amp;C <br />
 <br />
 <br />
:rofl   Will have to check it out once a few more eps come out. Thanks for the heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-14-07, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Venus Versus Virus B<br />
<br />
The story revolves around some sort of soul sucking virus (sorry for not making it sound cooler) and a group, Venus Vanguard, that eliminates them. The story mostly appears to revolve around Sumire (who, in my opinion, has one of the cutest uniforms I've ever seen. I love the black thigh-high stockings matching with the arm sleeve sort of thing she wears. The rest of the outfit really matches, but I'm getting off topic here.) and a girl who looks suspiciously like Barashishou from Rozen Maiden, named Lucia.<br />
<br />
The cast are all high school girls, this being from Japan and all (I kid). The action was fairly simplistic, and not very engaging, but mostly due to the lack of development so far (only the first episode, to be expected). However, Sumire's oyashiro-mode was somewhat cool.<br />
<br />
If I were to pinpoint who would like the show, probably Black Cat and Rozen Maiden fans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-15-07, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some interesting news re: Nodame Cantabile<br />
<br />
The first episode of the JC STAFF TV anime Nodame Cantabile broadcast between 25:00-25:30 on Fuji Television Network, Thursday, January 11th. According to series production elements, the airing has logged the all time highest audience rating for a late night TV anime, netting a 5.4% share. The live action Nodame Cantabile drama has in the past nabbed an audience rating of 21.7% and an estimated 19 million viewers in one showing. Both adaptations are based on the musical comedy mangad by Tomoko Ninomiya. The past latenight anime ratings record holder was the George Morikawa manga-based Hajime No Ippo (Fighting Spirit) and its 4.8% share. That record has stood for 6 years. The achievement makes this series definetly one to continue watching in Japan and internationally for a possible licensing / localization fast track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">01-15-07, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ripple effect. Nifty. A new show has word-of-mouth about a well-loved previous series, and creates buzz that launches a first episode peak.<br />
 <br />
Let's hope it doesn't fall apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-15-07, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was interested in that Hajime no Ippo was the former record holder. I never knew that. Hajime no Ippo was one of my favorite series. But being a Boxing anime, I never thought it was that popular. But I guess it was far more popular than I realized in Japan, even if it's almost nonexistent here.<br />
<br />
Despite that, I'm grateful that Hajime no Ippo just finished it's DVD release with Champion's Road movie. It is easily the most epic sports and shounen anime ever. The fights were awesome, the character development was perfect, and unlike most shounen or sports anime, it did not shy away from even developing a romance story in between Ippo and Kumi. It took nearly 75 episodes to grow, but since it was not the focus it was just a nice supplement to the series.<br />
<br />
And damn, the manga is crazy awesome now. The whole Ichiro and Ippo thing that went down, the fight between the loonies, and so on. Awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-21-07, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad everyone agrees with my review.<br />
<br />
Here's another!<br />
<br />
Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! A<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this show. People sensitive to lolicon might want to stay away. The show does not sexualize the girls outright (even in situations that usually call for panty shots, for instance, the skirt stays down, which may or may not be a bad thing for some people.) But it has situations where those sensitive to it will get an averse reaction. (For instance, girls in school swimsuits).<br />
<br />
Just a disclaimer. I did not find anything that seemed objectionable, where I could find some in say, Ichigo Mashimaro. So hopefully this does not turn people away from the show. All that being said, it's a really, really fun show. There's a whole lotta moe~, a whole lotta fun, cute, and cool.<br />
<br />
It appears to be a slice of life school story, but I don't know too much about it. Apparently in the future, birth rate dropped, nobody goes to school anymore because they choose to work instead, so schools are dropping. Manabi appears to want to change the school into a fun place to be.<br />
<br />
Manabi is very much like Suzumiya Haruhi. It's a good show for slice of life types, moe types, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-15-07, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree that Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight is definitely a highlight of the season.<br />
<br />
I haven't had time to write some decent reviews of other shows, but so far in the new season I've picked up Hidamari Sketch (good for people who liked Aria), Nodame Cantabile(A), Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight (A), Maria-sama ga Miteru (A), Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuchou (A), Venus Versus Virus (C), Siant October (C). Letters are how I personally rank them.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting on a few more series to get subbed, but the rest are mostly cannon fodder shows nothing HQ.<br />
<br />
Kyoshiro to Towa no Sora has been kind of silly. I can appreciate it a bit more now that a few episodes have come out, but it's still bizarre. As for the Densha Otoko spin-off, Getsumen To heiki miina, I haven't gotten around to watching it yet. But i'm sure I'll love it.</div></div><hr />
