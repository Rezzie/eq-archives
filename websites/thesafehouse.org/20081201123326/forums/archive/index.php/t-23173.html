<br />
I just wanted to stop by and toss an idea out to fellow rogue-ish types currently exploring the possiblities that Stormreach has to offer.<br />
<br />
As you know, there is no means to fence acquired items other than handing them over to the low-paying pawn brokers, who then jack the prices up for their customers.<br />
<br />
I represent a small band of like-minded individuals interested in the possibility of creating our very own market in the back alleys of Stormreach.  This market could provide the many adventurers now populating the land of Xen'drik with high quality items, at a much more reasonable price than what the brokers want to charge.<br />
<br />
The implementation of the market is not 100% fleshed out yet, as we are still discussing the possibilities internally, and (as this message implies) reaching out to any that would be interested in joining in.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are based on the Sarlona server, which from what I've read in the other posts is not where the majority of you are located, but, I figured I would still extend the idea on the chance there were Sarlona rogues reading. Also, maybe to get some ideas from more experienced members of the community.<br />
<br />
We're hoping to provide an in-game mechanism through Roleplaying, along with an out-of-game website for players to submit items that they have.  Also, players would be able to submit items they are looking for.  The site could notify players through email when an item was submitted that matched their requirements.<br />
<br />
The benefit would be the possiblity of higher pay for items, for the sellers.  And, lower cost items for the purchasers, as well as that 'special item' you've been looking for, that the brokers just don't seem to have.<br />
<br />
Over time, our guild would like to start collecting a sort of inventory of items from sellers to better supply the purchasers.  We'd like to see transactions taking place in the back alleys of stormreach, or in that dark corner of the inn, in typical Black Market fashion.<br />
<br />
Depending those involved, we could even go more roleplay, leaving the website for keeping track of inventory for those participating as contacts for the market.  All transactions could be left up to players finding our contacts, and discussing their needs in character face to face.  Rules could be established such as, /tells violate 'customer' agreements and ban that character from the market for x amount of time, that way contacts aren't bombarded with /tells when they login.<br />
<br />
So, what does anyone think? :)  Like I said, we're still fleshing it out, and deciding if it's even a good idea.. The possibilities of it could be a blast, but who knows if it would work.<br />
<br />
