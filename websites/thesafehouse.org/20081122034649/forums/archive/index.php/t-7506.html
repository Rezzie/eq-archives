I have two level 50+ characters and a level 30 all on blue servers. I am becoming very bored with the game   and want something different. PvP seems the be to be my answer. I am posting here because I have a few questions about PvP. <br />
<br />
1. How does the SK measure up in PvP?<br />
2. If I were to go with the SK should I make a Troll or Iksar for the regen effect? <br />
3. I like the idea of coin + one item like they have on RZ, but I hear RZ is not a fun server to play on and in RZ players own words there are a lot of “weird-o’s who play on RZ. Is this true? <br />
4. What are the best Melee PvP classes for casters and melees?<br />
<br />
Any info would be awesome, thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will warn you, think of levels 1 - 5 as a test of endurance. You WILL get pk'ed, dozens if not scores of times. Well, maybe not if a troll as there won't be a third as many newbies at the gates as, says, qeynos, but it's going to happen.<br />
<br />
Well anyway try it out I say, get your character to 10 and then dump him if you want.<br />

I pretty much look at them like a warrior with snare, siphon STR (this is bad when this lands), shadowstep and a pet.  Troll SKs are the worst (or best in their case).  Seems like they just have never ending HPs, and hit hard as hell.<br />
<br />
As far as the best class to fight a pure caster.... ROGUES! <br />

You log on in a city like Freeport or Qeynos and there are bodies everywhere.  It's hilarious, and then someone sees you and kills you.  And kills you again.  And again.  Until you move up a bit in levels, 5+, it's pretty much a test to thicken your skin.<br />
<br />
I play mostly on Vallon and prefer the teams setup, although I wish we had item loot back again.  <br />
<br />
Sks are really tough opponents.  Everytime I'm fighting what I think to be a warrior, and he starts to cast, I go, &quot;Oh damn.&quot;  They hurt, bad.<br />

<br />
You can kill halfings, elves and other vermin in Freeport.<br />
You can also kill dark elves as well.<br />
Human SK's are rare on the human/erud/barb team.<br />
<br />
Make it a racewar server and play a non evil team, but still kill the other 3 teams.  Rodcet Nife Ring Warden <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_malwae</div><div class="date">06-12-01, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My in game sister is a dark elf shadowknight, (on Tallon Zek), and now, at level 50, she is terrifying.  However, the road to where she is now was long and frustrating.  Shadowknights tend to get owned until they get their lvl 29 (?) spells.  I'm not sure how it is with other classes, but the difference between attacking a shadowknight a level before and a level after their next spells is immense.  If you are willing to do some hard painful work, being handicapped while the other classes go through their sweet spots in their 20's and 30's, in relation to PvP, it will be worth it.  I'd say the same goes for rogues.  You never get enough money or good equipment to be really devastating until your mid 40's.</div></div><hr />
