<br />
1) DOT = DOT. Got it.<br />
2) Str debuff = Str debuff. Got it.<br />
<br />
But..... <br />
<br />
3) Snare = movement debuff only? It slows, but doesn't immobilize? Does it work like a mez or stun? Can it be broken? Will the DOT poison, or bleeding - break it? <br />
<br />
4) Disease = Halves healing only? Natural healing, heal spells from other players, or both? Does it have any other effects? If not... seems lame, no? (Read somewhere it snares too but I dunno) <br />
<br />
One other thing...<br />
If you don't keep env up... does it eventually become useless? Like will a *lvl 10 env skill w/ lvl 10 poison* NOT have any affect on a lvl 35 guy? Or will it still do the same (albeit very weak) dmg / str debuff / snare time / etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only see its effectiveness when attacking with perforate and wanting to make sure the creeping death hits.  Perf with snare, stick, CD hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disease stops normal healing, 50% heal effectiveness, a small strength debuff and a snare. <br />
<br />
I actually use this for my snare rather then the snare poison for the most part.  It doesn't go away like the snare poison does.</div></div><hr />

High level is about a 20% snare from what Ir ead. Also snare breaks when mob takes damage so it is only useful to wack and run. In general a poison you won't use.<br />
<br />
disease = halve healing plus minor str debuff. At  ~20 envenom debuffs 20 str. At high levels it is about 50 str if I recall. Quite useful in RvR since instaheals are really annoying.<br />
<br />
Low envenom is fine. Resists are level vs level. So while you won't get better poisons you will still be able to use the ones you have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it true that even the lowest level disease poison prevents natural healing and reduces magic heals to 50%? I know the str debuffs will be much lower than high levels but are the other effects the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">02-12-02, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the higher disease poisons cause a bigger str debuff and have a longer duration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resists are based on your character level, as stated by Iriki.<br />
<br />
However, in relative terms, it will become steadily weaker.  With that I mean if you are level 10 with a 10 envenom vs a yellow con (level 10 mob), it'll do full.  At 50 with 10 envenom vs a 50 target... 10 envenom vs 50 target level means you'll be doing less.  The poison didn't really get weaker... if you managed to stick it on a level 50 at level 10, it would have done the same amount.  But don't expect a poison that does 18 per tick to yellows when you are level 10 to do 18 per tick to yellows when you are 40.  Won't happen.<br />
<br />
A low level strength debuff won't bother a level 35 guy unless you've got a high level of envenom (in which case you'd probably be using a higher level str debuff).  The guy will also have better gear (upping his str), better buffs (if buffed) and stat gains (assuming his class gains str as he levels).  So, yah, some things like str debuffs become useless.  Damage poison... well, doing 10 per tick for 5 ticks isn't much compared to a level 50's hp.  Others like disease will continue to last long enough and so remain effective.</div></div><hr />
