how do i check what is copyrighted and what is not ? does mentioning names of char i created in EQ or other games make them copyrighted ?<br />
<br />
<br />
and another question , what theme ? fantasy ? sci fi ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The intent of this is a common sense interpretation, I believe.  Don't write a story about Drizzt (no one should, after all), or a story that takes place in Qeynos or Rohan or London.  However if you write a story about &quot;Trueheart Evilsmiter&quot; or whatever sissy name you gave your paladin, you don't have to go on a search to find out if anyone has ever used that name in another work before.  A general rule of thumb is that anything creative is copyrighted - just because it doesn't have the little (C) jobbie doesn't mean it's fair game.  Don't use someone else's character.<br />
<br />
The theme should be Fantasy, I'd expect, since this will become part of Vanguard's in-game fiction, and Vanguard is a fantasy genre game.</div></div><hr />

Meaning are we able to use items from the sight such as creatures, places, etc?  I realize they don't want us writing 'history' i guess, but i want something i might write to feel like its part of the land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would assume if what you want to use falls into the History, Timeline or Characther catagory  then no.. if not then yes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">good luck all you storytellers out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstealer</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What size story are they looking for? 2-3 pages or a small paperback?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidden</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1500 words or less<br />
<br />
9. Submission must be no longer than 1500 words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The genre is Fantasy. I had that in the first line of my post but not in the thread title, I put it in the title to make it clearer :)<br />
<br />
Think of the type of story as something you might tell around the fire while in the world of Vanguard... yet not using any copyrighted characters. So while you could mention your liege, you could not actually use Vanguard character names, or EQ names, or Tolkien names, etc.<br />
<br />
When the winning story is included in the game one possibility is that it might be as a book available in various places in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">12-03-04, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those that don't read the vanguard forums, it's been clarified that &quot;relinquish some rights&quot; actually means &quot;relinquish all rights&quot; for the purposes of this contest.  The winner will be required to sign over all rights to their fiction.  So don't write about characters or places you have any desire to publish elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pearll</div><div class="date">12-04-04, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got mine in.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't mind giving up rights to it.  I write for fun and hope that others find my works as enjoyable.  Heck, submitting it will give it some exposure, even if it's not chosen, which is enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trayson</div><div class="date">12-05-04, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sent mine in.  :kroe <br />
<br />
I always enjoy entering writing contests. I figure Safehouse to be a good challenge as well, what with the wonderful minds this community has cultured over the years. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the horrible predicament of having written a safehouse story, but knowing the odds of getting to the finals are better submitting it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, tough one.<br />
<br />
When the deadline gets closer I think the other sites will have more entries and we'll all be even in the end. Then at least here you might have the &quot;hometown&quot; advantage ;)<br />
<br />
Or... you could submit it to another site but simultaneously post it in The Fireplace forum for us to read here and then tell folks where they can go vote for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went ahead and sent it to the safehouse mods.  In the end, it's not very good but it is a rogue story and belongs here.</div></div><hr />

Both names please :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a reminder, you can only submit your story to 1 fansite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deishan</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got mine? Please, tell me i am not the disqualified one...</div></div><hr />

I didn't notice this one until the due date, and I don't think I can scramble my brain fast enough to get a good submission in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DerangedGnome2.0</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will you guys be sending acknowledgments of entries recieved? Jesslyn5's was sent in late last evening &amp;lt;or early this morning, lol&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see anything for Jesslyn5.<br />
<br />
We did get one last night entitled &quot;By Dawn&quot; without anything but the authors real name.<br />
<br />
'zat you?<br />
<br />
Edit: And we did recieve another untitled story early this morning by someone with the same surname as that of the &quot;By Dawn&quot; author. That also didn't contain either SH or Vanguard handles.<br />
<br />
Edit again: Yep, that was hers/yours... I didn't read the subject line... I'm assuming By Dawn is yours or someone you know? We'll need both SH and Vanguard handles for both stories... but we do have them in hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DerangedGnome2.0</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">'By Dawn' isn't mine...I will resend with both names in the headline, I'll send from my AOL address this time rather than hotmail. Thanks for the response.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oops! Sorry. After sending it in on the AOL acct., I read my hotmail e-mail from you Nocte, requesting my SH handle. That e-mail has been answered, sorry about it coming on both e-mail accts, I just wanted to get it in before the deadline, and thought you hadn't recieved it. Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay then. That's one mystery solved. :p<br />
<br />
By Dawn  is still unaccounted for. I sent an email to the author-- we'll need both Safehouse and Vanguard names to qualify any story recieved prior to midnight PST!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I already got that guy's info. I've been emailing everyone as soon as I got their story. Only one I didn't was Nymm but he would've seen we got it if he checked his icq :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah. Sorry for scaring everyone then. Just trying to make all the bases were covered. Good luck everyone.<br />
<br />
And might I add, the SH is representing in the contest- currently the most known contestants. Great job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck everyone! It's now past midnight PST. We received 10 qualified entrants. We'll be posting all the stories at the same time, on Dec 10 for everyone to read. Voting will begin then and you must be a registered member to vote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trayson</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the deadline gets closer I think the other sites will have more entries and we'll all be even in the end.

<br />
Well, in the end you guys had the most submissions. Of all the sites that were listing number of entries (only two weren't), the next highest was 6 and I think three sites had that number.<br />
<br />
Definitely going to be a bit more challenging here. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Digo</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I purposely published my story here, knowing full well it would receive the most traffic and competition because if it wins, I know damn well it wasn't by default.  <br />
<br />
Winning without blood and suffering is hardly worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll post the entries now. Each story will be up in The Fireplace but I will post the voting poll/news item in this forum and link to each entrant from there for easy access.</div></div><hr />
