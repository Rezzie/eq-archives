<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">06-21-02, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aha, I thought. This is an easy riddle. An arrow! Put one in the box...no no, that didn't work. Hmmm, an arrow isn't exactly a splinter. So how about a dart! Yes that must be it. No...no. Ummm, a bolt? No. A sling bullet with pointy wooden toothpicks...no. <br />
<br />
Is there something that I'm missing? I tried putting one arrow/bolt/sling bullet/dart/shruken inside, as well as a whole stack, also tried putting it in there with the note as well...<br />
<br />
If I am looking at the riddle too obviously DON'T tell me the answer, just say, &quot;No you simple minded rogue! Are you half orc or something?&quot;          Krimzan Anklestabber<br />

That would be delivering something while it is in flight...<br />

Sorry if my blind guess ruined it</div></div><hr />

AHA! Thank you. Hmmm...perhaps I should get to that tree-huggin' quest...<br />

<br />
The answer you're looking for involves something in Peninsula district that you probably overlooked(I know I did first) but you'll need to make sure to have someone's permission to go there first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">06-22-02, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it took me awile to figure it out,however keep working on it.<br />
<br />
ps: your thought on an arrow was correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't believe I didn't remember about them though. On the last page of my inventory.</div></div><hr />

I'll give ya a hint about this particular one, the trail will start with a person in the Hall of Justice.<br />
<br />
I can't believe I couldn't figure it out though. I spent hours trying to open that door until I quit in frustration and saw this thread. I scoured all of Peninsula till I found what I was lookin for. Thanks guys! Edited by: Pedric Cuf at: 6/22/02 9:19:25 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm goin to go out on a limb and say this is the tomb one.  If so, I've gotten it and I have 3 items I recieved that I assuem are the keys.  Problem is I don't understand where the riddles are or how to use the items as keys.  If we're talking about the same quest, we can talk by email.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read the diary that came along with the keys. Also, keep an eye out for a girl named Punkin...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, especially if you aren't neutral...she may kick your ass...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read the diary.  I found the door, but by lord I can't figure out how to use the keys w/ the door or where the friggin riddles are.  I'll look for the chick though.  What district?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vaclav Romanov</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you remember your talk with the dwarf in the first tomb, he explained that he put an emerald in the chest at that tomb to answer the riddle there....<br />
<br />
So....<br />
<br />
Note: I'm currently about halfway through Chapter 3.... considering how many sidequests I skipped past I'm suprised it's this long - the 60 hr single player campaign quote might be the first accurate time estimate I've ever seen, too often a game is quoted time based on doing every little thing instead of being realistic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said they had a developer up to 80 hours and still going.  So I think there's alot of depth in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the arrow one.  My question, do the tombs have to be done in an order?  I was looking for the docks distict one and found a door I thought sounded right but I couldn't find a way to open.  SO I went to the blackgate district and found the splinter one.<br />
<br />
Which raises another question, at what level were you able to defeat guarders of that place.    I'm 6 and while I don't hire mercaries, (assassins work alone), those things own me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't defeat em.    I'm a thief, not an assassin. I just snuck by em, stole the relics, and stole myself outta there. Level seven with no henchman here too.    As far as I know, no particular order except you have to start with the Peninsula. I did Peninsula, Blacklake, Begger's Nest, and Docks in respective order.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-23-02, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 6 but just picked up a +10 hide cloak so I think I&quot;ll be able to make it this time.  I&quot;m an assassin but I only fight the battles in my favor.  Maybe I&quot;m just missing something by the sewer.  I haven't even entered begger's nest though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you may have to do that order.  I'm almost sure I&quot;m at the place in the docks where I enter but I have no triggers what-so-ever to open the door.  I have peninsula-blacklake done in that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vaclav Romanov</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shrug, I beat down the guardians...<br />
<br />
Forget what level I was, but I did them pretty late however - prolly Level 8-9ish on my Cleric, Summoned Dire whatever was appropriate to the level, and the Tomi for my Henchman...<br />
<br />
Was a tough, tough fight but I managed it... a stealthy class would undoubtably be able to do it alot easier though... (as my first character, before I switched to the cleric, I just dashed in grabbed it and used the Stone of Recall)<br />
<br />
They drop nothing so no reason to kill them if you have an alternate method...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gyorg</div><div class="date">06-24-02, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I was looking in the wrong place for the entrance in the dock district.  Go me for not following the path for finding the animals. (I'm finding the one in Beggar's last.  Hell, I just entered it after finishing evey quest I found in the other 3.  And I Just hit 7 on my second zombie.  Anyway, I guess I'll find the one in beggar's.  Kill some stuff.  Maybe go kill the stuff I left alive other places to level.  Then Finish up in Beggar's.  And assassin's don't hire henchman.  Assassin's work alone.</div></div><hr />

I let my friend take one for the team while I whipped around behind the staircase. I then proceeded to 'pull' em one at a time. =)<br />

I could pull them single w/ a bit of luck and good hiding.  I still died in 2 rounds.  =).  I just walked past them.  Much easier.</div></div><hr />
