<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Solanar</div><div class="date">09-29-02, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking with a friend recently, and we decided we wanted to try and get a group together for D&amp;amp;D.<br />
<br />
My only time playing was at a con in Tampa - 2 tables, 2 GMs, 2 groups (lawful good and lawful evil) and I had a really great time, but not really had a chance since to play, and never learned most of the rules, since the GMs were hosting the game specifically to show people who weren't familar (and therefor were really good about walking us through it)<br />
<br />
My friend hasn't played in about 10 years, with her step brother as GM and her dad usually the only one playing with her.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering what ya'll think would be a good starting game, and what we'd need to buy to make it happen.<br />
<br />
We'd like to get 5 or 6 people, have the GM spot rotate, and to avoid leaving anyone out we'd like people who die to be able to simply re-roll as a new character 5 or 10 minutes down the road.<br />
<br />
We'd probably want to start off with some prepackaged situations and then later move on to making up our own.<br />
<br />
So, any ideas, words of advice, or simply answers? Thanks guys.<br />

They're there for their ability to help the roleplaying/storytelling along, ideally.  D&amp;amp;D is a pretty good system if you dont want to be bogged down by mechanics (or at least it used to be... I havent looked at 3rd Edition)<br />
<br />
Choosing a system without heavy mechanincs is a must if you're going to run a campaign in which people are easily killed, as they will potentially be making new characters often.  I played a game once (FASA Star Trek) where the character creation was highly detailed enough that it took maybe 45 minutes to an hour to make a character.  Then the weapons had a &quot;wide angle disintigrate&quot; setting on em. Hmmm....</div></div><hr />
