<br />
Fast or the slowest one weapon, since we dont get 2h.. I personaly went for Bastard Sword 3.9delay. Is there any Higher delay 1h slashing weapons in Albion greater then 3.9?<br />
<br />
I could backstab with the slow then switch to the faster weapon but is that needed since it should equal out in the end with the way damage is setup in daoc. Only thing i can think of is faster weapon would help me get off my opening required styles more successfuly.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

<br />
I havent used these but i heard a while back a few infiltrators using these for their opening shot (BS &amp;amp; BS 2).  Generally the staffs are higher damage with slower delay which = great CS opening damage.  But after a while I imagine the constant switching out from staff to your prime weapons would get annoying.<br />
<br />
Lots of people suggest using a slow delay weapon for your opening crit shot.<br />
<br />
I'm lazy.... i keep the same weapons in place all the time.  I have a hard enough time getting in the correct hotkey bank after my CS opening......  much less having to worry about using hotkeys to switchout weapons and rehitting the attack button!!!    Nummie Shinsplitter<br />
