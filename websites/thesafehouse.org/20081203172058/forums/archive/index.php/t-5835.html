When was the last time a guild like FOH experienced  any risk?  If we were talking about risk v. reward, then FOH, LOS, and all the other uber guilds should get rusty daggers from everything they kill.<br />
<br />
Effort v. reward is another thing.  And if you go by that definition of the world, the loot sucks  <br />

<br />
I knew from the very beginning that EQ=time sink.  IF you die, you need to make up lost time.  Additionally, accomplishing things in EQ actually takes effort.  FoH doesn't just will a mob to die and then it magically happens.  They work hard.  They should be rewarded accordingly.<br />
<br />
If it takes 12 hours to clear PoG, plus defeating a flurrying mob that quads for nearly 1000, then there should be a reward that is suitable.  If better rewards are found elsewhere, the game is obviously out of whack.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to speak for FoH, because I am not in their guild nor have I killed Tunare.  But that doesn't mean I can't see the obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Snootay</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One time I was bored and attacked Tunare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where is the 'risk?'<br />
<br />
When you're level 60 and have a full exp bar, how many times can you die and not lose level 60?  How many times can you die at level 60 when you get a click stick rez every time?<br />
<br />
The only 'risk' to that kind of guild is corpse loss.  When you're level 20, and you die, chances are you're not going to get a rez, so there is a real risk of death - a couple hours of experience.  So a level 20 fighting somewhere 'risky' should yield a valuable reward (for someone who's level 20).  Likewise, someone who is level 50 fighting in the same place should get loot that is relative @#%$, because there's no risk of loss.<br />
<br />
I meerely point out that the concept of risk v. reward makes no sense at the end game level where everyone is level 60, everyone gets level 56 rezzes every time they die, and at the very least, you can always get a necro to summon corpses.  That's not to say that their effort doesn't deserve an adequate reward, simply the people who argue risk versus reward aren't really thinking through their statements.  The amount of 'risk' they are really undertaking is zero.  Therefore my statement that they should all loot rusty daggers.<br />
<br />
Risk v. reward is a tired, overused concept.  Don't just say risk v. reward!  Give me phat lewt!  Say &quot;It took the concentrated efforts of 70 people with an average level of 59 about 100 hours combined to develop the strategy and execute it.  Reward us appropriately&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ancalimon81</div><div class="date">08-01-01, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, the exp loss is not the only risk in this game.  Effort and time=risk.  WHen a raid is wiped out, be prepared to be spending a lot of time cring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LegionSwrd</div><div class="date">08-06-01, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No risk of exp loss? Yeah, sure.<br />
<br />
There IS a 3 hour timer on rezzes. Even if it doesn't run while you are logged off, you have to get someone TO your corpse in 3 hours to get the rez. Ever had a plane break go bad? Even with a great guild? CR at that point can suck rocks and yes, you can be in danger of losing exp.<br />
<br />
3 deaths yesterday breaking Fear. 2 rezzes and one too old. That's half a yellow and several hours work lost. =P Someone screwed up on the break and it cost around 25 ppl alot of time. But we cleaned it up, and you go on. =) Just don't say there is no risk involved on the 50+ game. Its only been since lvl 46 that I've actually been worried about my corpse.<br />
<br />
Lvl 20 risk, heh. Level 20 was a lot of fun and I died alot and lost alot of exp in the 20s and 30s. Big deal, there's very little risk or loss at those lvls in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Northerner</div><div class="date">08-18-01, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, at 60, maxed or close, there really is only the risk of time lost (effort lost if you will).  You won't lose your corpse unless your guild does something truly monumentally insane and the worst case scenerio is a bunch of coffins burned and click-stick deaths that are pretty meaningless.  Even a smaller guild can ensure the availability of a 49th Rezz I would imagine.  Hey, say it all goes to the dogs and you take a complete death.  You are still 60 and you aren't likely to take so many of those that you can't make the exp back on regular raids, nevermind loot hunts in more mundane places.  The *risk* is the lost opportunity to achieve something difficult and the *reward* is a new accomplishment and hopefully the ability to increase the power of your memebership.<br />

Sure killing Tunare owns, but some people might like to see more profit for their time besides a bragging right. I can see killing her once but not a second time. I've run enough raids high lvl raids in my time (well, pre-kunark anyway) to know how stressful it is and it only escalates with the difficulty of the encounter. I can't begin to imagine how running a Tunare strike down must've been. Loot isn't ~everything~ in the game, but it sure does have a lot of value as well as being survival gear for the next big mob that needs to die.<br />
