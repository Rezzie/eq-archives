<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-08-06, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there's a separate anime forum now, and I'm not so worried about forum clutter, I've decided to make a separate thread for the discussion of the current One Piece arc subbed by ADC and Gerusama rather than keep talking about it in the other thread where people are trying to discuss the KF releases.<br />
<br />
But anyway!<br />
<br />
263<br />
Finally got to see EL.  Much nicer place than I was picturing.  I thought it was gonna be some kinda alcatraz looking place, but it's not.<br />
<br />
Looks like Sanji and Usopp did alot of work for nothing.  CP9 still has Robin and Franky, and they end up back with the rest of the crew.  At least their all together now!  Full assault!  Woo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-08-06, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question:<br />
 <br />
Does Geru start at the begginning of an arc, or do they start in the middle of one?<br />
 <br />
And, if so, What ep. should I start with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-08-06, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gerusama starts with the very last episode of the Davy Back Fight.  Which is 219.  220 is the beginning of a couple short filler Arcs.  The non-filler stuff starts at 227.</div></div><hr />

Now the Enies Lobby arc has officially begun.  Complete with the kickass new opening!The 3 new CP9 members are a bunch of retards.  It's really a contrast to the cool calm of the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Luffy and Chopper meeting Sogeking was pure comedy gold.<br />
<br />
And of course, Luffy has to run ahead of everyone else and kick extra ass.  Man, they just got everyone back together too.<br />
<br />
God this is awsome. I don't think I can make it the two weeks till the next episode!</div></div><hr />

Pretty nice watching all the battling going on.  Wonder if Paulie and co. are gonna be able to take those giants on, or if they're just gonna end up getting their butts kicked till the Strawhats arrive.<br />
<br />
Only real complaint is the recap seems to be getting longer and longer.  Episode ended up just feeling way too short.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally...*******...sweet.<br />
<br />
That episode rocked all kinds of ass.  I don't think I've ever seen Luffy kick so much ass at once.  Poor Spandam doesn't have a clue whats happening either.<br />
<br />
And then there's Fuk, who apparently reads power levels...that's pretty cool.  At least, it's nice they ranked the CP9 members for us.  And they've got new fruits too!(Oh man, would it be sweet if the SHs got their hands on those fruits before CP9 could eat them!).<br />
<br />
My only complaint...they stuck one of the new scenes(one with Nami and Sogeking) in the MIDDLE of the recap!  Wtf, I only saw it by sheer luck!  So now I have to watch the ENTIRE recaps to make sure I don't miss anything?  God that sucks.</div></div><hr />

When Fuk showed up, I felt DBZ chills up my spine. But I can forgive that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">06-12-06, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What?  Oh, you mean cause of the power levels?  Yeah, its pretty obvious.  But at least they specifically state that the power levels are only pure physical power, and doesn't take into account special abilities.  Still, I'd like to know what the strawhats have.</div></div><hr />

I really like how EL has all these badass commanders and elite units, and Luffy is skipping all of them because he's blasting through so fast that by the time they are ready to fight him, he's already past them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">06-28-06, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">268-269<br />
<br />
Man, that was good.  Especially where it ended.  Blueno has been doing pretty much ALL the fighting for CP9 since Iceburg's house.  Time to see if Luffy has gotten any stronger since...um...oh wait, I guess that was yesterday for him.<br />
<br />
Also...Nami...those dials sure upped the power of her staff.<br />
<br />
And Paulie was particularly badass this week.  All of Galley-la was.<br />
<br />
Spandam is a real ****.  I get the distinct feeling that if the Government ever fired him, that CP9 would kill him instantly.  And that his position is the only thing that keeps him alive.<br />
<br />
Clip at the end was a waste of time.  Time that coulda been used showing one of those mini-stories in the opening pages of the manga.</div></div><hr />

Total cocktease.  I guess Luffy has gotten strong enough to beat Blueno since yesterday...oh well.  Just the way anime is I guess.<br />
<br />
Damn Sogeking taking up all the screentime!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-05-06, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">270<br />
<br />
Yeah I was like... GTFO Sogeking. But Luffy kicked ass. I don't think it's that he got stronger, he never go the chance to use his full strength. If you recall, the rifle move he used is the same one he used in Skypeia to finish off Enel, so it's a pretty strong technique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All hail Sogeking the Giant Pimp!<br />
<br />
Hmm...fruits for Califa and Kaku eh...that's pretty interesting.  Some informative stuff about fruits too.  If you eat two, you explode.  That's good to know.  And also it apparently tastes like ****.<br />
<br />
And Luffy vs. Blueno is managing to still rock ass even though they only show a couple minutes at a time.</div></div><hr />

 Bah, 272 episodes into the anime, Luffy gets his first real powerup, after having fought tons of strong people and learning from it, and it's a DBZ comparision? Feh. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The manga just explained it in chap 420 so if you want to know<br />
<br />
Luffy pumps his leg with air it causes blood flow to speed up, this is dangerous because his blood pressure would be fatal but his rubber body is able to handle it but will shorten his life<br />
<br />
btw first time posting here tho i've lurked for a while<br />
<br />
Hurray</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna go watch it again right now!</div></div><hr />

Oh man, this episode was just oozing with cool.  Especially the shot of them all standing on the wall.  That's moneyshot right there baby!<br />
<br />
Especially with Sogeking with a new weapon that just materialized out of ******* nowhere?!<br />
<br />
I just hope Robin is done resisting.  I'm REALLY getting ******* sick of that.</div></div><hr />

Facinating episode.  Finally they're showing Robin's past, which is great.  I wasn't expecting Robin to already have eaten the fruit when she was just a little kid though.<br />
<br />
And the Giant!  And one in Luffy's family to boot!  I wonder what relation he is...<br />
<br />
One thing I found wierd though was Robin's voice.  It sounds like they actually used a child to do her voice, which is different from all the other little kids on the show.  So she sounds wierdly out of place.<br />
<br />
And...4 weeks to the next episode?!  Jesus christ!</div></div><hr />

just you know in the manga it doesn't state that he is from the family</div></div><hr />

Technically, he just says, everyone in his family has the D. so I think your to assume he's related to Luffy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About time! Now the battle begins!<br />
<br />
I thought Robin's history was more well done in the anime than the manga, which was nice. It was crushing to see her suffering, but Luffy pounding his fists and saying &quot;Let's go&quot; says it all. Time to kick the world government's ass! Kind of makes me wonder if Dragon will be making an appearance over the next few arcs, him being anti-world goverment and supposedly super-strong and all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Certain Kill Firebird Star!!<br />
<br />
Sogeking rules.<br />

Plus, I'm glad Robin is finally ready to stop sabotaging her own rescue.</div></div><hr />

 does zorro slash the train ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The crew stands in line on top of the roof, and CP9 on the roof across them with Robin. Robin just told the crew &quot;I WANNA LIVE!!!&quot; So, right before the CP9 battles. So yeah, they are quite far away from Zoro slashing the sea train.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, sorry, I misread your question. I don't know what episode that happened in. It's been a while.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure 260 is the anime episode where Zoro uses Rashamon to cut the train in half.</div></div><hr />

******* sweeeeet!<br />
<br />
I love that Sanji's new super attack is a reference to Red Leg Zeff.<br />
<br />
He was just totally badass this episode.<br />
<br />
I'm sad though, because I really though Usopp was gonna be more powerful in this arc, but it looks like all that stuff with the new identity and the new weapon is gonna be for naught.  I'm sure he'll do something important, but he's not gonna be defeating anyone tough because everyones already beaten or taken by someone they are clearly not going to beat.<br />
<br />
I mean, ****, even Nami beat somebody powerful.  But Usopp still sucked....<br />
<br />
Sadness.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, suprising.  They showed a flashback of someones past but there was nothing tragic about it.  Lucci has always been a ****.<br />

<br />
In fact there's alot of stuff in that isn't filler that you will just assume is because there's just some really goofy **** going on sometimes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, in Naruto you can always tell filler by the introduction of some really lame looking character and some really pointless mission.<br />
<br />
In One Piece, pretty much every character looks lame.  It's my one beef with the show is the art style.  And Oda is introducing characters constantly.  I mean, people you won't even see again for 100 episodes.<br />
<br />
And they have a way of taking what should be straightforward activities and turning them into &quot;How the hell did you go from doing that to doing THAT?!&quot; type moments.</div></div><hr />

Good to see everyone again. Dragon looks damn crazy.<br />

Thousand Sunny is kinda meh, but Going Merry wasn't exactly shakespear.<br />

 <br />
I want a shirt. On the back, it would have a large pic of the strawhat logo, with the words &quot;Mugiwara Kaizoku&quot; encircling it. I'd wear it around and be all like 'ha, I'm so much better than all the other OP fans'. And maybe someone would recognise the logo, and be all like 'omg i luv OP but wuts Mooji wear whatever?' and I'd scoff at them and they'd commit suicide for losing so hard.<br />

Blackbeard hax.<br />
 <br />
Granted, he's weak against range, as he can't dodge anything- he can only take an incredible amount of damage as his defense.<br />
 <br />
Should be called the gravity-gravity fruit instead of darkness, but i guess thats not evil enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-27-07, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ActuallyHe should be completely immune to range attacks just like Ace and Enel.  He has a logia fruit, so it means his body is completely made of darkness.<br />
<br />
I think the only reason Ace's fire hurts him is because its energy and not a solid projectile.  That, or Blackbeard was letting it hit him on purpose for some reason.<br />
<br />
I mean, even when speared through with fire lances, the darkness just swallowed them up and there wasn't even holes left behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">09-27-07, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way he explains it:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Unlike other logia users, he can't let attacks go thru him: he takes every attack due to it literally being 'sucked in' by the gravity. It isn't nullified in any way, he can simply 'hold' an amazing amount of damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tivia</div><div class="date">10-11-07, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I have been pretty diehard on Kaizoku Fansubs for my one piece source since the beginning. Mostly because I tried another Fansub group at the time and had so much trouble with it and the translation was so terribly I never looked back. At the time they were only up to 160, so I had to quit watching a while.<br />
<br />
I recently subscribed to Naruto Fan and anime Eden so I could get fast direct downloads instead of Torrent since I got fed up with dealing with torrent. After downloading just a flipping ton of content to get my Fansubs collections back up to speed, I decided to take a gamble and check out the Vega punk Fansubs...<br />
<br />
I am converted, holy crap streaming in HD is so freaking much better then the DVD rips Kaizoku was doing. Checked Gerusama as well and it was good also. Translations in both are pretty solid, so before I get fully started with the series again..180 is where I am..I am replacing as much Kaizoku as I possibly can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">10-11-07, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've had conversations about that in PM's and such. <br />
 <br />
Main reason I started liking Vega was that they didn't translate names with 'k' sounds in them as 'c'. (Conis, Cocoro, ect)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure how your getting HD versions of earlier subs because they don't exist before the Davey Back arc.  Because One Piece wasn't MADE in HD back then.<br />
<br />
So you can't really blame KF for looking like poorer quality compared to Vegapunk, because One Piece itself looked poorer quality.</div></div><hr />

I was &quot;Hoping&quot; to get HD eps...I have now figured out they do not exist..no worries I got everything up to 325 downloaded last night, everything that was in HD..in HD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finished eps 218 to 224 last night, which was clearly filler...That was by far the worst arc I have endured.<br />
<br />
Finished up The Davy back arc the day before, I know some did not like it but while silly I did overall enjoy it anyhow. It was a nice break from the more serious Skypeia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea I know.<br />
<br />
I generally know what is coming, due to I do have all the episodes downloaded and named. I make a habit of watching known filler anyhow, that was just the first filler arc that made me regret it. :zombie</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what people don't like about it is they stuck filler in the MIDDLE of the storyline.  Like 3 of the 6 events are filler(in the manga they only played 1 coinset).  And having fillers in the middle of such a small arc really ****s with it.    It's not like the fillers in Arabasta where the arc is massive and they threw some fillers in while they were crossing the desert.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, I personally got up to Eps 236 last night.<br />
<br />
Wow....just...wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">10-18-07, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just 100 more episodes till you catch up!  And its all one arc too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't follow the anime as much as i follow the manga ( i watch K-F most of the time , so from what i hear from my friend they didn't encounter hte ghost yet ? is that right ? because that would make them still in filler land</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">likenew</div><div class="date">11-03-07, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you read above somewhere, you'll see that the anime has just finished building the super pirate boat and has set sail.  currently bounty hunters are after the 600 mil of the crews heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">11-04-07, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">236.. just wow.. just.. WOW!Oh yeah.  Luffy vs. Usopp.  That was definitely one boss episode.<br />
<br />
shehab<br />
Though I think the ghost you are talking about is in the new opening.<br />
<br />
Looks like a skeleton with an afro.<br />
<br />
Which I'm excited for because if there's one Pirate cliche thats been missing from One Piece it's ghost pirates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shehab aldean</div><div class="date">11-04-07, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah filler land<br />

Intro spoiler<br />
yeah skeleton afro would have been better description for it</div></div><hr />

I still like Naruto better when Naruto is good.  But then there's the times when Naruto blows.<br />
<br />
One Piece is more consistantly better.</div></div><hr />
