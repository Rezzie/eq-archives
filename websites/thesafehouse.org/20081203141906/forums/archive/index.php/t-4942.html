<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_J3110 B1AFRA</div><div class="date">03-06-02, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so here's the deal, last night I took my 30 shade to the battleground and I had a blast. Seriously the most fun I have had in a mmorpg to date. However, my stealth seemed low (25 with item) most people could see me once I got too close so I had a difficult time getting a perf off before they attacked.<br />
<br />
My origional lvl 35 RvR spec plan had included 27 base stealth and 34 crit so I could do CD for the stun. But after seeing some actual RvR action I have been wondering if it might be wiser to go 32 stealth and 29 crit.<br />
<br />
I really would prefur to be able to use CD on people at 35, so I guess my question is what stealth items are available in Hibernia? What drops them? How much gold could I expect to fork over if I decided to be lazy and buy from a player?<br />
<br />
Also what would be some good high damage piercing weapons for me to try and get my hands on for a lvl 35? I have had my eye on that one time drop from Dorbal but I dont think that drops till you are lvl 36? Anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your trouble!<br />
