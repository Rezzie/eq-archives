<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-27-03, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I had 6 people in my game on Friday night. The PCs had been playing detective/ghost hunters for like 3 sessions, and people were dying for combat of sorts, so I planned what I thought would be a nice, tough encounter for them.<br />
<br />
12th level Necromancer. Had it planned where they would storm her lab, and she would have a bunch of undead ready to defend her. Only, my PCs decided to Dimensional Fold from the dungeon, straight to her bedroom, to catch her by surprise.<br />
<br />
Now, understand something about me as a DM. I like to act like a hard ass to my players, but when it comes down to it, I HATE listening to my players bitch about my personal decisions as a DM. They don't find fault with most of what I do, but typically, there will be some eye rolling going on when I make a call or a plot choice. So I try to strike a balance between giving the players some of what they expect, and what I want to have happen.<br />
<br />
Rather than having a &quot;Oh man, I just blew this spell blah blah blah&quot; when they went to her room to find her, I let her be there. No biggie, I'll just Dimension Door(casting time 1) right to her Laboratory in the first round. Initiative is rolled, she goes on 8. That's fine, I think, she'll make it there.<br />
<br />
Wizard casts Lance of Disruption, 15 points of damage, out of her 30 hps. Yikes I think, now she has 50 hps, because the monk goes next....He attacks, 2 hits at -2 AC....ok.....rolls damage.....+6 damage for exceptional strength, twice, plus 3 base damage for his hands, twice, plus......15 damage twice from the ring of shocking grasp.........grand total of almost 45 damage.....<br />
<br />
At this point, I just ended the session. I was so pissed. Sure, I could have bumped her hp up to 70 to compensate, given her a -5 AC, but that in my mind, is being a @#%$ GM. I may make the calls, but the players know the difference between a real monster, and one that is getting extra HPs and AC because they are stomping it's ass. <br />
<br />
I have no one to blame but myself. I set the situation up, I handed out the items(the ring of shocking grasp has gone bye-bye since), my players simply acted on the scene I set up. I unfortunately have this problem where I don't like to completely bend reality to accomplish my vision of where the scene should go, that's not fair to the players. <br />
<br />
So now, I'm trying to decide what to do. The necromancer should have been a fairly nasty, important encounter for the module. They collected no treasure afterwards, go their xps for killing her, and gained no knowledge or information after killing her. Should I--<br />
<br />
A) Continue on with the adventure, reduce the treasure yield from the necromancer.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
B) restart the scene right when they enter the room, put her in her lab with some protection, let them keep the Xp they got for killing her and not award anymore should they do so again, and give them a challenging, dangerous encounter? <br />
<br />
<br />
On one hand, I hate changing a piece of the story that has already happened. It's tacky, makes me look like an idiot, is bad for the continuity of things. On the other hand, it is getting harder and harder for my PCs to take danger seriously in this mod because so far, no one has died, one pc has hit negative hp so far in 6 sessions, and the only reason they have to be scared at all is becauise I've supposedly installed a glass ceiling of no greater than +2 weapons, so they can't hurt some of the ghosts in the castle. <br />
<br />
Suggestions? I'm taking a nice 2 week break from running things. I think it's kind of funny, I think it's kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had.<br />

<br />
As the PCs are on their way out of the fortress/whatever, the necromancer's lover (who happens to be a carbon copy) is waiting for them, with the undead army already summoned. <br />
<br />
He doesn't have any loot of his own (or minor loot, she was a dominatrix or something), and you don't give exp, since the exp you awarded was for the entire adventure, which they hadn't quite finished.<br />
<br />
A little cheesy, but at least you're not messing with history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">07-27-03, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">#1.  Remove Dimensional Fold from the game.  it screwed up quite a few sessions for us when we were playing.  We basically made it into a much weaker teleport spell.  As it stands, it is a total BS and broken spell.<br />
<br />
#1a.  We had a standing rule that any type of teleport spell (even Dimensional Door) had a disorientation effect with it.  It kept the pop in, assassinate before they knew what was going on, pop out things from happening.  In effect, the person lost one round worth of actions.  After a bit we switched it to a +10 initiative penaly.<br />
<br />
#2 As to the ring of shocking grasp, I know you removed it, but I would think you could only activate it once a round.  *shrug*  It is a moot point now.<br />
<br />
As to rectifying what happened, isn't there a spell which allows Necromancy based caster to make corpses/zombies appear as whomever you basically want?  The name escapes me at the moment I am afraid.  That would be an easy fix.  Hell, make it a unique spell if there isn't one.  That is a decent reward in itself.<br />
<br />
Personally I would go with the disguised zombie thing.  That would explain how they beat her so easily.  While they ransack the bedroom, it is a perfect opportunity for her to snag a ghost or two, along with a couple undead protectors, and go looking as the Alarm spell kicked off (the silent mental alarm version).  As the PCs get tied up at the door due to the undead pets, the ghosts slip around the back and hammer the casters...<br />
<br />
Make them scared.  She may even have a pet rust monster.  Everyone fears the rust monster...  mm.  Undead Rust Monster...   <br />

It's a sound idea...except in my &quot;@#%$, you just fux0rd my session&quot; one of my soild PCs, in an attempt to help, suggested that very idea. Now, I'm unsure about using it, because it seems a cheap way to gratify myself as a DM. If he hadn't mentioned, hell, I'd be a genius! But since it's a basically a player idea to make me feel better about what happened, it in my mind cheapens the experience. Still a very viable option however.<br />
<br />
Quote:As the PCs are on their way out of the fortress/whatever, the necromancer's lover (who happens to be a carbon copy) is waiting for them, with the undead army already summoned.<br />
<br />
For one, they can't leave the castle, but that would taken entirely too long to explain. As for her lover....he's actually a part of the mod too, but it's more of a one sided relationship on her part, and he is actually the one that asked the PCs to kill her     Once again, it would take entirely too long to explain here. Of course, I could have her minions flip out after she dies and go rampaging....<br />
<br />
The original encounter was planned as: PCs enter her laboratory, she's alone. They storm in, and suddenly 6 Juju zombies appear from under a Cloak Undead spell. While they are holding the PCs up from killing her, she starts casting Summon Undead III and IV, with up to d6 nasties a pop, up to Jujus and something else really nasty. As well, she had about 4 defensive spells, Death Armor, Blood Lighting, and a few other nasty ones, in additon to like 3 wall of force type paralyzation spells, and a rod that shoots paralyzing damage blasts.<br />
<br />
All in all, I thought it was going to rock my PCs, but she died that round. <br />
<br />
Dimensional Fold has it's draw backs, like one person through at a time, 10% chance to age d3 years when you go through. A few PCs mumbled something about &quot;shouldn't we get the surprise advantage....&quot; but I ignored that, would have been undue overkill. Although I like the +initiative for starting behind a teleport door and trying to start meele through it. <br />
<br />
<br />
The really sad part is, the monk who just made 7th was itching to try out his new spell level, so he casts Divination, and asks about his odds and what the best way to to defeat her was. What did I tell them? &quot;Your best chance at success is to catch her by surprise&quot;.<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
The learning curve for DMing can really suck sometimes. Driving a friend home afterwards, he reminded me of something fairly crucial. &quot;Sure she was a 12th level necromancer, versus 6 average of 6th level PCs. Of course she was going to lose. A single caster type(i.e. not bitching armor class or HP) is not a viable encounter for a party of 6 with the full compliment of healing, meele and magic. Just isn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
About the ring, I had the epiphany about an hour later as well that the ring is only on one hand, not both. Talked to one of my PCs about, and his expalination was &quot;well, specialized fighters with long swords attack with the same weapon hand twice in a round, so why should a monk have to use both hands to make 2 attacks?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Dunno, allocation of magic items was a big @#%$ up on my part in this mod. Monks, by normal rules(he's playing a sort of European monk with less combat oriented special powers, no innate magic attack or damage bonuses) monks can't have exceptional strength. Not sure about that being definitive as far as magic alteration, but it makes sense to me.  Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 7/27/03 2:59 pm</div></div><hr />

Actually it is another spell of lower level.  I will dig out my PHB (2E and 3E) and see if I can find it.  Hmm, maybe it was in a supplement.  Basically, all it did was take a  zombie and let you change its appearance.  The spell description even mentioned it was a &quot;great way&quot; to foil ambushes.  You get the idea though.<br />
<br />
You could have it so she had a pact with Orcus in place and comes back as a minor lich.  She rises on the spot as a ghost seeking vengeance.  Contingency spell to port her out when she hit a certain number of hp, and some minion is there to administer corpse to mouth resusitation.  Or it magic jars her to another body.  You still have some options   <br />
<br />

<br />
Well, if she had not been caught by surprise, she could have whacked/severely hurt them IMO.  Undead and summoned minions, a properly prepared magical and mundane defense in her lab/bedroom, escape routes, etc.  We had a DM make the &quot;inner sanctum&quot; release a poison gas that the villian was immune to (Iocane powder anyone?), but which of course the PCs weren't.  This kicked in when a divination trigger sensed non bad guys in the room.  Of course, the undead he proceeded to summon didn't mine a little foul air.<br />
<br />
Under current (3E) CR rules, she would be CR 12 versus a CR 6 or 7 group and that would be considered a climatic encounter on the CR difference.  The power level difference between a 6 level and a 12 level caster is insane.  Just load her up with a broach of shielding to stop the magic missile zerg.  But you have to control the encounter.<br />
<br />
Having her raise as a ghost would fit the theme of the mod from what you have said nicely.  Except she is a ghost with Necromancer powers, and maybe a few bonuses.<br />
<br />
Heck, just have her evil-er twin sister appear and keeeeel them if you want to be super cheesy  <br />

Basically, the PCs move through time within the confines of this castle. They are in the middle time period. In the present time, this necromancer is a ghost, whether the PCs slayed her or not. She typically possess people(destroying their souls in the process) and attempts to complete the work assigned to her by her lord(her wannabee lover). It works perfectly, but, it doesn't give my PCs that hack n' slash satisfaction, nor does it give me any satisfaction to run a challenging combat encounter. But there were definetly draw backs to killing her for them, and depending on what I decide to do for next session, the monk might end up becoming her target, which would make 2 ghosts specifically gunning for him now.</div></div><hr />

Have one of the gems in her treasure be a Magic Jar that she stored her soul in.  Preferrably with Nystuls Magic Aura on it to disguise the type of magic involved.  The party then takes her along with them.  Meanwhile, ever so often, she attempts to DOMINATE the party members, or various other monsters.  If she is successful, she can wreak havok on the party from within, and maybe, if she is lucky and gets the cleric, cast Raise Dead on herself.</div></div><hr />

There are some minor issues like the monk not being able to cast anything out of that sphere, and the wizard will probably her spell book after they got rooting through her lab, but that is ok, I'm willing to bend a few rules this way, and they will think it's a pretty good twist. At least another session for the mod(I think we are up to......7? 8? I'm losing track. Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 7/27/03 10:24 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-28-03, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clairvoyance and any power that lets a party avoid walls (teleport, dimensional fold, stone to mud, super-tunnelling, or whatever) are always encounter wreckers.<br />
<br />
The way I dealt with them was either to disallow them entirely, or to make countermeasures realatively available (though expensive)<br />
<br />
One thing I did was make a house rule that precious metals (Copper, Silver, Gold) were magically inert.  It is part of what makes them valuable as currency, that they cannot be produced by magic.  A sufficient thickness of them (100mm of copper, 5mm of silver, or 1mm of gold.) wold block magical effects.  A magic barrier for an &quot;inner sanctum&quot; measuring 5mx5mx3m would require (4*5*3)+(2*5*5) 110 square meters of precious metal plate.  <br />
<br />
(assuming 100 coins to the kg, and 1:10:100 gp/sp/cp relationship)<br />
<br />
0.11 m^3 of gold (2123 kg) (212,300 gp)<br />
0.55 m^3 of Silver (5610 kg) (56,100 gp)<br />
11.0 m^3 of copper (99000 kg) (99,000 gp)<br />
<br />
Now, I didnt want this much money falling into the PCs hands too often, so I made another rule (that took care of tunnelling too) that natural stone still rooted in the earth (ie unworked, unmoved and still connected to bedrock) has a similar magic resistance if it is at least a meter thick.  If a person takes the time and effort to chip his stronghold (or part of it) out of a natural stone outcrop, he can avoid prying eyes/teleporters and such by installing high quality precious metal door/shutters over any openings.<br />
<br />
Anyway...  None of that helps you in your current situation.  I like Telurinon's idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-28-03, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm against disallowing entirely spells of that nature, they're an intergral part of fantasy, and Ethereal Travel and Astral Travel open too many possibilities for story to just eliminate. <br />
I'm thinking about jacking the level up on both Priest and Wizard ethereal and astral travel. My monk was like &quot;well, the priest ethereal is weaker than the wizard one, I can't go into the deep ethereal......&quot;. Right, you can still take the whole party with you, and go through walls. Not exactly a 3rd level spell in my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sillis Spineslicer</div><div class="date">07-28-03, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least add a hefty penalty to using them.  Travel spells should be a matter of convenience (teleporting across the planet) or a life or death need (getting out of the top level of a crumbling tower).<br />
<br />
We kind of had a gentleman's rule about them.  We knew if we abused them, we were screwed.  Remember, the bad guys have access to those spells too.  Who wants to have a group of mercenaries pop in EVERY friggin night at camp, or pop in at a bad time as reinforcements.<br />
<br />
Using them to circumvent the contents of a dungeon goes against their intent.<br />
<br />
OMG, I just realized I sound like SOE.     <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">07-28-03, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disallowing entirely isn't something I did a lot.  Tunnelling was about it, as it made the whole &quot;castle&quot; thing not work.  If someone can move through earth, or even solid stone, at a running pace and leave a tunnel behind them, it becomes way too easy to undermine structures.<br />
<br />
Another thing I disallowed was Invisibility and Desolidification working at the same time.  You could be one or the other, but not both.  Otherwise, it became way too easy to spy and/or rob anyone.<br />
<br />
Hero system is a lot more flexible than D&amp;amp;D spellwise, as it (theoretically) allows for any spell one can imagine to be constructed.  Gotta say &quot;no&quot; to some things in that case.<br />
<br />
Another way of preventing my players from doing anything too abusive was to simply tell them that if they do it, the NPCs can and will do it too, whatever &quot;it&quot; happens to be.  Your players, I am sure, would get pretty upset if 4 or 5 evil NPCs teleported into their bedroom just as they were going to sleep and killed them before they could even get an action in...<br />
<br />
Anyway.  D&amp;amp;D has always had spell power problems, IMO.  Some spells are just SO much better than others, even when some of those others are higher level.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the question is... If teleporting/dimensional folding/ethereal travelling into the heart of someone's stronghold and killing them before they can act is practical, how do kings/wizards/temples/wealthy merchants/such defend themselves against it?  There has to be a way, or else your world will fall into chaos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-28-03, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is why I'm getting semi burnt out on running this module. None of the setting is appropriate for these kinds of explanations, the castle is teh only one in the realm, the town is thatched houses, the whole genre is Celtic. The lord of the realm faces no supernatural/magic resistance to his rule, with the lame exception of 2 ninth level druids and a gaggle of lesser druids.<br />
<br />
Then here come PCs, with the full compliment of spells, strategy, and player deviousness. Oh sure, I could tell them that the walls are built around adamantium/electrum plating that prevents people from passing through in ethereal, but they would know that explanation for what it is, an attempt by the DM to restrict player options through setting as opposed to a house rule. And even if they didn't, the concept grates so badly with the module, I can't make myself want to do something like that. <br />
<br />
That's ok though. Over my vacation I wrote up stats for basically ring wraiths, apeearing 2-7 strong in each encounter. They temporarily drain levels, do about an average of 7 points of damage a hit, are 70% MR, have -3 ACs, have some rather nasty spells as spell abilities, and exist only in the ethereal and astral planes. The players have been traipsing around so much, I think the powers of Ravenloft are going to send their extraplanar watchdogs, because to it, the players look like they may try and escape Ravenloft in the Ethereal, and it just won't let that happen.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
You remove the commonality, but not the potential, for travel by that method. Merchants shouldn't have ethereal defenses and astral protection for less than 500,000 gold or more, every 6th lvl thief shouldn't be able to find a wizard to teleport them in. Armies can't effectively make use of most of the teleport spells, but that is why a massive Dimension Door spell is 9th lvl spell that only the most powerful wizards in the world are aware of, or capable of using. Of course this means extra leg work by the DM, compiling a list of problem spells, documenting their changes, letting players know, putting up with their bitching, but if it will make for a healthier, more sensible gameworld, and spare you the headaches spells like that cause, then it's worth the time.

I suppose in D&amp;amp;D, at least, you can control how common a spell is by just not having the scroll drop, and thus never having the spell available for scribing (unless 3rd ed has changed the need for magic users to scribe from an outside source)</div></div><hr />

Not in my game they don't. Priest classes get access to all spells, and don't have to memorize. Wizards have to find or learn every new spell.<br />
<br />
As for the adjustments to the availability to Teleport spells, I'm planning on it for my campaign, Castles Forlorn is a sort of crash test training course for doing my campaign. Alot of the stuff I talk about doing is going into that game, but staying out of this one to preserve the consistency. Players would be pretty pissed if it was like an MMO, log in one day and they've nerfed you to hell....AGAIN!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, teleportation, or dimensional travel, are simply not possible without hard and fast permanent structures.  Wizards can't just teleport when they want, they actually have to have a &quot;portal&quot; constructed.  And portals that allow travel to other worlds(there are 5 worlds in the campaign setting) aren't even buildable, they exist on the world from unknown builders(kinda like Stargate).<br />
<br />
And as far as scrying goes(not to mention teleporting even if you do have a portal).  I just use something called &quot;Wards&quot;.  I don't know if there in a book anyplace, I assume the are.  But I just allow any magic user so inclined to scrawl a bunch of fancy runes on walls and you can't scrye or teleport through them(unless your stronger than the magic user who made the wards).</div></div><hr />

Surely, some rooms they havn't been to might exist outside of time, only in a particular period, or be protected.<br />

Hrm... part of one of the towers could only be built in the very end future of the campaign, or the very beginning (having fallen off), stuff like that Sensei Pren,<br />

The ease of the mission was partially that, and partially the players making a good plan that worked well.<br />
<br />
   Let them have the easy win.  It will add meaning when things get rough.<br />
<br />
   I've been GMing for 22 years and I've almost never fudged things for the enemy.  I fudge things for the players alot if I stick them in an encounter I suddenly realize is overpowered and the players had no way of figuring it out.<br />
<br />
   I used to kill off players whenever the dice said so (I run mostly realistic games where no matter the player's level of power a single blow can fell them).  But now I only let them die if they do something they know is high risk and/or act foolishly.<br />
<br />
   In my opinion teleportation is just too useful.  The game gains alot of romanticism when you actually have to ride to deliver a message/or get somewhere on time.<br />
<br />
   In one of my recent games the gamemaster decided that when you teleported you were actually travelling, just on another plain where nasties roamed.  So every TP was a risk.<br />
<br />
   If overpowered items are a problem there are several solutions:<br />
<br />
   1. Pit them in adventures where their items are of less use.  Their +5 vorpal blade will do little good when on a diplomatic mission.<br />
<br />
   2. Items can be sacrificed to the gods.  Maybe the players have been cursed and items sacrificed to the offended god will clear the curse.<br />
<br />
   Another option is that players can sacrifice items to gain boons.  Sacrifice items to the god of wisdom for information on something.<br />
<br />
   Here's one possibilty.  After the players return to town to collect the X thousand gold piece reward for killing the ogre, dragon or whatever, they find that one of the party has already been in town to collect the reward.  After some investigation it becomes clear to the players that this person was a doppleganger.  At some future point this same doppleganger does other thing against the party or (better still) is linked to past events the players were never able to solve.  <br />
<br />
   After dealing with the mastermind doppleganger a while drop a hint about sacrificing items to the god of wisdom for information.  If this doppleganger is enough of a mastermind players will be sacrificing some good items.  When they finally face the doppleganger make the victory sweet for the players so they don't feel robbed.  Perhaps he's been impersonating a crown prince or something.  Maybe he escapes to lick his wounds but his plans of becoming king of X country are foiled.<br />
<br />
   3.  The players meet an item merchant (a wandering one they won't find again) who sells odd items (nothing normal).<br />
<br />
   This is basically giving the players a chance to trade items that give them raw power for items that give the players more interesting abilities that aren't found through normal spells or items.  Edited by: Iscin at: 8/17/03 6:20 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
-Simply told the Monk you can't over lap a ring and a pair of gauntlets, magic stacking is the first way people become uber.<br />
<br />
-Took his gauntlets of ogre power(+4/+6 damage) and gave him Gauntlets +2/+4 damage, crits on 19 or 20, effective as a +2 weapon. Still pretty uber, but I didn't want to nerf him unconditionally as a combat personality, the party tends to depend on him in the abscene of a real meat shield. <br />
<br />
If it's one thing I've kept telling my players, is that while this is a module, and they are running it to complete it, it IS still a training course in DMing for me, and a place where I can play with concepts and implement ideas without losing continuity in my own campaign world(what I ultimately care about). The fact the module is completely free form worked out well, I'm getting used to having to create NPCs, items, scenes, and plot twists in a matter of 2 minutes. <br />
<br />
I like your suggestion about teleportation, my brother did the same thing in suggesting that all TP spells act like 'the Ways' in Robert Jordan's books, where you must travel in a lightless void where there is always a good chance nasty @#%$ will get you. Althought I want some upper level TP spells to retain the full functionality, part of the romance of the hero story is power unimaginable. Can't take all that away from my players. What I AM going to do though is go through all spell lists and bump each TP spell that goes beyond 1000 ft or so and bump it at least 2 levels, adhere to material component use in TP spells, and add components if I think it's worth it. <br />
<br />
The single biggest problems with my players is that most. not all, of them revel in the fact they are hack n' slashers who enjoy a good story. They have no problem crapping on an NPC if mild diplomacy fails, because as long as they can defend themselves against something, they are ok doing it. Ticking off the king doesn't scare them, because they are full and ready to fight back when the guards come to arrest/kill them, and to die, because &quot;well they attacked us first....&quot;. I guess you could say they are a bunch of passive-aggressive mofos when it comes to NPC interactions. They've been plotting to kill the lord of the castle(who hired them) for almost......5 sessions now? Practically since they first met him. Last session, the wizard want to zip to his bedroom with TP and murder him, the Monk wanted to draw up a formal declaration of intent that Lord Marc is an evil bastard, so he would have something to present to an authority once they'd killed him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thoughts of player under Random Leaving:<br />
&quot;Will it take away my awakened +5 vorpal blade? or my wand of light healing with 3 charges left?&quot;  Do I really want to port and find out.<br />
<br />
Thoughts of a player under Purposefull item Burning:<br />
&quot;Yawn, another +1 dagger, better throw it in the sack for the next teleport spree we need.&quot; &quot;A dagger? cool, it looks like this Dead_minion_03 over here had some scrolls and potions, we're set for a couple days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Players can easily play around the &quot;limitations&quot; that purposefull item useage impliments, unless you make the requirement curve _really_ steep.  But then, why would you bother to even scribe the spell, when it takes a minimum of a +4 flamebrand just to dimension door, and it gets worse from there?<br />
<br />
The &quot;random item&quot; also gives you automatic &quot;well I really liked Item X, If nothing's pressing, lets go back and get Item X&quot; adventure hooks.<br />
<br />
Althought, under a &quot;random item&quot; scheme, your players can min/max thier chances by hanging onto a lot of those same +1 daggers, 3 charge healing rods, et all.  But there will always be that chance (and really, as a GM, YOU deside how big that sliver of a chance really is) that it takes thier +5 sword of doom. Ninen of Saryrn<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-20-03, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You just nailed my biggest problem, considering my players, with the Pay-For-Port system. They already stockpile items they don't use so they can use them as bribes and other sorts of whacky @#%$. <br />
<br />
Besides, as good of an idea that item for ports is, it doesn't make sense to me, in my vision of fantasy. I can understand destroying/disassembling items to get at the power inside, but casting a spell that just poofs an items seems......improbable and cheesy, to me. No offense intended. <br />
<br />
Now, gods on the other hand are a wonderful justification for taking stuff away. Want Zelthrak to grant you D-Door? He tells you to tithe your 4,000gp Warhammer+2 to the church, and the spell will be granted. Want Northrar to grant you command? Give him that flaming Longsword, tempered in your own blood, and it's yours. <br />
<br />
I'm rather thinking about requiring a special kind of contraption to make porting work. A small box, caringly prepared, worth between 1,000 and 10,000 a piece, that require very specific and rare components to construct. That way it takes time, effort, and intrest to get to port, not just &quot;I hit 8th level, now I can start sacking items.&quot; Not only does it make for good side adventures, but it also consumes the party's time, and most players I have would just say &quot;let's walk&quot; if faced with a possible 2 session side track just to get ONE port spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">08-21-03, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A sack of weak items doesn't equal a single powerful one.<br />
<br />
What I was thinking is that the wizard, when casting teleport, has to hold forth the item that is to power the spell.  The single item.  A +1 dagger might move you 100 yards.  A sack of +1 daggers will move you 100 yards a whole lot of times, though you will have to recast teleport a whole lot of times too.  If you want to jump across a continent in a single bound, you will need a single item of considerably more power.  After the spell is cast, the item doesnt just &quot;poof&quot;, it is simply drained of all of its magical power.  A +1 dagger would become a normal dagger, a wand of eensyheals would become, basically, a stick, etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or... to extend your component box idea, have one of the ingredients be a bit of matter (or what have you) closely associated with the destination.   If one wants to teleport from Seattle to Miami, one will need a bit of soil from Miami.  And where, exactly, in Miami the teleport deposits the wizard depends on just where in Miami the bit of soil came from.  This will retain a lot of the usefulness of teleport for quick travel, but will remove a lot of its usefulness as an assassination tool.  Unless you can get someone to give you something from the Necromancer's bed chamber, you won't be able to teleport there just as the Necromancer is drifting off to sleep and assassinate him.  <br />
<br />
Many other possibilities present themselves if this component need is adopted.  Thieves become pathfinders for teleporting wizards.  They sneak in and steal something from where the wizard (and anyone else he is bringing along) wants to go.  Quite the trade might develop in dirt, too, as high level wizards amass carefully labelled collections from around the world.  A nasty trap for those wizards might be put in place when some rival of theirs manages to secretly replace the contents of one or more of his dirt vials with dirt from someplace much less pleasant than was previously in it.  Its a nasty shock when one thinks he is teleporting to Peoria to see his sister, but, in fact, shows up in a dragon's lair. Woe unto the wizard who doesnt collect his own dirt, for he doesnt really KNOW that it comes from where he is told it comes from!<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to be even more restrictive, have any matter that has been magicked lose its previous associations.  So the mage teleporting from Seattle to Miami cant bring any Seattle dirt with him to teleport back with, or a group that has manages to steal something from the Necromancer's bechamber might be able to teleport in, but wont be able to teleport back out.  Unless their thief snuck in a second time (!) bringing something along that has an outside association.<br />
<br />
Line of sight teleports, would, of course, require no destination component. (though clairvoyant LOS probably shouldnt count)</div></div><hr />

100 yards is plenty for alot of your teleport needs.  Getting around walls, deadfalls, across rivers, into strongholds etc.  Long distance travel is what portal networks are for.<br />

Sure she was a 12th level necromancer, versus 6 average of 6th level PCs. Of course she was going to lose. A single caster type(i.e. not bitching armor class or HP) is not a viable encounter for a party of 6 with the full compliment of healing, meele and magic. Just isn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I've no idea how you play a caster in your games, but I assure you that a lvl 12 wizard would wipe a lvl 6 group no matter what.<br />
<br />
Surprise wouldn't be the party's best chance, it'd be their only chance to live a while longer  <br />
<br />
And of course there are so many ways to prevent surprise for a lvl 12 mage....<br />
<br />
Contingeny for one.<br />
<br />
But even in that case I just don't see a high lvl mage going around w/o some useful defensive spells.<br />
<br />
Any caster I play, as a player or DM will never be w/o an armor spell or a stoneskin, those are under the &quot;good morning spells&quot; list.<br />
<br />
I just looked at one lvl 11 mage I had....<br />
<br />
Armor (improved ac 2)<br />
Enchnted Tattos (5% MR +1 AC +1 saves)<br />
Stoneskin (enhanced 7 + 1d4)<br />
Know Alignment (reversed) you're never careful enough when you're NE in a group with a LG fanatic priest  <br />
<br />
Contingeny - Dimension Door<br />
Persistence - Fostered Protection+36% MR (a 3rd lvl priest spell, from planescape)<br />
<br />
Semipermanent effects<br />
Detect Magic<br />
Protection From Evil/Good (another +2 to ac here)<br />
Invisibility (can turin invisible at will w/ +3 initiative)<br />
Detect Invisibility (just in case)<br />
Fear (as a gaze effect, counts as action for the round, but still useful)<br />
Protection from normal missiles (some heroes still don't have magical arrows)<br />
<br />
Add a few priest spells here and there, as she was also a priest (muticlass fighter/mage/priest)<br />
<br />
As a mage her base ac was 1 when surprised and -3 with dex bonus and that's w/o even a +1 protection ring, at the end of the campain the only thigs she had were a +1 long sword and a +2 short sword, but of course as a DM I'd equip here with a +4 protection ring at least, what's the THACO on that monk ? ^_^<br />
<br />
All that is of course if you meet her in the field, try to walk inside here house and I guarantee that a lvl 6 group won't even get past the gates.<br />
<br />
The weakest guardians I used were enlarged skeletons<br />
AC 3 Hp 9 thac0 19 att 1 Dmg 2d6 that took 1/2 damage from melee attacks (on top of normal skeleton resistances) regenerated 1d4 hits every other round were invisible while not attacking and projected a 20' fear effect.<br />
<br />
They'd just hope to never meet the Bone Golem in the next room  <br />
<br />
Yep, I'm crazy and spend too much time to make enemies unbeatable, but my players usually attack everything they see, and I have to teach them otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a finaly note I always tell my players that they can use any spell they want (from official books) and all those that I approve from anywhere else.<br />
Of course NPCs will do the same thing.<br />
<br />
That might be why no one uses instant death spells in my campains (Disintegrations, Power word kill, Death spells) ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-23-03, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">She had defensive spells, a 6d6 blood lightning attack that denotated when someone hit her, death armor, spirit armor, the works. She just couldn't have done it. She had a 4d6+4 30' beam attack, didn't get to cast that either. He had spells that would have imprisoned PCs in a force bubble for TURNS. Didn't get to use that. <br />
<br />
I understand that I could make whatever I wanted to allow her to live, but when my PCs did more than 3x her &quot;relative hps'(i.e. where I think they should be as opposed to what the mod said they were) I have a hard time letting her live. My PCs can do basic math, so they would have known what was up. But I see your point, I was more focused on the actual batle with her than contingency plans for PCs being clever. I'm trying to rectify that when I play my encounters now.(the start of the next session is them on top of the roof of the tallest keep, battling what is essentially lesser-greater-wolfwere. To add spice to it, d6 goblin crossbow men shooting at them every round, random goblin adds every other round past the first 2 rounds of combat, AND, after 8 rounds, 1d10 goblins come to the roof every round there after. It's going to be a god damn bloodbath. If my PCs don't do something besides kill @#%$ this time, they are going to die. It's probably the one time I WANT them to use spells like Ethereal and Dimensional Folding, otherwise they will be diving off a 130' tower, and a 600-700 foot cliff.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Alderic</div><div class="date">08-23-03, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have no idea what Death and spirit armor do, but I didn't really care much about necromancers, I'm usually happy with the base Animate Death spell, and even then I use skeletons since zombies are so damn ugly.<br />
<br />
Casters should in general be prepared for just about anything, Especially at higher level when they have a good number of spells.<br />
They live and die by their spells, and not having the right one ready can mean death.<br />
They're also very dead if they have to engage in melee (my fire elementalist Alderic was the only exception, under skills and powers rules he had expertise with the long sword, and his sword scared away an army of trolls better than all of his fire spells.... thac0 15 2 misses per round for 1d8+1, but no one ever said trolls were smart ^^)<br />
When everything else fails, have an escape rounte ready, with just 1 day of time a wizard can be a completely different opponent, if you don't know what to expect prepare for as many different things as you can and then memorize a lot of getaway spells (from invisibilty, to spider climb, to dimension doors to teleports)<br />
And finally, Permanency is not that expensive after all, for a necromancer with magic jar and some minions  <br />
<br />
And the players shouldn't have been able to deal so much damage to her no matter what, a simple ring of spell turning, and a stoneskin would have prevented all the damage of the first round.<br />
No player in my campain is surprised when they first attack a powerful enemy, roll to hit, and I just nod when they tell me how much damage they dealt w/o writing anything.... they're more worried when I do actually, those of them that know what Kinetic Control is  <br />
<br />
A few notes about your next encounter:<br />
<br />
&quot;To add spice to it, d6 goblin crossbow men shooting at them every round&quot;<br />
<br />
Make sure they can't reach them easily, a x-bow man is quite dead in melee.<br />
Also, unless you plan to have them equipped with multiple loaded x-bows, and also use players option rules or some house rules x-bows deal some 1d4 damage and attack slowly, short bows would be much better (2 attacks per round and better damage) if the range is short enough you may also think about throwing darts, 3 attacks per round and your players won't be surprised if there is a mild poison on it, even a -1 to hit, with increased dizziness will make them wonder if they're falling unconscious.<br />
<br />
And I think goblins can take some levels as thieves ^_^<br />
<br />
Mean enough ? if not I can think of something else <br />
<br />
&quot;otherwise they will be diving off a 130' tower, and a 600-700 foot cliff&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember when I talked about spider climb, fly and maybe even polymorph self ? <br />
<br />
&quot;The brave caster, that could change into a dragon and carry everyone off, turns into a flying squirrel and hops down....&quot;</div></div><hr />

I don't want the crossbows to be over kill, just enough to make them just that more nervious, to add some damage for the fight with the werewolf. They have thac0s of 13, so they will hit often enough. And the strength of goblins(these are Ravenloft Goblyns) isn't in their individual abilities, at least not in this situation. It's about their sheer numbers and their easy access to where the party is fighting. Not going to need backstab. It isn't exactly an encounter I want them to 'win'. They can kill the werewolf, take his weapon, but the goblyns are going to mob them, so they need to do something else. <br />
<br />
The point is I want them to use their spells and abilities to get out of the situation, rather than subvert some of the paradigms the mod sets up(they used ethereal to enter the castle the first time, and they have already tried to scale towers from the outside). I'm actually rather hoping they leave the castle entirely for a little while, it would be nice to have some flexibility for the adventure, they've been in the castle with all it's pre-set setting for like 7 sessions now.</div></div><hr />

   The kobold caves were a labrynth of twisting corridors, some too small for humans to move through, and moving in all directions.  We were always getting lost.

These would include (with varying strength dependent on the level of the caster):<br />
<br />
-Having lots and lots of cannon fodder to throw at potential nemeses while they beat a hasty exit and find reinforcements<br />
-Casting permanent versions of various protective spells such as &quot;Protection from Normal Missiles&quot; &quot;Protection from MAGICAL Missiles&quot; and so on and so forth (its easy to create this kind of magic, fewl).<br />
-Placing alarm spells in vulnerable sections of the evil-person's stronghold or creating areas of dimensional shielding that prevent direct teleportation (thou shalt not gimpify thine encounters!).<br />
-Being REALLY good at spotting potential threats before they even notice that evil_person_01 is creating assorted strife and grief, and taking steps to make certain that these potential threats are prevented from having any form of edge over him/her. (&quot;New guy in town... looks like a paladin... whoa, is that a Holy Avenger on his back? Holy crap... get this guy under surveillance now! I want to know what color this guy's crap is when he takes his morning dump, YOU GOT THAT mister Thieves' Guildleader?! I ain't payin' ya to play poker all day, ya know...&quot;)<br />
<br />
It would also be useful to consider a modified version of teleport from The Elder Scrolls. The dynamics of TES teleport is that you have to set a teleportation anchor (requires one casting of teleport, which is noticeable in its own right) before you can perform the actual teleportation. For the sake of difficulty, make this anchor radiate an aura of magical energy, detectable by a single casting of detect magic... and make it also subject to dispulsion... or better yet... movement...<br />
<br />
Player: I cast teleport into her bedroom! I set the anchor earlier today!<br />
GM: You sure?<br />
Player: Yup! And I bring everybody else with me!<br />
GM (snickering): You appear in the middle of a jail cell. The captain of the town guard glares at you and says &quot;Illegal Entry Into a Private Household! Good for a few weeks in this cell. Don't bother trying to argue your way out of it, when Evil_Person_01 discovered your portal anchor, she shuffled it down here and told us that somebody had set up an illicit entrance to her household, with the possible intention of causing her harm! We're a law abiding city, and we will NOT tolerate such disrespect for the law!&quot;<br />
Paladin associate player: Crap, now I'll haveta atone...<br />
<br />
All it takes is a little improvisation, sirs.   'Cuz I'm Psycho Like That...</div></div><hr />
