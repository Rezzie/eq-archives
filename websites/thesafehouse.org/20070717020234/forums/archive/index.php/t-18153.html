<br />
This is my first time posting here at Safehouse, though I have been lurking about since my EQ days. :)<br />
<br />
I've got a question regarding builds (please dont flog me!)<br />
I have been looking through alot of the builds and I can hardly find any that include riposte... I love this skill, and would like to include it into a nice solid build... I am also interested in going the stunlock route.. is it impossible to combine these two into one build?<br />
<br />
Any advice, or suggested builds is greatly appriciated! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try 21/30, or 20/31, which has become semi popular in my guild since the seal fate fix.<br />

You can and should include riposte in your combat skills. Also grab improved kick and a weapon spec (your choice, mace/dagger/sword, each has their own advantages). The difference between the two is adrenaline rush vs cold blood. I've heard good things about adren. rush (ss spam for the win) and cold blood is a game over button usually, although if you miss it hurts. I'd say take adren rush if you are going maces or swords, cold blood if daggers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could I get a breakdown for those builds?<br />
<br />
I am also going daggers, just something about how I perceive rogues! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that i've thought about it a bit more, 21/30 or 20/31 would be more idealy suited for maces or swords. I've never had a dagger build so i'm not an expert, but key talents i'd suggest getting are:<br />
<br />
Assassination:<br />
Imp evis<br />
Malice<br />
Lethality<br />
Ruthlessness<br />
Relentless strikes<br />
Vile poisons (very nice for daggers because poisons go off so often)<br />
Cold blood<br />
<br />
Combat:<br />
Imp Gouge<br />
Imp backstab<br />
Imp ss (for the 2 points more then anything)<br />
Deflection - Riposte <br />
Precision<br />
Dagger spec<br />
imp kick<br />
<br />
Thats 51 right there. You might also try a combat/subtlety build that includes opportunity and imp ambush and some others, but i'll let someone else mention that since i'm no dagger expert.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niehaus</div><div class="date">04-12-05, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm am in the process of building a mace rogue and have had great success with Riposte. I haven't had a chance to experiment with the mace specialization I only have 2 points in it at the moment and the maces I intend to use I can't wield for another level, but here's my build thus far.<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
3 Improved Eviscerate<br />
2 Malice<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
2 Improved Sinister Strike<br />
3 Lightning Reflexes<br />
5 Deflection<br />
1 Riposte<br />
5 Precision<br />
4 Dual Wield Specialization<br />
2 Mace Mastery<br />
<br />
Subtlety<br />
1 Master of Deception<br />
<br />
I plan to eventually max out all the abilities listed above and add the following abilities<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
2 Murder<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
3 Aggression<br />
1 Adrenaline Rush<br />
<br />
Subtlety<br />
5 Camouflage<br />
<br />
I'm going to take a point away from either Lightning because or Duel Wield Specialization to get the point for Adrenaline Rush I haven't decided which yet.<br />
<br />
I put the points into subtlety because I've been having movement and detection problems in pvp, but if you wanted you could take those points and put them on the Assassination chart in order to use Cold Blood.  I have a buddy whose and Assassination Rogue and he's dealing and average of 500 per crit with Sinister Strike and 1000 with Eviscerate at level 40. But since the stun lock is what I'm going for I went with Subtlety for a better chance of starting the battle with Cheap Shot in pvp.<br />
<br />
I have been having a lot of trouble with Warlocks lately I'll Cheap Shot them and then they'll summon there Succubus and Charm me giving them time to move away and then hit me with a Damage over time spell to keep me from Vanishing, which is pretty much game.  I don't know if Improved Kick will help that out or not but if it does I'm definitely going to rework some things to get it. Man this was a long post sorry about that.</div></div><hr />

I've gotta ask why do you say daggers -&gt; cold blood?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">04-21-05, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Broadly speaking, a Dagger-based build will be heavy in Assassination and/or Subtlety, whereas a Sword/Mace build will be heavy in Combat.  Given that, it generally leads to Cold Blood making more sense for Daggers.  As always, though, it's all about personal playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaevola</div><div class="date">04-24-05, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm ok.  I'm heavy into combat and u duel daggers as I've dumped a lot in to crit back stabs and dual wield and riposte.   Guess its time to change builds.  I was going for adrenlin currently have 28 in combat 5 in sublety (stealth 5) and like 2 in assination</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengel Tyger</div><div class="date">04-26-05, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to change cuz of what we suggest.  He was just pointing out that most dagger rogues are Assassination heavy or Subtlety Heavy.  If you have fun with what you currently have, then it may be whats best for you.</div></div><hr />
