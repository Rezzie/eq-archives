thanks<br />

 Your signature is still to large to display, bot file size and dimension.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masema Dagar</div><div class="date">01-07-06, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*to site moderators* sorry bout the sig ... thought you guys removed it. gone now. And just to make sure... 200x500 for sig ok?<br />
                                                          <br />
                                                *sob* its so small now....<br />
<br />
Edit:  It's also still too big at over 27kb - 19.5kb is the limit for both a sig and avatar together, though if you can get it to 20k I (and probably the other moderators) will let it slide. - Ruc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">01-07-06, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aww :) Make a new, smaller, easy to read one. Or just use a text sig and an avatar.<br />
 <br />
&lt;---- It's all about the avatars, baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masema Dagar</div><div class="date">01-07-06, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">apparantly..... i had it at like 350x150 and a quality of 1 and its still too big.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its 15.5k  your avatar is 3.5 so your should be setting at 19... just under the file size limit.  and its 400x200 so it they might want it not as tall but at least its a small file now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-08-06, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think just the &quot;If your signature is larger than your post, Aidden will beat you with a stick&quot; rule will apply :lol<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if Aidden still has the sig rules defaulted to off since the forum update but if you're just posting a one sentence reply to something, don't use the sig, but if you've got a few paragraphs it should be fine.  Also remember the one sig per thread rule too.<br />
<br />
Soulstealer, try shrinking it vertically by 25% or 30%.  On my computer I did it to see what it looks like and I personally think it looks better, but I just use MSPaint which popped the file size back up to 23kb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Masema Dagar</div><div class="date">01-08-06, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow thank you soulstealer... might i ask how you made it so small? i was havin probs getting it below like 30</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulstealer</div><div class="date">01-08-06, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c348/super_geek2/evennewersig.jpg<br />
<br />
i took Ruccus advice and shrunk it vertically by 25%,  then did some little tricks and got it to like 12k. Just some playing around with settings in photoshop, the color palette, progressive, matte...  i guess i'm just used to doing it to get image footprints as small as they can go so the sites i work on load fast.</div></div><hr />
