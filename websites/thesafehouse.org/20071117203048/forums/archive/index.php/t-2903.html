I've got a suscription to the comic and I've got to say I enjoy it quite a bit.  I think the ending of the last story line was a little rushed but still great.   Glip the Gnome<br />

<br />
First problem is, there seems to be less comics per issue and more hackmaster rules.  Which just plain sucks, cause I don't care about the actualy game they made and are trying to sell me.<br />
<br />
Second, it stopped being funny cause it's the same damn joke week after week.<br />
<br />
Brian abuses rules, Bob bitches all the time and B.A. gets driven insane.  Haha, was great at first but the thing never changes.<br />
<br />
The Black Hand ones are more fun for me than the knights cause they at least a bit different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats kind of been bugging me too.  In the last issue they said they were going to cut back on it though and go back to the comics (apparantly we weren't the only people noticing it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, if Hackmaster is successful perhaps they should go to a Rifter (tm) style supplement for their gaming product.<br />

I love KoDT. I've been collecting since issue #14.<br />

And what the heck is up with the latest issue, &quot;Along Came a Drider&quot; anyways? Why is there no continuity of plot?<br />

I totally forgot the repetitive strips about how when the group beats a dragon, the bigger - meaner - beserking mate comes in to attack.<br />

The Head of Vecna was also funny. But that was a feature not a cartoon</div></div><hr />

I personally read mine from Glip's brother, but anyway, I particularly like the one where they buy all the livestock, and use it when exploring a dungeon.. sorry dont know the name<br />

          &quot;throw another chicken, I forgot to<br />
             accomodate for wind resistance&quot;<br />

<br />
The cattle one was good, I also really like the one where Brian gets in a whine tasting contest with Old Rot Gut and the one where Dave keeps getting his arms cut off in the trap  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the recent storylines, I really hope they get to play the Untouchable Trio +1 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Wartren</div><div class="date">03-24-02, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok then, I guess I read mine from glip via his brother... is that better?</div></div><hr />
