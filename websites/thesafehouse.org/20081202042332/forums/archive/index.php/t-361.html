<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_JoonLingShadowStryker</div><div class="date">06-05-00, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that is the question of the hour.  I am here to tell you that I, Joonling, did make the mistake of killing my friend.  It was all quite innocent I tell you!<br />
<br />
Duelist No. #1 : Lvl 10 bard<br />
Duelist No. #2 : Lvl 17 Rogue<br />
<br />
We were fooling around in NRO as I was powerleveling her (yes, Rogues can powerlevel surprisingly enough) when we decided that we should like to try and duel just for the hell of it.  We were near the Barbarian fishing village to start and right away I made mistake No 1.  I accidently targeted the male barb and backstabbed him for 47 points.  That angered him and he charged after me.  I ran away laughing, forgetting that my dueling partner was standing there.  He attacked her but was green to her as well.  We ended up killing him together, her getting the killing blow, and some xp.  Right away we started to fight again.  I kept hitting her and got her down to half a bub of life without losing any of my own.  Then I made mistake No. 2.  I let her heal as I wandered around (I had no intention of killing her) when she hit me from behind (proof that bards are more roguish than anything).  We were near a guard.  He took off running  after her.  She zoned and I won that duel.   So, after getting her to full health again we decided to try once more.  The same thing happened with me getting her down to half a bub of life with no loss of my own ... even when I stopped attacking her and let her hit on me (even with chords of dissonance she couldn't hurt me go figure).  I kept backstabbing her (from the front) so she wasn't losing much life.  That's when mistake No. 3 happened.  She turned unexpectedly and my dagger slid between her ribs and I pierced her lung.  Dead within seconds.  Whoops.  *shrugs*  It was all in fun.  This was last week.  I have been challenged to duel her again.  <br />

Tomorrow night my guild is having a meeting and we always end up dueling afterwards.  I mean when else are we all present for slaughter?  Heheh.  Funny thing though ... there is a much anticipation duel between Loud Mouth from the South Paladin and Painfully Sexy Kick Your Ass Monk.  I was hired by both for a nice fee to backstab the other!  I am going to have soooo much fun! Joonling<br />

Myself and a few members of my old guild where tearing into each other, having a good time.  A level 9 enchanter(who I didnt know was in the room until after I wasted her) stepped into the arena behind me.  As I circled around my opponent I got the dreaded strafe target change and hit my backstab button before I realized it.  <br />
<br />
My target had changed to the poor enchanter. My backstab hit for 145 and then a quad round and she fell on the ground deader than a doornail.   <br />

The first duel none of my procs were going off and I kept missing my stabs.  The second time I interrupted his spells and my blood claw went off three times within a few seconds.  I watched as he went from full health to a bub in under a minute. He yelled &quot;S*&amp;amp;$&quot; and took off running.  Though this was in fun I suddenly had hunter's instincts take over and I raced after him despite the fact I was snared.  He kept trying to invis himself but I would catch up to him and bs him.  I nearly killed him but stopped suddenly as I realized he was a good friend and how near death.  Then he gated and I won the duel anyway   Joonling <br />
