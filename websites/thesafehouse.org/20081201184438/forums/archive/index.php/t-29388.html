 1st, go to the Strand of the Ancients on Qualia, up to the top of a large hill to get to the Pantheon itself. In front there should be a very large stone that looks different than the rest of the wall. You have to /say &quot;Nar'issk&quot; and the stone will dissapear. Inside this newly exposed room is a large area with steps and a pillar on your right. Go behind the pillar and there is a stone that is pressed in. Click this stone and the stairs will split and open and let your group go down into the tomb. You will come to a 4-way crossroad that splits of straight and to each side. To the left is the &quot;bad side&quot;, or Tyrashnira's Lair. To the right is the &quot;good side&quot;, or the Chamber of Purification. Straight ahead is another T-junction that goes left and right again, to the pathways above the afformentioned chambers of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. In each of those chambers, on the ground floor, is 6 alcoves, 3 on each side of the chamber. Each alcove has an NPC with a quest, or &quot;trial&quot;. You go to each of these alcoves on both the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; side, completing each and every trial (trial info available at silkyvenom.com, under the wiki section, search for Pantheon). When you complete all 6 on either side, you can go back up to the pathways and find the corrisponding NPC to that side. If you've completed all 6 of the trials on their side, they will give you a final quest to turn in the &quot;marks&quot; you earned from those trials to recieve one of the two pieces to the cloak. Once you have both pieces from both sides, you can click on either piece to combine them into the Cloak of the Pantheon. Once you have this, you can go in the back of the tomb to the Immortal Sanctum. Here, talk to the Attendant and he will start a boss fight against &quot;The Sisters&quot;, the Avatars of Mara and Caia. During this fight the sisters will put nasty DoT's on your entire party, but you can dispell them by activating the Cloak of the Pantheon. After the fight, the Orb of the Eternal Flame will spawn on the pedestal in the middle of the room. If you talk to the Attendant again he will give you a key, but you must give him your new shiny cloak to get it. After you have a key, run up to the Orb and click it. Your reward will be random, ranging from a piece of armor to any one of the Legendary weapons posted above. The reward is not set for any one class, and a lot of times you'll wind up with a piece of armor that you cant use. If you're lucky enough to get a Legendary, they are Bindable *overjoy* so you can trade back and forth amongst your party so they find good homes. If you don't like what you've gotten, GOOD NEWS!! You can go back through and do all 12 trials again to get another cloak, sacrifice it for another key, and another shot at a Legendary!<br />
<br />
Now, in the Test Server patch notes, it is stated that the Orb of Eternal Flame will always be spawned. This means that you will no longer have to do the Sisters encounter to have a shot at a Legendary.<br />

Happy delving ;-)</div></div><hr />

Infuriate does not modify any visible stat in any way.  My guess is that it's a short term Haste buff, but that's a complete guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to kill the two Sisters EVERY TIME you go in to sacrifice the cloak. After the Sisters encounter, Ili-Hut(sp) will turn in to Alucard(sp) and offer the key in exchange for the cloak. Also, patch said that now, when you click on the Orb with the Key, you receive a Cache of the Eternal Flame. This guarantees that at least one of the items in the cache will be usable for you :thumb , so no more of those clothies getting plate legs =).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Items<br />
- Gift of the Prince's proc effect, Infuriate, has been modified. It continues to increase melee damage caused by 20%, but now also decreases the time between auto-attacks by 20% as well as adding an amount of hate to your offensive target on behalf of your defensive target. The hate adding portion of the effect will not fire if you are your own defensive target. The proc rate and duration of the effect has been reduced.<br />
- The drop rate of intact essences has been increased for all types.<br />
<br />
So great for solo, bad for groups is what I get outta that. Neat!</div></div><hr />

I get the exact opposite. I always have the main tank as my defensive target, giving him hate is exactly what I like to do. Does look great for solo, but near amazing for groups. Plus if I remember correctly it is the best dagger (DPS) til Greystone. Correct me if I am wrong please.<br />
