<br />
So blah.  Here it is!  I'd love to hear all the best stories, summed up campaigns, funny incidents, particularly cleaver traps or plot twists or item/spell usage, all the things that make D&amp;amp;D great and terribly memorable.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I usually DM, so heres our set up ..<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
The group I play with are the most cut throat people imagineable.  Our concept of adventure usually consists of who can screw over the others on loot enough to rise to be the most powerful one in the party ... at which point they realize they're the most powerful, attempt to kill everyone else to steal THEIR items, and then usually the campaign ends with everyone dead and one person rocking back and forth, laughing atop a pile of treasure.  To put it in to prespective, we actually have a looting skill, meaning after all the baddies are dead a roll is made to see who gets to the corpses first so that they can get their hands on whatever shiny items their victims may have possesed before anyone else has a chance.<br />
<br />
Its really not as frustrating as it sounds, and since I DM and usually work this predictable behavior in.  Their blinding greed has lead to some terribly amusing times.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, I kick off the first story:<br />
<br />
Our adventurers had just left a vally that they had been in all their lives.  They were &quot;forbidden&quot; to leave this vally from birth, and it wasnt so much of a vally as a circle of mountains with a constant and heavy cloud over head.  The mountains were deemed unscaleable and also very unsafe, as the bodys of missing villagers dropping suddenly out of the cloudy overcast had not been an uncommon occurance ... smelling of ozone and burnt heavily, sometimes half eaten.<br />
<br />
So it had been obvious that braving the mountains to get out wasn't the right idea, and the hints I litterally &quot;dropped&quot; to keep them from going that way they easily picked up on.  So they did some snooping, some reasearch, and played it well enough so that they found the old &quot;hidden tunnel&quot; that first let people into the vally.  After a couple of fights they were on the outside.<br />
<br />
The outside was a very arid desert.  Unfamiliar with the terrain (and my not so subtle hint that my campaign revolved around the vally) they pressed on, driven by the idea that DESERT = MUMMYS = GOLD.  Of course I hadn't planned for anything like this, but I threw them a crypt that was completely devoid of treasure, plus a not so angry mummy to boot (he was a mummy but not an undead mummy, and just layed limp as our heros stabbed him to ... uh ... more death).  Along with several rather easy to spot and easy to avoid traps that they didn't manage to find, and subsequently fell into/were burned by/got crushed under.  Scouting = waste of time to them usually, which is why we have a new campaign every time we play  :<br />
<br />
After the unsucessful venture, they were tired, weary, and annoyed that they left the vally at all.  But instead of turning back, they pressed on.<br />
<br />
And now it gets fun.<br />
<br />
About a weeks journey out they come upon an oasis.  Our group consisted of a warrior, a warrior and a cleric.  Hardly balance, and they never had a thought of scouting anywhere, they tramped headlong into it.  But by pure luck it was empty at the time, the sun was high in the sky and whatever lived in the area were seemingly in caves or underground.  They took some water and looked around.  They noticed HUGE prints on the ground, some from an animal none of them could identify, and some they could.  Ogre prints were here (way out of place, no one noticed), along with a few gold pieces.<br />
<br />
Infused by the sight of gold, they took to scouting around the area.  They located a rather massive and stinky cave, into which one of the warriors was sent to look ahead.  There, on the ground, with his back &quot;fortunatly&quot; turned to the warrior, was a massive sleeping giant.  The cave obviously held riches, as there were lower quality items such as statues and torn paintings and silver scattered about the shallow parts of the cave.<br />
<br />
Our heros, being the wonderfuly predictable people they are (and perfectly capable of being able to kill a lone giant by this time I might add) gather back at the entrance, form a quick and not so subtle attack, and move in.  The giant doesnt hear their approch, or feel their swords jab into the back of his head as they think they've come upon an easy victory and riches galore.  But I smiled as they realized something was wrong and moved around to the other side of the sleeping brute.<br />
<br />
Only to realize there was no other side.  Something had eatten everything out of the front side of the giant, leaving basicly an empty husk of a giant, of which they only saw the back and smelled the smell.<br />
<br />
They didnt even try to run as the brown dragon came into the room and started to slaughter them.<br />
<br />
My friends now scout ahead, and one always plays a sneaker</div></div><hr />
