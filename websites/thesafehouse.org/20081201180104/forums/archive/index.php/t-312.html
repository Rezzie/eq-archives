<br />
I got my mask this evening. It took me two weeks of off-and-on camping. However this past Friday night I went down there and said to myself I wouldn't leave until I got it. The problem was that the assassin is hardly ever camped on my server (Vallon Zek). <br />
<br />
Tonight (Sunday) I managed to get lucky. I had been starting to go delerious looking at that Loch Ness monster shaped green slime on the wall near the ladder up to the SR. Or is it the stain from Gumby when he was slain by the frogs? I dunno.. I'm tired. This whole weekend I was popping in and out to see if the assassin had spawned. Good news is that I got my alternate character up three levels. Bad news is that I finally got the mask tonight, right before bed time for work tomorrow. I'll stop rambling.. I really am tired.<br />
<br />
I popped in, the assassin was up. I asked everyone I knew that had ever given me an inkling of a reason to think they'd let me loot the mask. Nada. Finally I worked out a plan to have an inkie hunting in LGuk pretend that his human rogue was camped there for the mask. That way folks might not mind if he looted it. I played my alternate while the plan was set into motion. Well I got restless after about 30 minutes (I really thought THIS assassin was the one) and logged back in as my rogue. Oof... folks upstairs in the store room?!?! I really thought I missed my chance... so hell, I said, might as well see who had beaten me to the punch (again). Behold... the assassin's corpse was sitting there with a bunch of evils meditating around it. Ninja loot-&gt; rehide-&gt; jump-&gt; BAM. I had a Mask of Deception.<br />
<br />
I must say it was definitely done in the style of a true rogue although my game etiquette was a tad unsat. Turns out they were waiting for a younger evil guildmate to make his way down and loot the mask. Sorry pal, two weeks of staring at slime on a wall will do that to a rogue.<br />

now if only those lazy-assed, rich-on-us basturd Verdamt programmers would implement that your name changes too on wearing the mask, to a pet name for example, this would be great for unimpeded Nariak solo raids of yours heheheee <br />

I must say though, after spending a full day in Neriak (after doing the red wine quest about 200 times at the third gate), that mask i a real god send.  I didnt realise how fantastic the DE city is... it is deffinatly the best city in the game.  I like bar with windows that look out 'underneath' a lake, i like even better swimming in that lake and looking through the glass to the startled patrons inside.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if my half elf faction can ever be adjusted with the inkies.  With my mask on, I went from KOS to amiably from the red wine quest (200 times.. pah!!) but without the mask I am very much still KOS (as I found out while wandering the city after I forgot to put it on after a zone)<br />
<br />
Still... if you have the means, I reccomend getting your faction up so you can wander this amazing city. Unfetered One Shadow Stalker Of Norrath and Warden of InnoruukEdited by Unfetered  at: 4/1/00 12:46:16 pm</div></div><hr />

BTW, i have a question. Everytime i do it, it used to give me faction with the dreadguards inner and outer, now it only gives me faction with dark barganiers. Do i have to do something special?</div></div><hr />

This theory, created by me on the embellishment of another theory, states that faction is gained like in a Vial, then consumed by the user. You can only fill the Vial but so full, however, so at times, you need to empty the Vial to start drinking again.<br />
<br />
IE. If you're not getting faction, die to a member of the faction, and start workin again. Or maybe you just have to die. Dunno.<br />

BTW, ghouls guarding the Lodge work on Dark Bargainers/Dread Inner faction. Ratraz the troll works on Dark Bargainer faction. Woof woof woof!<br />
