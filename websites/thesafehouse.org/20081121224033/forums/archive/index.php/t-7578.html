Please any advise is welcome.  What can I do to make our up coming duel decisive.  It will probably occur in the arena with an audience.  And there will not be any rules.  We both have our epics btw.<br />
<br />
Things I've considered so far ..<br />
Vampire blood<br />
Snare and blind poisons<br />
single charge root items <br />
I will have MR at 100 unbuffed plus will use the vampire blood ...  What else?  <br />

Also make sure you have MR over 100 or so and bring pumice with you to dispell stuff on yourself or buffs on him.<br />
<br />
Jboots is a must and don't let him cast anything.</div></div><hr />

Snare would probably be better.  Dispell everything you can on him before you start - then get your poison on him.  Stay on him until he's dead.  Carry cure poison/disease potions and use them when you get doted.  Those potions basicly mean that he will waste mana on you.. and you will win.  Ignore his pet if he makes one.

Get yerself some cure poison an' disease potions.  Also, get that golem metal wand an' if ye ain't got nothin' that'll regen ye, I think there's potions out there that'll do that too.   I'd have a pumice on hand too t' strip dots off yerself, basically ye use th' golem wand on yer foe t' strip 'em down real good an' use th' pumice on yerself.  Keep yer top two slots open if ye can, it'll make strippin' dots much easier.   One way t' do it is t' put on yer guise an' change form, then start puttin' on beneficial things ye got (fer me it's Shrunken Gobbie Skull an' Bracer O' th' hidden).  After yer buffed ye go hit a zone an' boom yer top slot is free.  Ye kin get th' second slot free if ye have someone cast somethin' that don't last long like a dmg shield on ye.   Lessee...I wouldn't waste yer time on th' pet, I'd rush right in an' make sure he ain't gettin' casts.   That malise line will really hurt now, so don't let 'im get th' spell off.  Fast weapons an' some choice backstabs an' hopefully ye'll bring th' fooker down.  Good luck with it, mate.<br />

I can destroy any shaman i've been put up agisnt till 60. Then they get unresistable mr debuff.... I have had my ass handed to me by every 60 shm i have been up aginst, but if they are below 60 i dont have that much of a problem with them.(cept that on in fp arena, he blended in with the gd walls! i still beat him but i had a really bad headache afterward lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maleus</div><div class="date">06-04-01, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snare poison is probably your best choice, if you can kill him before it wears off. If you can't, though...well, you're in for a long, hard fight. <br />
<br />
If you can't kill him before the poison wears off, or he resists, the first thing you have to do is make sure you kill his pet. It will interrupt your &quot;spells&quot; every single time unless you do, since you have no channeling skill. This is the single most important piece of advice I can give you. <br />
<br />
Get pumice or a golem wand to cancel his malo and epic dot.<br />
<br />
Get cure poison and disease potions. You'll need them, and probably need them badly.<br />
<br />
Get a fungi, and get your MR/PR/DR up as much as you can, at the expense of AC if necessary. Wear as much HP gear as you can, too.<br />

Rooting/Snaring can be nullified with his own metal wands and you can't keep up with a shaman running.<br />
<br />
Instant Click SoW &gt; Instant JBoots.<br />
<br />
A shaman often has innate regen(troll/ogre), a fungi tunic, and cast regrowth so kiting can get you behind quickly.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you have a see-invis item of some sort, once you kill the pet it's not an unheard of strategy to cast pox then invis while it does it's thing.</div></div><hr />

I believe there is something regarding dueling somewhere on the Safehouse.  It would be nice to see detailed separate topics in the library on how a rogue can kill each class ... including rogues ... The Safehouse Guide to Player Assassinations ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have enough of a hard time kiting and then landing a 4-second casting spell on a melee, and usually that involves lucky channeling. Malleus McGuinness -  - Vallon Zek<br />

If you've got some time before your duel, head over tehre for a little while and pick up a few.  2 charges of ensnare.  Great if that snaring poison wears off a bit early or is resisted altogether.  its not instant cast time, so you'll be standing there for a sec while it goes off.  But if it lands, that could shift the tide of battle.  <br />
The golem Metal wands are probably one the best tips given to ya so far tho.  They can stick so many buffs on themselves that they can pose a REAL threat simply from the number/type of buffs they have. ~Takarae Taekmoor~</div></div><hr />
