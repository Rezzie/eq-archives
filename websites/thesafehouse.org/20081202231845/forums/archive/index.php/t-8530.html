<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ewan aka nach0king</div><div class="date">09-27-02, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[Fri Sep 27 19:43:13 2002] Paldar Bladesoul jolts his head in the direction of the voice. 'You. . . you're not an apparition are you? No, you can't be, that's what I am. Well, I'm glad to meet you, my name is Paldar Bladesoul. I don't suppose you've seen [Ulessa] since you've entered this tomb, have you?'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 19:43:16 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'Talk of a dragon almost as powerful as the creator herself?! A dragon that reigned supreme over all other dragons as they looked on and cowered in fear? Such beasts were unimaginably powerful and a group of three tireless adventurers would have no way to take on such a monster. We were honestly frightened by the story and we feared for anyone who tried to embark on a journey to find such a beast. But as I said, Milas paid no heed to our warnings and went off on his own anyway. We really had no idea what to think at that point, but we knew that we [had to do] something, before Milas got himself killed.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 19:43:25 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'He was our friend, though now we started to wonder if perhaps he had gotten too far into these explorative missions for his own good. Because he was our friend, we had to go after him to make sure he didn't do something he shouldn't. We followed his trail all over Norrath before finally finding out that he had made it to the [ancient tomb]. We found out where the tomb was and raced there to try and catch up to him.'<br />
<br />
Paldar Bladesoul says 'The walls shined dimly with a glacial velium bile the likes of which we had never seen before, not to mention the fact that they stood hundreds of feet high. I'm sure you felt the same way the first time you came here. The awe-inspiring architecture clouded our minds for a brief moment while we took it all in. Truly, we thought, Milas had stumbled onto something magnificent, albeit terrifying. We proceeded through the tomb carefully, avoiding the various golems and gargoyles that we encountered, all the while trying to locate any sign of Milas. We came to the door directly across from this room and my first thought was, ''What's in here?'' Without a moment's thought, we moved forth towards the [door] to open it.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 19:43:32 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'The door was gigantic and spanned the entire reach of the hall, from floor to ceiling. It took a great force to muster it open, and what we saw when we opened the door terrified us both. Beyond the door lay a humungous golem, over three times the size of the normal golems. We tried to close the door before it noticed us, but it was too late. It charged for us, the smaller golems following behind. I tried to fend off the huge golem to try and let my beloved wife escape. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't see whether or not she was able to escape, and for all I know, she could have died right then and there. As for me, I was quickly done in by the might progenitor, and have spent the last. . . eternity here [waiting for] Ulessa.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 19:43:35 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'I'm fairly certain that my beloved wife perished in this condemned tomb shortly after me, and while that makes me sad, I still have nothing but love for her and wish to find her. I've had plenty of time over the years to come up with a way to try and escape this prison I'm in so that I might be able to find her, but unfortunately the bond between my soul and this statue are far too strong to allow me to go anywhere. I've been waiting for quite some time for someone to come to aid me in my struggles, but I don't know anyone who will help.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 19:43:38 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'You will? That's fantastic, this might just work. I've concocted a way to put my spirit into a mortal body, at least long enough to search the tomb for any sign of Ulessa. I've come up with the perfect way to do this, and here's what it's going to take. I'm going to need you to bring me the lifeblood of several of the creatures in the tomb. I don't wish to upset the creatures or their spirits in this tomb, so all I'll say is that the more powerful beasts will be the ones that will have what I need. Gather the ten components for me and bring them back to me, I'll be able to use them to form the creature that I can join my spirit with.'<br />
<br />

<br />
For NEC/WIZ/ENC/MAG quest:<br />
1. Opalescent Gold Dragon Scale (Warder)<br />
2. Opalescent Storm Dragon Scale (Warder)<br />
3. Opalescent Black Dragon Scale (Warder)<br />
4. Opalescent Silver Dragon Scale (Warder)<br />
5. Founder's Velium Creation<br />
6. Globe of Frozen Vitality<br />
7. Stinted Velium Drapes<br />
8. Serrated Gargoyle Claw<br />
9. Drakeen Scales<br />
10. Opalescent Drakeen Brain? (another class specific item, priests use Ethereal Drakeen Brain) <br />
<br />
That would be my guess if it uses 10 items.<br />
<br />
CLR/DRU/SHM - use Ethereal (color) Dragon Hearts off warders, and Ethereal Drakeen Brain<br />
MNK/BST - use Primal (color) Dragon Fang off warders, and Primal Drakeen Brain?<br />
WAR/PAL/SHD/BRD - use Primal (color) Dragon Claw off warders, and Primal something Brain I dunno :P<br />

[Fri Sep 27 23:13:16 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'Your abilities treat you well, as you have made it past some of the most difficult automatons that have been created to date. I made it here, such as you have, but my story is one lost ages ago in the myths and legends of the lands. If time did not stand still as a spirit, I might have forgotten it myself. Perhaps you would like to [hear it]?'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:13:18 2002] You say, 'i would like to hear it'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:13:19 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'As I thought, and a wise choice I might add. Never was there a more wise choice than listening to the ramblings of an age-old spirit, infused with the knowledge of a place that time has forgotten. I was a meager journeyman in my youth, traveling the lands to fulfill my own contempt of the life I had led. I met a multitude of men and women, all of whom had desires, riches, and most importantly -- things they needed done. And so it was that I took these tasks on, journeying from one place to another, doing their deeds and reaping the rewards. However, my follies came back to haunt me on what was to be my [last mission].'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:13:28 2002] You say, 'what last mission'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:13:28 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'My journeys brought me to a seemingly old man who was in need of someone like myself to go on an expedition for him. He told me that there would be riches beyond my wildest dreams if I were able to complete this, and like a fool I was instantly enchanted. He told me of a place where the frost and rime had engulfed a cavernous lair. He spoke of mighty ice beings, great dragons, and an immortal beast only legend had known to be true. He only wanted me to retrieve for him [one thing].'<br />
<br />

<br />
Awea says, 'Hail, Remmen the Short'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:13:36 2002] Remmen the Short says 'You have traveled a great distance, and already bested a great many challenges to find me here, so for that I salute your effort. However, mortal being, your effort has been in vain, for the challenges that await you are far more difficult than that which you have encountered thus far. That you have reached me here shows that you are indeed headstrong and able, however do not confuse these things with the ability to best the [guardians] which walk these halls beyond.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:01 2002] Awea says, 'what guardians'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:01 2002] Remmen the Short says 'The gargoyles and the golems you have seen so far are the most basic of all creations in this tomb. However beyond this hall you will find creatures of even greater spite and power. Beyond this hall you will begin to understand the immensity of the situation which you are in, as well as the control that the Ancients have on those who enter this lair. If I were in your position, I would turn back and leave the lair before [ancient chaos] erupted into my very essence, as it is surely to do in yours and as it has in many before you.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:11 2002] Awea says, 'what ancient chaos'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:11 2002] Remmen the Short says 'I'm sure by now that you're aware of the power that the great prismatic dragon contained. As he grew in power and influence, he also grew darker and darker in consciousness. The very essence of his being had turned into a twisted and maligned spirit, wrought with evil and demented into hatred. These thoughts had been taken out upon dragon kin, scraping the dark thoughts and emotions upon them so that they would never sway under the righteous power of the great prismatic. However, all was not well for the dragons and they would not stand by to take the [abuse] for long.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:25 2002] Awea says, 'what abuse'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:25 2002] Remmen the Short says 'Kerafyrm had insulted the pride, power, and efficacy of the dragons for quite some time. However, as he continued, so continued the growls of discontent. It wasn't long before those growls turned into an uproar, filled to the brim with the courage of the Claws of Veeshan as they deemed it necessary to take action. Their action was to push back against the stringent hold of Kerafyrm through outright aggression, which led the dragons into a bloody, violent civil [war].'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:35 2002] Awea says, 'what war'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:14:35 2002] Remmen the Short says 'There were some dragons and their kin that sided with Kerafyrm, defending his prophetic nature to the last. However, no matter the odds, the war that ensued ensured death on both sides. Dragon, drake, wyvern, and wyrm corpses littered the battlefield, a testament to Kerafyrm's fortitude. Despite his efforts though, the great prismatic beast was pushed back into his lair, here where you stand, and put into stasis by dragons of all elements. For years he was held in a tenuous state, almost breaking free several times, as the Claws of Veeshan oversaw the construction of a velium subsystem of [tunnels].'<br />
<br />

<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:26:47 2002] You say, 'Hail, Milas An`Rev'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:26:47 2002] Milas An`Rev looks around curiously. 'Well, well, well. Look what the wyvern dragged in. I dun get visitors all that often, but usually when I do, it's a bad omen. Ye know, ye look a lot like some of the buggers that came 'round here not too long ago. Well, heh, not long ago for me could have been years and years ago. But, by the looks of ye, ye wouldn't know [why that is].<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:48:52 2002] Awea says, 'Hail, Ulessa Bladesoul'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:48:52 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul looks up with you and sniffles. From the look of it, she has been sniffling like that for quite some time, though you're not sure how long. 'Oh, I'm sorry. I really don't mean to do this in front of you, it's just that I'm so very [unhappy].'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:06 2002] Awea says, 'why unhappy?'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:06 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'I'm unhappy because I haven't seen my husband in so long. We were so very in love, did everything together. But after the , I never saw him again. It's like a pang in the back of my throat keeps causing me pain, but it's not a pain that is tangible or real, simply an emotional one. I feel so empty though without Paldar by my side.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:20 2002] Awea says, 'what incident?'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:20 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'It all started because of a friend we once had. I say once had because he, like myself, is dead and gone. Milas was his name and he was an adventuresome little fellow, always looking to go out and do the most dangerous, most fanatically unheard of [things] to 'live' his life. His final endeavor was to come to this wretched place and find some lost sleeping dragon. Paldar and I tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't listen. We tried to tell him that he was just looking to get himself killed and that he should just let it go. But gnomes will be gnomes and he was a gnome. So just like a gnome, he was stubborn and wouldn't listen to a thing we had to say.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:39 2002] Awea says, 'what things'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:39 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'He went off on his own after we pleaded with him not to go and came here, to this. . . this. . . PLACE! Ugh, it makes me so angry to think that he came here, and like the fools that we were, Paldar and I came after him to try and stop him. Did we stop to think that maybe we should just let him go? No, of course not, because that's not what friends do for their friends. Instead, we followed him and we got ourselves caught up in the [mess].'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:40 2002] Wargurdar says, 'what mess'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:49:40 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'What mess? I'll tell you what mess! We came here, of course terrified out of our minds. We saw the pretty sights, found out that there are huge golems and what not all over the place just waiting to grind you into velium dust, and then we came to a door. So tell me, what do you have to do when you come to a door, by default?'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:51:34 2002] Vendrengha says, 'You checked to see if it was open'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:51:34 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'You open it, exactly! And that's just what we did, because we thought that perhaps Milas was behind the door. We didn't take into account that the door was twenty times larger than either of us, but we still opened it. Well, beyond that door we didn't find the gnome we had come here to find. Instead we found the creator golem, set in that room to create more golems for the ones that failed. I'm sure you can imagine [what happened] after that.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:15 2002] Vendrengha says, 'no I wont imagine, I'm going to ask you what happened then'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:15 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'We tried to close the door, hoping he wouldn't see us, but he did. He came charging after us, his feet making thunderous footsteps the entire way. My dear brave husband stood up to him and his newly built sentries to try and let me escape, and escape I did. That is, if you can really even call it an escape. I made it out of the eye of that creator beast and fumbled my through this forsaken tomb, barely missing the various [beasts] of burden along the way.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:34 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'Golems, gargoyles, wyverns, spectres, you name it. Each time I saw one, I almost let out a scream that would have awoken the dead, if they hadn't been already I mean. I got turned around quite a few times too, going back and forth not remembering which way was up. But finally, I got to this statue behind me and looked at it. It was so still and gentle, yet it portrayed the epitome of [evil] that had slain my husband and most likely slain our friend Milas.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:43 2002] Vendrengha says, 'what evil'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:43 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'The evil of the sleeping prismatic dragon; the evil that corrupted our little gnomish friend and brought us to our deaths. It was here that I stood, looking at this statue that I realized that it was hopeless for me to continue on. What was I trying to prove to myself anyway? That I could live on and survive? That I could find this infamous sleeper and tell him to shove off? None of that was going to be part of my story, none of it at all. Instead, while I was gawking at the marble dragon, a [shadow] engulfed me.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:50 2002] Vendrengha says, 'what shadow'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:50 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'That's the very same thought that was going through my head at the time. Who's shadow could that be, or rather. . . what shadow could possibly be that large? When I turned, I had my answer. There, in front of me stood a lumbering golem, its bright velium skin glistening in front of me. It was at that point that I knew my life had been for naught, and that I would never see my husband again. So here I stand, an ever-lasting spirit of the tomb, [waiting] eternally to see my poor Paldar in the after life.'<br />
<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:56 2002] Vendrengha says, 'what waiting'<br />
[Fri Sep 27 23:52:56 2002] Ulessa Bladesoul says 'Waiting? Who knows why I'm waiting. I guess I felt that someday, some live being like yourself could help me find my beloved. Perhaps allow us to reunite, if only for a moment. I had some kooky ideas about how to make that work, but I really didn't have a way to get the components I needed to make them work.'

The four dragon items are colored as Black, Silver, Gold and Storm (although Storm is not a color  )<br />

So you have four items in each category:<br />
- named Eyes<br />

- Opalescent &amp;lt;color&gt; Dragon Scale (NEC/WIZ/MAG/ENC)<br />
- Ethereal &amp;lt;color&gt; Dragon Heart (CLR/DRU/SHM)<br />
- Primal &amp;lt;color&gt; Dragon Claw* (WAR/PAL/SHD/BRD)<br />

You take the ethereal &amp;lt;name&gt; dragon essence (im a ranger so that's my piece), combine with the 6 generic and 3 other pieces (not sure what) to get an item or something.  What's gonna suck is, if you read through the lore about Ulessa and Paldar, they want to be re-united, so im hoping you dont have to &quot;clear a way&quot; after you turn in something so that they meet up =/<br />

One of the Crusaders (dragons who were to be the successors to the Warders when the Warders ascended) tells the quester to collect essence(s) that match the quester's nature (assuming class).  Likely, this is what the various Essences are for.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in typical Verant fashion, the quest text given by the Crusader is cut short, so details on the quest are still to be discovered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe the essences are related to the quest from erudite ghosts. As one of the posters above mentioned, one of the new mobs in Skyshrine specifically asked for the essences of the ancients and their constructs, and specifies that these essences should match the essence of the quester (ie, have the right class listed).<br />
<br />
One bit of information which may help: Some of the mobs that drop the none/none quest pieces required for the ghost quest are *rare spawns* which may or may not be up during a given clearing of ST. I'll see if I can find a list I made of all the named yard trash that I've seen.</div></div><hr />

Day 1<br />
Far and away, this is the most exciting thing I've ever done. I never imagined that there would be a time when I could find a beast of myth and legend simply by trekking as I have always done. I only wish Paldar and Ulessea could have come along with me to find him! This will be most exciting!<br />
<br />
Day 15<br />
I wonder how long it is going to take for me to find out where this creature is hidden. From what I've learned so far, it was kept far away from mortals so that there would not be the chance of him being awakened and again dealing strife to the inhabitants of the lands. I cannot for the life of me find out where such a place that could hold this prismatic lord could be.<br />
<br />
Day 83<br />
It has been long since I last wrote, but only because there has been nothing to write about. The leads I have gotten from various vagrants have been misleading and uneventful. I wonder if I might be wasting my time. No, that can't be possible, for the rewards I'll reap will be in every way worth the effort of finding this tomb.<br />
<br />
Day 596<br />
After so long, I have finally found a statue of a sleeping dragon. I had almost given up hope, but it is here in the middle of the Eastern Wastes. There is an inscription on it that reads, He whose prismatic might shall not be freed will be corrupted by perpetual greed. It also shows the way to the tomb! I'm so excited, and so close!<br />
<br />
Day 603<br />
At long last, I have finally found the tomb! it is immense and marvelous , with huge ceilings and beasts of burden that are larger than life. I go now to venture through it and meet this fabled Sleeper, perhaps I can learn from him!<br />
<br />
Day 603, part 2<br />
I have made my way into a huge library, filled to the walls with books. This first one I opened gives a history on the drakes of the world. It rea--<br />

<br />
The Digest of Devastating Frills<br />
Quote: <br />
This is the only story I know now, now that I have been stripped of my corporeal essence on Norrath. My slayer was a mighty wyvern, born of dragon kin and survived through the hardships of the lands for years upon years. I know now that I destined to be a protector of this tomb, for the purpose of spreading my story and keeping those who would foolishly follow in my footsteps out of here. <br />
<br />
I do not know what this may mean for my friends paldar and Ulessa, however I do know that they must never try to follow in my footsteps either, for the good of the land. It is with this protection in mind that I must learn the form of the great wyvern, learn how it moves, how it wields its mighty claws, and how it keeps at bay those who would attack it.<br />
<br />
Drakes are easy, for they are simple minded and provide no need for extensive thought. They are warriors through and through, and will not cease until they are dead, or their foe is dead. Wyverns have the intelligence to take the magical elements of their surrounding and use them to better themselves. They can force the air around them into a highly impactful and very deadly screech that will deafen those who hear it.<br />
<br />
It is this power that I am to become. This is my legacy now,  and I shall excel at it, regardless of the consequences to myself or to those who I once c<br />
<br />
The wyvern these came off was Milas An`Rev I believe. So it looks to me as if the human wandered into the tomb, and became a wyvern through reading the books in the library.</div></div><hr />

The quest NPCs that mention the dragon essences currently have bugged text that cuts off, so aside from knowing they want them, we aren't sure what to do with them. A GM told me last night that they would be fixed in the next patch.<br />

<br />
Corrupted Gargoyle Stone (or maybe was corruped forbidding stone) plus a rare drop from the scorn banshees (cannot recall the name of that item) are requested by one of the new quest NPCs in skyshrine in a specific quest.<br />
<br />
Most likely combine seems to me to be one of each of the six none/none items, plus one of each &quot;color&quot; warder drop for your class group, in the 10-slot bag. &quot;Prismatic Storm Dragon Claw&quot; was probably supposed to be &quot;Primal Storm Dragon Claw&quot;, or the other three claws were supposed to be &quot;prismatic&quot;.<br />
<br />
All other drops (aside from the warder eyes, which are most likely just resistance stone replacements) come from various mini-boss mobs throughout the zone, and I would bet they are for new skyshrine quests (like the corrupted gargoyle stone definately is).<br />

I am no longer on stormhammer, so I cannot fetch the quest texts there now... perhaps someone there can post the texts here, or else I suppose we wait until the revamp of skyshrine goes live to all servers to find out that stuff...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Primal Gold Dragon Claw (Warder)<br />

9. Wings of Oversight (Overseer)<br />
10 Globe of Frozen Vigor (last mob b4 FA)<br />
<br />
I also managed to find some other combinations of class specific + none/ none items...but these seemed the most logical at the time...<br />
<br />
some of the none/none items that drop seem to have names suited for classes...<br />
<br />
1. Stinted Velium Drapes (MotG)  (Nec/Wiz/Mage/Ench ?)<br />
2. Founder's Velium Creation (Prog) (Monk / Bst ?)<br />
3. Globe of Frozen Vitality  (Clr / Dru/ Shm ?)<br />
4. Serrated Gargoyle Claw(Near FA) (War/Pal/Sk/ Brd ?)<br />
5. Wings of Oversight (Overseer) (Rogue/Ranger ?)<br />
6. Globe of Frozen Vigor (last mob b4 FA) (Clr/Dru/Shm ?)<br />
<br />
also in a previous post 4 class specific stones were found...which leads me to believe there is a 5th for hte other classes.<br />
<br />
1.Wiz / nec / mag / enc stone : not found still looking<br />
2.War / Pal / Sk / Brd stone : Corrupted Forbidding Stone<br />
3.Clr / Dru / Shm stone : Tomb Protector Stone<br />
4.Rogue / Ranger stone: Corrupted Gargoyle Stone<br />
5.Monk/Bst stone : Opalescent Gargoyle Stone<br />
<br />
<br />
so all in all maybe:<br />
<br />
1. Class item off warder<br />
2. Class item off warder<br />
3. Class item off warder<br />
4. Class item off warder<br />
5. Stone 1<br />
6. Stone 2<br />
7. Stone 3<br />
8. Stone 4<br />
9. Stone 5<br />
10. none / none item eg. Serrated Gargoyle Claw for WAR</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shakah</div><div class="date">01-17-03, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you talk to the Crusaders and get past the point where the text is cut off (see my last post in this thread), they very clearly ask for two items.<br />
<br />
Grendish the Crusader asks for the monk/BL items and Charayan the Crusader asks for the plate melee items. That is all that I have personally confirmed, but I assume that there is also one for the chain melee items, one for the caster items, and one for the priest items. They ask for the 2 items from each of these groups that are not the warder drops.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what quest the warder drops are for, but I am hoping that it is a follow-on quest from the same NPC after you complete this one.<br />
<br />
You need very high faction for these quests, probably ally if not max ally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is you turn in the two minor class items to the quest NPC and get a 4 slot container to combine the warder items in.  The turn in NPCs seem to be be bugged and will not accept the correct items even with max faction.</div></div><hr />

[Sat Jan 18 00:29:45 2003] You say, 'Hail, Grendish the Crusader'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:29:45 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''Greetings. You address Crusader Grendish, keeper of mindful discipline and the spiritual ties of our manifestations upon this world. I can sense as clear as the warmth of Ro's touch upon our scales that honor washes through the fabric of your being -- honor that has been displayed and proven countless times over in your loyalty to the Claws of Veeshan. But something obstructs purity in you -- your motives are clearer still. All of your kind that have come before us believe we to be as our brethren -- at ease with our stations and at a loss of judgment toward those whom have proven worthy of our recognition and knowledge. Know that the Crusaders do not regard you or your kind to be paralleled in existence unto us -- a regard that the recent, ignorant and disregarding [actions] of your kind has justly and firmly instated within us.''<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:29:51 2003] You say, 'what actions'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:29:51 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''Kerafyrm, the Sleeper, has been awoken. For centuries the Claws of Veeshan have maintained the prismatic threat's imprisonment, an act that was not achieved without much sacrifice and loss, but now all seems to have been destroyed and left as a struggle that ended in vain. The Sleeper is free and his power grows with every passing moment -- a threat that has descended upon the steel of second generation warriors. You have condemned yourself, as you have since the dawn of your creation, but your actions guided by shallow lusts for power and fame within your fledgling insignificance has spilled into the ancient world that cradles your very existence. It is you who have ushered us into being as we are now -- the apprentices we are no longer and as the [Crusaders of Veeshan] we stand before and shall either [command or disregard you].''<br />

[Sat Jan 18 00:30:08 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''When the warders were first charged with the duty of holding the captured Kerafyrm in enchanted stases, they were ordered by the elder council to mate with dragons whose elemental influence mirrored their own. From these unions would be born the apprentices -- dragons whom would be dedicated from birth to the maintenance and imprisonment of the darkest threat to descend upon this entire plane of being. Inevitably, the council did not foresee the release of Kerafyrm by the actions of the second generation -- for it was their foolhardy nature to underestimate and ignore the true depths of your seemingly insignificant gluttonous lusts within your fallible existence. When the Sleeper took flight, the apprentices became the Crusaders out of necessity for the unforeseen present. Where our predecessors were of the passive duty to maintain Kerafyrm's imprisoned slumber, the Crusaders must be of aggressive natures to pursue and eliminate his threat once more. But what has been [unleashed] is far more than a prismati'<br />

[Sat Jan 18 00:32:10 2003] You say, 'I will aid in its undoing'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:10 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''This task will not be one of immediate reward, nor shall you see results of a tangible effect. The threat that we engage is one that cannot be extinguished through one success -- we must make strides, and those strides shall come slowly as we begin to fathom the true depths of the terror we face. Your duties unto us shall be only the first steps in preparation for this understanding, and you must accept that your actions will be of little repute when the whole scale is revealed and challenged. The Crusaders do all that we can, but for us to [enter the stronghold] of our nemeses would be futile and be a stride taken blindly into an endless pit from which we will never recover, thus is why we shall command you in the infancy of our struggle.''<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:21 2003] You say, 'I will enter the stronghold'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:21 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''You must not merely engage the enemy in battle for the sake of battle alone. We stand upon a battlefield not only of steel and evocation, but it is a plane of dire consideration, mindful tactics and reasoning and the understanding that we are dangerously outmatch with this shroud of ignorance over our eyes. To lift this veil, you must return the very essence of the coerced and constructed minions of Kerafyrm and his Ancients, but you must be sure that your own spiritual bindings to this realm are [mirrored] to that of the essence you wish to retrieve, else they shall become corrupt and their natures destroyed.''<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:51 2003] You say, 'how mirrored'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:51 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''All beings draw their power from within the unseen mystical, spiritual, and elemental forces that surrounded the primal at a constant and balanced chaos. As these beings mature in power, their ties to these forces become strong and intertwined with the powers. Every adept of the second generation will be touched by only one of these forces wherein all of Veeshan's brood is exempt from such limitations, for we are beings whose existence far exceed the limited complexity of your own fragile being. Each of the Crusaders is bound to one of the primal elemental forces and in our passing years of learning, we have taken a path of an influential power to forge an unbreakable circle. I am a being of the tranquility that surrounds the unification of both mind and body and walk the path that crosses both the prime and spirit realms. If [you walk this path], then you shall aid me without obstructing the purity of essence you will retrieve for us. However, if you are not of these roads, than seek one of the other Crusa'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:56 2003] You say, 'I walk this path'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:32:57 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''Venture into the stronghold of the Ancients and seek the Wyvern Fanatic. Once a soldier of the Claws of Veeshan dedicated to the preservation of the tomb, this powerful creature has become corrupted by the return of the Ancients.  As this creature is one of mortal birth and is tied wholly to the prime, its heart resides as the core of its essence that has become corrupt and is now fuelled by Kerafyrm's own power, rather than the uncontrollable forces of chaos and influence. Return to me this creature's heart, but know that only the hands of one who walks the path that dictates discipline between mind and body or from the realm of natural spirits may handle this item without obstructing Kerafyrm's taint upon it. However, that single item will not be sufficient to fulfill this duty and you must acquire an [additional specimen] that holds the mark of Kerafyrm's will.''<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:33:15 2003] You say, 'what additional specimen'<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:33:15 2003] Grendish the Crusader says ''Dragon kin of mortal birth were appointed to the post of soldier within the tomb, but the warders knew that this would not be enough. Due to the raging front engaged with the giants of Kael, the warders created stone constructs and imparted unto them a small fiber of their essence. Along with many of the mortal born soldiers of the tomb, these stone constructs were corrupted by the Ancients but as these creatures are of pure arcane and mystical creation, their essence is more easily destroyed with their physical forms. The Crusaders of Veeshan command that in your willingness to aid the battle against this dark threat, that you engage the vigilant gargoyle custodians and when you are able to extract the Opalescent core of their being, return it with the wyvern's heart to me. Only then shall your efforts be considered by the Crusaders of Veeshan and the true extent of your devotion and loyalty to the Claws of Veeshan be recognized.''<br />
[Sat Jan 18 00:33:57 2003] You say, 'note: handing in Crystalized Wyvern Heart and Opalescent Gargoyle Stone (with max ally faction)'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fitz</div><div class="date">01-20-03, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here is what I know.  Back when the new Sleeper's Tomb was opened on Legends, there was a huge 6 hour event.  Throughout the event some leaders emerged.  We were not supposed to win the event.  <br />
<br />
At one point, the 300 people there were so organized that I had pulled the 40 mobs protecting a named dragon individually between waves and had gotten him solo.  The GMs froze my character and told me that if I brought the dragon into camp, it would end the script prematurely.  So I was frozen and unable to do anything as the script completed itself.  Through all odds, we pulled it out and protected the tomb from the giant and renegade dragon hoards.  At the end...10 leaders were chosen to recieve nice items.  5 were given artifacts of tremendous power at the time and the other 5 were given mediocre end game items but with promises they would be named after us.  Those 5 people were hmmm me, Scornful (cleric), Ilsi (wizard), Sarthis (monk), and I forget the 5th person.  It was told to us at that time that those items would be the result of a quest in the New ST involving drops from the new warders.  <br />
<br />
It is an easy bridge of logic to look at the items we were each given and see that the classes of the corresponding quest items match up to the classes on our uniquely named items.  This was before anything was mentioned about Skyshrine being revamped.  I have attempted to figure out the quest, but just like here, there is a lot of info I could not unearth.  That is pretty much the extent of my knowledge on the subject, I hope it helps somewhat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe we will take a month or 2 longer to complete these quests, but atleast we can see what we are working towards. :)<br />

This wouldn't be the first time VI released a combine container with many extra slots, so don't let that ruin our perception of what could be needed as a final result for the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sloe Moe</div><div class="date">01-21-03, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">go back and read the NPC text...he asks for 10 items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shakah</div><div class="date">01-21-03, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is that there are at least 3 quests (or maybe a quest and a 2 part quest).<br />
<br />
The reason they have not been solved is that they are bugged. First when ST was released the quest mobs (Crusaders in Skyshrine) weren't even in the game. Then they added the quest mobs in with cut-off text so that you couldn't follow the key words. Then someone figured out the key words and the quest has a faction bug so that even if you hand in the right items, you can't continue the quest.<br />
<br />
Anyway, 2 of the class-based drops are clearly for the quest that the crusaders are giving out. Once you get the keywords right, it's quite clear what they are asking for. My quess is that the other 4 class-based drops (the ones off of the warders) are either the second half of the quest or a follow-on quest from the same NPCs.<br />
<br />
This leads me to think that the all/all quest drops go into the 10 slot bag.<br />
<br />
If SoE ever gets around to fixing the Crusader quests, maybe then we can eliminate some of the drops we are finding and the rest of them probably go into the bag.</div></div><hr />

[Sat Feb 01 13:35:11 2003] Andarael says, 'i will aid'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:11 2003] Susarrak the Crusader arches his neck in an almost callous study of you, the voice in your mind silenced for but a moment as an uneasy feeling washes over you, as if judgment has just been passed. Suddenly, the melodic whisper of dominion flows through your thoughts once more, 'If you are a wielder of the arcane powers of the mine or your heart is guided purely by the devotion and faith of the second generation deities than you shall aid me. Otherwise, seek out one of the other Crusaders whose duties would identify with your purpose within your world. It is of the utmost importance that you do not stray from this decree, }, for to do so would be to waste precious time which is neither a luxury nor ally at our disposal. If you are of the appropriate necessity to aid Susarrak, then you must [venture into the tomb] that had so recently held Kerafyrm.'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:21 2003] Andarael says, 'i will venture into the tomb'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:21 2003] Susarrak the Crusader gives a gentle roar that rings almost as approval before the unwavering voice continues, 'Much has changed since Kerafyrm lay in dormant slumber -- the return of the Ancients has ushered the return of Kerafyrm's faithful minions. These creatures, many of whom mimic the former inhabitants and guardians of the tomb, are beings of pure untamed hatred and will strike you without hesitation or consideration. When Kerafyrm was awakened and the ancients descended, these creatures were summoned or created through the very essence and power of these phenomenal nemeses. Only one of your magically woven essence can properly extract and handle the [components] that I seek, and if you are of the mind to return the aid that the Claws of Veeshan have bestowed upon you, then your efforts shall not go without just consideration.'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:35 2003] Andarael says, 'what components?'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:35 2003] Susarrak the Crusader says ''Within the tomb resides a creature known as the Furious Phantasm. It is a being of pure corruption and hatred that is fueled by the consciousness and presence of Kerafyrm and the Ancients. The phantasm contains within its core a stone that binds it to the primal world. This stone may be recovered only by one who may invoke the power of their mind into the order of cause and effect upon the prime. Find this creature in the tomb and recover the stone if your hands are of the arcane. If you bear the will and guidance of your deity within you, then the creature you must seek is one known as the Drakeen Controller -- a creature that has been contorted into one of the Ancients' mindless drones. Its brain, saturated with corruption, is of the utmost importance to our research. One whose spirit has been blessed by the divine forces of their deity must extract the Drakeen Controller's brain. Before you leave the tomb and return to me, there is an [additional item] that must be acquired.''<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:42 2003] Andarael says, 'what additional item?'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:35:42 2003] Susarrak the Crusader says ''The divine essence of your faith and duties that has lightly touched your spirit will allow you the chance to extract the very core of the Ancients' manifestations -- their ethereal hearts. When the time comes that you seek to engage these forces of malignant hate and destruction, you shall be granted the chance to extract this precious, delicate item. If and when you have successfully extracted the heart of each Ancient, you shall return them to me. Mind you, this feat is not one that will be as simple as charging and defeating each of the Ancients, for their forms are unpredictable and the ways in which they are bound to this earth are those of a delicate balance between chaos, consciousness, and power. Times may come when you defeat an Ancient and the delicate matter of their ethereal core will be damaged beyond use to us. Prepare yourself for a seemingly endless battle, for as we stand now upon this path, the recognizable semblance of an end is upon an unseen horizon.''<br />

[Sat Feb 01 14:13:02 2003] Jortreva the Crusader says ''The Ancients have resurrected many shadows of their former legions. Among these are the creatures known as the Ancient Drakeens -- creatures of mortal birth but are twisted and reshaped to suit the Ancients' plans. Find one of these Ancient Drakeens and seek out the very core of their being -- their heart. Be warned that these hearts are fragile in stability away from their host. It may prove difficult to find a flawless specimen that we need. Once you have obtained the Drakeen Heart, you will then seek the creature known as the Sinister Gargoyle. Upon the destruction of this creature's corporeal form, the core of their power that binds and allows them to affect the primal world should remain. That core you must extract and return to me with the ancient Drakeen Heart.''<br />
<br />
<br />
this is rogue/ranger  because of magelo listing ancient drakeen heart as ranger rogue.</div></div><hr />

[Sat Feb 01 13:55:00 2003] Charayan the Crusader arches her neck in an almost callous study of you, the voice in your mind silenced for but a moment as an uneasy feeling washes over you, as if judgment has just been passed. Suddenly, the melodic whisper of dominion flows through your thoughts once more, 'If you are a soldier of your people, be you knight of either darkness or valor, or be you a minstrel -- you shall aid me. Otherwise, seek out one of the other Crusaders whose duties would identify with your purpose within your world. It is of the utmost importance that you do not stray from this decree for to do so would be to waste precious time which is neither a luxury nor ally at our disposal. If you are of the appropriate necessity to aid me, then you must [venture into the tomb] that had so recently held Kerafyrm.'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:55:08 2003] Andarael says, 'i will venture into the tomb'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:55:08 2003] Charayan the Crusader gives a gentle roar that rings almost as approval before the unwavering voice continues, 'Much has changed since Kerafyrm lay in dormant slumber -- the return of the Ancients has ushered the return of Kerafyrm's faithful minions. These creatures, many of whom mimic the former inhabitants and guardians of the tomb, are beings of pure untamed hatred and will strike you without hesitation or consideration. When Kerafyrm was awakened and the ancients descended, these creatures were summoned or created through the very essence and power of these phenomenal nemeses. Only one of your magically woven essence can properly extract and handle the [components] that I seek, and if you are of the mind to return the aid that the Claws of Veeshan have bestowed upon you, then your efforts shall not go without just consideration.'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:55:14 2003] Andarael says, 'what components?'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:55:14 2003] Charayan the Crusader says 'Within the tomb resides a creature known as the Forbidding Gargoyle. Its origins are not entirely clear to us, but we do know that it is a being of pure corruption and hatred that is fueled by the consciousness and presence of Kerafyrm and the Ancients. The construct contains a stone that binds it to the primal world. This stone may be recovered only by one whose essence is touched with the remnants of battle. Find this creature within the tomb and recover the stone if you are able, but do not return to me immediately upon succeeding in this one simple duty. There is an [additional item] that you must procure -- one that, as the stone of the Forbidding Gargoyle, will help the Crusaders better understand the near unfathomable darkness that threatens us.'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:55:22 2003] Andarael says, 'what additional item'<br />
[Sat Feb 01 13:55:22 2003] Charayan the Crusader says 'Among the constructs and corporeal beings loyal to Kerafyrm and the ancients, those whom are closest to the Ancients in creation and being reside. These creatures of pure consciousness, will, and malignance are known as the scorn spectres -- beings conjured by Kildrukaun's essence, and thus share with him his spiritual impression. Seek out these scorn spectres and reave from them their essence, should you find yourself alert enough to capture such remnants before they fade back to the cosmos that had borne them. Once and if you are successful in these two tasks, you shall return to me and present the items demanded of you if you wish the Crusaders to regard those of your kind loyal to the Claws of Veeshan worthy of our consideration.'<br />

Turned in the 4 Etheral Essence and got Fitz earring back.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the earring really needs to be upgraded considering the risk/reward and how boring it is.<br />
<br />
Even the Essence Perl (old ST quest) had better hp/resists.<br />
<br />
And the spell itself is a joke, considering its not stacking with many ranger spells. Please put another effect or change it. Very silly to put an effect that rangers cant use on a ranger/rogue earring.<br />
<br />
As it is now, I only did it since I had the quest items rotting and taking space in my bank. Edited by: LuterinShadowstalker at: 2/10/03 8:01:24 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW I am a 64 Ranger and I was ally to him.  I petitioned a GM and she said she could not help me.  <br />
<br />
Could the quest be fixed only on a few server?  Maybe you need max ally faction?  <br />
<br />
After I handed in the items he gave me 4 messages that he did not want to talk to me and to go away.  I assume that was one for each essense I handed in.  <br />
