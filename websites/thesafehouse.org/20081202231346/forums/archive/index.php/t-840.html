The graphics are nice but I'm a bit concerned about the story. It looks like a new group was trying to find Jenova and resurrect Sephiroth, but that seems a little, well, dumb.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I have some high hopes for this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">03-07-04, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not really sure what you're talking about, Torrent codec? I'm going to assume you are talking about codecs for your video player, you can find info on this at forums.animesuki.com/show....php?t=175<br />
<br />
If you are asking for a Bitorrent client, then bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html will suffice. Edited by: Stalkyr Weaksoul at: 3/7/04 8:52 pm</div></div><hr />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean &quot;cant be worse than the original game&quot;?!?!?!?!?     I loved FF7! played it countless times, and if I still had working CDs, I would probably still be playing it!!!!<br />

How dare you defile the name of Final Fantasy 7!  :&quot;&gt; :&quot;&gt; :&quot;&gt; <br />

grrrrrrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've been kinda hoping they might go back and give FF7 a facelift and re-release it as an actual PS2 or Gamecube title.<br />
<br />
That would make me happy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkOmen42</div><div class="date">03-08-04, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a good 70 hours there, each time through. At least if you spent a good bit of time leveling. Hara</div></div><hr />

Then I beat the snot out of the zolem...twice.  That was a fun game, used cloud, cid, and red XIII.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe people liked that game as much as they did.  I played through it and I thought it was crap, and I was a huge Square fan when I started.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't really care about Square much.  FF7 was the beginning of the end (with some notable exceptions).  We don't get good games anymore, we get crappy movies that make you push buttons to advance the story coupled with hours of tedious treadmill activities that somehow fool the gaming public into believing it is 'content'.<br />
<br />
Bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Peebs</div><div class="date">03-09-04, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok that was a little too much on the 'bah humbug' side, I must have been cranky last night.<br />
<br />
To each his own, I hope it's cool for all of you (and who knows, if it's cool enough it could turn me around on the whole 'FF has gone to crap ever since 7' thing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkOmen42</div><div class="date">03-10-04, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What did you really not like about it? Sure the materia system was new, but other then that it was very similar to 3(6). There was easily 50 hours of game play there, far from a movie with stuff in between. 7 was a very good example of good game play showcased with really cool CG scenes. Even though the quality of rendering isn't as good as it is today, it still isn't bad. Hara</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vagabond</div><div class="date">03-10-04, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. so I watched it way back when and I didn't understand what was going on; but didn't feel bad as I can't read JPN.<br />
<br />
Now I watch this one, and am still lost.  I recognize maybe half the characters, and can see which scenes are supposed to illicit &quot;o wow&quot; from the FF-heads out there.  Was the sub'ing really badly mangled, or was it supposed to be that disjointed rambling thing? Ninen of Saryrn<br />

Bad spelling can be lethal. For example, the greedy Seriph of Al-Ybi was once cursed by a badly-educated deity and for some days everything he touched turned to Glod, which happened to be the name of a small dwarf from a mountain community hundreds of miles away who found himself magically dragged to the kingdom and relentlessly duplicated. Some two thousand Glods later the spell wore off. These days, the people of Al-Ybi are renowned for being unusually short and bad-tempered.</div></div><hr />
