<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decrescendo</div><div class="date">05-23-04, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was very, very impressed with this.  The animation quality is on par with the best I've ever seen in a series.  Very well drawn, and very fluid especially in the action scenes.  I can't comment much on the story yet, but the characters are all engaging.  The cuts between scenes were a little wierd at times, as was the non-sequential edditing, so Im sure some people will complain about it, though I thought it worked well stylistically.  Overall its very promising, and may turn out to be one of the best series done in a long time.</div></div><hr />

Samurai Champloo is indeed worth the hype.  I really think this show is going to be big.<br />
<br />
BTW, there is no Pioneer, they sold the animation company to someone else, and it's now known as Geneon.</div></div><hr />
