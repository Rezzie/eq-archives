<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm surprised at the (apparent) lack of interest in this series. I loved the heck out of the first season, and the second season is shaping up to be as good as the first. Perhaps y'all read the manga already, which would leave me quite in the dust, but eh, I'm enjoying the anime a lot. Six eps have been subbed to my knowledge (I follow wannabe fs, they might be behind some, I dunno). This latest episode had me cracking up the whole episode. Lots of character developments, as well.<br />
<br />
Much :heart for Yakumo, as usual ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am enjoying it. As I enjoyed the 1st.<br />
<br />
Though I really want Harima and &quot;Queen&quot; to get together but it probably wont happen &quot;sigh&quot; :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-15-06, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The character dynamics in School Rumble are absoluely wonderful. There have been many cases of &quot;he likes her, she likes that other guy, that guy likes this other girl&quot; type of thing in anime, but I felt it was well-done in this series.<br />
<br />
Not only are they slowly changing their relationships with each other, this change is continously reflected upon in further episodes, rather than leaving it as a standalone event as most series would.<br />
<br />
My absolutely favorite character is Harima. I really love Yakumo too, especially when she's around Harima. It's so sweet to watch her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">10-03-06, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bumping this thread, as the Second Semester is over...<br />
<br />
I'm really excited for the Third Semester/SS OVAs, as Yakumo is my favorite character, expecting a lot more character development for her soon. The last eps of SS were awesome, I'm really pleased with how they turned out- just the right balance of humor and seriousness. The character dynamics are still wonderful, even as the relationships are finally starting to settle down.<br />
<br />
Anyone else keep up with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OpZO</div><div class="date">10-05-06, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still do, eagerly awaiting season 3 and keeping up with the manga in the meantime</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">05-05-08, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uber thread bump! San Gakki was confirmed a while ago, as an OVA series- the first is scheduled to come out mid July; tanoshiministeru~! I actually rewatched the entire series (well, in the process of rewatching ni gakki, anyways); I'm impressed how well its held up and how much I still enjoy it. And I actually picked up on a few more jokes that I missed the first time around~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">05-07-08, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More digging around has net this: the official site apparently is going to be updated every Wednesday (and has been updated thus for a while). They've released the titles for *nine* episodes already, which bodes well for a full , 'nother season of anime (or at least more than just a couple OVA releases like originally thought). In any case, we'll find out for sure once the first OVA comes out in July (bundled with the 21st volume of the manga) what the plan is; hopefully it follows the format of the previous seasons (OVA releases followed by a full, televised season).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-07-08, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never watched any of this series. Appears I should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-09-08, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, its called Rumble School eh?  Is it full of fighting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-28-08, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First ep of the Third Season OVAs was subbed finally. It seems that, for now at least, they are only releasing two OVAs for the entire third season. Time-wise, they are titled episodes 25 and 26 (ie, the last two episodes of the season), despite being the only two episodes for the season. I still hope that they will go back and actually do the first 24 episodes, but it doesn't look like they will at this point.<br />
 <br />
That said, e25 was good. The first couple minutes were kind of confusing (it was basically a &quot;recap&quot; of the first 24 episodes to get you up to speed), but the rest of the episode made up for it, imo. One more month for the end~</div></div><hr />
