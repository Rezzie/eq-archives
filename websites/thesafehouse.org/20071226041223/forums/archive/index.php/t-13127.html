<br />
Cute name, right? Makes you think of some cheesy sappy 'girls with guns' fanservice show, right?<br />
<br />
Umm... How do I put this...<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
Okay, I cant figure out how to tell you what I'm thinking about this hauntingly beautiful yet manic-depressive series that dug itself into my brain and refuses to let go. Thankfully, I managed upon a site that pretty much says what I have to say:<br />
<br />
Review (NOT WORK SAFE) (http://www.therossman.com/rrr/anime/gunslinger.html)<br />
<br />
Okay, you read that and are thinking 'it can't be THAT messed up'. Oh, Evangelion only wishes they would have thought of something like this. I'll shut up before I ramble, HOWEVER, if you are tired of seeing anime where everyone ends up happy, even if said people all have no limbs and live in a cave full of hentai monsters... This is your ticket. Want an analogy? Fine!  'Grave of the Fireflies' meets 'Evangelion'. Now go watch. Now. Preferably with someone you love. With the lights on. And lots of comfort food. And the number to a mental health clinic nearby.<br />
<br />
I kind of accidentally DL'd it knowing nothing about the series, and I'm convinced it's one of the greatest accidents I've ever had, minus the self-doubt and nightmares. Oh well! ^_^</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about?  When does that EVER happen??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Berdusk</div><div class="date">08-23-04, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do read the review Len linked to, only read the main review.<br />
The two other commentators say nothing of worth, only to bitch and whine about how 'evil' the series is, and then give it a thumbs down.  They are shortsighted and should not have commented, as they detract from the main review.<br />
<br />
<br />
I liked it. Go see it. <br />
It's a really good series that should be able to draw emotion out of a rock.<br />
That's all you need to hear in preparation to watch this. Everything else that you need to know, will actually be told to you in the series. Unless the company that bought the rights does worse than fansubbers...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-23-04, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people can't deal with super emotional anime, be it good or bad emotions. Anime seems to hit people on a deeper level than even the most drama filled motion picture. I can totally grasp the idea that some anime is just too debilitating to enjoy. I know people that can't watch Evangelion just because of the way it presents the human condition, in a ****ed up, roundabout sort of way. That's why I like Anime. People can't just shake anime off like a movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">08-23-04, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunslinger Girl remains one of my favorite anime, and the manga being far more disturbing than the anime. It is highly recommended, but it is hard to deal with for most, as it is not as light-hearted / shallow as most anime.<br />
<br />
Another very damn disturbing anime is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, anime of all time - Koi Kaze. I still am stunned it is being released in USA, heh.<br />
<br />
The end of Gunslinger Girl anime really put me in a shitty mood. I talked about it a while ago, I believe. I watched the last episode of Gunslinger Girl, and was put in a really shitty mood (although I loved the song), and then watched Peacemaker Kurogane mid-later episodes where a certian person died, and was in an even shittier mood.<br />
<br />
There's quite a few others that are very emotionally disturbing in anime. However I don't think Gunslinger Girl is anywhere near as depressing as Grave of the Fireflies, but that's just my personal opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">08-25-04, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, while GotF was simply outright depressing, I think GsG is more emotional overall. Mainly because of the gamut of emotions, from hate to hope to complete sorrow....<br />
<br />
<br />
...like realizing that you cannot find the series anywhere on your computer... dammit... and I still needed the last two episodes... /sigh</div></div><hr />

Don't most of the movies end up with everyone, or just about everyone dead, mangled, or completely insane?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, dont know much about movies ( only japanese movie i saw recently was Azumi, and that one ended with her and one of her friends alive, which is one more char surviving then expected :p ), but as far as anime goes ... not at all . While the &quot;non Happy Endings&quot; happen more often then in US TV series ( which is good, how boring is it to watch something knowing fully well its gonna turn out allright anyway? ), there are still plenty of Happy Ends, and occasionally a &quot;partial&quot; win ... Happy End but at a cost.<br />
<br />
In fact, i just went through my anime collection, was going to list em all with a description of the ending, but turned out to be way to many :p But the Happy Endings were much more common then the bad ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">08-26-04, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh Noes!11!1! They killed Joe!<br />
(big emotional scene/attack/whatever)<br />
Hey, look, Joe isnt really dead!<br />
(happy ending)<br />
<br />
I hate that crap :(  People who die a death that plays an emptiona;l part in the storyline need to STAY dead. Cheapens the overall effect if you know they couldn't possibly kill off a popular/main character.<br />
<br />
Guess that why i like Full Metal Alchemist so much ^_^</div></div><hr />
