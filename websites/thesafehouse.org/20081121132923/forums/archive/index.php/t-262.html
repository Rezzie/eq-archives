I also saw someone named &quot;The Messiah&quot;, who looked like Jesus.  I've seen &quot;The Flaming Queen&quot;, &quot;The Pitcher&quot; and &quot;The Catcher&quot; (in matching outfits), and a host of other names that are going to give the gms fits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I grouped with a Defender all in white, with a long white beard, a long white hairstyle, and a winged headband - by the name of &quot;Almighty&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a chap in a purple suit, with a purple fedora and an Afro - named &quot;The Original Bling&quot;<br />
<br />
Saw one remarkable Wolverine clone while my brother was dinking around with a new character in the Tutorial</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does surprise me that I haven't seen The Crow yet since the makeup and everything is all there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">all the crow's are probably waiting until the trenchcoats get added</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the GMs will land on you for this.  It's the reason the skin colors and clothing colors don't match up exactly, but apparently they have to actively avoid that M rating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saw one guy Called &quot;Mr. Useless&quot;. Looked like a complete clone of Aquaman, and his Battle cry was &quot;I can talk to fish!&quot;<br />

<br />
That's completely classic! :lol<br />
<br />
Other funny ones I've seen recently:<br />
<br />
-Fred Rogers who's Battle Cry was &quot;Want to be my neighbor?&quot; <br />
<br />
-Someone named Malibu Mahem who was a perfect Barbie clone and made great use of that disturbing looking smiling face option.<br />
<br />
-a perfect Hulk clone who's name was 'Me So Hulky'<br />
<br />
And I couldn't resist making a character named 'Miles Mannered' who was a perfect Clark Kent copy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a new one, made a totally black knight called Flesh Wound.  You can guess his battlecry i'm sure.</div></div><hr />
