I think I'm gonna try it out but some people say its satan worshiping.  I don't see how it could be but if soneone could tell me the different points of views I'd appreciate it. =)<br />

Sure, it's all fun and games until you realize there's only enough sacrificial virgins for half the group and then there is much sulking.<br />
<br />
<br />
j/k of course   The most Satanical thing that ever happened to me gaming was when the whiney Goth GM started quoting  Nietzsche and NIN when someone turned on MTV. But we never took him seriously anyway so I doubt much satanical influence came from playing.</div></div><hr />

Er, anyways, I think that's a bunch of BS :P<br />
I'm Catholic, I play D&amp;amp;D, I don't worship the devil :P<br />
Saying D&amp;amp;D is satanic is saying Cops and Robbers is criminal activity, it's just pretend.<br />
