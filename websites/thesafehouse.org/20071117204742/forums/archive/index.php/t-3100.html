<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Grendl Nighthunter</div><div class="date">07-31-03, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ages ago a few friends &amp;amp; I were involved in the best campaign I had ever played.  The games were over the top, &amp;amp; we were pretty decked out with phat gear, but it was balanced out by the fact that so were the NPCs. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I was a halfling theif, &amp;amp; I always was the guy carriyng the portable hole.  Over the course of the campaign, I managed to lose two loaded portable holes, as well as all of my magic gear, from dragon breath.<br />
<br />
I hated that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-31-03, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking items en masse' from players accomplishes 1 of 2 things.<br />
<br />
It-<br />
<br />
A) Provides the PCs a challenging situation where they are used to dealing with situations a certain way, and have to be creative<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
B) Rebalances a campaign when the DM feels like he is losing to the PCs in terms of encounters and plots. I think it's kind of funny, I think it's kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Berdusk</div><div class="date">07-31-03, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, something similar happened in a campaign I was playing in.<br />
<br />
One of the two thieves in the party had repeatedly lifted items from encounters and kept them for himself. So while the rest of the party was using +1 to +2 weapons with maybe one effect, he had a +3 axe and a +2 katana. Same deal with armor, misc items.<br />
<br />
So eventually, the cleric of the party comes across an item he's looking for. He makes his will save to not use it, and stuffs it in his bag. When we ask him about it, he tells us not to worry about it. Eventually, somehow or another, it gets pulled out of the bag. It's a Deck of Many Things.<br />
<br />
So, most people in the party decide they'll have a go at drawing a card. Uber-thief draws a card, has to fight 'Death'. With his weapons and armor, it was no problem for him. Other players draw cards, get a keep, get a magic item, avoid any one bad encounter, and so forth. I for one decided not to risk it, as I was pretty happy with my character as he was. Then uber-thief decides to draw again... and loses all of his magic items.<br />
<br />
He left early, and stopped playing the game after that.<br />
<br />
The next card drawn was a major exp bonus.<br />
<br />
The people that drew cards did so by choice and got what they got randomly, yet on the whole it managed to balance out the party fairly well for the DM, without him actually forcing anything on us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love chance...<br />
<br />
My character was never seen again, had to make a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">07-31-03, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the Deck of Many Things, one of my favorite items...<br />
<br />
My old GM used to hold 'carnivals' where PCs could bet money and items in a game of BlackJack...using the DoMT. It results in some intresting characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Healo</div><div class="date">07-31-03, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DM didnt know I had a 6 will save.  he put in the item that made us lose our items at a DC15.  everyone else was around 16-18 will save so he thought I was too. He said it was just there so if you rolled a 1 then you lost an item.<br />
<br />
He's gonna set up an assassination mission for me to get some items back before we play again.</div></div><hr />
