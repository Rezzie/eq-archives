Can someone give their impression on the breakdown on the most populous vs. least populous classes on the server?  Does it vary significantly by team? <br />
<br />
On bluebies, the most popular classes seem to be:<br />
Druid<br />
Warrior<br />
Ranger<br />
Cleric<br />
Paladin, probably...<br />
<br />
Just curious... Lisboa Bixiestinger<br />
Level 42 rogue of Bertoxxulous<br />
Warlords of Steel<br />
<br />
...and Rorer Junior<br />
Level 27 Shaman[i]</div></div><hr />

But people are finding it's more fun playing as rogues, monks, SKs and are making a switch.  So there seems to be less of an extreme, everyone seems to pick any class now.  Theres still a lack of clerics and enchanters though for obvious PvP reasons.</div></div><hr />
