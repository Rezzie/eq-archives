<br />
Watching OP atm and it looks like Powerpuff girls, only Anime style and it has same villans from what I see. I used to like Powerpuff. Will see how this goes.<br />
<br />
edit: ok, seems like its for younger audiences. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-05-06, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol yeah, definitely younger audiences. But then again, I'm a huge Pretty Cure fan, this goes right up my alley if done well. Ep 1 was good.</div></div><hr />

Well ya its a powerpuff anime :P its supposed to be younger :P. Altho it is odd that a super young anime is being subed. But that is just a guess/observation :P.</div></div><hr />

Ah ok I thought it was really lower then that heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sammyu</div><div class="date">07-05-06, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually really enjoyed the original Powerpuff Girls (the ep where the mayor is playing Zelda still cracks me up), so naturally I was curious to see what this would be like. It was... erm. interesting, to say the least, haha. Not quite my cup of tea, I think, but I'll probably watch at least a few more eps before making a final judgement.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the ED was all kinds of awesome... until the english kicked in, then I kinda went :brow :pulid</div></div><hr />

I doubt though, it sounds cool to them I guess, but for native speakers it's other way around.</div></div><hr />

You have killed your fairy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">07-06-06, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hope they shorten the dress up sequence. The one in Powerpuff girls was perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahh yah, I totally agree- the first time they went thru the whole thing I was like... this is really.... really... long. Then they did it twice more, for each of the other two characters. :zombie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">07-06-06, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, this was pretty average. Pretty cure, now THAT was a monstrously long transformation scene. Then there was the Marble Screws, Marble Screw Ultras, Max Heart, oh my. Reused footage galore!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">07-07-06, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kind of disappointed they were reduced to a standard magical girl cliche.<br />
<br />
I liked how the original PPG were super powered in their normal lives and used their powers in everyday activities.  In PPGZ they are just normal unrelated girls that just powerup after the episodes bad guy starts causing trouble.</div></div><hr />
