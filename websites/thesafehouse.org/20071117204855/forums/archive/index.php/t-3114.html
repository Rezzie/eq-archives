<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">09-08-03, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a friend (our DM) and I had a good idea last night, well we thought it was a good idea anyway, here goes...<br />
<br />
We're going to run a Dragonlance campaign here at the gaming club at school, I will run an evil campaign, he will run a good campaign. The plan is that the two parties will eventually be working against eachother, and the campaign will culminate in them fighting it out. <br />
<br />
The time-setting will be The War of the Lance, just because the Age of Mortals is no fun, and I want my Queen of Dragons. Actually the current plan is: we go on Tuesday and join a group if we can, if not we check and see if there are enough people to do one campaign, if so he will run a good campaign and I will just be a player, if there are enough to run two campaigns then we'll do the good-evil thing. <br />
<br />
This will be my first time DMing, but I've been playing for a long time. Any thoughts on this idea, or advice for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-08-03, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Big suggestion, don't try to run the evil campaign ever for a long time, dealing with evil parties is something an experienced DM should do, or someone who is hard up to has his plot line smashed into tiny bits. Being low key in the evil party will help not tick other players off when they DM under you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not much advice to give you about being a new GM, except to relax, take time and think about plots, encounters, ect.... before you give it to players. Snap decisions as a DM can be fun, but they can also be a lot of trouble, because they leave you un-prepared for what the party comes up with. You can go read my 7 pages of woe on the matter   &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most evil personalities in fantasy worlds exist in one of a couple ways.  They are uber-powerful mastermind types.  They  never leave the &quot;seemy underworld area&quot; with all their informants, bodyguards and such.  Or, they stick to small stuff that doesn't register on the &quot;good guys&quot; radar.<br />
<br />
Evil parties of players tend to think they are uber-powerful mastermind types and tend to do things that register on the &quot;good guys&quot; radar.  Once that happens, their life expectancy is severely limited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Santerre</div><div class="date">09-08-03, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way I've found to make an evil party last a decent while is to make a plot device that stops them from killing/hurting/robbing/turning on each other.  Had one GM bind a group of evils together by giving them collective awareness, so they couldn't plot on each other.<br />
<br />
Also, the players need to realize that evil can mean &quot;looks to acheive personal power without regard for whom is hurt in the process&quot; rather than &quot;is a raving homicidal maniac&quot;.  I played a Lawful Evil sorcerer once that despised killing and wouldn't do it unless his life was threatened, but had no compunctions about charming or otherwise influencing beings into serving him in ways that were not beneficial to them...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">09-08-03, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I blame the current views on evil on RPGs which offer the obvious good choice and the obvious evil choice. Evil seems to always be portrayed as insaine chaotic-evil. This will not be tolerated in my campaign (my friend may be doing the Evil group since he is the more experienced DM anyhow) but they will be working for a much larger force, the Dragon Armies in the War of the Lance, so if they start doing dumb stuff, I'll just have to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-08-03, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how are they supposed to be evil when they are supposed to be working for the army? I'm not saying it's implausible, but part of the fun of playing an evil character is the freedom from moral constraints. It is always good to set up counter measures for problem evil players(The barmaid asks you what you want to drink. HER BLOOD! I whack off her head!), but you should also let players succeed at being evil, otherwise what is the point to playing an evil campaign. I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't penalize people in the evil campaign for being evil per se, penalize them for being stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hindraak</div><div class="date">09-09-03, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">being in an army would make them more LN wouldn't it? Doing what is said, not caring about the morality of it. Unless they were commanders or an elite force or something of the like where they had more freedom and control. Immortal 'til the day I die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">09-10-03, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the players know they are eventually going to go head to head, or is it a &quot;What's a Panzerfaust do to a troll, Hans?&quot; type deal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Pdrago shadowflight</div><div class="date">09-10-03, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well its technically the DRAGON armies so i'd guess they are evil... but it depends on the age. Evil defeats itself is one of the main concepts in the dragonlance world for the dragon armies, so being in the dragon armies they would prolly be more CE than anything else, cuz they rape pillage and what not. On the other hand, in the thorn knights or whatever they were called? haven't read my books in a long time... even though they worshipped takhisis, ariakan ordered them not to harm anyone who surrendered, and not to rape and pillage etc etc. so they would prolly be LE. or to some extent LN. (the common foot soldiers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Esliim Karnth</div><div class="date">09-11-03, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, 'cept the Knights of the Thorn were after the War of the Lance.  Sooo...yeah...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">09-13-03, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had our first meeting tonight. It went very well.<br />
<br />
The PCs were sent to secure the area designated for Icewall Castle, they arrived at the port of the closest bay city and they joined a trade caravan going east to the Ice folk city then they went south to the caverns where a young White Dragon lived named Frostbite along with his ice goblin minions. They fought and subjugated the goblins, then actually beat up on the dragon and got him to help the cause as well. It only took them about 2 days of game time + 3 days of travel time, we decided to keep track of time for the benifit of the good campaign. It wasn't too hard of an play-segment, and everyone came away with a good feeling. I said no chaotic evil people in the interests of co-operation, and the evils seem to be behaving very well. We've all known eachother for all of college though, so this is much easier than with a group of strangers.<br />
<br />
Tuesday the good campaign will meet, I'll play in that (the good DM plays in the evil campaign, the evil DM plays in the good campaign) and hopefully this will be a interesting new (? it's probably been done before) way to run a campaign.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">09-18-03, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've ran a few evil campaigns and I've found one concept to be infinitely valuable. No matter how big and powerful your evil PC's are, make sure that they know that they aren't the biggest fish in the sea. An evil NPC overlord, or group of them, bossing the PC's around (giving them quests/missions) and putting the smack down when they get out of line goes a long way towards sustaining an evil campaign. A small clan or coven of high lvl renegade wizards should do the trick in a Dragonlance setting. Also, if you can balance their missions where they are seriously challenging and demand group cooperation, you can quell a good portion of the desire to PK other group members.

&quot;It has.. It has a meter that is tricky. A little wicky wacky wicky...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-18-03, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A GM I game under has this theme for one of his kind of home made games(he writes GURPS supplements). Basically, PCs are part of this mercenary company. It's second in command of the entire organization is a necromancer named dead eyes, who issues orders and assignments. Want an idea of this guy's powers? He sends the messages by making the PCs vomit up a dead raven, which comes to life and talks to them. Not something you really want to @#%$ with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zykium</div><div class="date">09-19-03, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_RabidMonkey01</div><div class="date">09-23-03, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wraine is right.<br />
I play an evil Mofo in my friends campaign and there's always some !$#@'r standin over me telling me what to do. Though he won't restrict me in anyway...just i have to pay the conciquences of my actions and those actions can be anything that is plausible in that world and with that character, hence I'm a Vampire so peole need magical weapons to hit me but i don't run rampant through the city killing all the guards...well once but that was circumstance and i payed for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">09-24-03, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play what could be consitered an &quot;Evil&quot; character in a Shadowrun campaign.  Due to a history she is named &quot;Ghost&quot; and her father was named &quot;Ghost Maker&quot; by the gang.  He was a Night-One Elf.  She ended up Albino, with abit of magical talent.<br />
<br />
Due to some more of her history she ended up being &quot;Friends&quot; easier with people that were already dead.  She also follows the madness tradition and she can only summon spectres. (Basiclly they are nature spirits but they can only be summoned if someone or something had died there and that is what was summoned)  She also has the merit Spirit Affinity Spectres.<br />
<br />
Needless to say she turned out like a necromancer to some.  She shows more loyalty to the dead than to the living and hence has no regard for life.  She dosnt bother to spare people if theres no need to, but she also wont kill someone for no reason.  She also &quot;Collects&quot; haunted locations.   Spending all her cash on the warehouses from the Night Of Rage and various other buildings.<br />
<br />
Well in the current campaign there is a threat that the group is fighting without pay.  A group is going to try and level Seattle with a nuke.  (Humanis-poli-club that beleives seattle is to tainted with metahumanity)<br />
Ghost is working towards stopping them as well, the rest of the group is confused as to why she is doing it without pay as well.  The other groups that she has been with (This is her fourth group, she was the only surviving member of the other three.  And the rep on the street is that she was responsable for them) always thought of her as &quot;Doing it for the money&quot;.  Plus having an iniated front-line combat mage that can call back the dead for a chat was a benifit.<br />
<br />
The reason for her helping that nobody has asked...  &quot;If they blow up the city all of the dead will have no place to stay&quot;  My actual theme for her madness is that she is like a spectral park ranger.  Preserving the habitat so to speak.<br />
The I play her however, she comes off as a pure evil [female dog] who has no loyalties to anybody.  Yet they still deal with her due to her power, and partially fear.<br />
<br />
More than once she has put someone into Deadly Agony (Via agony spell with deadly damage level) and Quickened the spell making it permenant because they really pissed her off.  One in particular she enchanted so that they no longer need food or water survive.  Though they will still feel the affects of hunger/thirst. Then shapchanged them slightly so that they could breath water.  Finally locking them in a cage and dropping them into the bay.  That poor fellow will be down there until someone finds him, he gets eaten by something down there, or dies of old age.<br />
<br />
For her she dosnt have someone above her keeping her in check, her own madness is doing that.  As long as there is Something to keep the evil acts from going out of control then it isnt to hard to keep one alive for awhile.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I absolutely love playing that character.</div></div><hr />
