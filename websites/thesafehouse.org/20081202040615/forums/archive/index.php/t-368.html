<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Winterdawn</div><div class="date">06-08-00, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to start a rogue website, and one of the features I want to add is role playing stories.<br />
Since I am still a new rogue myself, level 14, I can not offer rewards.  I wish to have a screen shot<br />
 of the rogue posted alongside the story and include a caption with the rogue's level and server.<br />
<br />
Please send these things to febnbambo@earthlink.net<br />
<br />
Other features that I plan on having are, this will take a while since I'd rather play then write. =)<br />
<br />
rogue armor, weapons, and quest, as well as maps to the rogue guilds in each city,<br />
 and places to buy throwing items, pottery supplies, poisons.<br />
Most of the above will probably be links to other places. my link to tips and quides will be simple,<br />
&quot;the safehouse&quot; of course.   Any help with this or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
