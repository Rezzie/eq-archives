<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">04-22-07, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple question, if I want to play with my friends in the US are the servers in this game split into US and EU like WoW or are they same as in some other games like how they at least used to be in EQ? I'm not sure which version to order to be with my friends since the US is a bit more hassle to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-22-07, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm not positive but today someone in game today said they were French (they said this in French so I'm not sure if they were a French person in the US or in France). I'll look around their forums for you.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well on this page it does list servers that I have not seen as a drop down choice when I play.<br />
http://www.lotro-europe.com/service.php<br />
<br />
So you can take the unofficially as, you will need to buy the US version to get access to the US servers I suppose.<br />
<br />
Here's the forum I got to when I hit the &quot;EU Portal&quot; button and then a few more buttons:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">04-22-07, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! Would be really appreciated. I've tried looking on the game's various FAQs but can't seem to find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rune</div><div class="date">04-23-07, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are different US and European versions. You have to have the correct version to play on the servers you wish.<br />
<br />
I haven't been following the developing situation much but several weeks ago Turbin had stated that they would be blocking isps to enforce regionalisation of servers. There was a big uproar against this.<br />
<br />
Since then I have seen thread headings that they would no longer be doing this but since I never actually read the threads I can't say for sure.<br />
<br />
I would say yes, you can play on any server you wish if you have the proper version but I can't say that with any authority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koru</div><div class="date">04-23-07, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah. Well that doesn't sound very good :-/ I might have to just get a life instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rune</div><div class="date">04-23-07, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked deeper into this.<br />
<br />
Yes you can play on US servers from Europe. You just need the US client to do so.<br />
<br />
Buy the game from a US distributor over the net and you're gold.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">04-24-07, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I didn't back to you sooner Koru, but my findings agree with what Rune said, you can play on the US servers if you buy a US game.</div></div><hr />
