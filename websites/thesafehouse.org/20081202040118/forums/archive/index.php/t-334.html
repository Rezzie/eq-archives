<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sylf Z</div><div class="date">04-21-00, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, when I was level 29, a very frusterated POS rogue who was level 49 wanted to duel me...<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?  why me mr. highlevelrogueman?&quot; the little bard asked.<br />
<br />
the rogue replied by grunting &quot;Me mad, me died...again, when me tried to kill a green thing...I am an idiot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why would you want to pick on little ol' me?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, me know I can kill a pathetic bard that is 20 levels lower than me...shut up and accept the duel!&quot;<br />
<br />
The poor bard accepted to duel and the two fought.  <br />
The dumb rogue at first thought he could just straight up toe to toe the rogue, but boy was that rogue dumb, a little wee bard like myself wasnt going to stand in one place, OH NO!  in fact, I had SOW on still from my hunting in Cazic.  So, I ran around and around the stupid rogue until he grew dizzy, and dead from my bellow! HAHA! stupid rogue, you just lost and the message spammed across all the land!<br />
<br />
Well, thats just about it, thought it would be kinda funny to tell you guys...anyway, see ya later!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">04-22-00, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well one day not too long ago some big mean (red) bard decides she wants to come bother me and kill (attempt to anyway) everything that I attack.  After several minutes I grow rather annoyed and a verbal argument ensues.  We argued back and forth for a wee bit and then she challenged me to a duel! &quot;Whooopie!&quot; I thought as I ever so roguishly smeared poison all over my serrated bone dirk.  As I positioned myself before her for the initial strike I hit accept and gave her a nice sharp stab to the back.  Hey! 140 backstab, thats not too bad,but the 150 damage from the poison is even nicer.  So nice infact that I might try it again I thought as I stepped back into the shadows.  I'll just take my time reapplying this poison since all the silly (red) bard is doing is spinning around swing those swords at the air.  The big mean bard finally wisens up and starts to sing a lil, but thats okay cause I'm right behind her by now anyway, so I go and poke her in the back again.. ooooo, 125 isn't too bad, but the other 150 again from the poison is also pretty nice.  While this poison tactic works very well, poison is just too big a pain to waste on this silly (red) bard so I decide to fight it out now, gnome to half-elf.  So she goes about her business swing those confounded swords of hers at me, which I found quite annoying so I knocked one out of her hand.  She didn't seem to notice, which suited me just fine since I was busy pokin gaping holes in her knees at the moment.  Ooo, my backstab is back, so I use my nifty swivel move and pop up behind her and gave her a good poke in the rump iffin ya know what I mean.  I didn't have any poison on this time so my dirk was nice enough to proc for me.  I think the poke musta stung cause she spun around and started slapping at me with that empty hand of hers.. what a silly (red) bard she was, doesnt she know that swords work much better? I wasnt going to say anything though since the fight was going my way, this silly (red) bard had about one bub of life left while I'd lost just a  little more than half a bub.  So I poked at her knees for a few seconds more then ducked under her legs and poked her in the back again! Oh what fun this is! About this time she must have noticed that she was slapping me with nothing but her bare hand (she didnt seem to be hitting much with her offhand) so she pulls back out her puny little steak knife (ykesha) which I didnt think was a good idea so I knocked it back out of her hand again.  She must have been paying attention this time though cause it came back into her hand pretty fast, but thats okay, since that first swing of hers I riposted and knocked that silly (red) bard unconsious with.  Feeling a bit sorry for her, since she was laying on the ground bleeding and I still  had not lost a bub of life I bandaged her back into consiousness, then I remembered, hey, she's a stupid hobag.  So I quickly knocked her back into unconsiousness again, I was going to try to be nice and bandage her one more time but I guess I dont know my own strength cause I killed her.  Oh well, one less silly (red) bard.</div></div><hr />

I ever tell you about the time I killed a 50th level wizard? Granted, I had 200extra hp cause of a cleric buff but at 35th level I'd say that was an accomplishment.  Uhh, so there!</div></div><hr />
