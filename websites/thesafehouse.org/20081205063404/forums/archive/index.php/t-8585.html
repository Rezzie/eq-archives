<br />
Get yerself a wizard who can port to hate, and a cleric (preferable with clicky stick or 96% rez)<br />
<br />
Die someplace safe, leave belongings on yer corpse.. have wizzy port you up naked and buffed, as soon as you get to the plane, have cleric rez you.. leave the rez window open while you wander.. if you get in any trouble, click yes and yer safe.. only problem I had was that when I picked up the book I lost the window and the cleric had to recast, I had no aggro at the time so was no big deal<br />
<br />
Good Luck and let us know how it worked out.<br />

<br />
Did the run last night, and I must say, it was easier than the old hate!  Had a 65 wiz buddy port us up there, i left my gear in the bank.  First, he cast translocate to bindpoint on me, said I have 3 mins or so to accept.  Then he cast translocate on himself, 3 mins to accept.  Then he pulled the Loathing Liches off the bridge when you first zone in, i ran passed as he pulled them.  Then he translocated (accepted) and got out, while I was omw to the book.  Got to the door where the book is supposed to be, opened it, Loathing Lich is there.  So I run passed it, turn right, see a Spite Golem and a desk with the book on it.  Grab the book, get hit 2 times by Loathing Lich and hit translocate.  Took total time of 25 seconds  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps  use the map above, its drawn to a T<br />

Well that map above is exact, so once I entered the building, i was pretty much safe because the TL box was up.  Even if Im stunned from the Lich i can TL.  I ran in, turned right, and saw the book, once you see the book, you kinda focus on the book ya know    got it, gated  hehe<br />

Hoping to avoid XP loss....then, it won't matter what XP % the cleric rez's me for, correct?  So I can pay a low level cleric with a 10% rez to stand there and wait for me?  Can you rez someone that dies in a duel?<br />

This sounds doable....</div></div><hr />

I think rez time against a mob death is 3 hours and rez time against a duel is like 10 minutes or so (rough guess, somewhere around that time).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lukar</div><div class="date">06-19-03, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Map is very accurate, GJ.  Finished the run this morning.  When I went up last nite (nekkid and alone) I made it all the way to the house with the book, opened the door and ...... a loathing lich (sees thru hide/sneak).  DAMN.. what am I gonna do now ??????  Camped out in a safe spot and checked back this morning .... lich still there *frown*.  Guildie came up with a different idea than the TL one (wish we had thought of that 1st).  Gated back to Thurg, grabbed my gear from bank, got buffed to hell, ported back up, and made a mad dash to the Book.  Grabbed it and died.  Wizzie ported me and a necro back up and necro summoned corpse, looted my gear, TL back out and voila I have the Book of Souls.<br />
<br />
I didn't mind the XP loss so much 'cause I got my Book, but wished we had come up with the TL idea first it would have saved me some XP grinding.  Oh well, I have the Book and that's all I wanted so not too bad a trade off.<br />
<br />
Good Luck getting your books fellow rogues.  One word of caution though,  I would have been really upset to get to the nightstand and the Book not be there.  Not sure what kind of timer it's on but have read anywhere from 5 to 12 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhow, time for renux 2.0 and then a second try at general.. FYI if anyone ever wipes on the general, be sure to have someone keep him busy while you re-buff and stuff, he depopped I'd say in about 20-30 min for me while we got everyone rezzed and medded up .. hence the second run at my epic...  At least I got my cazic quill side quest done already ... Well, good luck to you all, and a nice job on the map.<br />

I am a gnome, and gnomes rock... but they're short!<br />
When I got the the nightstand with the book, I could barely see the book, cause I was so short! I jumped up and down and tried to get it, with a couple of hundred mobs hitting me... and I died. Next time, I brought my Mask of Obtenebration, got SoE cast on me (before I entered PoH) and cast Illusion erudite (in PoH), gave mask to wizard, had wizard cast transloc, sneakhide halfway to book, run past mobs that saw me, grab book (cause erudites are tall, man!) and press YES!<br />
<br />
So congo-rats me on my BOOK OF SOULS! :P</div></div><hr />

I finally went up and got mine this morning. Wasnt a single other person in there cept for me and the wizzie that ported me up.  Only got turned around once and when I got back on track and made it to the house the first mob that saw through hide/sneak was right on the steps so just ran like hell past him as he started casting and grabbed book and accepted the TL. Whole run was easily under 1 min from zone in even with getting lost.  But MAN what a min.<br />

<br />
Took forever to find a wiz with the guts, but yesterday my dreams came true!<br />
<br />
I guess the reagent can only be purchased in Neriak?  All the way back?<br />
<br />
Anyway, a banshee on the left of the first staircase/bridge saw though sneak/hide.  I debated taking another route, but ended up skating up the right side railing and avoided argo.  Nothing, not even a liche and the mobs I con'd in the building with the book saw through sneak/hide the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
Of course, I accepted my translocate as soon as I grabbed the book so something may have been on the way from another room in the building, to get me, but I wasn't sticking around to find out.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the map and thank you all for the very good advice.  The wiz method works like a charm.</div></div><hr />

Got a Pally to kill me in arena, got a SoW and a port up, had pally cast rez and kept the box. And there is a Spectre on the bridge that sees invis. I tried to find another way around, and got aggroed by something that conned indifferent 15 seconds before.<br />
<br />
Start again, the Spec is still on the bridge. Well, I thought, it's not going to go anywhere so I guess I'll try get past it. I hugged the left rail of the stairs and no aggro. (This is at 1 kill into 46). Now I don't have a map, so I just head generally south. I see a big cathedral, go into the building directly opposite, up the stairs to the right, pat the repulsive rat there on the head, take my book and and accept the rez.<br />

<br />
some useful info, im a 58-59 lev rogue, and had absolutly zero problem walking right to it and standing in the corner next to the dresser where it pops, nothing sees u but an ocasional loathing litch, but those are easy to avoid, over all im very happy,,,<br />
<br />
Thanks very much to all who made the maps and posted the info, it made all the diffrence to this part of the run...<br />
<br />
GL to all, its defintly a rush.. oh BTW,,, i suggest turning OFF your sound card, the added stress of the run with the background hisses and growles are almost too much when your already sweating bullets...<br />

An added precaution you can use is to bring the small idol that drops off the named Orc in HHP (name of idol eludes me at this moment).  This idol casts one time Divine Aura (DA) on any class.  This will give you plenty of time to go inside, find and loot book.  IF you have an instant gate potion or tl message waiting to be used you will need to click off the DA effect before hand.

<br />
At zone in there is a fountain, you are in a u shaped area that extends out pretty far. just ahead and to the right of the zone in is a bridge of sorts with 4 mobs standing on it.<br />
<br />
Cross over this bridge. Directly in front of you is a building, skirt just to the left of this building and follow this corridor till it opens up into a large area with a large building with HUGE steps kitty corner to your right. Go to these steps. Stand in the very middle of them and face away from the building they lead into. You should be staring in the general direction of the zone in. <br />
Directly ahead of you is a small little platform with 4 colums rising from each corner. Sometimes there is a mob standing in the middle of this. Just behind it is a small building. Go into this building. Ahead are some steps. Up the steps and turn right. ANother small set of steps leads into a bedroom with a dresser on the back wall. The Book of Souls spawns on this dresser.<br />
<br />
So to recap and make it easy.<br />
1) zone in<br />
2) face out of the zone in and proceed to the steps on the right that lead up over a small bridge with 4 mobs.<br />

Followed the map in this thread. Only problem was there was a Loathing Lich standing there when I opened the door. He saw though invis and sneak/hide. My 52 druid was there, so I snared the lich, tried anyway snare resisted. Lich went after my druid. I ran in grabbed the book and ran back out, druid had already gated out. For some reason I lost sneak hide, maybe because I grabbed the book, and I got aggro, ran my ass back to the zone in and died. Didnt care, my cleric was there rezzed me. And now I have my BoS. WOOOT. Thanks so much for the help from my fellow rogues. The information you guys have provided has been super.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This time around, the only thing I knew was that it was somewhere in the middle of the zone.  I dropped my stuff in the bank and paid a wiz to port me up, did some sneaking around for about 10 minutes, found the book, looked for the group that was fighting there (lucky me) and had wiz in that group punt me out.<br />

<br />
Last time I did my book it was the OLD hate, original hate. I anticipated the two level hate, and turned out that was also changed, fun fun.<br />
<br />
I wandered around for a bit, the wizard that had given me the ride (after a week of trying to find one willing to do so) was nice and chatted with me as I walked around with my TL window up. Unfortunately, I was completely lost in this new place, and the timer expired.<br />
<br />
I kept roaming, and finally asked on the ring. I had already found the maestro, assuming the book was still near him. The ring saved the day, and I got my book.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_schimaera</div><div class="date">01-13-04, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all<br />
<br />
I would like to relate my story to get the Book of Souls.<br />
I had read ll the possible information and was one day, naked and alone at the zone in in Plane of Hate. <br />
I made my way (by maps found here and descitpions) to the place where the book must be.. the little house just north of the Cathedrals Stairs. So far all was ok, since nothing saw through Hide/Sneak. I open the door and in the entrance there was a mob (Spectre looking thing) which could see me (kos) . I waited long, but the mob never moved. I knew that the book must be up the right stairs and into the little room. <br />
I had a Rune IV cast on me by a chanter, before I ported up and this is what I did: I charged, ran in, grabbed the book (no &quot;are you sure you want to loot this no drop item&quot;-box appeared, phew) while the rune was being eaten away by the mobs attacking me. I ran back out and made it to the houses door sill, where I was massacrated in seconds. <br />
So I ported up again, brought me a Cleric, dragged the corpse to the safe spot at zonein, rezzed and gated back out (Thurgadin Gate potion).. *with* the Book  <br />
<br />
I dont know if that Mob (which sees through) is new or not, it is not described in other reports.. But this one never moved from the entrance. It would have been impossible to retrieve the Book of Souls without that Chanter Rune.<br />
<br />
Good luck <br />

<br />
That's the point of having the Resurrection or Translocate box up. As soon as you grab the book, you can poof out of the zone. You only have to be able to survive long enough to get past the mob, grab the book, and hit the Yes button in the box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No personal experience here, but everything I've read about SoS says that any see-invis mob has a chance of seeing through SoS. There's no set list of mobs that can, as one time they might not and next time they might.</div></div><hr />

       Just to update: - I did my BoS run last night with much ease. Went to Neriak last night and hit De mask (dubious with clerics and amiable to merchants(thanks Red Wine)), bought an Innorruk stone and met a guild wizard at stones and up we went. There was another guild farming the zo. I ran down to the room and opened the front door only to see a Revenant. Luckily it conned indifferent. A cleric and Ire Ghast were behind him but had their backs facing me. After conning both of them neither could see SoS. Took the stairs immidiatlely to the right and saw another Ire Ghast standing in front of a table with a book on it. Conned Indifferent..walked behind him picked up book and ran back to wizard for a safe port down. Picking up the book did not break hide/sneak. Took all of 1 min from port up to port down. The map is drawn perfect, kudos to the artist. Good luck rogues.<br />
<br />
word out</div></div><hr />

Just take your time, con the stuff you pass. Head towards Maestro's steps, Arch across from them, go through to door, inside and take the right stairs up. Book is sitting up open facing towards you, plenty of mobiles in the room to kill you if you mess up so be cautious, but farely easy, did it on first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username"></div><div class="date">01-20-04, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got the BoS the other day for a twink-alt (yeah, yeah, no whining), and found it is MQable.   <br />
<br />
Nothing saw thru SoS along the way.  Took 30 seconds from port in to TL out to get the book (left TL window up from wizard).  Confirm the post (two above) that says hide/sneak doesn't drop when looting.<br />
<br />
Major kudos on that map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Beolyen</div><div class="date">01-28-04, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, heres my story...<br />
<br />
First...just to let you know the book spawns ever 10 hours, I have conformed this due to the fact that it was up when I zoned in and some one took it, then 10 hours later, it was up again...so time may be a little less, but no more than 10 hours.<br />
<br />
Next - PoH Zone<br />
<br />
When you zone in, you are facing East(depending) if not face east...you will see that to the right of you are some stairs that kinda look like a bridge, but no water or anything under it...just stairs with 4 mobs on it...when I first came in, there was one mob that seeinvis later that one despawn and spawned another that also seeinvis the third pop was a chest...NO SEE INVIS...so I ran past him, I didnt know where the book was, I had heard of this little map but couldnt find it till after I found the spawn point of the book. Well, just follow the map, it works very good, there may be 2 mobs that will see you one on the bridge and one inside the &quot;House&quot; but on the spawn when I got past the bridge mob that was a chest, there was also no see invis mobs inside the house. The zone is huge compaired to old hate. <br />
<br />
Get that book!<br />
Once you use the map to locate the book, Congratz, you have it, just grab it and hide right away otherwise if the mobs agro you, just run out of the house and die on the steps in front of you or some where like that...I recomend the steps this way when you go back for your corpse...you dont get agro by wondering mobs. Come back loot your corpse with a gate potion and get out or have wizzy port you out...what ever, you know how to get out of a zone. But inside the house there are 5 mobs you must open a door to get inside and when you open the door BAM a mob is staring right at you, I have never see this mob be a see invis mob but I have heard its possible. Stay Close to the right and go up the RIGHT stair case, there is a Mob on the top of the stair case that is RIGHT next to the stand that the book spawns on. Also, its not really a Stand, its more of a dresser...NOT THE TABLE or Chair or bed. <br />
<br />
No UP!<br />
Well that sux, dont worry if its not up just go sit on the stairs and either stay and play with your self or camp, what ever, you may want to keep checking every hour though, as long as you are where the steps end and the door enterence begins, you are safe, I sat there for the full 10 hours and NO agro, although my stammy was very low since I forgot to bring food so the walk to the house became slow, but hey so is Sneak...the only thing kinda freaky about sitting next to the stairs is that their 2 wondering mobs around(dont worry they dont agro you) but one that sits between the pillars some times will look like he runs right at you and then goes to the left and wonders around...this some times scared me that he saw me and was gonna beat my ass! but no...Well thats all the info I got...just have some balls and try it, you will be glad that you did, plus all the noises and constant strange messages are a RUSH!<br />

Every walkthrough I've found says 10 hours.  I've been up here in PoHate since 9 hours after the last rogue snagged it, and it's now been 13 hours.   :hmph <br />
