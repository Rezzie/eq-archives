<br />
Didn't get all the way through it yet, but what I have gotten to so far is pretty well done, though I think the art is sub-par.  And I didn't notice any NPC stats for the major Dragonlance characters (missed 'em perhaps?) but kinda sad that they weren't included. <br />
I'm currently playing: Lionheart</div></div><hr />

I'll probably get this book at some point though, just to read. <br />
<br />
and AU kicks ass :P</div></div><hr />

He really likes those things that are theifs but don't know it, forget what they're called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard through the grapevine that there will be a living-style campaign based in the DLCS, and that Margret Weis will be writing a number of the early adventures.<br />
<br />
Not confirmed by any stretch, but I played yesterday with a guy who says he's involved.  That would kinda neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kender. They're called Kender</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lady Kaylan</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I know there is already one non-WotC released supplement done by Weiss and their are more on the way.  So that part is at least true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorashus</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love Kender... soooo fun to play. Great fun to play a happy go lucky character that is unbelievably curious, has absolutely no fear of anything, and the habit of &quot;finding&quot; things everywhere he goes. <br />
<br />
Now Kender in Ravenloft.... *shiver*<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what his insides look like?&quot; *pulls a lil dagger*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you seen the vampire kender's picture?!? It's the scariest @#%$ thing I've ever seen! &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">09-02-03, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't need to see a picture to know I never wanna meet a Kender Vampire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
:runs away in fear.<br />
<br />
Now...draconian might be fun to play...<br />
<br />
<br />
But a kender...man that'd be awesome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">09-05-03, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you could convince them to go away if you gave them a shiny silver fork bent in the shape of a cross</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kender Vampire: I vant to suck your blo...ooh...a shiny object!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">09-06-03, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what does a kender vampire do? bite you in the ass, without you or it knowing until 30 minutes later when you both all of a sudden notice hairs in the poor thing's teeth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-06-03, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some 2nd ed. babble..from the Ravenloft Monsterous Compendium...<br />

# of attacks: 1<br />

+1 or or better magic weapon to hit<br />
<br />
Anyone struck by the claw of a Kender vampire must save vs. paralysis or be unable to act on the next round of combat. Whether or not the save is passed, the victim loses one point loss from both intellegence and wisdom.  Death results in becoming a vampire.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a kender vamp once per hour can laugh 20 yard radius, save vs. spell or treat as if pc looked upon a symbol of insanity. <br />
<br />
Wooden weapons that strike a kender are destroyed.<br />
<br />
2 Hp Regen per round<br />
<br />
Kender vamps that are reduced to 0 hp are not totally destroyed. The kender vamp assumes spiritual form and flees. Not being able to return for 12 turns to it's coffin traps it in it's polertgeist form.<br />
<br />
Kender Vamps can assume this poltergeist form at will, with all the powers relegated to a polergeist. If slain in this form, the kender vamp is totally destroyed.<br />
<br />
Kender Camps are immune to sleep, charm, hold spells, including all mind effecting magic. They are totally immune to poisons and toxins and diseases. Heat and cold based attacks do 1/2 damage. <br />
<br />
They are however rather easy to turn, they turn as wraiths. Taking the hookpah from a Kender vamp and using it against them is very effective against them, it will not be destroyed as per the kender vamp ability, and a 19 or 20 results in impaling the kender vamp, killing it instantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not exactly fun for a party to run into.</div></div><hr />
