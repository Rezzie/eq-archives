As it is, I see little reason to raise your poisoning past the level it takes to make muscle lock 1.<br />

<br />
The initial resist seems to be about the same as muscle lock 1 (I only use muscle lock 1 and spirit of sloth). It has always worn off after 6-8 seconds in pvp (granted I haven't used it a ton cause it always seems to wear off so quickly). I can only assume that it either has a very low fixed duration or that it checks vs resist each round (like root). Either way I think it sucks, the only thing that makes snare better than root in pvp is the fixed duration which is why I spent so much coin to get to the level for buyable snare components.<br />
<br />
Yes, that is a quote from Lenti <br />
<br />
It takes longer than 8 seconds to kill other melees.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_NFlyte Ribsplitter</div><div class="date">05-11-01, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirit of Slot has a max duration of 1 tick/level, but as each tick rolls around, they do get another chance to resist the poison.  &amp;lt;L55, usually lasts close to full duration, for me.  &gt;L55, it usually lasts 1-5 ticks.<br />
<br />
I've found that it takes me RL DAYS to gather enough components to make Inferno Blood worth the trouble (15-20 poisons), but it's a VERY nice poison, when it isn't resisted.  Plus, when it isn't resisted, I've never had it hit for less than max, unless I kill my prey before the DoT finishes (30 seconds really is a long time, especially against casters).<br />
<br />
Stiffening Ergot (Paralyze 3), is usually my favorite for most duels.  At my skill level I VERY rarely fail the make and the sacs are easy to farm (Just run through FoB, tapping/throwing at each one you find, train them to one end, and kill them all)...<br />
<br />
My only problem is, when I'm using it against a Wiz.  How DOES Yonder work, anyway?  Is there any way to try and predict where they'll pop?</div></div><hr />
