<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jord</div><div class="date">12-28-99, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always up for adventure, I decide to dive into the depths of Lower Guk in search of some fun.  Discovering that my good friend Mordrick is also looking for some fun, we team up with other members of his guild in search of adventure… <br />
  <br />
 Wandering the halls, we lay waste to Minotaurs and Frogluk’s around every corner.  Feeling invincible, we approach the castle looking for more frogs to sink our daggers into.  Upon turning a corner we come upon a Kor Shaman, feeling brave they attack in a gallant effort to slay the beast. <br />
  <br />
 Mordrick and I fight against overwhelming odds in a battle that shall be sung about for years to come.  No matter how hard we hit the beast, it refused to yield, laying waste to Delena, the beautiful Wizard and then attacking Lundia our only healer.  Mordrick calls for an escape as Lundia falls, but alas Cosmos, our other brave Wizard, is unable to complete his concentration and is too drained from the attempt.  Mordrick is the next to fall to the foul beast. <br />
  <br />
 Cosmos yells for me to run -- knowing that I have very little chance to escape and also knowing that if I run, Cosmos is doomed, I turn my back on the beast and begin to attack his pet to get its attention.  Cosmos backs away from the pet as the pet turns to attack me, just as Cosmos begins to make one final attempt to save our lives, a huge water elemental joins in the battle, all is certainly lost.  With little fear and plenty of determination, I leap to engage the Elemental, all the while yelling at Cosmos for him to get out, he has the only chance for survival.  As I see Cosmos disappear into the smoke, I turn my back to the huge water elemental and smile at the Kor Shaman, let’s dance. <br />
  <br />
 OOC: 	Needless to say, I did not survive that battle and in addition lost level 38, but as I appeared inside of the gates of my home Neriak, I smiled a warm smile, that death was well earned and well fought, the only regret is that I could not have saved more.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
 I suspect that that one timely death will give me plenty more groups in the future.</div></div><hr />
