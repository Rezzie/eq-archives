<br />
Possible to do solo, but is much easier with a partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabrasis</div><div class="date">11-12-04, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pulled it off solo a couple days back. Pretty much you gotta sneak up to the top of the tower, when you get to the top of the tower, Sap the guy guarding the chest, loot it, jump down the stairs and sprint out to lose agro.<br />
<br />
Once that's done, you just have to pp the malformed drone (hits for 250ish),  MAKE SURE YOU ARE BEHIND HIM OR HE WILL GANK YOU <br />
<br />
after that bring the stuff to the man, turn it in to get the touch of zanzil. When that's done talk to the gnome downstairs, then you have to find some thread, wild flowers, a leaded vial, and a bronze tube.<br />
<br />
Thread is in Finer threads on the ground. Wild Flowers are at the gardener (i believe it's near stormwind keep), leaded vials from the poison supplier, and the bronze tube either get it made or get lucky and buy it from an engineer supplier.<br />
<br />
(if you want to get rid of the poison sooner, you can either die or get a high level cure ( I think ) )<br />
<br />
But if you do the quest, it's worth like 1600 xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">11-12-04, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I died accidentally (did pretty much everything out of order, opened the chest first and died on the first attempt to get the key), the poison went away, but the quest to remove it was still doable. <br />
<br />
How have people's experiences been sapping that guy, anyway? The first time I tried to engage him I died in about 3 hits, so I didn't go that route. Myself (at 22 or 23?), another similar lvl rogue, and a lvl 30 took him down together. I know the quest text says they're all weak and easy, but hell, it actually started with the lvl 30 just fighting him herself, and the rest of us jumped in when she was having trouble. I wouldn't have guessed a solo sap would be reliable, considering he seems for all intents and purposes on par with elites.<br />
<br />
(Erm, kind of replying to both threads at once.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maedie</div><div class="date">11-12-04, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done this quest twice, first on closed beta then on stress test 2. =)  Both times i was able to sneak up and sap the guy on top, but it took a couple deaths to do it without him seeing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">11-13-04, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't have to worry about sapping him, as another fool ran up the tower and aggro'd him, dragging him down to the bottom of the tower/out of the tower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cevil</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sapping him works well, but once you make it to the top level he knows if you are there, if stealthed he will eventually start talking to you, however...I'm not really sure if this causes him to aggro you or not as a lvl 27 rogue jumped on him the second I made it up there, leaving me with just enough time to loot the chest and watch him get eaten by the lvl 26 elite guarding the chest. I just jumped down the stairway and hit sprint when I got to the bottom to clear aggro up.<br />
<br />
  I wouldn't say the quest is very hard solo at all. If you use ambush on the mobs inside the tower on the way up, it kills them with one hit as part of the quest. And a 1/2 decent sap on the elite should give you just enough time to grab and go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yumako</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where does this quest start? I thought it was in Stormwind and got 2 quests there. One took me to Lakeshire where I got a certificate of thievery (have no clue what to do with this) and the other had me going to Westfall to look for some NPC by a tower. I was guessing this was the tower right by griffens, but I never found the NPC. I even tried scouting through the tower that's surrounded by the lvl 22-24 Defias thugs and didn't find anything. <br />
<br />
This was all on the last day of beta, so it might have been bugged or something but I wanted to see how the quest worked for when it went retail. So for example, the tower in Westfall had a ginormous demon in it that isn't normally there since it was the last night and there were demons all over. So what's the scoop on this quest, was I looking in the right place and it was borked, or do I need to try someplace else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AzmirFV</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, the NPC is there, As I never got the quest, but I have a habit of fully scouting out everything before I engage the quests, so I know the basic locations of all the mobs and will have an easier time locating them.......+ so I know and can plan shortcut routes from place to place.<br />
<br />
But what your looking for, is an NPC, when facing the tower, she is to the left near the trees in stealth. I bumped into her on accident thinking it was some Horde watching me, pretty cool, she's crouched looking in somewhat of a pounce position.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sucked cuz I only got to 17 in the stress, but the good thing is, I didn't ruin most of the Alliance stuff and it will be my first time running through. Although I did get relatively far with the Horde Side during the first ST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, she is just hiding out. It's a great quest.<br />
<br />
I don't think that I ruined the alliance stuff for me. I had a great time doing the quests and reading the story (and reporting a bunch of apparent glitches).<br />
<br />
The quest is not terribly hard at 20. I died once, and I still blame a gnome for that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cevil</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's the tower that is off the coast of the river, kinda close to the bridge to duskwood, in westfall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VexingVelocity</div><div class="date">11-21-04, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta say, I had more fun doing this quest than I did getting my Ragebringer in EQ.   I really enjoyed all the options you have to completing it, either sneaking your way to the top of the tower and running out with the item or assassinating every guard along the way by exploiting their weaknesses.  I hope there are other rogue-specific quests out there like this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twolight</div><div class="date">12-03-04, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished it at lvl 22...(had try at lvl 20...tons fail for the key)<br />
All I want to say...I pull Klaven away tower by myself&amp;lt;not sap way&gt;<br />
and sneak up again for quest item...quite easy at lvl 22</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekoken</div><div class="date">12-03-04, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I failed 15 times or so picking the key at 21.  Succeeded once but he moved out of range so I lost the window before I could loot.  I gave up on it.  If I wanted to waste time camping a mob over and over again for another try at the random number generator I'd still be playing EverQuest.  I think I may have to quit playing online RPGs.  This kind of crap should have some basis on the player's skill rather than being a random decision if the mob detects the pick or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinestro</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the quest yesterday, it was pretty easy if you knew what you needed to do. <br />
<br />
First just pickpocket the Drone, he his hard to if you get aggro - vanish and move away to try again. <br />
<br />
The 2nd part was also pretty easy, took two tries. When you get up top, make sure your Vanish is ready. SAP the NPC, open the chest and Vanish. After that I just walked right now of there with no issues. <br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berael</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't even need Vanish; the quest is level 20 and Vanish isn't until 22.<br />
<br />
I just did this quest solo at 20th with no problems.  Still one of my favorite quests so far!</div></div><hr />

Accept your res and stealth IMMEDIATELY and you're right there, ready to sap him. When I opened the chest and he woke up, I jumped the railings all the way down, hit Sprint when I touched dirt and bolted out of the door.</div></div><hr />

The first time around I met with the chick after doing the inside of the tower, so I just snuck past everyone. It's much more fun to one-shot 'em as you go. <br />
<br />
By the way.. did they take out that little flavor scene when two of the guards talk about going on break? My whole time creeping around this time I didn't catch it happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bengel Tyger</div><div class="date">12-13-04, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw them talking about a break.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malevolence</div><div class="date">12-22-04, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this one last night solo at 20 - if you ignore the multiple deaths due to the drone outside and me not reading the quest correctly (I thought I had to pickpocket the chest guard... there was lots of DOHs! heard in my house when I figured it out), it was pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Did get a locked box off of Kraven when I picked his pocket (copper loot), picked the chest instead of getting the key (gave me book and another point in lockpicking) and after about 6 deaths, picked the key off the drone.  Not sure if it was luck or the fact that I snuck up close, stopped moving then picked (instead of attemping to pick while moving).<br />
<br />
Definately going to come back to the tower in my 30's to practice lockpicking on the chest.. and maybe get a little revenge for all those deaths.  Those two boys are on my short list. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">12-22-04, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if it was luck or the fact that I snuck up close, stopped moving then picked (instead of attemping to pick while moving).<br />
<br />
Once you start your PP, stop. If you move while the pick pocket window is open, it will close automatically. However, he can move as far away as he wants, and the window won't close.<br />
<br />
I died or ran away at least a dozen times trying to PP the drone. I was trying to keep up with him. As soon as I re-read it, I got just close enough for PP to work, hit the PP key, and stopped moving. The drone wandered around the corner, and I had the key in the window waiting to be looted.<br />
<br />
So those are my two tips. Get just in range of PP, and stop moving when you hit the PP key.<br />
<br />
I actually snuck up to the top of the tower on two separate occasions, just to check it out. Just as I got to the top the second time, some valiant paladin and a few others came clearing up through the tower. They pulled Klaven, and I wandered over and opened the unguarded chest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">12-22-04, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happened with me is I had forgotten about the poison quest until 22... by then I had distract. I just distracted the drone, which stopped him from walking, and picked it nicely. Vanish made this one a lot easier too ;)</div></div><hr />
