You can check out our website at feeterna.com and read our charter and recruitment policies. If you are interested, you can put an application on our forums, or get a hold of any Fe Eterna officer, or have a member tell you if one is on or not. We are not a casual guild, and are looking for people that play at least 20 hours a week(not a requirement, but it may make things easier). You can currently talk to Guild, Hinamar, Mabious, and myself for recruitment.</div></div><hr />
