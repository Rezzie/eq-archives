<br />
Can anyone help me on how to spawn him, or any idea of his spawn pattern? I checked PoI with a ranger religiously for 3 weeks and never saw him up. I also read on EQmaps (I think) that he has been moved inside the factory....<br />

Trains to zone are common in PoI, and Junk's liked to just sit there and wait.  I recall the first night of pop, approx 100 naked bodies sitting outside of PoI waiting on GM to fix the JB camper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being a level 65 bard with FT15 and various elemental gear, I have the ability to solo pretty much all of Innovation outside the castle.  And I have been doing so, clearing nearly half the zone at once.  I do this by swarm kiting.  I agro everything I want, charm 1 of them, send it on the 50+ others, and it instantly dies.  Charm another, send in, repeat.<br />
<br />
I keep MOST of the zone cleared this way.  Only slowing my pace to kill Archaic's and other summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
I've done this for about 4 hours, clearing everything on the &quot;back&quot; side of Innovation, and have gotten ZERO junkbeasts to pop.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine that one of the roamers is the junkbeast placeholder.  I say this because this one particular one tends to spawn as interestingly named and modeled types.  For instance, it spawned once as one of those little spiders that feed Behemoth, so it stands out a bit.  Also it looks like it was an &quot;added&quot; spawn with its spawn point being right before Xanamach's room.<br />
<br />
My theory is he's the place holder for the junk beast.<br />
<br />
When the junk beast SPAWNS, being a bard, I will also have the luxury to gate the damn thing and see where EXACTLY its spawn point is.  At which point I will take a screen shot, and post the exact spot here in all its goody goodness.<br />
<br />
But I'd really like to know first hand from as many people as possible where exactly I should be hunting.  Summoning mobs slow me down, and I loathe clearing over 50 light blue and green mobs every 8 miniutes.  If anyone can tell me that he roams, and his exact roaming path, I will tell you its exact spawn point in return in probably less than 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Also, I have heard he has a static spawn point as well.  If anyone can provide this, I would apprciate it.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Its just... that his encounter is much harder now. He now spawns INSIDE the factory in the room where you can only get to by hailing the Researcher Robot(Endurance Test quest) and say I am ready. The Researcher will then port ONLY 1 group into the room where Junkbeast was. Throughout the fight, little manaetic robots will start spawning and attack. So, bring an enchanter. When Junkbeast dies, loot his corpse and evac since i didn't find of getting out of that room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zone in and go left all the way to the large intersection (or right and past the place with the vendor gnome).  When you go left you will need to pull from the right hand side through the doors.  There is one mob in there that cons dark blue to 65 (the rest of the zone is green/light blue).  That mob is the PH.  Kill it over and over and you will get the JB.<br />
<br />
It always spawns right there, everytime.  The issue is, the thing has a HUGE aggro area.  It can see you when fighting down the valley to the cross section through the wall and it will rush you.  It also does still camp corpses.  This is why it's sometimes out in the valley instead of in him room.  He wipes a group and sits there while the bodies pop back at the graveyard.</div></div><hr />

Also the first time we fought him we wiped twice, both times he went back to his pathing, did not camp any corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Undaine</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this thread is fairly full of bad info and I camped this guy for like 40 hours.  Finnally found him up on a server up, ran out to him and gated his butt with bard Song of Highsun and instantly FM'ed.  I then bound sight on him.<br />
<br />
AKA I know the exact location of where the junk beast spawns.  This is 100% true no BS &quot;My friend told me&quot; stuff.  I did it.  I am right.  Your friend is wrong.  If I seem like I'm angry about this for some reason, I am.  I heard way to much total crap from a million sources, none of which were right.<br />
<br />
Now that thats cleared up here it is!<br />
<br />
From zone in, go to the right towards the house with the gnome that does the walking quest to spawn the PoI dragon.  If you're looking at the house, the junk beast spawns nearly directly in front of it.  If its NOT him, its a PH.  The PH will roam on nearly the exact same path that the gnome walks, all the way into Xanamach's room.  It will then stop, and turn around and go back.  It frequently pauses for long periods of time on its journey.  Long enough to give the misconception that it is a static spawn where ever the heck you encountered it.<br />
<br />
Thats it.  End of story.  Happy hunting.  Grats me</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Javan Transient</div><div class="date">06-12-03, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, with Undaine's information, one way to get the JB is:<br />
<br />
Go to the dragons area<br />
Start down the path back to the gnome, killing everything<br />
When you reach the gnome, set up camp killing anything that pops until JB spawns.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you just stay at gnome, and the ph is making the circuit, it'll take forever and a day to path all that way and then back.  This would explain why he's so rare, anybody at a stationary camp isn't going to see the ph very often at all.</div></div><hr />

Went through one round of PH killing and JB popped right in front of the house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_CalhoonJugganaut</div><div class="date">06-21-03, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This method works.  I wouldn't start from the dragons door though, that takes too much time.  Thats what we did.  You should go down the first hall that the gnome takes and stop at the end before the next opening to the next big open area.  Kill any wanderers coming towards you.  Most of the time it was an Erratic Model, occasionally a rat, and 2 times we got a busted power carrier(it looks like a spider).  Well, after killing these mobs that auto popped at the gnome house each time the former was killed they stopped popping for about 5-10 mins.  Then the Junk Beast spawned and came down the path very fast.  We died.  So we met back up at the GY with the Junk Beast spawned and he went to Xanamech's door and kinda camped that whole area.  We went left from the Gy to make it to Xanamechs area faster.  We stopped right in the hall before you come to the open area where you go to Xanamech's room.  We then pulled the Junk Beast and killed em.  Was pretty easy once he was spawned.  But he does indeed pop at the gnomes house.  I think he only travels the path once though.  MY warrior defensive discipline brought his hits for 900 down to 551.  Get him slowed and he is cake.  The blind isn't even that bad, considering its AoE.  JB is a shared spawn.  He can pop just like any other model at that spawn point.  So you might kill one PH or you might have to kill 30 or more like we did.  Hope this info helps you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason I reccomended the dragon as starting point is if you start anywhere else, the PH 'could' be between you and the dragon, so you have to wait for it to path all the way back.  Starting at the dragon insures that you will hit any ph that pops.  That way you are assured that when you get back to the gnome you are ready for it to pop.<br />
<br />
Might also be worthwhile to have someone at the gnomes hut.  If they see something pop, the know its a ph, and the clearing group can evac and go get it directly.  Should cut 'camp' time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_CalhoonJugganaut</div><div class="date">06-21-03, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye thats what we did, sorry I didn't mention that.  We had 2 rogues with SoS running back and forth tailing prospected wanderers.  When we finally found the fight PH it kept auto popping on its death.  If you have enough people it wouldn't hurt to kill all the way to the gnomes hut, that way you don't have to back track any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For us it  did not pop at gnomes hut, popped right in front of xanamech area.<br />
<br />
Another thing of note, our tracker noticed that only one busted power carrier was up at a time. could be nothing though.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

Nothing. Am I the unluckiest shmuck in EQ or am I doing something wrong?<br />
<br />
Usually we start at zone and go right, clearing everything along the path (with particular presence of mind to grab any wanderer we see) until we get to the clearing just before Xanamech's corridor. Then we set up shop in the west chamber of that double-clearing and proceed to slay anything we find. Nothing. Even tried the reverse; cleared everything starting left and ending up at the gnome house. Again, nothing. I've also never seen any wandering mobs that auto-pop another placeholder at the gnome house upon death.<br />
<br />
Either Junk Beast is mortally afraid of facing me, I'm doing something wrong, or the information here is flawed somehow. Any new input?</div></div><hr />

I started following him at the dot denoted as 1 in the picture. Every stop he made after that is also denoted with a dot, and numbered in the order he made these stops. <br />
<br />
After about an hour my patience was worn out and I left, but from what I can tell, this is the only mob that could be what you decribed.<br />
<br />
No other mobs I could find pathed anything like the stretch from the gnome to the dragons lair.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to confirm that this indeed the junkbeast ph?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise Manasponge</div><div class="date">07-24-03, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well based on my exp with JB (2 kills) no that's not his pattern unless you left some pacing out and he really takes his time on it.<br />
<br />
First up past this <br />
<br />
hem2.passagen.se/purge/junkbeast.jpg<br />
<br />
in this window's addy bar then after pic loads hit back and the pic should be loaded instead of the happy little red X.<br />
<br />
<br />
First time I caught him up was at the big area between points 4 and 5. He was just sorta pacing back and forth in there occasionally going down the hall to the Dragon. I got to watch him for a while cuz my exp group found him up and were looking to get reinforcements (mid 50s group) and he aggro'd us. then we came back (after wiping) and pulled him but combined between these two times I prolly watched him for about say 15 minutes. Pace north/south on that map (if north is up) with the occasional roam down the dragons hall/tunnel. He never came in the time I watched to point 4 till he aggro'd on us (that's where we were standing and he didn't roam there he rain straight for us).<br />
<br />
Next time I caught him he was in the big area between points 6/10 and 8. I didn't get to watch him as much since we had a group capable of killing as well as I knew his aggro radius (huge) so I stayed back. But what I did see was once again him pacing ALOT. Back forth back forth then he'd roam somewhere. Dunno where.<br />
<br />
So if that is his path on that map he does ALOT of stopping and wandering/pacing before moving on.<br />
<br />
My guess is he is on a roamer ph table but has his own set path and spawn spot(s). Think Frog hunter/forager. Both can spawn in multiple spots both have named that can spawn and then roam in different paths etc from their PH.</div></div><hr />

You spawn the gnome at the hut to the right of the GY.  At this point, does he travel the long way around the loop?  Or, and this migt make less sense, does he travel the shortest path straight to the west in front of the GY and factory?<br />
<br />
I don't want to spend time back in the bowels of the zone killing wandering ph if it's not necessary.  Completing the circuit with a fairly high dps group was still about a 2 hour affair.<br />

<br />
from zone in and taking the right path to lead up to the gnome building/structure, continuing further up is where I've seen the JB.  I only saw him wander in a small area in front of the gate, he didn't move much further.  I tagged and ran to zone in and had a monk do the rest.  Lots of mobs around him when I tagged so expect a big train if you do it that method hehe.</div></div><hr />

Junk Beast, atleast on E`ci, has spawned EVERY SINGLE time after Xanamech has fallen in Plane of Innovation.  Might want to take this into account next time you hear folks going for their Innovation factory flag.  Try tagging along, and I am sure you'll see the Junk Beast.<br />

<br />
1) We were fighting right from the zone in and passed the gnome house.  Then continued a bit down to that big area (i think near some gates) with lots of spawns in the middle.  I'm a druid and JB was not on tracking.  He spawned right on top of us and wiped us since we weren't ready.<br />
<br />
2) JB was on tracking and we gathered a Xana raid figuring we'd get a 2 for 1.  Fought through and he was in the same place where he had spawned on us a previous time.  Killed him and kept fighting on.  Just as we were turning north to the Dragon gate he respawned on tracking.  A ranger was able to run back quickly and pull him to the main group before we tackled Xana.  I'm told again he was in that open courtyard area up a bit from the gnome's house.  So we got a 3 for 1.<br />

I think you'll find that is true because you have to clear about such a large chunk of the loop to do xana (from gnome to dragon).<br />
<br />
If your guild needs him (has a few decent items, like the focus for wiz), just get a raid force together and mass clear all the way around till it pops.</div></div><hr />

No way i'd be able to get raid force together for a quest for a twink</div></div><hr />

Has anyone actually got him to spawn in area near Xana by just killing the mobs in that area?  I'm talking from Xana's room down the hallway to the crossroads with the door on the one side, and killing all the wanderers that come through there.</div></div><hr />

Left at the first 4 way intersection. Other paths on the 4 way: Straight leads to Xenos room, Right is a door with some mobs inside. We also noticed a roamer with the name &quot;??? powersouce&quot; that pathed from left to right and back and forth at this intersection it looked like one of MBs spiders. This mob WAS up while JB was up though. He was in a large open yard  area and he agroed me &quot;65 monk&quot; while i was in his sight around the corner. Nothing else agroed but him and he was quickly dispatched. Easy fight except for some blinds... but that kinda stuff just builds the excitement.</div></div><hr />

Got a theory.  I saw someone mention &quot;a broken power carrier&quot;.  I bust out my ranger and watch tracking.  When this mob is up, it's the ONLY one by that name up.  Besides the raid mobs, minis, and quest NPCs, it's the only one of the like.  Allakhazam's doesn't list it as having any form of a loot table.  Unfortunately for me, I cannot snag a group to off him whenever I want to.  I'm gonna off him one of these times and see if JB don't pop after it like an immediate PHer of sorts.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
