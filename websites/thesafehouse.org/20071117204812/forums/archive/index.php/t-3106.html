<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-15-03, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to write fiction, and I like to develop campaign worlds, so with that in mind....<br />
<br />
   I'm working on a setting of a mostly oceanic setting, with a couple distant landmasses, but tons of smaller islands.  It will be a pirate type setting, but with mystical elements (my main character is married into a family of witches).  The central portion of the seas is a area prone to dimensional irregularities, so that many times people from other worlds stumble through, and several powerful entities/nations know how to use it to travel worlds, trade with this world.  So the pirates who infest the waters have many choices of victim, but must also watch out.<br />
  <br />
  So the point of the post, I will be typing up the setting, and would be more than  willing to share it with others who are interested, so if you are, send me a ezmessage and I will send you the initial work.  If you would like to contribute a pirate shipname, crew or or other cool idea, you never know, it could end up in a book someday (with due credit given natch).</div></div><hr />

Will give a break from planning my own world. Been reading the Sandman series by Gaiman, and I've got boatloads of material from that I'm trying to work into my world story. &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-15-03, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, will have to add it to the list.</div></div><hr />
