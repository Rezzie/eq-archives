Rose of Versailles team wins 2nd place after US team disqualified for cosplaying the same characters<br />
<br />
TV Aichi has announced the winner and runners-up at the 2006 World Cosplay Summit:<br />
<br />
Grand Champion: Brazil (Angel Sanctuary)<br />
2nd Place: Japan Web Team (Rose of Versailles)<br />
3rd Place: Italy (Project ARMS)<br />
Sponsor's Choice: Japan Tokyo Team (Gundam Seed)<br />
<br />
The 2nd place award is notable because Rose of Versailles creator Riyoko Ikeda has said she does not like cosplay of her characters, which was the official reason for disqualifying the only US entry in the Group category last year.<br />
<br />
This year's World Cosplay Summit did not include a US participant. According to TV Aichi's site, &quot;a regrettable mix up in the planning towards the US representative's preliminary contest&quot; caused US representation to be &quot;postponed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anime Expo co-sponsored the 2005 World Cosplay Summit preliminaries in the US but declined to participate this year.<br />

Apperently they even had the winners picked before the contest started. Wonder how it will reflect on future ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even before the competition, the 'winners' were getting more interviews/press time than any of the other teams.</div></div><hr />
