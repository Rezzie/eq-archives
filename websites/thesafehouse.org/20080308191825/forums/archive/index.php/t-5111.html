<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_DabuddahB</div><div class="date">06-26-02, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Im a 23rd Infil and i currently have the skills of:<br />
<br />
CS = 23<br />
Envenum = 16<br />
Slash = 21<br />
Thrust = 4<br />
Stealth = 22<br />
<br />
or very close.  Im not at home so if im forgetting a skill ill update it.  But my question is am i missing out on something big by going heavy slash instead of heavy thrust?  I know daggers have always been associated with rogue classes for piercing skill.  So is there an advantage made for rogue types specificaly with Thrust?<br />
<br />

<br />
Slash has mainly 3 targets in RvR: Casters, Rogues, and Archers. But a lot of mobs in PvE are weak to Slash.<br />
<br />
Thrust has all Chain wearing targets at a disadvantage. This includes (I believe) Warriors, Thanes, Clerics (For PvP server btw), Mercs, Minstrels, Healers, Heroes, Champions, and Skalds. I'm not too sure if Thrust gets a bonus to Scale or not, so someone please correct me if I'm wrong. This offers more targets overall as it's pretty easy to beat down casters with Thrust or Slash, just that Slash makes it quicker.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, with Thrust, you get Dragonfang... 9 Sec stun move at 50 Thrust based off Evade... can we say incredible? Hehehe...</div></div><hr />

I've dumped more into the other skills, quite obviously. If I start putting points into thrust instead, will I be able to increase it to an effective level without hurting the others? Or, at high level will slash still be effective against chain armor but just not as much as thrust?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read somewhere that slash was just plain more powerful overall, especially for briton.. is that true? Does the damage of slash negate the thrust bonus on chain? Can someone test it? ----------------------------------------------------------------------Wulien, lvl 47 Rogue of Norrath Fellowship on Quellious(Retired)W.U.L.I.E.N.: Wireless Unit Limited to Infiltration and Efficient Nullification...Bernard Razorleaf...Ranger of Fallen EaglesGawaine</div></div><hr />
