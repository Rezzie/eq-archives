When AC came out, EQ wasn't under that much threat because what I have heard about it, it wasn't much, if any at all, superior to EQ. However, SB and DAoC seem geared toward fixing EQ's problems and still coming out with a well-polished game. It's now or never with Verant. I am not a doomsayer for EQ, and I think it'll go on after these games come out, but they are going to have to start fixing some of these things NOW or they won't have people wanting them to be fixed at all (and yes they are already working toward this, read some of the last few patch messages).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-13-01, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sad thing is, most if not all these patches shoulda and coulda happened earlier on.  I know that they did not have as much manpower as now, but they also wasted some of that manpower on expanding with more zones before basic game and zones were fixed and refined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Frankly</div><div class="date">05-13-01, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The wasted man-hours is a consequence of how they've decided to design their game...to keep people on the blue servers interested, they have to keep adding more zones, more toys, more levels, more classes to try.  DAoC and SB both are aiming for the pie in the sky...a play environment where players provide their own PvP adventures and so massive coding additions aren't really required.<br />

<br />
talk about somthing that should have been taken care of before release?<br />
<br />
yeah vi is wacky. I mean who puts out a game with crappy mechanics then after what? coming up on 3 years on the market finally starts fixing @#%$ that should have been done prior to release?  never mind I know its not that uncommon. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">05-14-01, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thought is they are looking at the declining pop on Vallon and wondering whether they want to go through with this.  If any new server move log is made before the P v P server comes out, it's a bad sign....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_MajestykVZ</div><div class="date">05-15-01, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Declining population on Vallon could be due to players, who will no longer continue to play a game that has so many fundamental flaws, hoping that the manufacturer will enventual correct them, leaving.<br />
<br />
I know that's the reason for at least one player giving up the game. If, you can't be good. at least, be good at it.Majestyk, Rogue,Shanks,Vallon Zek!Edited by: MajestykVZ at: 5/15/01 1:39:17 pm</div></div><hr />
