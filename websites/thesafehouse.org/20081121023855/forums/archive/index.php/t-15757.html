<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lashiec</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have my eq2 interface setup in the same way as alot of  eq1 players do- that is, having a chat window and a combat window<br />
<br />
however every single time i log out, and then back in, all the settings i made are reverted back to default (all melee hits, all spells etc)<br />
<br />
also the hot-button queue button command doenst stay unchecked.  is there some setting i'm missing here? the commands work perfectly until i log out - but then i have to spend a couple minutes upon logging in to fix em :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen that problem, but I get a sense there are some bugs in filters and such in chat windows, so your problem may tie in with that. I've been trying to log quest text, and occassional I don't get the message whether it's been turned on or off. <br />
<br />
I've also seen occassionally changing one window's properties will make a global change. For instance, last night after tweaking a chat window my inventory screen became completely transparent. I thought I was bugged until I accidentally moused over it and it faded up. When I was hitting &quot;I&quot; it didn't appear. I wrote it off as lag screwing with my commands, but in hindsight this may be something more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koryn</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine does the same thing.  I have a chat box and a combat box.  The chat box is the original box by default and the combat box is the second one made.  The combat box is ALWAYS being reverted back to default, but the chat box stays the same.  It's annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugannw</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same issues last week when I was completely rearranging my interface and screwing with my chat/combat boxes.  Lots of issues with the fading for the most part (also had the combat box reverting to normal a bunch).  This week they seemed to have settled down and are exactly the way I want them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shotoif</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday is the first time i tried messing with this stuff. I made several adjustments while in Verments Snye because of the closeness in proximity to others their stuff can bleed over. i.e. spell stuff and npc conversation etc. Once I made those changes the game became very unstable and slow. Like it had to &quot;think&quot; about the changes I made and then decide on action. Maybe it is my head. :crazy <br />
<br />
Everything does return to default everytime I log back in though. I haven't seen fading yet. I do often encounter missing messages in the chat window. Sometimes when I scroll back through to see what &quot;X&quot; told me it isn't there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lashiec</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">did feedback on this, hopefully someone will get around to looking at it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This happened once during beta and ended up being a rights issue on one of the config files on your PC.  Deleting that file cleared your settings, but made all the chat customizations work again.  I can't remember which config file it was though, maybe someone else does?</div></div><hr />
