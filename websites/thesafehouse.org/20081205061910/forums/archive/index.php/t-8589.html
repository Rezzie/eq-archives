<br />
is it possible to:<br />
<br />
turn it in while invis and hope to god i dont die en route to zone<br />
turn it in while he's some chanters pet<br />
turn it in while he's agrod on me or someone else<br />
<br />
or do i just have to suck it up and kill shadowed men for the next year?<br />
<br />
i'm thinking posibly have some tank agro him, drag him to zone, and have either a chanter charm him or someone invis me, then turn it in. will that work? any help appreciated =D</div></div><hr />

He's not on the generic &quot;Orc&quot; faction that the rest of them are.</div></div><hr />
