<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kezzek</div><div class="date">06-20-00, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is with great anticipation and much excitement that I write you, Stane.  Much has been changing in the lands of Test Server and I find myself gazing at the far horizon more every day.  I hope this message finds you well--the orc messenger seemed none too eager to carry it, but I was happy to see that the Bladefiend name and the glint of a blade still has enough influence on our orcish friends.<br />
<br />
When last I saw you, you left in a fit of rage--stealing both my hard earned equipment and a fair bit of my pride.  Time has passed, however, and I feel I understand what drove you to such lengths.<br />
<br />
I long for the bite of my blade into my enemy's flesh. Almost feeling the wind whipping through my hair as I chase down another foolish halfling.  I can hear the cries of outrage as yet another victim feels the sting of my poison coursing through their veins.  And, of course, the unequaled rush of excitement as I pluck the trinkets from unknowing fools.<br />
<br />
I cannot bear the thought of finishing my days as a quiet caretaker of this place of refuge!<br />
<br />
Tonight, I returned to the world of Norrath.  Armed with only a rusty dagger, I tested myself against the common denizens of Nektolos.  And I fared well, son!<br />
<br />
I am resolved to continue my quest and renew my worldly adventures!  Perhaps I shall see you someday though I fear otherwise.  If that day ever arrives, know that I am filled with gladness and feel no trepidation.<br />
<br />
Your father,<br />

Play on the edge because we could die at any time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I'm not sure what is gonna end up happening on Test.  Lots of things up in the air, lots of rumors flying around.<br />
<br />
Still, I'm banking on starting over as Kezzek, level 2 rogue.  I've asked that Gill be restored so we'll see what happens.  Regardless, I'm staying on Test.<br />
<br />
I feel Verant should just stick to their guns and maintain the p-wipe, no restores, &quot;stick-yer-whinin'-up-yer-arse&quot; attitude.  I've never asked for nor received any help, compensation, or buffing/twinking in any way and I'm a happy player/tester.  Why listen to these tantrums people are throwing anyway?  It's Test, fercrissakes!<br />

Bah!<br />

Kez is retired again.<br />

(If whoever is on Test and has the name Kezzek reads this, you really SHOULD delete him since you never play him.)<br />
