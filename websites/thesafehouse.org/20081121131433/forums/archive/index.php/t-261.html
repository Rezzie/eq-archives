From some unknown reseason these shops are not listed on any map and a pain in the arse to locate.  Most of the shops sell ehancers and DO's.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Steel Canyon, real close to the Bronze Way marker there is a shop named Freedom Corps. This shop only sells training enhancements.  The prices to buy enhancements are half price of all the other shops and they buy back enhancements at double the price.  Wish I would of known about this sooner, I could of save so much money. 15 Run Enhance was only 600 inf, check the price at Orion/Cooke and it was around 1500.  Vice versa is true for selling back enhancements.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, there is a shop for each kind of enhancements.  So one for science, one for tech, etc etc.  And the rates at the speciality shops are different from the generic places.<br />
<br />
So, save your money and shop smart. Shop Freedom Corp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also the fact its Training makes it useless after level 12 ;)<br />
<br />
Training is 8%, Dual is 16%, Single is 33% ;)<br />
<br />
Dont bother with buying training, EVER, from the start save all yer inf until level 12, its not worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Training still gives 8% not 0%, so disregard phantoms post about it being completely useless.  And they can still be stacked for greater effect.<br />
<br />
Also, outside of the 10 DO's available in most shops, the DO's for the other skills are not available untill lvl 23 in some fubar hazard zone.  So the trainings for movement and etc will be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barrister</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if you are selling DO's or SO's back to an NPC shop, you will get a LOT more if you sell it in a shop taht specializes in that origin. ie, selling a mutant/tech do will get alot more in a mutant or tech shop than in a generic, or scinece, or whatever other shop.<br />
<br />
Also, training enhacers cost ~25% more in an origin specific shop than from a generic/training shop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom Rogue</div><div class="date">05-04-04, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Training IS useless.<br />
<br />
I dont know about you, but at level 16, i have stacked DO enhancers in every slot that I need.  (dont bother with useless skills)<br />
<br />
And thats with about 20k more inf on me still.<br />
<br />
And I have the Damage and Acc enh's (most expensive)<br />
<br />
And it is worthless to buy.  The Stuff you are hunting should give you them anyway ;)  So save your inf for stuff that isnt a common drop (level 23 [i think]) mobs drop DO enhancers anyway.  So you can save more inf that way.<br />
<br />
Just be smart and dont waste inf on training when you can get DO.</div></div><hr />

At 12, I had enough for 2, only 2 DOs.<br />
<br />
You know the little bonuses you get for getting the last shot in on a group of thugs? The one that only one person in the group gets? Let me tell you, that stuff seems small, but it adds up quick.<br />
<br />
Take a look at this thread, about the problems I'm referring to.<br />

'Course, the few times I've been in pick up groups were miserable failures, so make of that what you will.<br />
<br />
Freedom Corps does rock for selling, though. Much love for pointing that place out to me.</div></div><hr />

Tried to make my way to the store in steel canon last night and got owned so hard when I took a wrong turn.  But it was fun none the less.  Maybe today I will actually print the map.<br />

<br />
Well, Unfortunately, I took Psi Blast. While it is almost never resisted, as compared to other attack types and damage is good, the animations are very slow. Which means, unless I'm the one to open open up combat with attacks, the badguy will more than likely be dead by the time my shot hits.<br />
<br />
Oh, and in large groups (6-8), I generally do need every second hoarding endurance for heals, and I generally trade off any acc/dmg/def/luck inspirations I get for other people's endurance inspirations. :) Of course, thats one reason I lean toward smaller groups.<br />
<br />
But even then, there is a fairly big diff between what a Defender/Controller gets and what a Scrapper/Blaster gets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">El Sorriso</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the enhancements are hard to test...but judging from the damage ones (the training ones not the DO or SO) they definitely make a difference.<br />
<br />
   According to the strategy guide, nearly every single training enhancement gives you an 8.3% boost.  Double origin gives you twice as much, and Single origin gives you twice as much as double origin.<br />
<br />
   I say go ahead and spend.  You will gain more influence from 12-14 than you will from 1-12.  So you really aren't losing that much by buying training enhancements and seeing what they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah with groups of 7 or 8 your healing becomes alot more important. Another reason I often try to keep groups down to 6 or less unless it's a bunch of friends messing around heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn, really noticed for the first time how much a difference DO's make.<br />
<br />
I love how you can tweak powers to fit your playstyle with enhancements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naica</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just replaced a 12++ healing with a 15 DO, and it raised about 10 - 15 points (I was in groups with different levels and seemed to get different numbers off them, dunno if that is normal). Honestly, that's about the same raise I was getting from a ++ enhancement.<br />
<br />
If you can afford them, yeah, they will be better in the long run, but it's probably better to bank your inf and then get a three of each for each slot they are going into  if you want to see dramatic difference right off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alturick</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at 12 I bought DO's for all my damage and endurance draining needs... then I waited till 18 to upgrade any of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I had a heck of a power slump till then, and I dropped 80k influence upgrading (and I'm still not completely done), but I managed to get most of my enhancements up to 20+ level with single DO upgrades.<br />
<br />
<br />
20 + 15 = 20+ at 75% chance<br />
<br />
Not really sure I would do it the same way again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nic if they had them more than every 5 levels in the stores, so that you only have 1 possible level to do your upgrades in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 21 I've only had to do store upgrades for 3 of the DO's I bought at 12.  The rest have all been improved by drops.  Plus, most of my training I still had have been replaced by dropped DOs.  Also got SO from task force, so that helped a bit as well.<br />
<br />
Now next level will be the real issue, do I start buying SOs or stick with DOs until 27?  hmmmmmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dime</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone found a place like freedom corp to sell their DO's at?  I love the inflated price freedom corps buys the training ones at so was hoping there was one for DO's as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stores that sell that type of DO will pay double the standard prices.</div></div><hr />
