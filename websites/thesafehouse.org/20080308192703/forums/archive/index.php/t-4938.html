A while back ago he switched to Hibernia but I kept playing my infiltrator.  Now, I'm looking at switching over to Hibernia and playing a nightshade.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if any of you nightshades have ever run out of mana when using your spells.  From what I have read, the amount of mana is based upon your intelligence.  I want to know if the extra 10 in int of an elf makes much difference.<br />
<br />
Also, what other stats affect spells.  I think I saw something that said that your dex helps to determine if you hit.  It may have been that dex is used to determine casting times.<br />
<br />
Any answers or comments about how magic in general works would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Situations where we should be chain-casting our DD instead of getting into melee are freakishly rare.  They happen, or they can if you remember that you can do it, but it's not something to base your character choice around.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that dex is figured into our chance for hitting.  That might have something to do with bolts, but mostly it's the creatures resistance and level.  Higher dex does decrease casting time, though, so we can get our spell off relatively quickly.<br />
<br />
Don't choose an elf because of the +10 intelligence.  Choose an elf because we're genetically superior. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />

<br />
When in a group pulling or solo, at best (barring pathing wierdness) you can get off 4 casts before the mob is in melee range, and you usually have full mana again by the time fight is over and your endurance is back.<br />
<br />
Me and a fellow shade decided to see if we could nuke someone to death if we both unloaded a full mana bar on them (was a blue norse hunter, at level 41).  We ran out of mana, the hunter was at about 1/3rd life still, then we got pounded for 550+ by a gang of trolls.
