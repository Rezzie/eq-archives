<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kothar</div><div class="date">04-07-07, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dark Vengeance is a guild in Vanguard:SoH, on the Shidreth server. Our goal is to develop a solid network of mature players to experience the content of the game as the developers intended. Currently, the focus is on maintaining nightly groups to help us advance together. In the end-game, we will raid 3 to 4 nights a week on a schedule, possibly more depending on availability and interest of guildies. Our primary mission is to have fun and enjoy the game. Many of the Dark Vengeance members came from raiding guilds where we raided 7 nights a week and often times had a great deal of stress that came along with it. Dark Vengeance is here to bring the fun into raids and leave the stress where it belongs, at work on the job! <br />
<br />
Our intention is to raid 3-4 days a week on a schedule. Raid Times are between 8pm EST - 11/12pm EST weekdays and the possibility of raids starting in the afternoons on weekends if VG provides extra lengthy raid dungons to challenge us. This leaves other days to focus on the other aspects of Vanguard you enjoy whether it is crafting, diplomacy, or running around the docks punting gnomes. <br />
<br />
We also no longer have to use smoke signals or tin cans for communication (or that pesky typing thing). We have a ventrilo server up and available for use in grouping and raids. You are, of course, never required to speak on ventrilo, but should have the ability to listen during raids. Making fun of our accents can provide hours of enjoyment anyway, so it’s a definite plus! <br />
<br />
We are currently recruiting: <br />
All classes including dedicated crafters and diplomats. <br />
<br />
Our only requirements are that you take the time to learn your class, have a bit of a sense of humor, and well, at least a smidge of intelligence never hurt either. <br />
<br />
Dark Vengeance is a solid guild, with strong leadership, and an eye on an end goal that allows for fun in the journey. Whether you are a group of like minded players who have yet to find that guild that fits your needs, or a solo player looking for a guild, Dark Vengeance may be just the home you’re looking for. Check out our website at Dark Vengeance  (http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=152574&amp;TabID=1294433)and post an application or contact Kothar, Senjaro, or Aeran in game. <br />
