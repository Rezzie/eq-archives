<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-31-02, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had my most annoying death I've ever had in RvR today...  A Mid group had nearly wiped out an Alb group, and there was one armsman and one cleric left, trying to kill of something that had been a pet of one of the Mids.  The armsman was preoccupied with the pet, and the cleric was sitting and healing the armsman.  The cleric was orange, and at 50% health.<br />
I get in, and get my PA off on the cleric, still sitting (I think, could have been lagged..  Was a 300ish damage shot, on an orange con).  I knew that if I landed CD the cleric was dead.. When wham, I'm messed.<br />
I find a chain wearer in one of the few situations in which I could likely kill them and get away, I get in, get my PA off while they're still sitting (I think.. I don't PA standing orange chain wearers enough to know my damage on em) and yet the cleric was still  able to get off an insta PBAE mes (The first one, which will do the job is gotten at 3 smite spec (Heavenly visions...  Lasts 9 seconds, but that's more than enough to do us in.  I'm sure I was hit by a higher version, but even a cleric specced only 3 in smite could do this, and I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't) I think.  In other words, almost any high level cleric will likely have this.)  I checked my backlog, and I was definately messed in between my PA and when my CD would have come (No out of range, miss, etc. on the CD)<br />
I can't think of anything I could have done to have had a better chance at this.  Was I simply unlucky?  Or is a sitting orange con cleric at half health still too much for me to take?  <br />
How are we supposed to fight instant crowd control spells?  Just hope that they're surprised enough that they don't get em off before we land CD?<br />
Blowing off a bit of steam because I knew I should have had that kill easily, and frustrated because it seems like there's absolutely nothing to do about it.<br />
I could really do with a poison that disabled insta and quickcast for a period of say 1 minute.  Or even just disabled all spellcasting if it stuck for 30 seconds or so... A spasming poison, which would make the muscle control necessary to perform spell gestures and incantations impossible.<br />
It's just so frustrating to get everything right, and still have absolutely no chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they invincible.  The only way to kill one is if:<br />
<br />
a) they're dumb and don't think to push that oh-so-convinient insta pbaoe mez button.<br />
<br />
b) you get REALLY lucky and resist the mez.<br />
<br />
c) they're afk.<br />
<br />
d) you one shot them.<br />
<br />
e) you have another shade with you, one crits, gets insta mezed.  Cleric backs up to max range and casts a stun.  As he is about to start smiting shade1 shade2 crits and finishes off the job (there's a timer on those pbaoe things).<br />
<br />
Healers in general..i have no idea how they envisioned fighting them.  It would make sense for an assasin to assasinate the healer first..above any other class.  Too bad they're entirelly invincible.<br />
<br />
Just a few minutes ago i run into a lvl 50 healer medding in front of ligen.  I think to myself, i know this is a bad idea, but he is sitting down, and i am a very good player, and i do have the very very best nightshade items obtainable in this game.    So i walk up to him and dish out no less than 1450 damage before he unstuns from cd.   Then he insta heals himself back to full life, insta stuns me, backs off a little and sits there medding.  After the stun FINALLY wears off,  i try to stealth, but it's too late, i am now mezzed.  At this point i cry, he waves and leaves. <br />
<br />
In other words, healers are unkillable even if you catch them sitting down, you're level 50, you got full set of midnite marauder armor + 100 af vest, you open with a 3.5 delay piercer, you are maxed on all your stats, your poisons stick, you land three poisons, you land crit and followups, etc etc etc.  /rant.

You attacked two chain wearers- orange con and expected to live?  I've attacked orange clerics one on one (cleric slightly above 1/2 health), and my PA will knock them down quite a bit, even with slash weap. Even when he did mez, run, smite, i could still sprint over and finish him off.<br />
<br />
Same thing happens to me against minstrells though.  If there are two players to attack- there always seems to be some kind of stunning/mezzing class around.<br />
<br />
Cleric's mez ability is in the smite line;  I have a cleric too, and when my smite was low, compared to my level, I couldn't mez for crap pve because they always got resisted. <br />
<br />
Does BS II have a stun in it?  I'd heard somewhere that it did, its not listed on Catacombs, but I was using that style on clerics because I thought that it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bargle13</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Backstab two has about a 2 second stun to it, I have found the combo piercer/Northern Lights to be much better at &quot;Stunning&quot; an opponet. Piercer stops them dead for about 4 rounds, Northern Lights adds enough to make just about any orange/red mob immobile till it's dead. Combine this with poison and you should have a pretty easy time on a target, unfortunately you'd have to use other Crits to finish the job.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a stun line tho this ones definately worth looking at. Heck I am still new to my SB though so their may be a much better solution higher up the chain. Just using this one now because it seems to be better at this lvl.<br />
<br />
Another good option would be backstab II/Thigh Cut with the stun poison. Then move to the side, and hit with a piercer to finish the job.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.. I'll have to try that second combo myself to see how it goes.<br />

<br />
1) You attack.<br />
2) They Insta mez.<br />
3) You stand there mezzed looking stupid while they heal themselve to full.<br />
4) Cleric cast stun, BAM, you're stunned for 8 seconds.<br />
5) Cleric cast smite, 400 damage(they can do more then 400 btw)<br />
6) Cleric cast smite, 400 damage<br />
7) If you're not already dead, you're probbaly regain control at this point.<br />
8)  You charge after cleric<br />
9) Cleric cast smite, 400 damage<br />
10) you /release back to lala land.<br />
<br />
Same thing with Midgard Healers, you wont be able to kill a good one. But unlike clerics, they will run away instead of smiting you to pieces.  <br />

<br />
400damage smites aren't an exaggeration either.  clerics are as broken as archers were back in the day.  they are virtually unkillable.  telling us that you can almost kill a cleric thats half health is BS.  when is the last time you saw a healing class at half health?<br />
<br />
resists are based on level, not spec btw...<br />
<br />
When a solo player can immobilize 3 or more players beating on them, then pick them off one by one without any countermeasure, there is a problem.  this is what a current smite cleric can, and does do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xumten</div><div class="date">04-02-02, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No doubt about it, when it comes to the chain wearing healing classes(Cleric, Druid, and Healers) they made us incredibly hard to kill. The druid probably being the easier out of the 3, but still not an easy feat.<br />
<br />
Clerics and Healers are tough. My healer has yet to die to an assassin. And Im about 50/50 on archers. Not only do we have instant stun/mez, but you should go ahead and assume we have two instant heals on deck as well(I always do). <br />
<br />
Disease is a MUST poison to use on a healer class for this reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dark Current</div><div class="date">04-05-02, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is really rather humorous. I suppose you expect to be able to kill anyone in the game that cons orange to you? Then you want to cry about it?<br />
<br />
I believe a properly specced assassin can flat kill any class in the game 1 vs 1 barring mez or stun. That is pretty awesome if you think about it. Do you disagree with that?<br />
<br />
Why did you fail to mention the Inffys same dilemna when confronting a Healer? Just FYI, my Infiltrator has not run across any lone healers. Even with a scout we almost never take out a pair of Middys with a healer. <br />
<br />
My SB is not big enough to try for the top level clerics, but they do run solo more often than the healers do. <br />
<br />
You want to learn how to take out a cleric? Play one up to 45+ and then do some serious RvR and you will find the weaknesses to exploit. It's not as hard as you think  <br />
<br />
When I find one I will NOT try to solo him, just grab a friendly hunter for a partner. You two as a pair can annihiliate ANY cleric or druid in the game. Matter of fact, a good hunter or ranger can solo an even con smite cleric or escape if the attempt fails. Not just once in a while but the majority of the time. <br />
<br />
And yes, your poison going off can indeed interrupt their casting of the stun or smite spell. The insta heals belong to all three realms. All bard classes have insta cast spells. Thanes have insta cast spells. Are you advocating they remove ALL instant spells or just those of one class?<br />
<br />
I absolutely hate the mez and stun spells with a passion, but they seem to be here to stay. Either have Mythic remove all mez and stun spells in the game or learn to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Before you ask for the nerf though, remember All of the assassin classes have stuns if they get them off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">04-06-02, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you completely Dark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valarauco</div><div class="date">04-06-02, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a funny story from when you could still stealth while mezzed:<br />
<br />
I'm stalking around AMF in Emain Macha and stumble on an orange cleric.  I figure wearing chainmail is just begging to be perforated, so up I go and PA-CD-SS.  After a round or two the CD-stun wears off with her at about 1/4 health, she insta-stuns me, and backs up a few steps to heal.  I restealth as soon as possible but am stuck there watching her heal.<br />
<br />
However, we all know smite clerics don't heal very well.  I'm twiddling my thumbs thinking I'm just prolonging the inevitable, when I realize the stun is blinking and she's still only at 3/4 health and still healing!   It wears off, and I barely contain a squeal of delight as I drive another PA-CD-SS chain into her skull.  At this point I can't be stunned anymore, and with me right behind her she feebly limps away... prolonging the inevitable.<br />
<br />
That is one of two people I have PA'd twice in one (short) battle.  The other story is good too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">04-06-02, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dither, be glad you don't have to deal with the healers in your realm.  The other day I did over 4000 damage to Gluch without killing him.  <br />
<br />
I agree that clerics are tough.  Anyone with instant heals are.  You should see how hard it is to take down a healer though.  With a well spec'd cleric you have to deal with one instant mez, a castable stun which if you are smart they should only be able to get off chained off the mez and 2 low percentage instant heals.  Healers have at their disposal instant stun, instant aoe stun, instant mez, instant aoe mez, 2 instant heals which will be much stronger than a smite spec'd cleric.  <br />
<br />
Insta casts(shouts) are the single most difficult thing for an assassin to deal with.  There is really no way for us to counter them.  As long as the opponent is paying attention and can get them off before we can stun them with CD we have no defense no matter how good we are.<br />
<br />
Every assassin knows the classes that you simply don't mess with unless you know you have a clear cut advantage.  As an infiltrator a skald or healer will instant mez you every time.  All Hib casters are a pain with their quickcast stuns too, but that's mainly only a problem if there's more than one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dither DAoC</div><div class="date">04-06-02, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem isnt with a class that is able to insta mez or stun, it is the ability to insta mez and stun, as well as have a huge offensive ability.  you may not be able to kill a midgard healer, but there is no way a midgard healer can kill you, unless he has a buddy.  smite clerics can kill 2-3 even con opponents quite easily, with very little risk to themselves.<br />
<br />
btw, gluch is like top 10rp in midgard/palo, and one of the most talented, if not the most talented healer we have when it comes to rvr.  he doesnt get shaken up at all, and dies less than any healer i have ever grouped with in rvr. Dither Disgustipated<br />

The Clerics insta mez is dangerous to an infil yes but the range and duration make it almost useless to a group of guys who know what they are doing.  Also the mes recast is 60 seconds, not 30.  If you attack a cleric and he messes you and smites.  RUN.  Then hide, he will find it almost impossible to kill you if you are fast enough.  <br />
<br />
I agree with the hatred for messes and stuns but I think that the huge range AOE stuns that last 60 seconds and cannot be interrupted (paralise?) are way worse than the paltry cleric mes which is resisted most of the time and lasts barely any time at all. <br />
<br />
A cleric is very hard to kill in RvR that is true, but it is also hard for a Cleric to kill unless they are against an inferior player.<br />

<br />
mez invulnerability in pvp lasts for 60 seconds, but that doesn't cut down on a clerics ability to waste multiple opponents while solo.<br />
<br />
there is no stun in the game longer than 9 seconds, and the 9 second ones are extremely high spec.  LW spec 50, 40+pac spec, etc.<br />
<br />
if you are immobilized for any more than 6 seconds, its a root or a mez.  mez breaks on melee or offensive spells, so does root, stun does not, which is why its duration is so short.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However I disagree with the stun thing.  If I stun someone as soon as they are hit they release.  However I have been stunned more than a few times and am dead before it wears off.  I don't think any spell should stop you from hitting someone back when they are striking you.<br />

<br />
I dare say, any Assassin who has PA'ed a Bard knows how easy they are to kill, especially if they have their lute up.  A level 50 Critblade can near oneshot my level 49 Bard.<br />
<br />
A Clerics can PBAE their mez between the PA and CD.<br />
A Minstrel can shout stun you before the PA and CD.<br />
A Healer can insta-stun, overwrite with mez, and then run for it, if it's alone.<br />
All of them wear chain.<br />
<br />
A Bard (which wears the equiv to studded leader) can... err run through you.  With new stick, it's not as effective in avoiding the CD's.<br />
<br />
The only instant we have is memblur which interrupts spell casting and archery.  Hmm, okay we can disrupt your xbow or thrown weapon.  <br />
<br />
A 50/50 Smite/Rejuv Cleric typically has 4 instants available.  PBAE mez, PBAE damage, target heal and group heal.  They dish out a moderate level of damage, and are hard to kill.<br />
<br />
One thing to note about Smite Clerics, their spec line Smite has a listed 4.0 sec casting time, and range of only 1350 (Heal Range bascially).  Their baseline smite is listed as 3.0 casting time.  Of course with proper Dex equipment you can get those numbers lowered.<br />
<br />
Here's the apparent kicker... instacast CC appear to be on a different timer then normal CC.  So Hibernia is doubly screwed due to lack of insta-cast CC's.  I've seen it happen in RvR.  A Healer overwriting their insta-stun with a normal stun.  A Cleric overwriting the Minstrel Stun with their own Stun.  A Sorc or Minstrel overwriting the Cleric mez.  I've never been able to AE mez and then use my single target mez, back to back on the same target, I've always been hit with the &quot;target cannot have that effect again&quot; message.</div></div><hr />
