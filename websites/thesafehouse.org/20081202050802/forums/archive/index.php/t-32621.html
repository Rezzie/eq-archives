<br />
Long story short, I'm a feral druid, my 2v2 partner is a rogue.  We're gonna get back to arena shortly, but I'm rather curious...am I better off with an opener+rip and going bearform, or stay in kittymode in general?<br />
<br />
<br />
And no.  I'm not going resto.  I wish I could play rogue, but something about the speed of the feral that has gotten me seduced...plus kitty is not trackable under tack humanoids and people don't know how crappily geared I am. ^.^</div></div><hr />

They do now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">12-12-07, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to go with Bear, in general. <br />
<br />
My reasoning is this: A smart team will take our your rogue first usually. That said, if you're the first target picked, and you get stunned or incapacitated in kitty form, you're probably going to die. Rogue have a few more tricks to stay alive. Secondly, while kitty have pounce, bears have feral charge and bash. That's 2 stuns you can call on versus bleed damage. The white damage on kitties is nice and quick, but, in arenas you're not getting to stand around maximizing your white dps. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, and it kinda goes back to my first reason. Bears are just tough as **** if they are reasonably geared. If they see you they will go for your rogue instead. But that leaves you free to harass their healer, or other crucial target, and as well as leave you in a good position to drop heals on the rogue. <br />
<br />
All that being said, sometimes you want lots of quick dps and a surprise attack. Like if someone was gambling enough to bring 2 clothies or a clothie and a leather wearer to a 2v2. In that case you'd want to stay kitty with your rogue buddy and just burn one of them down super fast. <br />
<br />
You're a druid, so what you need to do varies depending on what kind of team you're up against, regardless of your spec. Working it out with your rogue ahead of time means eventually you don't even have to talk about your strategy.</div></div><hr />

So far (with decent success) I was more of the less either kitty, or healing him.<br />

Thanks ^.^</div></div><hr />
