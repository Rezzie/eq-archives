Basically, when I first started playing my rogue, I was able to equip her rather nicely for dealing with mobs and such.  The problem I had was dealing with other players.  I'm still working up my pvp skills, and I think that my equip has a lot to do with my lack of success in pvp combat.  So I've sold everything my rogue owns, and now I have 4k to play to start over on her equipment.  So I would like to get some advice, how would some of you best equip a rogue for pvp combat with 4k?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Lirin TZ</div><div class="date">05-24-01, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for weapons i would go for deul tombcarvers.  i love those babys, a caster will have a vary hard time getting a spell off.   <br />
<br />
what you really need is resists though.  some basic items are:<br />
<br />
2x +7 MR, bracer, gold wolf eye.  <br />
<br />
+10 MR, neck, velium wolf eye<br />
<br />
DRT(not the best ac, but the resists are vary nice for low/mid level pvp +8 magic cold fire<br />
<br />
collar of undead protection +7 poision disease<br />
<br />
as for armour, the most i ever give is a full set of banded.  all these are fairly cheap, the most expensive would be the +10 MR neck which should run you 500+ (i dont really know, my guild had a master jewler that did all of it for cost, but it costs 450 to make, so 500+ is a rough estimate)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ceescrit da Bossalini</div><div class="date">05-25-01, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FBSS = 8-10K on VZ<br />
<br />
First off you wanna get your standar Wolf-eye chanter made stuff.<br />
<br />
Plat Wolf-eye Neck- 150-200pp<br />
<br />
2 Wolf Eye Bracelets- 50pp each<br />
<br />
BI Crown or Ry`gorr helm- 100-150/500pp<br />
<br />
Dwarven Ringmail tunic (if you can wear it)- 20pp<br />
<br />
Sarnak Emblazened Tabard (for a medium/large race) - 250pp<br />
<br />
Ravenscale or Rygorr arms/legs/tunic/gloves-  about 200-500 each<br />
<br />
RS gloves are really nice if you can find them.<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Icebear- 100pp<br />
<br />
Troll Hide belt- 200pp<br />
<br />
Blood stained Mantle (A MUST for all rogues)- 35-50pp<br />
<br />
Mask of Deception (good luck)- No drop<br />
<br />
Split Paw hide mask- 30pp<br />
<br />
Ry`gorr Collar- 500pp<br />
<br />
<br />
MR is key, try to get that to 100+ and you'll be all set.  After that, worry about FR and CR, then PR at higher levels.  ALWAYS keep your MR gear on unless you are fighting mobs, or 1 on 1 with a pure melee, then go for AC and STR.<br />
<br />
When you get some extra plat, try to get these items:<br />
<br />
Plat Jacinth Rings (+13 MR)- 2K<br />
Earring of essance (+10 MR)- 3K<br />
Crown of Froglock Kings (+20 sv Fire/Cold)- 2-3K [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

<br />
Harpoon of the depths is always nice for about 500pp now.  In your offhand, that 11/29 Crystalized Sword is really nice, if you can find one for about 500-700pp.  also, Serated Bone Dirks are always a good option (especially at level 27 when they proc)- They still go for about 700pp.<br />
<br />
When you get level 25+, get that Burning rapier. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nightshade</div><div class="date">05-25-01, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, thanks for the info, I appreciate it...but now I've hit a big problem spot.  Thanks to a bug or something, I was trying to get some equip, when eq just shut down automatically and took me straight to my desktop.  When I logged back on, the money I was carrying to complete most of the deals I had made was gone, and I had a corpse.  So I've been petioning gm's all afternoon.  No one can help me, and now I have nada.  If you'll excuse me I must go out and have a drink before I smash my 'puter into bits.  This is gonna suck if I have to start from scratch thanks to whatever happened.  Just got a feeling that someone is a few k richer now...

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ceescrit da Bossalini</div><div class="date">05-29-01, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn, that recently happened to a guild mate of mine.  He was looting him corpse, and the server crashed.  when he logged back in, all the gear he had just looted was gone, and only the other half of his stuff was still on his corpse.<br />
<br />
Took him about 7 days straight of petitioning to recover over 20K worth of gear.  I think he finally got it back though, when he got in touch with a Admin or SWAT GM. [b]Ceescrit Bossalini<br />
