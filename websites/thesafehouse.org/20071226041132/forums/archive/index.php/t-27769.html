The studio had to first work out a deal with creator Masamune Shiro and manga publisher Kodansha who owns the original rights to usage.<br />

Interesting. Probably won't come out for a few years, but I have extremely low hopes for this movie.</div></div><hr />

Hehe only live action i ever wanted to see was the Death Note one :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-16-07, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the asian dramas I've seen have been fairly good (culture plays an even bigger factor here than anime, so foreigners often have a difficult time getting into it due to subtle differences).<br />
<br />
Japan has had many successsful anime to live action adaptations. Death Note, Great Teacher Onizuka, Nodame Cantabile, and many more. I'm not into many live action stuff, so I may be gravely mistaken, however I have not heard of many live action flops.<br />
<br />
That being said, JAPAN has been successful. The people making this are Hollywood. The same hollywood that hardly ever turns up a good adaptation, especially where foreign titles are concerned.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I'm not raising my hopes. If it turns out good, then great! But I won't hodld my breath.</div></div><hr />

(I have to admit though I havent seen all that much at least not compared to everyone here) If its going to be Hollywood making this I have some reservations, but I think if the right people get their hands on it it could be really awesome. Something like the care that Peter Jackson took with LoTR (obviously not with that big of a budget) or the Wachoski brothers with the first Matrix film. (I think they owe Masamune Shiro a freebie if they do it anyway) :) I also have some faith that Masamune Shiro will have enough oversight or control over the whole thing that it isnt a complete disaster considering the care he has taken with all of the English translations of his graphic novels. (I may be hopelessly naive on this thought though) Anyone else have thoughs on dream directors or casting decisions? Since it will be made by Hollywood I assume it will most likely have an American or Asian American cast.<br />
