But today in southwatch I seen a group all running around as panthers. i asked them what class got the spell. They replied it was a mask item from a quest in CiS. Siernda or something like that was the name. They wasn't sure on the name of the NPC but it was something to that effect. They didn't give me a lot of info. I have not had a chance to make it back to CiS and look for a NPC with this name yet.<br />
<br />
But has anyone else seen or heard of this? Or know anything about it? Cause rogues running around as black panthers is just special.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gauge</div><div class="date">11-03-07, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a quest in CiS, over by the Shrideth miners.  There is an NPC named Imirial the Seducer who gives the quest.  You have to get your faction up to 12000 with her to get the quest.  It's a nice mask and if you are around level 28-30 the faction grind is pretty decent experience.  <br />

It is still nice for classes who do not normaly get a speed buff (or a lazy rogue who forgot speed of wolf scrolls :P)</div></div><hr />
