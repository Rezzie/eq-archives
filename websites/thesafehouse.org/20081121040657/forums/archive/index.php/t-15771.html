<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-23-04, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a very easy quest, at least for anyone level 15+. Its a tad time consuming, but not really very bad. This entire bit of questing can be done solo by a 15+ character, with the exception of one step. <br />
<br />
<br />
First, go to the down below, and find one of the mechants (they are near the zone-ins from the starting cities, baubbleshire, nettleville, etc.). Behind the merchant, there should be a stack of books. Inspect the stack of books, and read the book you find. You should get the quest &quot;An Intruiging Eye&quot;. <br />
<br />
This is the access quest for the zone &quot;Crow's Resting Place&quot;. The quest takes place mostly in the down below, with some running up to various city zones as well. Every step of this quest is easily soloable, with the exception of the final step, which requires killing a fallen noble. The fallen nobles are level 11-12 group ^^ mobs, and they come 2 at a time. It was too much for me to kill by myself, but I found a couple of other adventurers to help me out. <br />
<br />
Once you have completed the access quest, click on the hand statue in down below to zone into Crow's Resting Place. Crow's is a very small zone, and is a base for operations for the Circle of Unseen Hands. Inside this zone, you will find Fippy Darkpaw the 4th. Talk to Fippy. He will tell you about how you won him a bet, and also insult you some. Give him the right answers, and he will give you a quest to collect signatures from tavern owners in Qeynos. It seems fippy, like his esteemed ancestor, is smuggling booze into Qeynos. He wants to you take around his ledger book and get signatures from his customers. The book doesn't give much detail on where to find each customer, but it wasn't too hard for me to figure out. Use your tracking skill to help you out. <br />
<br />
Once you have the signatures all collected, return to Fippy for more insults, as well as the quest reward, a Nighthide Tunic. <br />
<br />
<br />
Reward: Nighthide Tunic. <br />
<br />
light armor, with the following stats: <br />
<br />
AC 86 (at level 19, its 64 for 16), +5 agi, +3 str, +12 health, +12 power.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I got a good tip for you guys...if you talk to Fippy he gives you the book. Once you have it don't read it to innitiate quest...instead talk to the guy outside and do the cleanup for him and then kill all the wandering mobs, as soon as you do that, kill the person who told you to clean up ( i forget her/his name) then run to the back and the guy standing next to Fippy will spawn 2 mobs, and turn KOS kill him and a chest drops with the same book inside but this one is the &quot;good faction&quot; version of it. <br />
<br />
You can read both books and get the quests which are exactly the same. Complete them at the same time and you get a Nighhide Tunic and Tunic of the Guard which is exactly the same as nighthide but it has More Str instead of AGI (5str, 3agi) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aalias</div><div class="date">07-06-05, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saw these tunic's on eq2.ogaming.com and read about the quest (BTW Ogaming has higher stats for this item, don't know if the stats listed here are updated or theirs are).  When I inspect the books I don't get a window offering me the quest, I just get to read through the book, see that it says get the coin from the ratmen at all costs, and then stop inspecting the book is my only option.  Am I supposed to get a quest window?  Or do I just continue on like that.  Also is it possible I'm too high for this quest? I'm level 18, and this quest seems to be level 13 or so, which confuses me since I can still get level 5 quests.</div></div><hr />
