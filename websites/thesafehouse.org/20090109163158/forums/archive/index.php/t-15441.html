<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">11-10-04, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found it on another forum looks like I need to see the scribe as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merilee_Rathe</div><div class="date">11-10-04, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">During beta you went and interacted witht he 'trainers' for the melee class powers/skills while the int and wis casters could ge their upgrade from the scribes.  Every town village area should have them, although I don't know if during the release that they'll all have the same stuff...<br />
<br />
You can only buy Apprentice 2 from the trainers and scribes; Apprentice 3 and Adept/Master spells need to be made by a PC scribe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">11-16-04, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Apprentice III and Adept III are made by crafters, with Adept I only being available by monster drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">12-06-04, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you buy Adept II off merchants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinadial</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think Adept 2 is in game yet. App 2 is bought from the NPC trainer. Adept 1 and Master 1 are drops. App 3 and Adept 3 are PC crafted, but the reagent for the ink used in Adept 3 crafting is an extremely rare harvested component. To obtain Adept 3s, you're best bet is to acquire the rare ingredient then find someone to make the skill upgrade. You'll need an alchemist for the ink and a jeweler for the skill itself.</div></div><hr />
