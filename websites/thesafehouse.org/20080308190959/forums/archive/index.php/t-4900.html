<br />
BAF works a little differently. If your group consists of three or more people, you can pull a creature and at least one more will come to help out his friend.<br />
<br />
Both give a group experience bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dither DAoC</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">generally, it lays out like this:<br />
<br />
group total<br />
1-2 no baf<br />
3-5 add 1<br />
6-8 add 2<br />
<br />
baf is somewhat range based, but can oddly baf mobs far away.  pulling 1 mob straight through another can make bafs larger than normal, ie 2 adds with 3 in group.<br />
<br />
mez does not bring a baf, so many people make the mistake of thinking baf is buggy.  if your mezzer pulls with mez, there is no telling which of the mobs is linked to the one he mezzed, and if you pull the wrong one you can get up to 4 total, the one the mezzer mezzed, the one that was baf'd to it, the only that was pulled, and the one that was baf'd to it<br />
<br />
pull with a spell that causes both to come, ie root, and you will have very predictable baf. Dither Disgustipated<br />
