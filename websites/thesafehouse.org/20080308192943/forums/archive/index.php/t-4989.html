<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently created a CD/Weapon/Envenom spec shade, for fun.<br />
Template is:<br />
Pierce 44<br />
CD 44<br />
Envenom 43<br />
<br />
All should be at 50 with items and RPs I hope.<br />
<br />
Currently, Solo, I run around 75% survival on orange ideal mobs, which is very good. Survival is much closer to 100% on yellow ideals, though some poison resists may hurt me.  Next level I get the 10th level DoT, which should bring these percentages up significantly, provided I don't get resists.<br />
Grouped, the CD styles are incredible.  I can tear through things using CD positionals provided there's a tank around to distract the beast.  I was using a mentalist as a tank (Look, I had to improvise...) and worked very well.  The mentalist even survived some of the times =P  While lacking the initial punch of a CS assassin, the higher envenom spec and very high melee skills make it up over a short time.  Hopefully, the upgraded poisons will keep soloing viable for a while.<br />
<br />
Gonna update again if I ever hit 20 with him. (I figure 10-20 will prolly take as long as getting Caith up to 43 or so from 40...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm looking forward to seeing how well this template performs on the Battlegrounds. Kehvrynne Quickblade, Professional Damsel of Distress<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-27-02, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably horribly.  I'm not investing ANYTHING into stealth until the 40s or so.  For this char, stealth is ONLY useful in RvR, and to be honest, this is more of a PvE centered template.<br />
However, by 50 he'll have 25 stealth + 11 = 36.  Not the highest ever, but decent enough for someone who doesn't need to set up a CS.  Melee wise, he'll be fine in the BG, but there's a lot he won't be able to do then.  <br />
50 is when he RvRs seriously, as that's when stealth becomes high enough to be moderately undetected.  <br />
As far as assassin vs. assassin goes, he'll likely do very well.  The other assassin may be able to see him at longer range, but as long as he sees the other in time to get a shout off (No positional requirement) he'll win a fight against any assassin but a Shadowzerk.<br />
I plan on dressing him up with a robe and a staff and having some fun as bait too...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-28-02, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">May as well.  I don't really need it at all for anything other than RvR...  And if I need a high stealth shade (scouting etc) I can always use my main instead.  I'm not generally in favor of auto-training if it will make your life much harder.. But in this case, he'll hardly even notice it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">03-29-02, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an interesting template.  I'd like to see how that works with a shadowblade:<br />
<br />
You'd end up with<br />
<br />
44 axe<br />
44 Laxe<br />
43 envenom<br />
29 stealth (or as high as 41 stealth with items and realm rank)<br />
3 critical strike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-31-02, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, isn't that essentially a Shadowzerker you're describing there, as the Mid equivalent?  <br />
<br />
Cathon's main defense against other assassins is gonna be the DD shout.  He can use it on em as long as they're in view - no need to line up a PA at all.  Also, since detection is non-stealth based (And he'll have detect hidden once he hits high 40s) he'll be seeing the other assassin hopefully with enough warning to get the shout off.  One the shout is off and they're destealthed, he'll easily beat anyone other than a shadowzerk.  CD has a nice rear positional with a snare component and high damage (Well, it seems high at 12), which if the offhand weapon isn't breaking the snare (Not sure on this for the CD styles...) would make chasing people down fun.</div></div><hr />
