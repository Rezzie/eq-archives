<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silverblade</div><div class="date">02-08-07, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have info on this?<br />
I think they totally screwed up this quest.<br />
<br />
I had this quest from going inside the Tomb of Lord Tsang.<br />
Need 4 symbols.<br />
<br />
Then after the patch yesterday a ghost npc had a quest with the exact same name that told me to go to the 4 stone tablets by the gremlin portals near this area. I'm supposed to get the key to Lord Tsang's Tomb somehow(which I already have from another quest chain) and nothing updates or happens at these tablets for me. I'm afraid to delete my key to see if this works for this new quest. <br />
<br />
Anyone completed this and have the heroic dagger or have any information.<br />
<br />
If the rogue leader could bring this up to a dev it'd be great. I'd like to do this quest before the whole place turns grey con and it's already getting lightblue.</div></div><hr />

He just said it's from a very long line of quests in the Tomb of Lord Tsang. GL though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinge</div><div class="date">02-10-07, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guildy of mine has done this quest in the last few days, so it does look like it works. Am hoping to do it myself very soon.<br />
<br />
Edit - info ive found out about this so far - <br />
<br />
The quest in the Tomb itself which requires 4 symbols is still there and still doable. Completing that gives a reward of a blue quality weapon (about 12 dps). Had 2 guildies complete these quests in the tomb itself tonight.<br />
<br />
The quests given by the ghost outside the tomb appear to be the quests to upgrade these blue quality weapons to the legendary quality final weapons.</div></div><hr />

Quest 1 is easily done, kill 25 of the stongazers, 15 of the defiled oaks, 10 creepers, returning for a nice increase in dps<br />
Quest 2 is where it's broken from there i got 3 quest 2 shared the same name, one asking you to take the dagger and slay 10 of the ghost in the forest, another quest says take a provided key, which is not given to you to the flame up top and summon the 5 generals, the last quest he gives is also to go to the flame up top and slay the 5 generals with the provided key, also not provided, so at this point i am stuck with a dagger that has 18.54 dps not bad but not the best for the time wasted on stuck quest lol i have bugged all the quest and ask that you all do the same so we can all get it done =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
K, I finished this quest last night.<br />
The problem is that they changed the way the quest works and never deleted the old quests. So you can essentially have both methods running at the same time. The old method works, The new one does not. <br />
<br />
Old Quest<br />
4 symbols (blue dagger)<br />
Ghost npc &gt; kill 15trees, 25 stonegazers, 10 mosquitos (yellow dagger v1)<br />
Ghost npc &gt; do you want to upgrade weapon? click yes (yellow dagger v2)<br />
Ghost npc &gt; part III, test of wits, 4 riddles<br />
Ghoste npc &gt; part IV, tsangs generals, use key from part III kill mobs <br />
Ghost npc &gt; go to costal graveyard in thestra, touch the tablet (heroic final version dagger)<br />
<br />
New Quest<br />
4 symbols (blue dagger)<br />
Ghost npc &gt; kill 15trees, 25 stonegazers, 10 mosquitos (yellow dagger v1)<br />
Ghost npc &gt; kill 10 suffering villagers (yellow dagger v2) **Broken villagers do not give quest update when slain**<br />
Ghost npc &gt; Ulaar, the blade of anguish, 4 riddles**Broken removes the key from inventory, or the key disappears when you log, not sure which but I lost mine.**<br />
Ghoste npc &gt; Ulaar, the blade of anguish, use key from last part kill mobs **Broken -Removes the runestone from inventory**<br />
Ghost npc &gt; go to costal graveyard in thestra, touch the tablet (heroic final version dagger)<br />
<br />
Bugs<br />
-10 villagers do not update the new quest line.<br />
-Riddles part of new line removes the key when completed. (Key is needed for next quest in the chain.)<br />
-Generals part of new line removes the runestone when completed. (Runestone needed for the final quest.)<br />
<br />
Notes: If you are currently on the quest to kill 10 villagers and the ghost npc does NOT give you the option to upgrade right now then you'll have to wait until they patch. Don't waste your time. If you have the 18.54dps version 2 you can skip that quest and never do it. You will need to do the riddles quest. Once you get the riddles done I would only complete &quot;Part III, test of wits, but not Ulaar, the blade of anguish. If you have already completed it and no longer have the key you can still finish it. You will need another person who does have the key to spawn the generals. Have loot set to roll on magical. The person with the key can pass on the runestone so you get it, and he/she will keep the key. After obtaining the runestone I'd only complete Part IV: the generals, not Ulaar, the blade of anguish. The last step you go to costal gy chunk down to the water where the sunken boats are. Go with a grp and someone who has water breathing. tablet is in the middle of a boat that is sunk to the bottom and broken. <br />
<br />
Good Luck guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically every quest that the Ghost NPC gives and says &quot;Ulaar, the blade of anguish&quot; is a NEW quest. <br />
<br />
The ones that say Part III, Part IV etc those are the old ones. You should get options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I think I have  a problem then, I have two quests that both say, &quot;Ulaar, the Blade of Anguish.&quot; First one requires me to find Lord's Tsang's key, and I got the quest from the ghost outside the temple. The  second one requires me to find 4 symbols and I got it from the stone tablet inside the temple proper with the name of the weapon. How did you get the original quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
K let me correct myself. The one to get the 4 symbols is the original starter quest so keep that one. Delete the one to get Tsangs key. Once you get your 4 symbols (drops from trash mobs inside and near temple) then go back to the dagger to finish the quest. After that go talk to the ghost. He should give a quest to kill tons of mobs..(Might be call Ulaar, the blade of anguish - if so this is okay to complete still) after killing the mobs talk to him and he will give you the rare dagger upgrade. Talk to him again and there should be a chat bubble saying do you want to upgrade or something like that. Go through that text and you will get the 2nd version of the rare. Then you can get the quest from him that says Part III: test of wits. Do this and come back to him. Get Part IV: Tsangs Generals, go up to the flame, full group, tank, two healers, good dps. Come back get the quest Final Test or something and go to thestra and finish it up. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadySalba</div><div class="date">02-15-07, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok let me see if I got this right..<br />
<br />
 *Completed first Ulaar quest given by stone tablet within the temple that required 4 symbols and gives the first blue text version of Ulaar. <br />
*Completed the slaying of several forest animals given by the ghost outside the temple  that gave the second yellow text version of Ulaar. <br />
*Completed the 3rd quest for Tsangs weapons given by the ghost that required the 4 riddles, and got another yellow text version of Ulaar better than the last.<br />
<br />
Still to go, Tsangs flames general: I had actually killed the generals with a group prior to completing the first Ulaar quest, however it seems I have to kill them again while under the quest for it to work. Am assuming first orange text version of Ulaar comes after this is complete, correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's on Kojan, The Tomb of Lord Tsang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitch</div><div class="date">02-15-07, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been working on this quest for about a week (not every night though). I got all four symbols, but my other five friends need 1 or 2 each.  We've noticed that they don't really drop more on either the forest mobs, or the mobs inside the tomb.  Has anyone found if they drop more either inside or outside?  At least they can be traded.<br />
<br />
The dagger looks damn cool too.</div></div><hr />

We've noticed that they don't really drop more on either the forest mobs, or the mobs inside the tomb.  Has anyone found if they drop more either inside or outside?<br />
<br />
I would say they drop more often in the tomb than in the forest. After all the kills in the forest I needed to aquire the temple key and as part of the dagger quest I only saw one drop off a turtle in the forest area.<br />
<br />
I completed the quest tonight and here are my findings.<br />
<br />
 You will need the flame runestone twice in the quests current broken form.  I was able to keep my tsangs key and respawn the general so didn't have an issue. However a bard doing the quest in my group got his key eaten by the ghost quest giver. <br />
<br />
For the Coastal Graveyard part, you don't need a group or enduring breath. There are kos mobs however all you need do is avoid them, and you can always swim up for air while checking the sunken ships for the stone. The stone is not the easiest thing in the world to click either, you need to get real close to it and click it on it's side.<br />
<br />
And the final stats for those who were curious.<br />
<br />
Ulaar, The Blade of Anguish<br />
Soulbound<br />
Dagger and Knife                  Either Hand<br />
54 - 65 Damage                   Speed 2.10<br />
(28.10 damage per second)<br />

+6 strength<br />
Weapon Bonus<br />
  Attacks have a 5% greater chance of scoring a critical hit.<br />
Item Level: 23                      Equip. Expertise: 4%<br />
Durability: 100%<br />
Required Class: Bard, Druid, Blood Mage, Necromancer, Psionicist, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer.<br />
The ancient dagger, Ulaar. This fully-restored dagger once belonged to one of Tsang's five generals, a powerful rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitch</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LadySalba, just sent you a PM about this quest (I have a question about the last part).  Please take a look :smile<br />
<br />
Unless anyone else can help me who have completed the quest, or are about to. <br />
<br />
Last night I finished the generals part, and got my runestone. As expected, it was stripped during the turn in to complete the quest.  After that I did not recieve another quest to go to Thestra.  Is this normal? The way I read it is that I go to the graveyard in Thestra, loot the dagger there, and do not have to return to the ghost to get it.  I hope to God thats the way it is, since I never recieved another quest after that.  Or maybe its named something else instead of &quot;Ulaar, Dagger of ...&quot;?<br />
<br />
Is what happened normal? Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitch</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read a post on Silky Venom that someone says the the ghost NPC isn't giving out the quest anymore.  Yet LadySalba was able to complete it? Bah! I'm so confused now.<br />
<br />
Found out the final part is named something different then the &quot;Ulaar, Dagger of ...&quot; quest.  I don't think I got it last night, but maybe I just clicked fast, and didn't see I got a new one in the journal since I wasn't looking for a new named one.<br />
<br />
If I do have the final quest in my journal I should be able to spawn the generals again to get another stone.  If I don't have the quest, then I think I'm hosed until it's fixed.  I just don't get how a few people were able to complete it if the ghost NPC doesn't supposedly give the Thestra part.  When I clicked on him last night after completing the Generals part, he just rambled on about thieves in the tomb, and getting the weapon for him to upgrade.  It sounds like something he would say before you even accept the first quest.<br />
<br />
SO CONFUSED!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadySalba</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fitch, this happened to me too. I got the runestone from the general ring and did turn in with the ghost, he ate it and did not give another quest for the Thestra part. <br />
<br />
Luckily, a guildee was doing the same weapon quests for his DK, and he has the quest for the Thestra part and shared it with me. Here's what I think happened. The night I finished the killing the forest animals part of the quest, it was late I was tired and when I went to the ghost he had several quest options for me to choose from, I only took the one with the riddle stones thinking I could go back to the ghost at any point and get the others, well I was wrong.<br />
<br />
So the catch here is, after you kill the forest animals you need to get all the other 3 quests you need to complete the weapon at once or you might get screwed. Fitch all I can tell you is, when someone else you know gets to that point in the weapon quest right after killing the forest animals, have them get the quest for the Thestra part and share it with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitch</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, it makes sense now. Strangely considering how bugged it is.  So I have to find someone to get it shared from, or wait until they fix the quest, and it allows me to get the last quest.  They fixed so many quests in the last patch, but this one has been broken for quite some time.  Frustrating.  Thanks a lot for the reply and info.  My only hope is to find someone who can share the Thestra one...question is how.  Boards don't seem to work (posting on Florendyl server boards at least).  Guess I'll have to shout and offer money!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joege</div><div class="date">02-17-07, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After following the advice of folks here and in-game, I'm now to the point of looking for the stone in the Coastal Graveyard.  I have the runestone and according to what I've been told, I may not need the quest to actually head to Thestra to find the stone.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I went and looked for several hours last night and today and have yet to find the bugger.<br />
<br />
So far, the only clues I have are:<br />
<br />
a sunken ship in the area that is broken in two<br />
sort of in a square part of the ship that is sunk.<br />
<br />
In avoiding the mobs that are there, I still have yet to find the stone.  Also, am I needing to pick up an actual quest before I head to Thestra?  I asked around in OOC for a bit and no one had the quest to go there.<br />
<br />
Appreciate all of the info here regardless.  Best source of information I have yet to find.  Thanks Safehouse.<br />
<br />
Any assistance on the above is appreciated.  Thank you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silverblade</div><div class="date">02-17-07, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this quest is FUBAR!!<br />
I tried doing it and guess what. On Weapons Part III: Test of Wit - I answered the 1st three questions and when I went to the 4th stone it would not light up for me! Meanwhile my health is ticking down. So yep I ended up dieing because the quest bugged up. Tried to restart the riddles and guess what. The 1st stone now would not light up. Finally I deleted and restarted the quest and guess what the riddle stone still would not light up for me. So I petitioned. My petition was unanswered for three full days. In my petition I had written that the Key of Lord Tsang disappeared from my inventory because I originally completed the riddles and the key poofed out of the blue. I tried a /inventory, /bankadditem &quot;Key of Lord Tsang&quot;...neither of these worked. Wrote both of that in my petition. <br />
<br />
Three days later I get a response from a GM in my ingame mail in between the maybe 2hrs I had been offline the whole day. It said you should try a /inventory. The GM never read my post and didn't think twice about displaying customer service. SOE is supposed to be in charge of customer service and SOE is the exact reason I was hesitant to play vanguard. If something is not done about this lack of respect for the paying custome and the ******* ******** GM autoresponses I am out of this game for good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joege</div><div class="date">02-17-07, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, after this quest, I found that the final part is bugged for the Dagger quest.  As I said in my previous post, you can do the kill quests, and from there, you are supposed to get the &quot;kill the generals&quot; quest.  However, with Ulaar, you never get it.  The only way to finish the quest is to get someone to share the Thestra part of the quest after the generals are killed.<br />
<br />
Folks are camping the generals all of the time so getting the Runestone wasn't an issue at all.  However, after being on all day, no one has the Thestra part of the quest or wasn't reading Shout/OOC to share it.  Also, the actual &quot;Kill the Generals&quot; quest isn't sharable.  Checked and found that out tonight.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm stuck.  Heck, I don't even know how they are going to fix it.<br />
<br />
Axe/Mace/Sword quests work fine.  Rogues get hit again.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need to die if you fail the riddles, just click off the dots, regen your health then start over. This may not be working as intended, but at this time you can avoid dying and just redo the riddles 'til you get the correct answer. The riddles have a specific order, you need to hit the one that asks if you are ready to begin first, then go to the other ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the exact order of the riddles and every single step of the quest...I started the complete write-up. My frustration is that I'm bugged at the riddles part and it won't let me repeat the riddles now. GM's refuse to help in any way shape or form. They won't return the &quot;missing item&quot; -Lord Tsang's Key- and sense the riddle stones won't light up now I can't repeat the riddles part to get another key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT:  Woohoo!  Done!  Spoiler below!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Talk with the Spectre first and you get the Ulaar, The Blade of Anguish quest.<br />
<br />
From there, click on the Tablet of Ascendancy which is near by.<br />
<br />
Dagger done!  Now for the sword!.</div></div><hr />

Thankyou for the guide this topic was a little hard to piece together accurately X_x!  I only have one qustion. .. .. What exactly do you do to get the blue weapon? I hear people saying that you farm some kind of drop for some quest iinside but could someone provide a little more info please? Well, such as where the quest starter mob is located X_x</div></div><hr />

Inside Tomb of Lord Tsang proper, in room 2 or 3, after you port up into the temple (must go through locked gate therefore need to have key quest done) there is a stone tablet with the name of the dagger, Ulaar Blade of Anguish, click that to get the intial quest for the blue weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zokushi</div><div class="date">02-24-07, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok after much guesswork I finally figured it all out up till getting the quest inside.<br />
<br />
You should to be level 16+ to do the first 5 steps and 19+ for the rest.  All the mobs involved passed the 2nd step are 3 - 4 dots 19 - 22.  If you go even further into the tomb it becomes 25+ level mobs.<br />
<br />
1) Talk to Master D inside the house at Lotus Hold SE of the Jin'Ka Forest (ouside the forest)<br />
<br />
2) Accept quest &quot;Ulvari Weakness&quot; and complete and turn in to him<br />
<br />
3) Accept quest &quot;Into Jin'Ka Forest&quot; and complete and turn in to him<br />
<br />
4) Talk to Da'lar in the forest (near entrance, head straight east and down hill)<br />
<br />
5) Do quests from other 3 wardens in the forest to be &quot;blessed&quot;<br />
<br />
6) Turn in to Da'lar once Blessings complete and head to the temple with the key it gives<br />
<br />
7) Head up the stairs, take a left at the top and go up the next set of stairs<br />
<br />
8) Head up the stairs against the back wall and go up to the glowy orange colum on your right in the middle of the platform area<br />
<br />
9) Go to the side facing outwards from the temple and open the door then click the crystal inside to teleport in<br />
<br />
10) Once inside clear the first room (has the axe) then the next room you come to has the dagger quest<br />
<br />
11) Farm all the mobs inside the tomb and in the Jin'Ka forest ((only the 4 dots in the forest)) for the random gem drops (symbols ARE tradeable)<br />
<br />
And thats as far as I got tonight.  Took about 5-7 hours to do all that x_X<br />
<br />
If you want the longsword instead of the dagger like I did it's a bit more work.  You have to go passed the first few rooms then take the elevator UP (should be on your right after the dagger room).  A few rooms in you'll come to another split where you need to go UP again.  Few more rooms back you'll find a named golem and the altar for the longsword behind it. You've gone too far up if you see level 25 mobs.<br />
<br />
More uptades as I do the rest this weekend : P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here are the stats for the infinium dagger.<br />
<br />
Mercurial Infinium Dagger<br />
Bindable <br />
Dagger and Knife   Either Hand<br />
45 - 56 Damage    Speed 2.10<br />
(23.81 damage per second)<br />
+1 Critical Melee Hit Chance<br />
Weapon Bonus:<br />
Attacks have  5% greater chance of scoring a critical hit. <br />
Required Flags: Arena of Time<br />
Item Level: 27        Equip. Expertise: 5%<br />
Durability: 100%     Weight: 5.00<br />
Required Class: Bard, Druid, Blood Mage, Necromancer, Psionicist, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer.<br />
A dagger forged from Infinium and infused with time itself. <br />
<br />
<br />
This dagger can be traded, but notice you require the arena of time flag to be able to use it. Was told the short sword over shadows this with 28 dps, can anyone verify that. It would make the short sword a better choice to dual wield with Ulaar if that's the case.</div></div><hr />

No, the shortsword is like 24 maybe 25dps at most. It does not have the +1 melee crit either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completed this quest line last night in its newer format.  The tablet is no longer in Thestra, and the quest dialogue reflects the correct location.  None of the bugs listed in this thread (losing the key, problems with the general, or anything else) happened.  Everything worked as indicated in the quest instructions on screen.  I'm not guaranteeing that it will work for everyone, but I had no issues whatsoever last night.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />

<br />
So far we have been working the wolves which has been somewhat successful. We have also gotten a drop from the mobs on the stairs up to the tomb as well as inside the tomb.<br />
I have not seen any drops from the 4 dot mobs in the forest but then again we have not killed as many as the wolves.<br />
<br />
What did you all farm to get the symbols as the wolves are slowly driving us insane with their low drop-rate? :) <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I ended up buying 2 of mine from the broker :)<br />
<br />
(They were selling for about 40s each on Gelenia when I did this quest)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anyone is able to remember where they got their star symbol (I'm pretty sure it must only drop inside the tomb) I will be a very happy rogue :)</div></div><hr />
