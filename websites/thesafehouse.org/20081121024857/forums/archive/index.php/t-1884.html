Did you see his fist hit me? No? Then why did he get a point? I also have some issues with grown men who can't take hits. &quot;Light contact&quot; means I only leave bruses when you have no pads on, 'warning' my foot up your ass, buddy. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm a sore loser, but I feel pretty @#%$ ripped off when the score is tied 4-4 next point wins, and I've gotten 4 points that not enough judges scored to count. I have serious issues with someone tapping me on the head and getting a point. HIT ME, this is a god damn sparing match, we're fighting here. A body kick is going to be hard, take it like a man, it didn't even move you backwards...that means it wouldn't even count in Tae Kwon Do, you sniveling @#%$. Just as a hint, judge, a ridge-hand is different than a hook, learn the @#%$ difference and award me the point. No, I won't pull my hand back to my waist thank you very much, I'm fighting, I prefer to have my hands where they can block the vicious head-taps of my pussyboy my opponent. Thanks also to the order of matches so I got eliminated my first fight while everyone else got to fight two times.<br />
<br />
I've never been a good loser. :&quot;&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's something to be said for that. If he can make contact on you without exerting himself, over extending himself, ect...Imagine if he actually was trying to break your face. That tap to the head would have left you on the ground. You were trying to kick his ass, and he still won. Go up to the guy after a match next time and ask him if he wants to have it out, exhibition style. Then you'll know if the judges are just stupid, or if he really is better than you.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />

<br />
Are the judges counting techniques that could have landed but didn't?<br />
Are the judges counting techniques that could have landed and would have been effective?<br />
Are the judges counting techniques that could NOT have landed?<br />
Are the judges counting touches that would have had no effect? <br />
<br />
You can score points all day with pitty pat taps if you get the right judges. It's not right, but it's how the game is played. Blast the living hell out of em the first round. Dead in the center of the chest protector. You will be able to feint to that the rest of the match and get points when the guard shrinks. I guess you could have disputed the validity of the techniques used. It's far easier to tap someone on the top of the head then hammer strike them. Ask your teammates- maybe one of them saw something that you can't see. <br />
<br />
Well, condolonces on the loss. It's never easy to take when you think the other guy was fluffing it. Graynd Theftauto<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">10-05-03, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh, I didn't make it clear, Nenjin. I was ticked because it was not clean contact. You don't have to go out and kill a person, but putting your leg up and hitting a person with it is not a kick. Putting your arm out and having someone hit it with their head is not a punch.<br />
<br />
A backfist is a distinct motion and it is controlled. A side kick is a distinct motion and it is a controlled motion. He wasn't better than me, I was WAY off my game. (I blame rum and a girl named Katie. On the plus side, the look on my friends face was priceless when I asked him for 2 shot glasses and walked into my room with her though.) Most of my anger is at myself for being way off, but I am not happy with the judging at all. I think that:<br />
1) If you are going to require light contact, you judge for controlled, meaningful techniques. Not a backfist being me running into your head. Out, hit, snap it back. I have done Tae Kwon Do for a while, and you MUSt have good contact. That's why I say light contact means bruses. You have to know you hit them, they have to know you hit them and the judges need to know you hit them. Good, controlled contact. (Head kicks you tap, body kicks you put a bit more into because it's easier to block a body kick)<br />
2) A right hook is not a ridgehand, and vice versa. They look different, and I seriously object to that point getting taken.<br />
3) A crescent kick is a legitimate kick, &quot;We have to know what kick it is,&quot; doesn't cut it just because white belts in Karate don't do crescent kicks. I also object to those two points getting taken.<br />
4) If you are going to stop the fight to score, make sure there was contact. The way it works is 3 judges, 2 in opposite corners, one is the ref. The ref stops the match when there is contact to score. He (aparantly) thought there was contact with my spinning hook kick, one judge scored me as a head kick (2 points) but then the ref didn't actually score what he thought he saw, so I got nothing.<br />
<br />
I don't mind losing to a good fight. I love a good fight. In fact my favorite matches have been ones I've lost, sometimes badly. I really just don't think this was at all good judging, it happens though. I also am upset that the first fight was single elimination, and everyone else automatically placed. <br />
<br />
I don't care who is better than who. I just felt that after the scoring of my Kata it was &quot;lets grind down on the white belt from the other school day.&quot; I think it is pretty lame to go up and ask the judges, &quot;What can I improve on my Kata to score higher,&quot; and have them say, &quot;I don't remember what was wrong with it,&quot; well there was obviously .5 points wrong with it, because you scored all your students that much higher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you understand what he meant now, but I just wanted to add something. The thing is, it's alot easier to land a tap, than to land a solid hit, or a hard hit in general. Which is why I hate doing light/tap contact sparring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dahne</div><div class="date">10-05-03, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, you shoulda seen this style I used to do called Moo Yea Do.  You know what sparring was?  Stand in front of another person and kick and punch in their general direction. If it got on the ground, the teachers told you to stop and get up.  Sheesh.  Wusses.  At least it got me out of taking PE.  <br />
<br />
Now I miss the Israeli style I used to do when I was younger.  Nothing like a bunch of little kids wailing on each other.      <br />
