I played an Infiltrator the first month it came out, but they seemed to suck ass and everyone was complaining about them.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if they've made any changes to any or all of the rogue classes?  Have the even'd them out at all?<br />
<br />
If I play, I want to make sure I can rock hard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maxillious Doomscythe</div><div class="date">05-29-02, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There have been a ton of changes to the game... and frankly I cant really remember all of them.  But the major ones that pertain to infils that I can remember are as follows:<br />
<br />
Increased skill points to 2.5x level<br />
<br />
upped Dual wield % at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Buffed up Evenom dots<br />
<br />
Snare no longer breaks on damage<br />
<br />
Realm ability: See hidden, allows you to see archers at clip distance even if they are stealthed<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of combat style changes... might want to check out the 1.50 patch notes for anything that really pertains to you.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see... lots of people want to play assassin types now.  Hope this helps  <br />
