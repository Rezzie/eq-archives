<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chromite</div><div class="date">05-19-06, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a guide for flashing a Linksys WRT54G/GS/GL wireless router with DD-WRT firmware (http://www.dd-wrt.com/).  DD-WRT can be used on other routers as well but there are usually special instructions that you need to follow for those.  You can find this information and much more on the Official DD-WRT Wiki (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=DD-WRT_Docu_%28EN%29)<br />
<br />
Here's the official DD-WRT Support Forums: http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/<br />
<br />
You can view all the Supported Devices for DD-WRT here (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=Installation#Supported_Devices).  It supports several brands and models so make sure to check and see if your router is supported.  Listed below, you'll see the Linksys router versions and how to determine what version you have.  You just look at the first several characters of the serial number.Linksys WRT54G 1.0 CDF0xxx or CDF1xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 1.1 CDF2xxx or CDF3xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 2.0 CDF5xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 2.2 CDF7xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 3.0 CDF8xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 3.1 CDF9xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 4.0 CDFAxxx<br />
Linksys WRT54G 5.0 (JTAG only with cfe update, see here. (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=Flash_Your_Version_5_WRT54G))<br />
Linksys WRT54GL 1.0 CL7Axxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GL 1.1 CL7Bxxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GS 1.0 CGN0xxx or CGN1xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GS 1.1 CGN2xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GS 2.0 CGN3xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GS 2.1 CGN4xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GS 3.0 CGN5xxx<br />
Linksys WRT54GS 4.0 CGN6xxx<br />
This guide is only going to focus on the most common routers out there - the Linksys WRT54G/GS v1.0 - v4.0 and the WRT54GL (same as WRT54G v4.0).<br />
<br />
NOTE: Flashing firmware to a device is a very tricky thing.  You MUST do it at a time when you're pretty sure there will be no interruptions to your power, computer or attention span!  If there is a problem during the flashing process, you can sometimes &quot;brick (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=Bricked)&quot; your router.  Here is a link to recover a bricked router: Recover from a Bad Flash (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=Recover_from_a_Bad_Flash) (Make sure you save it offline!)<br />
<br />
OK now that we've gotten that out of the way, we can start off with the things you'll need:<br />
<br />
  A supported device I mentioned above.  If it's a WRT54G v5.0, please stop right now and go read the special link (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=Flash_Your_Version_5_WRT54G) for that instead and stop following this guide.<br />
<br />
 A wired connection between your computer and your router.  This means you have to hook up your computer via ethernet cable to the router.  Make sure you have the IP address for your computer set to a static IP (i.e. 192.168.1.2) and the gateway is set to your router's IP (default is 192.168.1.1)  Example picture: TCP/IP Settings (http://schrade.best.vwh.net/articles/hardware/DD-WRT_Firmware/TCP-IP.png)<br />
<br />
  The Linksys Firmware updater from the Linksys site for your specific model of router.  You can get it by going to the Linksys Support Downloads Page (http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1115416835852&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper).  This is important because if you have any problems you'll want to use this to try and recover from them by reflashing your router to the Linksys Firmware.  Also, make sure that you're running the very latest Linksys firmware for your router.  Update your firmware first if it's not the latest.<br />
<br />
  The DD-WRT v23 SP1 firmware you're going to flash the router to.  For now, there is one you need to download: dd-wrt.v23_mini_generic.bin (http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads/dd-wrt.v23%20SP1/mini/&amp;download=dd-wrt.v23_mini_generic.bin) .  If you want some other specialized features you can get one of these versions after you've flashed to the mini one above: Standard (http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads/dd-wrt.v23%20SP1/standard/&amp;download=dd-wrt.v23_generic.bin), VOIP (http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads/dd-wrt.v23%20SP1/voip/&amp;download=dd-wrt.v23_voip.bin) and VPN (http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads/dd-wrt.v23%20SP1/vpn/&amp;download=dd-wrt.v23_vpn_generic.bin).  I personally use the VPN version.  Avoid the versions with the specific model of the firmware in the filename.  (wrt54g/wrt54gs/wrt54gsv4) Those are for flashing via TFTP only!  The &quot;generic&quot; one is the one for flashing via web interface.<br />
<br />
Once you've established that you have a supported device and have downloaded all the firmware I listed above, we can start the flashing process.<br />
<br />
The first thing you do is to make screenshots or write down the settings you have in your router for port forwarding and/or any other things you may have set up.  I recommend using the Scrapbook Extension (http://amb.vis.ne.jp/mozilla/scrapbook/) for Firefox to do this.  It'll save an exact copy of a page in your router's config interface with any settings in the fields and whatnot.  It is also good for saving a local copy of the web page that tells you how to unbrick your router :)  It is important that you have your computer physically plugged in during the flashing process.  This means that you have to be plugged in via Ethernet cable to the router.  Do NOT flash over a wireless connection!<br />
<br />
And now, it's time to flash!<br />
<br />
 Reset your current firmware to factory defaults.  This can be done by going to the appropriate tab in the router config interface and selecting factory defaults, or by holding the reset button on the back of the router in for 30 seconds.  This will clear your NVRAM settings in the router and then load up the factory defaults.  Remember that the Linksys firmware sets your login to be nothing and the password is &quot;admin&quot;.<br />
<br />
 Once that is done and the router has completed rebooting, go to the firmware upgrade tab and browse for and select this firmware on your hard drive: dd-wrt.v23_mini_generic.bin (http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads/dd-wrt.v23%20SP1/mini/&amp;download=dd-wrt.v23_mini_generic.bin)<br />
<br />
 Now, click on the upgrade button and wait for your router to finish flashing.  It is VERY important that there are no interruptions at this stage.  Wait up to 5 minutes during this process before you try to do anything.  Watch the lights on the front of the router.  You should be able to tell when the modem reboots after a flash because the power light will start blinking.  Once the power light becomes stable then the router should have rebooted successfully.  Check to see that the router came up successfully by going to the router config page: http://192.168.1.1/  You should see a System Information page of your router.<br />
<br />
 You should now be running the DD-WRT Mini version of the firmware.  The login is now &quot;root&quot; and the password is now &quot;admin&quot;.<br />
<br />
 Click on the Administration tab and then click on the Factory Defaults sub tab.  Click on the Yes radio selector and then click on the Save Settings button.  The router should now reboot and load up the factory default settings for DD-WRT.  If you are having any problems at this point with accessing the router config page, try to do the 30 second reset.  (Push in the reset button and hold it for 30 seconds)<br />
<br />
 This step is optional.  If you want to install a DD-WRT firmware with more features like XBOX kaid, VOIP/SIP enhancements, OpenVPN client/server, etc. you can now install one of the other firmwares I listed above.  It is ESSENTIAL that you first flash to the DD-WRT Mini firmware before upgrading to any of those other firmwares.  The reason for this is because the default Linksys firmware does not support flashing firmware images larger than 2 megabytes.  You have to be running DD-WRT to do this.<br />

From v23 File Versions (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=What_is_%22DD-WRT%22%3F#v23_File_Versions) @ DD-WRT Wiki<br />
  Micro - does not contain: chillispot, nocat, rflow, kaid, samba client, SNMP, IPv6, MMC/SD Card Support, SSH, PPTP/PPTP Client, UPnP. This file is under 2MB in size. While it is aimed at routers with less than 2MB of flash space (e.g., Linksys WRT54G version 5), any router should be able to run this version, including Linksys WRT54G versions before 5. Note that the Micro version is considered in beta, so it has a chance of instability.<br />

I'm getting to the differences!  I had to write that thing up and double check my information on it a lot so it took a bit.  I'll be posting pictures of the router interface and what's included on the services tab between the different versions of the firmware.<br />
<br />
XLink Kai site: http://www.teamxlink.co.uk/<br />
<br />
Basically think of it as XBOX Live, but you get to play with people on other platforms.  And it's free and open source.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Vilk<br />
<br />
If you do go out and buy one, please remember to take note of the serial numbers!   You absolutely do NOT want to get stuck with a WRT54G v5.0.  Avoid it at all costs!<br />
<br />
The &quot;Mini&quot; version of DD-WRT supports PPTP by default as well.  I am pretty sure all versions of the firmware support it.<br />
<br />
The &quot;VOIP&quot; version of DD-WRT has a SIPatH tab (SIP At Home (http://sipath.sourceforge.net/)) with three subtabs - Overview, Phonebook and Status.<br />
<br />
I have no understanding at all of SIP and the VOIP stuff so I'll just be posting pictures of it in the second post of this thread.</div></div><hr />

Altho I just find it easier to manually do it but i was just curious :P.</div></div><hr />

I am not a fan of UPnP but it should work just fine with uTorrent and DD-WRT.<br />

Static IPs and specific ports/port ranges are what I use.</div></div><hr />

That'll come when I write the second part of the guide.. configuring the firmware.<br />
<br />
I'll go into locking down the firmware, selecting the best encryptions for Wireless, configuring QoS, etc.</div></div><hr />

Well, the stuff in the second guide will mostly be basic things that most people who get into the router config screen should already know about.   (Well, other than the QoS settings)<br />
<br />
The hardest parts are trying to figure out what firmware file to download for your router, what the proper procedure is for flashing to reduce the chance of having problems, etc.<br />
<br />
Once the router is flashed and factory defaults have been set then you can go about doing the configuring of the router.  Basically, the firmware is miles above the standard blah firmware of Linksys and you might as well be running it anyhow even if you don't know how to configure some things in it.  All the basic functionality of the Linksys firmware is in there along with WAY WAY more information and features and most importantly... the HELP files!</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK first of all, don't panic.  This happened to me once as well.<br />

Did you follow the instructions of flashing the mini version first and after it's flashed you push and hold the reset button for 30 seconds?  It's a good habit to do that after a flash to a new type of firmware to completely clear out all the old NVRAM settings.</div></div><hr />

Ya did this several times =/. Even when the load times when down and seemed normal....it then crashed and you can not reach the setup page or the internet. Its like the commuication with the router dies and everything is lost. (tested this by ping also and at times it lost the router totally.)<br />
<br />
Should note that I did do as you say. Once it flashed it could not reach the router. So I did do a hard reset. Then it still could not reach it but eventually it does. Then when i get inside it the stuff lags like crazy and just flat out dies. Then i try to go back but can't etc and so on :P.</div></div><hr />

OK let's have you do this then.  Load up the Linksys flasher program and have it ready to flash.  Then do that 30 second reset of the router and try to flash it using the Linksys flasher.  Let it reboot on its own and stuff.  See if the standard Linksys firmware works.<br />
<br />
What you're experiencing or seeing is exactly what I saw when I didn't do the steps right and also tried to overclock the router.  (I really don't recommend trying the overclocking option)</div></div><hr />

Oh I was able to flash back just fine even with the DD firmware on! (when it responded long enough without crashing itself). But it seems flashing back is not a problem =/.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's incredibly stable.  I too used to use Sveasoft and once I came across DD-WRT I started using it.  It has far far far more options and a much better layout plus the helpfile links on each tab actually have help in them!<br />
<br />
Can you be more specific than just DNS?  There's lots of DNS options.<br />
If you mean allocating DNS names via MAC address using DHCP then yeah, that's available.<br />
<br />
Static Leases for the DHCP server are available on the Administration - Services tab.</div></div><hr />

Make sure you don't buy WRT54G v5.0 routers!  That's really important.  They are not the same as the others.  The only new versions of the router that you can buy from a store that are good are the WRT54GL routers.</div></div><hr />

OK.. make note of the special information for flashing the Buffalos then!<br />
<br />
Flashing the Buffalo WHR-G54S and WHR-HP-G54 (http://wrt-wiki.bsr-clan.de/index.php?title=Installation#Flashing_the_Buffalo_  WHR-G54S_and_WHR-HP-G54)<br />
<br />
Make sure you have your computer set to 192.168.11.2 when you go to flash the router.  The router's IP address will be 192.168.11.1.  You won't be able to flash to DD-WRT using the default Buffalo firmware because they have it set up so you can only flash signed/encrypted firmware.<br />
<br />
To get around that you have to use TFTP to flash it.  TFTP is a builtin command with Windows XP and most Unixen.  You'll see the commands you need to do in that link above.<br />
<br />
So.. steps to do this:<br />
<br />
<br />
  Make sure you have your Computer's NIC set to 192.168.11.2, Full Duplex 100 MBit, the Buffalo router should have the IP address of 192.168.11.1 by default.<br />
<br />
  Unplug power to the router.<br />
<br />
  Open up two command prompts (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; cmd [enter]) and type this in one and hit enter:<br />
ping -t 192.168.11.1<br />
<br />
  In the second command prompt cd to the directory where you have the TFTP Version of the firmware you want.  I'm just going to point to the VPN one since that's what you mentioned.  So type this:<br />
tftp -i dd-wrt.v23_vpn_generic.bin (http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/downloads/index.php?path=dd-wrt.v23%20SP1%2Fvpn%2F&amp;download=dd-wrt.v23_vpn_generic.bin)  (don't hit enter yet)<br />
<br />
  Now, plug the router back in.  The second you see pings coming across in the ping command window, hit enter on the tftp command window.  If you see a successful transfer, leave the router alone for about 2 minutes.  I know this will seem like eternity but just do it for safety's sake.  Once that's up, then unplug the power, wait 10 seconds and plug it back in.  Your Router's IP address is now 192.168.1.1! Make sure you change it on your computer so that you have IP address 192.168.1.2 on the computer, 192.168.1.1 as your gateway.<br />
<br />
  To login to the router you just go to http://192.168.1.1/ and login name is root, password is admin.  Once logged in go to the Administration - Factory Defaults tab and reset the router to factory defaults.  This is important!<br />
<br />
<br />
You should now be able to enjoy DD-WRT firmware on your Buffalo router.  You will no longer have to upgrade the firmware via tftp with it, you can just upgrade it via the web interface.  The default Buffalo firmware just doesn't allow for that.<br />
<br />
Also, should you ever want to go back to the default Buffalo firmware, you can use this: http://brainslayer.braincontrol.org/backup_whr_hp_g54.bin   Just make sure you use tftp to get it over there.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I do not own a Buffalo router so I am only try to translate the instructions to make them a little easier to follow.  Do these at your own risk!</div></div><hr />

In any modern browser that follows standards they should wrap.  I tried it in both Firefox and Opera and they wrapped just fine.  What browser are you using?</div></div><hr />

But, got one of the Buffalo's firmware upload done, been playing with the settings.  Amazing amount of options.  Will be testing over the next few days as far as its operability.<br />

<br />
I used:<br />
<br />
Solution Nr 1<br />
Go to the Web-Admin and log in <br />
Go to 'Administration' <br />
Go to 'Management' <br />
Enter the following values at 'IP Filter Settings' <br />
Maximum Ports: 4096 <br />
TCP Timeout (s): 90 or 120 <br />
UDP Timeout (s): 90 or 120 <br />
<br />
I think I set my time outs to 300 for ICQ.<br />
<br />
In any modern browser that follows standards they should wrap.  I tried it in both Firefox and Opera and they wrapped just fine.  What browser are you using?<br />
<br />
I use IE via Maxthon (http://www.maxthon.com).</div></div><hr />
