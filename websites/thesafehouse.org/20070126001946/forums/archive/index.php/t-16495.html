<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">12-29-04, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I have a bunch of collection quests that need to be complete, Is there specific areas that I need to look for the ?'s on the ground? Does one zone have all feathers? or gnome bones? Or do I just need to keep wandering around till I find something.</div></div><hr />

Frankly for collections I turn to the market.  Just make it the last thing you do every session, just before you log off or go into seller mode.  Get feel for the prices of collected items and only buy things at that special low price.  Do this every session and before you know it you will have completed tons of collections at low cost.<br />

unscathed/weathered bones can be found in Stormhold, along with spiders<br />
bone chits and gnoll bones can be found in blackburrow<br />
<br />
that's all I know right now. I find you can make a pretty gold piece if you go to SH or Oakmyre late at night, run around the zone, and find all the question marks when no one is online. Oakmyre is relatively safe, unless you're very low level. SH, the three places I've ever seen question marks are the Atrium, the Entrance Hall, and the Library. The Atrium they spawn more commonly, and it's completely safe there. I would spend the majority of my time in the atrium if I went ? hunting.</div></div><hr />

Enchanted Land is good for enchanted maple leaves and pristine shards and I think enchanted bones.</div></div><hr />
