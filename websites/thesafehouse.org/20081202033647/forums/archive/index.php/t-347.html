have heard none quite like this...<br />
<br />
The fire at my feet begins to dwindle in the growing light of dawn, I am<br />
surrounded by the tents of my fellow Insane Heroes, yet I remain, awake --<br />
indeed unable to rest! -- until I have recorded the events of this evening.<br />
Dadathias (31 Cleric), Quagmire (29 Rogue), Samoy (28 Enchanter) all rest<br />
peacefully after our exhausting battles. I, Malinois (28 Paladin), am<br />
restless and still somewhat covered in the blood of Borxx. This is our tale:<br />
<br />
Upon arriving in Clan RunnyEye, we gathered our wits about us to develop a<br />
strategy for tackling the dungeon. Having had the vile Borxx focus her glare<br />
on each of us over the past couple of days, we were looking for vengeance.<br />
<br />
It was at this moment, while we decided on our strategy, that we became<br />
aware of Borxx's foul presence. Quagmire ran off to find her. A few minutes<br />
later he was heading back, his health quickly draining. Borxx had cast her<br />
gaze upon him and was dealing him great blows of magic! Quickly all of us<br />
jumped in. There were several underlings there to help her and the battle<br />
was fast and furious. Samoy was working with chain stuns and group mesmerize<br />
and Dadathias was watching everyone's health. I stood exchanging blows with<br />
Borxx while Quagmire buried his dagger in her big, gelatinous retina.<br />
Several minutes later, Borxx gave up and began to retreat. One final<br />
backstab and she died, offering up her coveted lens to Samoy!<br />
<br />
Feeling vindicated yet unsatisfied, we went back to planning our assault.<br />
With the victory over Borxx fueling our confidence, we tried to come up with<br />
something daring and unusual. That was when Quagmire suggested a strategy<br />
that upon conception appeared insane. Using only faded parchment maps as our<br />
guide, we decided to dive into the cesspool leading out of a room guarded by<br />
an Evil Eye and his dazed goblin guards, swim to the end of the water<br />
tunnel, get out deep in the dungeon and then fight our way to the top.<br />
Surprisingly, everyone readily agreed.<br />
<br />
Heading to our point of departure, we dispatched the first Evil Eye with<br />
surprising quickness and stood around the vapors rising from the cesspool,<br />
hearts pounding. With Quellious and the divine light of Ghoulbane to guide<br />
me, I jumped in. We emerged out of a hole in the depths of the dungeon, with<br />
4 goblin workers standing in awe. Moving quietly through the halls, we found<br />
little here to challenge us. Goblin workers were everywhere but had<br />
apparently heeded our warnings and were afraid to advance. (Someone<br />
commented that though there were goblin workers in abundance, there was<br />
surprisingly little work being done.) Disappointingly, the fourth floor was<br />
no challenge. The workers avoided us and the few goblin guards that offered<br />
defiance were often dead before they had time to reconsider. Eventually, we<br />
found a ramp and headed up.<br />
<br />
On the Kings level we met much more resistance. We started in the Warlord<br />
room and dispatched he and his elite guards. Moving on the Kings domain, we<br />
found him heavily fortified. This battled lasted several minutes and in the<br />
end, we defeated the King and 14 of his minions. Goblin blood swept across<br />
the floor. Pausing to rest for only a moment, we pressed on through the back<br />
of the Kings room into a goblin bar. Here the merchants would not sell to<br />
us, so we killed them and their guards for their insolence. We ventured into<br />
the goblin bank and were forced to kill one of the bankers when he insulted<br />
me. The other banker held his tongue, so we all conducted business with him.<br />
Searching the rest of the level methodically, we engaged in several epic<br />
battles, leaving bodies scattered in our wake.<br />
<br />
We went up to the next level and quickly found ourselves battling near the<br />
Knights room. (Apparently, word of our attack had reached him by this time<br />
and the cowardly Knight had fled.) Working our way around the corner from<br />
the Knights room we were faced with a tough battle of several shaman and<br />
dazed guards. A few fled before us and we gave chase back down to the fourth<br />
floor. Cautiously, we moved on. Around one dark corner of stone walls, I<br />
stumbled headlong into what turned out to be our most challenging effort.<br />
First six goblins, then five more joined, and soon four more. Everyone was<br />
in peak form at this point and the swords were fast and furious. Dadathias<br />
was working to keep Quagmire and I alive while Samoy began to get control of<br />
the battle. For several moments I stood ready to call upon the healing power<br />
of Quellious and Lay on Hands; though it did not become necessary. Sweat<br />
dripping, goblin blood and bodies lying everywhere, we paused to regain our<br />
strength. While waiting, I walked into a hidden room and found a stunning<br />
view of the night sky over Norrath. It was beautiful.<br />
<br />
With only one room left in all of RunnyEye to explore, we found the Slime<br />
Elemental standing on a walkway over a pit of contaminated water. We<br />
dispatched him quickly, jumped off the ledge into the pool, and began to<br />
make our way to the top. Reaching the second floor, someone suggested that<br />
we take the warlord off his throne for the last time. At this same moment,<br />
we were engaged by several goblin shaman and a couple of guards that had<br />
been summoned by the King. While fighting, we realized our group had been<br />
separated and Quagmire was nowhere in sight. Calling for him, he responded<br />
that he had gone on to the defeat the warlord by himself! (Samoy is certain<br />
it was an attempt to gain glory for himself, as this particular Rogue<br />
Halfling is occasionally given to flights of fancy and fits of madness.) As<br />
his health rapidly diminished and having just killed the last goblin, I gave<br />
chase. Running through the corridors exhausted and encumbered, I made my way<br />
to the warlord with all haste I could muster. Quagmire's health was sinking<br />
faster than the progress I was making; I began to think I would be too late.<br />
I rounded the last corner and opened the door to find a horrifying scene:<br />
Quagmire stood nearly unconcious in the corner of the room. The warlord and<br />
one guard dead, the last two pounding mercilessly on my friend... I reached<br />
out, laid my hands on him and revived him completely!<br />
<br />
The assault was over. There was nothing left to kill. Rejoice people of<br />
Norrath! All who have died at the despicable hands of the goblins have been<br />
avenged! Four Insane Heroes ventured into the depths of RunnyEye, to areas<br />
none had seen before, and emerged victorious. For our troubles, we plundered<br />
the riches of Clan RunnyEye: we had the lens for the Observer Staff, several<br />
pieces of Blackened Iron Armor, Bone Totems, money and other magic items.<br />
<br />
Alas, it is getting very late and dawn in Norrath approaches. My companions<br />
are fast asleep, dreaming of their conquests and the adventures ahead. Now I<br />
must rest as well, for we have heard rumors of an evil presence lying in<br />
wait in a place called Najena...<br />
