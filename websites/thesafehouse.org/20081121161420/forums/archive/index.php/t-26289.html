<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dral</div><div class="date">10-05-06, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inner Fire will be one of the premier hardcore PVE raiding guilds in the game Vanguard. Already, our leadership is composed of very experienced, dedicated, and talented players of various MMO's, including EQ1, EQ2, WoW these are just to name a few. We also come from some of the top Guilds game wide in those games and we want to continue that trend by being one of the top GUILDS in the game of Vanguard. We're one of the newest Vanguard pre-release guilds, formed just recently, and we continue to grow in numbers and strength with each passing day. However, we are looking for Quality not Quanity, we are only looking for people that have the same desire, will, and strength to compete at the highest level to complete all goals and encounters the guild will be taking on. <br />
<br />
Do we sound appealing to you or you think you have what it takes to be with the best? We're currently open for limited recruitment. We're not looking for casual players or l33t hungrey kiddies. If you're a mature, hardcore - dedicated player, looking to be among the best in Vanguard, and want to push your knowledge and skills to the limit to overcome almost near impossible encounters. Then maybe Inner Fire may be the home for you. <br />
<br />
Please for the time being post below or send me a PM if you are interested in applying and or would like to have some more information. We are currently building our site and forms which should be up shortly. <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
Dral <br />
CO-Leader</div></div><hr />

mIRC is shareware, not freeware.  After 30 days it nags the crap out of you to register.</div></div><hr />
