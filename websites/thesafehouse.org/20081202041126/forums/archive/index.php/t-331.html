<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-20-00, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I groaned. I rubbed the scar on my face. &quot;Fresh one, I must've been drunk last night...&quot; I stood up slowly only to realize just how high up I was. &quot;...&quot; I have been afraid of hieghts for a long time, probably since my sister fell to her death. &quot;Amuretsu...&quot; I mumbled. I shook myself off. I leaned my back against one of the giant tree supports of Kelethin. It was rigid and coarse. I couldn't have cared less at that moment. I couldn't feel my back anyway...<br />
      I decided to go to Merchant Kwein's for some milk and sober up before I went hunting. On my way I saw a very fresh inviting pine tree. I took my dirk from my hilt and dug my name into the tree. One of the gaurds caught me and chased me, but I hid in a barrel of ale. So much for sobering up.<br />
      When I woke up after havin a wee drink t was getting late. I decided before it got dark to go to Crush Bone and fillet some orcs. Upon walking in I was greeter with the stench of death and a sword to my neck. A legionairre! I sliped around him. (Orcs are big dump things so it wasn't hard.) And ran him right through with my pike. &quot;Damn!&quot; It was caught in the ribs. As I ripped it out a note fell from his hand...<br />
Ofcourse I can't read orc so I went to the HeartWood Master.<br />
I said, &quot;Excuse me M'lord but I've found meself a note from one of them greenies.&quot;<br />
He pondered over it for some time.<br />
He then went bright white and gasped.<br />
&quot;What is wrong M'lord? You be as white as a ghost high elf!&quot;<br />
He looked at me, his hands shaking, &quot;Go-go-g-g- go get a gaurd, NOW!&quot;<br />
I was quite mystified but obligied his command.<br />
The gaurd said in a very strong, deep voice, &quot;What be the problem 'ere?&quot;<br />
He waved me away, but noone can hide a secret from a rogue. I hid, and listened.<br />
&quot;They are planning an all out attack!&quot;<br />
&quot;What!? There ain't no way! Greenies ain't be that smart!&quot;<br />
&quot;Unless this is a hoax, we have 3 days...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh dear Tunare!&quot;<br />
&quot;How many gaurds do we have?&quot;<br />
&quot;'Bout 50.&quot;<br />
The Heartwood master became very pale.<br />
&quot;The orcs number in the hundreds... and if they joined with other orcs or gnolls, or- or worse.&quot;<br />
&quot;Worse?&quot;<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
&quot;No, we banished them from our land years ago, no lizzard man has been seen since...&quot;<br />
&quot;I think there is something you should know as captain of the gaurds...&quot;<br />
&quot;About 3 years ago, a young highelf was playing on the shore... when he was attacked. His body was found with- with some scale dents on his chest and arms...&quot;<br />
&quot;But, I- I- thought they decided it was a lone froglok, or a goblin...&quot;<br />
&quot;No goblin has scales like that...&quot;<br />
&quot;We are in Tunare's hands now...&quot;<br />
&quot;We need a scout, someone who can go to- to Kunark...&quot;<br />
&quot;Kunark!? Are you loopy!?&quot;<br />
&quot;We have no choice, if the orcs were sending that note to the Iksar, we are doomed.&quot;<br />
&quot;But, what evidence would make you think that Master Heartwood?&quot;<br />
&quot;This-&quot;<br />
He handed the captian a letter. One thing caught my eye even though I was several feet away... A scale mark...<br />
&quot;Oh Tunare! It- it is written in Iksar!&quot;<br />
The Heartwood Master lowered his head.<br />
&quot;We must find a scout...&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I hope you like my story so far, if I get some positive feedback I'll write more. Thanks for reading it!<br />
 &quot;If you see me coming better step aside, alot of orcs didn't alot of orcs died...&quot; <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-24-00, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hairs on the back of my neck rose...<br />
&quot;Eh! Young scout, get up...&quot;<br />
I stayed hidden.<br />
&quot;Eh! you 'eard me! We need a scout and you are one, ye 'eard all this!&quot;<br />
Accepting my unfortunate fate I stood up.<br />
&quot;How old are ye, wee scout? Eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am not 'wee' I am 20 seasons old.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eh now don't be getting in a tizzy, we need ya.&quot;<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
The Hearwood master stood up and walked to a large chest. He carefully removed a lock and lifted the door.<br />
The gaurd went pale.<br />
&quot;You aren't gunna give 'im that are ye?&quot;<br />
The Heartwood master rose and nodded solenmly. He was holding a small wooden box. He handed it to me as if it were a baby in a blanket. Such care startled me and I wondered what was inside.<br />
&quot;Open it boy, for if you don't we are doomed...&quot;<br />
I stood, on the hard pine floor of the Soldiers of Tunare platform, shaking; I opened the box slowly... Inside rapped in some sort of velvety fabric was a dagger. A dagger like none I'd even seen.<br />
&quot;Go ahead... Even in a time of such tragedy, I know your youthful enthusiasm begs you to try weilding it.&quot;<br />
I stared at him then down at the dagger in awe.<br />
It had a strange, almost golden tint in it. I puzzled and held it up. Imeadiately I felt it's power.<br />
&quot;It's- it's- amazing!&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed it is a relic of Tunare herself...&quot;<br />
I felt all the blood in my face drain... I was holding the dagger of Tunare! Tunare!!<br />
The gaurd a bit stunned although he knew of it's exsitance could not believe it had been handed to a scout.<br />
He said resentfully, &quot; 'Ow can ye give 'im that! That be a relic! Of Tunare! He be a trooblemaker! How can HE weild it!&quot;<br />
The Heartwood master scowled at the gaurd and said, &quot;He just so happens to be the son of Qetra! How dare you say such things of him!&quot;<br />
The gaurd went pale... He looked as if he had seen a ghost.<br />
His mouth opened as if to speak, but he shut it again, looking down at the floor puzzling.<br />
I finally regained my senses to take notice of the fact that my long lost father had a name...<br />
&quot;Who? Who is it you speak of master?&quot;<br />
&quot;Long ago, when I was a lad, very young and just learning how to tame the magics of the earth I met a man by the name of Qetra. He was a traveling monk, a human. Ofcourse humans are not well liked for stealing and ruining our lands, but he was quite different. He was kind to all men. All, with no exception. One day I was practising my magic when an orc pawn ran up and tried to cut me ear to ear, out of nowehre Qetra slammed the pawn down and I was saved. He lived in Kelethin all his life until your mother died. It was an akward wedding ofcourse, him a human and her a woodelf. But somehow even though they were so diferent, Qetra was accepted for his kindness and good deeds. But she was murdered. One late night I heard her scream as Qetra was taking you and your sister on a walk to Merchant Kwein's, if I had only been a minute sooner this story would not have been important. Qetra heartbroken, left Kelethin, he never returned.&quot;<br />
&quot;But... people told me my father was a worthless drunk...&quot;<br />
&quot;That is because many are not partial to uh- 'halfbreeds'&quot;<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry lad, but you know how people are...&quot;<br />
&quot;It's ok, we need not talk more of that.&quot;<br />
I put the dagger in my belt and smiled.<br />
&quot;What is it called?&quot;<br />
&quot;It be the Dirk of Tunare, it has no real name; You should choose one for it...&quot;<br />
I smirked.<br />
&quot;Arg! Nothing dirty lad!&quot;<br />
The gaurd rolled his eyes.<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I was told of my mission and escorted to Felwithe. Aparently there was a secret dock to Kunark there. My boat trip was one of sickness and rain. I was sober the whole time, couldn't keep a drop or a bite down with all that rocking.<br />
When I got to Kunark I met a man by the name of Dynuac McFerrin. Apparently the high elves had bargained with the barbarians to do their dirty work.<br />
&quot;Hail yoong lad!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hail...&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah! Suprised I see! Dem, 'igh elves be pretty smart but noot to strung, so dey sent us in to bash 'em Iksars!&quot;<br />
&quot;But, what do you get for it?&quot;<br />
He lifted a velvet curtain beside us, inside was beer, gold and women. <br />
&quot;Not a bad deal...&quot;<br />
&quot;Ehehe, we be dooin fine doon 're, but we need a guud scout to find dem Iksars! Dey be pretty crafty imps!&quot;<br />
&quot;Imps?&quot;, I mumbled.<br />
&quot;Be ye tired, ur hoongry? Or...&quot;<br />
He nudged me and winked.<br />
&quot;No thanks...&quot;<br />
I looked over and saw a solemn looking high elf.<br />
She looked at me and turned away quickly.<br />
Dynuac looked at me and smiled.<br />
&quot;She be a fine one, eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
She tried to speed up and get out of the corridor.<br />
&quot;Eh now! You wait 'ere.&quot;<br />
He grabbed her by the shoulder and leaned over to kiss her.<br />
I grabbed him by the shoulder and said.<br />
&quot;We need to discuss buisness now...&quot;<br />
He grumbled but let her go.<br />
He looked at me as if nothing like that had ever been done. I felt me face getting red and turned away...<br />
<br />
 &quot;If you see me coming better step aside, alot of orcs didn't alot of orcs died...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-25-00, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rest of the day was spent getting to know the castle. I had dinner with the barbarians, they are horrible eaters.<br />
&quot;Pass de meat, laddy.&quot; Was all I seamed to hear over the belches and chewing grunts.<br />
&quot;So ye hittin de hay eh laddy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes M'lord I hope you don't mind...&quot;<br />
He chuckled and said, &quot;Oy, I 'ave a wee suprise for ye.&quot;<br />
Considering barbarians suprises went from a polar bear in your bed to a snake in your pillow I was a bit nervous.<br />
He nudged me with his elbow and winked. &quot;Eh, laddy doon be so pale, I picked ye the one ya wanted.&quot;<br />
&quot;???&quot;<br />
I walked into my dark room. I drew my dagger expecting the pig that I saw in the pen earlier and had mentioned what a good dinner it would make. But as I came nearer to my bed I didn't hear any 'oinks' so I figured he had put some sort of snake in my bed. I put my hand on the bump on my bed and realized it was &amp;lt;bold&gt;not&amp;lt;/bold&gt; a snake. I realized it was a person... I gulped. I realised it was that high elf girl... I drew back quickly. She stirred. She went pale. &quot;M-M-m'lord I'm sorry I fell asleep...&quot; I stood there. My mouth opened as if to speak. Then shut. She realized I hadn't ordered this and looked embaressed. &quot;Forgive me M'lord... he said I was to go here...&quot; I opened my mouth, and in a very shy voice said, &quot;No, forgive me M'lady...&quot; She looked stunned. &quot;M'lady? what- what did you call me?&quot; &quot;I may be but a simple scout, but I shan't shame you that w-w-way&quot;, I stammered. She looked at me as if she had never been called a lady, let alone been given any respect. I moved towards my satchel. I removed a shirt from it and handed it to her. I turned away as she put it on. &quot;But why M'lord?&quot; I stared at the floor.<br />
 &quot;Leave now... tell that barbarian that you are mine and will not be taken advantage of...&quot;<br />
 &quot;Yours?&quot; she said haughtily. I mumbled then spoke up, &quot;I won't even come back from this mission, you'll be safe though...&quot; <br />
&quot;My name is Ilyunia, what's yours?&quot; <br />
&quot;I have no name...&quot;<br />
&quot;No name? Then I shall give you one...&quot;<br />
She looked down at my boots, then looked up to my unshaved face.<br />
&quot;Sett&quot;<br />
&quot;Sett?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, that name suits you well.&quot;<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
I woke up about noon. I picked up my satchel, adjusted my belt and went to the roof of the barracks. I looked over the hills and stared at the dark forests. Dynuac came up and said, &quot;Eh laddy, enjoy yeself?&quot; I didn't make eye contact. <br />
&quot;Eh now laddy? Whas' wroong? She din't get back till late, ye moost've 'ad a gud time!&quot; I scowled. <br />
&quot;Ahh, she no be as gud as ye was tinkin eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am a man of honor dammit! I did nothing with her!&quot;<br />
He looked at me as if I had said the strangest thing to ever befall his ears.<br />
&quot;Leave me, now! I wish to be alone!&quot;<br />
He bowed then walked down the stairs.<br />
Ilyunia snuck up the stairs.<br />
&quot;Hail good sir scout.&quot;<br />
My scalp tensed and I looked away.<br />
She smiled. She reached up and brushed my hair out of in front of my eyes.<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
&quot;What is wrong Sett?&quot;<br />
&quot;I-I-I- I can't be with you. I have to concentrate on my mission... I wish- *sigh*&quot;<br />
She countinued tussling my hair.<br />
&quot;I know...&quot;<br />
She took a dagger from her robes and cut a lock of hair off.<br />
&quot;Something to remember me by...&quot; I turned away, I clutched the lock of hair... Out of the corner of my eye I saw a tear. A tear for me? But what am I worth?<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
With a knot in my stomach and the lock of hair in my hand I started down the only trail for miles. I stayed to the edge of the road and walked quietly. I heard something coming and ducked behind a tree. It was a lone Iksar. Wait no... Two of them, one male one female. I threw a dagger and hit the female in the throat. The male roared and knelt over her. I puzzled. It looked as if was somehow crying. But Iksar can't cry I thought. They are nothing but stupid lizzards. I jumped up and stabbed the other in the back. He yowled and tried to slash me but I drove my dirk to far in. He died quickly. I dragged the corpses to the side of the road. I looked at the strange expression on the Iksar's face, he almost looked sad...<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
 &quot;If you see me coming better step aside, alot of orcs didn't alot of orcs died...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-26-00, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard something down the road. I froze and hid. It was an Iksar, very different looking however. It was covered in robes and skulls and bones. A shaman? He was being followed by some other Iksars. Most were obviously warriors. Long heavy swords and black scale armor. One looked towards the tree I was hiding behind. The whole parade stopped and snuffed the air. I froze with fear. Sweat diamonded on my face. One came near the tree, a small snake slithered out of the grass. The Iksar chopped it's head off and roared to the others. Which must've meant, &quot;It's all clear!&quot; because a moment later they walked off again. For the first time in minutes I breathed. I wiped the sweat from my head and began walking again. But I knew there was a new problem; my scent. I pondered over how I could suppress it or camoflaush{/ooc ARG!!! I can't spell!!} it. I also had heard they could see the heat you give off, although it sounds absurd, I knew I should take precautions there, too. It was getting late. I needed to forage up some food and a safe place for the night. The trees were suitable for sleeping in, and I managed to find some fruit to eat. It was meager, but I hadn't much choice. I set up a small hanging bed and slept. I tried to remember all the stories about the Iksar Heartwood Master had told me. Like the one about Daerenin, a young warrior who was found by the Iksar, and said after he escaped that they see heat. When he was asked to explain he said, &quot;they can see you in a pile of stinking manure, when they can neither smell or hear or see you...&quot; There was also they account of a man named Zedyn, a traveling healer. He is still locked up in the Iksar city they say. I hope that he is still alive, for he was only a young man of 20, and many healers live to more then 100 years. He would be 138 it had survived. But I figured he was probably dead by now. The Masters in Kelethin had kept most of the secret war with the Iksar quiet...<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
Kelethin lay silent, a night with no bugs or birds in the air. No orcs in their outer camps. No bandits were in their hang outs, all of them were at their secret camp. King Tearis in Felwithe was talking to some gaurds aboout what was to happen tonight. In Kelethin all the merchants were up in the higher platforms. Gaurds were tieing stakes to all the edges of the lower platforms. Some young warriors were using knives to sharpen wooden spears. One young man was called Llandern, and sitting by him was his long life friend Ynyan. Ynyan was getting sleepy. Llandern told himt to rest and he would finish Ynyan's spear. Ynyan curled up to sleep. Some say it is good to see others sleeping, when they are vulnerable and dreaming... Llandern stood on the lift with some other gaurds. The first lines of orcs were below Kelethin, shooting flaming arrows and using axes on the giant tree supports. Ynyan woke up suddenly as a flaming arrow zoomed by. He jumped up and threw some water on it. Llandern ran to the tree supports where orc legionairres were fiercly chopping. He stabbed on right through and went to another. Ynyan began shooting arrows and throwing spears at the orcs below. He picked up a sack of flower and dropped it on an orc pawn. Llandern countinued fighting. He got stabbed in the left shoulder but simply picked up his sword and kept fighting. He collasped as a royal gaurd stuck a spear though his waist. A gaurd picked him up threw him on the lift and pressed the button. Ynyan ran to his friend. &quot;Ynyan, we have had such fun in our short 14 seasons...&quot; He convulsed. &quot;You can't die on my Llandern!! I won't let you! C'mon stay awake!!&quot; Llandern grunted. A druid ran up and began to cast healing spells on Llandern, but to no avail, the wounds were to serious. Ynyan held Llandern until he murmered his final wishes. &quot;Ynyan, don't hate those orcs, I see the fear in their eyes, too. I see it in them. I see- I- see that they are-&quot; He seised up. &quot;Please Llandern, don't stress yourself.&quot; &quot;They- they could- could- be- good...&quot; His head slipped from Ynyan's lap onto the hard pine floor. Ynyan stood up. Looked over the edge of the platfrom and jumped off. Below a scream was heard, not from a man, but from an orc...<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
An orc named Curnok woke up early. He looked around... Corpses. Everywhere he walked, the ground was a dark maroon color. He stepped over the corpses of an elf who had jumped on an orc from ontop of the platform. The lift was destroyed. One of the tree supports had been chopped down and a whole 3 platfroms had fallen to the ground. A young orc pawn lay on the ground bleeding. He ran to it and began to bind the wound. But it was obvious the pawn would not make it. He drew a sword and stabbed him through the heart. Even an orc can show mercy. Where the tree support had fallen was a huge smear of orc blood, they hadn't run out from under it in time. Orcs despite popular belief are clever, they just don't think things through. All the trees around Kelethin were charred or on the ground. Some trees were still burning. He walked towards Felwithe, the castle had endured. Outside some high elf clerics were attempting to ressurect and heal the dead and wounded. He walked towards the orc outer camps. All were burned to the ground. He neared the Crushbone enterance. The orc flag had been torn down. In it's place a decapitated orc hung by his feet. On the ground lay The Prophet. The orc leaned to him, seeing if he was still alive. He bumped him, nudged him;But to no avail, the Prophet was dead. And once the Prophet was dead, all orcs knew, so was the future... Near the Prophet the warlord lay with a spear through his chest. The King Crush's corpse lay in the middle of 7 or 8 royal gaurds, a few emmisaries. Dvinn was not dead. He had escaped. His whereabouts were unknown, and he posed the greatest threat. Ecspecially if he reached the Deathfist Clan... And the cargo hold of the Stormbreaker a man lay, a huge gash on his leg. He was blue. He was ugly. He was a stowaway. He was once a great leader...<br />
------------------------------------------------ &quot;If you see me coming better step aside, alot of orcs didn't alot of orcs died...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-28-00, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I continued on my way down the trail. Rather uneventfully until I reached it's end. At the end was a giant castle of sorts. But the stench almost made me turn back. It was Calibis.<br />
I decided to go inside. I used a special potion I had devised to rid myself of most strong smells. I now smelt like an old pine tree crossed with mud. Which was about what it smelt like all over here so I figured I was safe.<br />
The castle was not hard to get into really. I simply scaled the wall and snuck around. I eventually found the underground dungeon. I snuck around a napping Iksar and down a bit deeper. The walls were a bit rotten and eroded. They must've been hundreds of years old.<br />
I finally reached some cells. And saw a barbarian sitting inside one. His head was between his knees, he looked asleep. I picked up a small pebble on the ground and threw it at his head. He instantly awoke. His eyes widened then blinked. He was silent. I signaled him to come to the gate. I began to pick the lock, which was easy. I figured that Iksar were more brawns the brains. The barbarian spat on the gate several times then slowly opened it. It made no sound. We carefully snuck past the sleeping Iksar. I stood behind the Iksar and took a thin leather string from my pocket. I quickly choked him with it. I really hated using it, you have to watch them die so slowly. But it is the quietest thing I could do. We proped him up so he looked asleep, and snuck up the stairs.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Indeed my forces of the Crushbone orcs were defeated.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah, you think King Crush led them? Don't be simple.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know you are a very strong leader, but I and noone else leads the Deathfist, is that understood?&quot;<br />
A royal gaurd put a knife to D'vinn's throat.<br />
&quot;Is it?&quot;, he grumbled.<br />
&quot;Indeed M'lord, forgive my impurtanence...&quot;<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
I came to know of my new friend as Sandrock. Which may be a very strange name but well given. He is a very rare breed of barbarian. Raised in the Deserts of Ro by bandits. He said eventually he learned how to summon strength from the earth and used both shaman and rogue like skills. I must say I was impressed. And his talents came in handy. When we got far enough away from Calibis we sat down and caught our breath. The first words I heard from him were, &quot;Got any brandy?&quot; I just so happened to have a bottle and gave him it. He summoned up some bread and I foraged for some rabbit and we ate and got drunk quite well.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;How much for a tick-*HICCUP*-et to Erudin?&quot; a young dashing drunken bard asked the ticketmaster.<br />
The ticketmaster eyed him and said, &quot;Eh laddy might ye want to wait till ye sobered up a wee bit?&quot;<br />
&quot;I *HICCUP* am as *HICCUP* sober as I *HICCUP* get, now give me a ticket.&quot;<br />
The ticketmaster shruged and said, &quot;3 silver, and watch out, ye fall off that boat there be killer sharks waiting for ye!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-29-00, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The young bard was bright, but only when he was sober. And as he was generally not sober it hurt his intelligence. He picked up the ticket and walked to the docks.<br />
&quot;*HICCUP* 'eres da boat!&quot;<br />
The captain looked at him and laughed.<br />
&quot;Going to new lands to adventure eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;*HICCUP* what I do is *HICCUP* none of your *HICCUP* buisn-*HICCUP*.&quot;<br />
The captian shruged and helped the young bard on board. <br />
&quot;What be ye name eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;*HICCUP* I'm Raedomort.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, that's a mighty long name, ye got a nickname?&quot;<br />
&quot;*HICCUP* Yeah, Red is my nick-*HICCUP*&quot;<br />
&quot;Why Red?&quot;<br />
Raedomort laughed and pointed to his nose. <br />
&quot;See tha-*HICCUP* red nose!&quot;<br />
The captain rolled his eyes and patted Red on the back, helping him to the underdeck bar.<br />

I helped Sandrock up. We decided we'd have to map the castle and somehow get the map to the Outpost.<br />
Sandrock said, &quot;I bet I can befreind a bird with one of my spells, the ideal carrier of secrets.&quot;<br />
I nodded and we started down the path. We were pretty unfocused at first however. Laughing and hiccuping. I decided we should take a short break before we went any further.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
A deathfist messenger by the name of Rfocal walked down the long slender corrider to the thrown room.<br />
Two gaurds searched him for weapons and made him take his dirty sandals off.<br />
&quot;It is always clean in this thrown room!&quot;<br />
Rfocal nodded and walked by the gaurds obliviously.<br />
He kneeled before the king then stood to read the message tightly snug in between his arm and ribcage.<br />
&quot;M'lord I have a message from the Iksar people, permission to read aloud?&quot;<br />
In a deep grumbling voice, &quot;Permission granted.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hail King of the mighty Deathfist,<br />
As you will observe we have been beaten again and again by the elven races of this world. We have been opressed, driven from our homelands and slaughtered. I believe it is time for the under powered races of Norrath to stand up and reclaim what is rightfully ours. I greatly wish we can put differences aside and ban together for the good of our races. I propose an alliance, The Orc-Iksar alliance of formal trust. I will outline it's purpose...<br />
&gt;1 We will split all the conquered lands between us, more prosperous lands like the Karanas (fertile growing ground) will be evenly split. <br />
&gt;2 We will NOT fight eachother during or after this great war with the elven races.<br />
&gt;3 We will help eachother with battles that will be hard fought. When we fight the humans this is a great necessity for fighting from both sides would be impossible.<br />
&gt;4 All during the time of the war we must keep a strong line of comunication.<br />
&gt;5 We will raise taxes on our people to support the war fund. Every people we conquer will be taxed, starved, or worked to death. We don't want any other races to rebel, but we can't waste their resources.<br />
I hope you can agree to all these conditions.<br />
If so please sign here __ __ __ __ __ __ __ X<br />
And you must return this within a fortnight of it's received.&quot;<br />
The Orc King looked at his subjects and said,<br />
&quot;Hehe, we shall go to war! Bring me a feather!&quot;<br />
He hurried and scratched his name on the parchment.<br />
The messenger ran to the docks and boarded a ship, a ship to Kunark...<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Once we had sobered up a bit we went down the path further. A bit ahead we saw a small band of Iksar bandits. The were dressed in patchworked armor and a few rusty, and even some bronze weapons. I told Sandrock to use his root spell to snag the leader who would be a hard kill. He stood up and chanted.<br />
The Leader screamed in anguish as roots entwined his feet. He tried to claw at them with no avail. I landed a huge backstab on one of the bandits, he fell face forward in the dirt. Sandrock had killed another couple, he had smashed their heads together. I grimaced and countinued fighting. All we had left was the leader. He ripped his foot free of the roots and readied himself.<br />
I looked over at Sandrock, handed him a brandy. We both to a big gulp and ran forward. Sandrock from the front, me from the back. The Leader would fly around his tail wizzing through the air, it would hit us both. So I grabbed his tail and while he shook me violently in the air cut it off. I fell with the tai. *WHAM* The Leader stood there stunned for a second, looking at his tail stump in disbelief. He blinked and roared. Charging towards me, picking up speed with every step. Sandrock leaped on his back and stuck a spear straight through him. The tip of the spear came within an inch of my chest. I rolled out of the way as the leader hit the ground. Sandrock stood up and said, &quot;Well, you hungery for some lizzyman fillet?&quot;<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
&amp;lt;NOT PART OF STORY SIMPLY AUTHOR COMMENTARY...&gt;<br />
/ooc Ok I just wanted to talk about my story for a second. I know it might seem very disjointed, but I have a theory about life and literature. (Ahem Ahem) What I noticed in life is many little details often times come together like a giant puzzle. I always wanted to see where things began, and using this format I can do some good forshadowing, too. I never write anything unless it will come up in the future. Little details in stories are NEVER useless. You just might not see the connection right away. Anyway, all I have to say! Hope you are enjoying my stories! *cough* Hi Baneorin *cough*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">04-30-00, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">D'vinn woke up early that morning. He went with the early morning patrols to spy on Freeport. He knew this was a vital city. Vast resources, great economy, docks for transportation of goods, and ofcourse a strong city. He decided to try and find it's weakest points. He knew of the underground aqueducts that would be perfect for getting troops inside the city without being spotted.<br />
&quot;Gaurd! Take a note!&quot;<br />
&quot;M'lord!? Yes- Yes Sir!!&quot;<br />
&quot;The outer walls are about 3 feet thick. 2 gaurds at each gate. The Freeport militia house by the west gate. The secret enterances to the underground aqueducts are big enough to walk through. The one from the west gate leads near 'Hallard's Resales'. I suggest taking troops in through the secret tunnels into the center of the city. To attack the center and east gates first. Then once most gaurds have left the Militia house we shall charge the Militia house and burn it to the ground. Ofcourse we will have many who resist our attempt besides soldiers. All those who are not of our cause shall not be given mercy. I shall not loose as I did in Kelethin, never again...&quot;<br />
The gaurd stared blankly.<br />
&quot;Uh, ugr, Sir? I um urg can't write...&quot;<br />
D'vinn looked at him with a smile.<br />
Then out of nowhere a flash of steel met the back of the orc. He didn't even scream...<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
The young bard slept peacefully on his boat ride. But in the morning was briskly woken up by a gigantic shadow. Raedomort jumped back in fear.<br />
&quot;Eh nuw wee laddy, welcoome to Koonark.&quot;<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Sandrock and I decided it would be best to camp early due to our exhastion from the fight. He had found there was a fairly large sum of elven money on the leader of the bandits and was quite cheerful.<br />
&quot;Ehhehe, noow think of all the brandy we can buy with this!&quot;<br />
I laid back and crossed my legs and put them on a tree trunk.<br />
&quot;Heh, I think I'll settle on a nice lil house up in Kelethin.&quot;<br />
&quot;You ever thought of living in Freeport? It's a grand place ya know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nyah, I got my eye on a fine high elf, I figure we can have a wee family in Kelethin...&quot;<br />
Sandrock laughed.<br />
&quot;If ya live that long! Hehe!&quot;<br />
I sighed, it was a very dangerous buisness I was in. I wondered if I could ever have a family. I would put them in to much risk one would think.<br />
Sandrock looked over at me.<br />
&quot;You're serious ain't ya? Ya want a steady life eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think I've lived to long without a name, to long without a home, to long without hope...&quot;<br />
He sighed, &quot;How can you live with yourself?&quot;<br />
I looked at the ground, &quot;Trust me, I've considered the alternitive...&quot;<br />
&quot;...&quot;<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
Dynuac advised Raedomort of the dangers of Kunark. Raedomort hadn't realized he had been put on the boat to Kunark and immeadiately wanted to leave. Dynuac said however that he once there, couldn't leave till his duties were served. Ofcourse Raedomort fit in quite well with the rarely sober or intelligent barbarians. And soon stayed of his own free will. He had left behind his lady and was in search of new romance.<br />
Ilyunia was the fairest of the elven outpost. Raedomort tried to woo her with his songs, and words, but his beer stained breath was not a turn on. She ofcourse only had eyes for &quot;Sett&quot; and showed him to attention. One night Dynuac was talking with him and they devised a plot to win over her heart. Telling her first that Sett had been killed. Which didn't help one bit for she simply locked herself in her room to starve. They then informed her that he was not dead, and had married a lizard woman. She was bright enough to know how simply ridiculous that was and didn't believe it. Eventually she wouldn't speak to either let alone believe their long tales. So Raedomort decided if he could defeat Sett in a duel then maybe she would earn her respect. So he set off to find him.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
I felt it would be a good idea to send another letter to the Elven outpost. But I sent another more specifically to Ilyunia.<br />
Dear Ilyunia,<br />
I must say these days without you have been long and hard. I have made a new traveling companion. He is of the best characther, his name is Sandrock. We defeated an entire band of Bandits, with little injury. He is partial to brandy, and I ask that when we return he is rewarded alot of brandy for his services. I wish I knew how to be more romantic, but I am afriad I have not practice in such matters.<br />
Sincerly yours,<br />
Sett<br />

Thanks for the positive feedback, Vija! It makes it all feel worth it. Although I must admit I really enjoy writing. I hope you all enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy writing it. If you are reading it please give me some respectful critisism. Thanks again Vija!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-01-00, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raedomort was a bard, but trained in some useful tracking skills. He had taken the Northwest, and consequently only road. The travel was mountainous and harsh. After about 5 days of hiking he found a fairly new camp. Hoping it was Sett's camp he ran even faster down the road. He came to a waterfall and saw two men swimming and began to make his way down the edge of the canyon.<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Sandrock? Where the hell are you?&quot;, I shouted down into a canyon where a waterfall poured into.<br />
&quot;Jump in! *glub* *cough* C'mon-*glub* C'mon in! Water's fine!&quot;<br />
Considering it was another hot day with no other means of relief I jumped in.<br />
&quot;Yaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhooooooooooooo!!!&quot;<br />
*SPLASH* *glub glub...cough...glub*<br />
*THRASHING NOISES*<br />
&quot;ARG!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ung, grr, urg...&quot;*glub* *glub* *cough choke cough*<br />
&quot;Sett! I'm coming Sett! Hold on!&quot;<br />
&quot;Aieeeeeee!&quot;<br />
&quot;Urg! No! This- is- just *choke* between- me- and- Sett-&quot;<br />
Sandrock held the man by the collar and lifted him inot the air.<br />
&quot;Sett, you ok over there?&quot;<br />
I threw up.<br />
&quot;Ugh, well that'll teach you to never eat rabbit swim and try to deal with assassins again eh?&quot;<br />
He began to sqeeze the man's throat harder. I threw up some more water.<br />
&quot;And you? What do you have to say eh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am *choke* Raedomort of Queynos, let me g-&quot;*choke*<br />
&quot;Ung, let him speak his reason Sandrock, then we'll kill him.&quot;<br />
&quot;I fight for the hand of Ilyunia! I love her! And you are nothing but a worthless rogue!&quot;<br />
I sneered.<br />
&quot;You sniveling coward, what a fool to say I am the rogue, you came out of nowhere and attacked. When dueling for a ladie's hand is it customery to have an even duel.&quot;<br />
He glared at me.<br />
&quot;Fine then, we shall have a proper battle!&quot;<br />
&quot;Does she love you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, no, but it is because you have evilly tempted her!&quot;<br />
I laughed loudly.<br />
&quot;I shant fight until she wants me to.&quot; &quot;Sandrock? Throw him off the cliff.&quot;<br />
&quot;What!? No! No! Don't throw me off! Please wait! I- I- uh can help you! Yeah I can help you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Only if you have some brandy on you...&quot;<br />
Sandrock smirked at me.<br />
&quot;Hehe, sure, got any brandy?&quot;<br />
He went pale and said, &quot;Yes I happen to have the finest of the Elven Outpost! I swear!&quot;<br />
Sandrock searched his backpack and lift out a flask. He gulped it down as golden trails of brandy ran down his cheeks.<br />
&quot;Damn! That is some fi-*HICCUP* fine brandy!&quot;<br />
I laughed myself silly as Raedomort gave Sandrock a look of total bewilderment.<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;M'lord&quot; D'vinn bowed humbly before the Deathfist king.<br />
The king nodded and waved his hand in approval.<br />
&quot;We are to charge Freeport tomorrow M'lord, I sinmply wanted to go over some battle plans...&quot;<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
We finally got back to the castle and snuck around counting their forces.  The entrance to the city was a bunch of empty houses with a gaurd or two. Apparently they called themselves Crusaders. At the actual gate itself were only 2-4 &quot;crusaders&quot;. We wanted to venture into the city, but it was to risky. Raedomort wrote all of the measurements in his lyric book. We decided it was enough and began our journey home. Well, atleast to the Elven Outpost.<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
The men and women of Freeport all gathered at the Theater of Tranquility for the news of the upcoming war.<br />
Sir Lucan shouted for silence. A tense oppresive silence swept over the crowd as many &quot;hush&quot;es and &quot;quiet!&quot;s rang out.<br />
Sir Lucan stood on the stage and took off his helmet, <br />
&quot;I am regret to inform you formal conflict with the Deathfist clan will come to a climax soon. I know many farmers in the outskirts have already experienced violence. I am very dissapointed that we could not come to an ammicable agreement with the orcan race. Unfortunately it sounds as if the forces shall be coming soon to try and take over Freeport in a massive siege. If you haven't yet been drafted to the gaurds I suggest you do so, we expect an attack at anytime, and a day's training from us shall give you a greater chance to live and save your city. It is your duty to protect all we have worked for! We shan't be conquered by an unkept, hodgepodge of centurians with rusty shortswords! I dare say if we are, then what shall become of Norrath!&quot; A gaurd nudged him and whispered in his ear. His eyebrow raised and he scrathed his chin. He mumbled and frowned.<br />
&quot;I have just recieved notice that the Deathfist plan to attack in the eve tomorrow!&quot;<br />
A roar of whispers and dubious cries burst forth from the crowd.<br />
&quot;What can we do!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh may Tunare save our souls!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sir Lucan! Please! Where do those with small children go?!&quot;<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
Raedomort and Sandrock got along quite well. Both sang, drank and played cards. Although I never sang, I kept up with their other activities well. Our trip back to the outpost was an easy one. But upon ariving at the Outpost, we were horrified at what we saw...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-02-00, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As we approached the Outpost, Sandrock dropped his bottle of whiskey and stood in awe. A very strange, morbid sort of awe which lasts until someone says something. Which due to the looks on their faces, was apperent that it'd be me.<br />
&quot;I- I- can't believe the Iksar would be as stipid to attack the Outpost, they must've had no idea what hit them...&quot;<br />
Raedomort looked at the ground, he jumped as soon as he noticed he was standing on the former apendige of an iksar. Sandrock was doubled over and throwing up. Raedomort handed Sandrock some whiskey and we surveyed the area. Hundreds, and I mean hundreds of iksar, elves, and barbarians lay stroon about. On the wall of the Outpost were 50 or so spears with the head of an iksar on each. We hadn't even seen the forces of the Iksar, how in the world did they get to the Outpost without us seeing them. A huge band of young soldiers always leaves a trail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Berdusk</div><div class="date">05-07-00, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I was thinking of offering you a few thoughts on how you might improve your writing (not the story, as that's something you gotta think up yourself, no amount of advice in the world can help with that sorta thing, and you're doing just fine yourself).<br />
<br />
You've got a great story here, you shouldn't stop just yet, I'd like to hear the rest and so would other people  <br />
<br />
If by any chance you would accept constructive criticism, then by all means send an email to the address found in my profile. Yours was private, so I couldn't just send one off like that *snaps his fingers*. Some/most advice comes straight from the words of David Stott, who taught my Screenplay class and who's teaching Creative Writing: Fiction this semester (didn't make it in, grrr   ) but it's logical stuff, some pertains to stuff you do before you write, and some pertains to stuff you do while writing, so...<br />
<br />
But at any rate, keep up the good work. Berdusk RavenspikeRogue of Xegony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ramaras</div><div class="date">05-09-00, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoah dude kicking story. (i would like to hear a lil' more character development, still not sure who everyone is) You are a good writer. *IDEA FOR GETTING RICH* write some novels with EQ characters and charge $10.00 a month to own/read the book! ok on the more serious side i would DEFENITLY like to hear some more about the great war and less on the &quot;love story&quot; mabey make that the side plot instead? but whatever you're the writer you write the story. Good Luck man!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-10-00, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose it was then that Raedomort began to stop drinking. I'm not really sure why he did. Or atleast he never drank around us. He became very secretive. Keeping to himself. We nicknamed him Mort, I mean Raedomort is a little hard to remember. To this day I still don't think I'm spelling it right.<br />
When we had gotten over the stench, we managed to get to the Outpost gate. It was shut tightly, as if expecting another attack. We knocked and 3 elven archers pointed bows at us and a single barbarian stood up calling out, &quot;&amp;lt;b&gt; Who goes there?&amp;lt;/b&gt;&quot; I came forward and shouted I had returned. I realized immeadiate how bad an idea this was, considering I hadn't warned them of the approaching forces. Several men were sreaming to have my head cut off. Cunyar, the only barbarian I had known by name, had his name on a tombstone now. The Elven Squadran and the Barbarian warriors were having a shouting match. I came in and an eery silence left me terrified. <br />
&quot;The Iksar must be masters at traveling in secrecy, you didn't see any?&quot;<br />
&quot;None except a small party of a shaman and a few warriors, Sir.&quot;<br />
An elf who I had never laid eyes on was was scratching his beard curiously.<br />
&quot;Hmmm, we underestimated the signifigance of the tunnels.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tunnels Sir?&quot; I was puzzled.<br />
He nodded, &quot;Indeed we found a larger network of them underground near the Outpost. They look abandoned and most were underwater.&quot;<br />
One of the barbarians stood up again screaming, &quot;I toold ya! Dammit! I toold ya! Theys were built fer swimmin, theys swam right under ours foots! Damn ya all!&quot;<br />
&quot;&amp;lt;b&gt; Silence! &amp;lt;/b&gt;&quot;<br />
Another shouting match insued as I sat silently.<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;D'vinn M'lord? Bad news I'm afraid...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes? What is it fool!? Speak up!&quot;<br />
&quot;The Iksar sir... They have suffered a great loss...&quot;<br />
D'vinn paced back and forth, uncharactheristically nervous.<br />
He stopped suddenly, evil gleamed in his eye as he turned to the messenger.<br />
The messenger looked terrified and screamed, &quot;Please! No! I am but a humble messenger! I don't make the news! I- I- simply deliver it to y-&quot;<br />
D'vinn's dagger had cut off the messenger's plea for mercy. As it had done many times before, and would not soon stop...<br />
&quot;Damn it all!&quot;, he screamed, &quot;We already put off the attack of Freeport by several days! Now what shall be done!?&quot;<br />
His fury passed through his dagger to the next three centurians who came in his chambers.<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
The barbarians claimed the elves had no battle skills what-so-ever and the elves claimed that the barbarians shouldn't talk because they couldn't even spell what they shouted. I believed them both right. Elves were better at thinking, and barbarians at fighting. In theory a match made in heaven, in reality a match to cause hell on Norrath. Sandrock and Mort weren't even in the room. Sandrock had went off in search of the new supplies and Mort of the women. When the &quot;meeting&quot; was over and I was allowed to go, I decided to have a conversation with Sandrock about the Iksar. I was somewhat intrigued at their intelligence of using the underground tunnels.<br />
&quot;Eh Sandrock? What were the Iksar like?&quot;<br />
&quot;To me or to eachother?&quot;<br />
&quot;Both I guess...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well to me, pretty bad, very little food and water. Although I could summon some more, using mana is a bit of a crunch...&quot;<br />
I cut him off, &quot;And to eachother?&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh yeah sorry there, Well to eachother was very different... They kissed I think...&quot;<br />
&quot;Kissed? How in the world...?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, it wasn't like we do, very different. They'd- they'd sorta... nudge noses, yeah that about explains it I guess...&quot;<br />
I sat there puzzling, he continued...<br />
&quot;And they have merchants, and banks, and guilds... All just like we do. I almost didn't understand why... I mean, they look just like big dumb lizards...&quot;<br />
I laughed, &quot;As a barbarian I think you should watch what you're saying!&quot;<br />
He laughed and play choked me a bit.<br />
Sandrock was about 30 I think, he didn't act it ofcourse, but he was about that. He had brown hair, and brown eyes. The sort of eyes you know have seen to much, like mine. He was sorta like a big brother to me I guess. It's hard to say that now, now that I'm &quot;grownup&quot; and on my own... Not that I've been taken care of for much of my life. Maybe I'm just not used to having friends, althouth these days Mort was becoming more and more cynical...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-11-00, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The deathfist king walked briskly down the long stone corridor.<br />
As he reached D'vinn's chamber room he sneer at the pile or corpses outside the door.<br />
As he rammed his fist on the door briskly he shouted, &quot;D'vinn! Open this door, NOW! I have MUCH to confrence you on! Open up now or I shall have my whole army in your chambers by sundown!&quot;<br />
&quot;Then your whole army shall be dead.&quot;, D'vinn said sarcastically.<br />
&quot;And I too? I do doubt that, you better open up, and you better hurry...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes M'lord...&quot;<br />
They sat around a giant wooden table in the main hall of the castle. All around them were maps, models, scribes, and army leaders.<br />
D'vinn looked around a bit then said, &quot;Shall we attack in the morrow?&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed, tis the best course of action, we must strike while the humans are weakened by their celebrations of the new year.&quot;<br />
D'vinn nodded, and pointed to a map.<br />
&quot;Through here is where we'll take a greatest troops, throw fodder at the gates...&quot;<br />
&quot;Fodder?&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed, simply warm bodies, maybe a few elites just to beat the gate gaurds down...&quot;<br />
The king nodded morbidly.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
In Freeport the calm before the storm was overshadowed by rejoicing songs of joy.<br />
Men and women and children danced in the streets. Men drunk, women giggling, and children mimicking the gaurds playfully. The gaurds looked on...<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Mort has kept to himself for weeks now, we are traveling from Kunark to Freeport. Apparently I'm getting a new mission there. I am excited really... In the Outpost we congradulated the forces for winning over the Iksar and left. I didn't see Ilynial anywhere... But I told her already I wouldn't be there for long. My mission in Kunark was never really specific, it was imply to make maps and free prisoners, which I did. I am hoping the new mission I get is exciting...<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
The morning dawned. As it did yesterday and will tomorrow. But what it dawns upon tomorrow shall be different. For today the orcs march upon Freeport, today men will die and women will cry. Today is the dawning of a new time, a new time for everyone in Norrath.<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
&amp;lt;AUTHOR BLIRB&gt;<br />
I hope you all enjoyed my &quot;comeback&quot; issue. Tomorrow is the war in Freeport, don't miss it! The way I see it noone's a virgin, the world's screwed us all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-12-00, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was the early dawn. Many a man lay in the gutter, drunk and passed out. The gaurds were all very sharp, alert, and sober...<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Under the city D'vinn and 60 or so orcs ran through the seemingly endless tunnels of refuse.<br />
He ordered a quick bark, and all the orcs lined up. He ducked under the water, and swam between the bars of a sewage pipe opening. The bubbles floated up from his nose as he neared the surface.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
A yong gaurd was patrolling, near the Freeport Ofice of the people when he noticed something peciluar. Some bubbles were floating up from the bottom of a sewage pipe. He walked closer. Leaning over the water, he put his had over his forehead, so the sun wouldn't reflect. He peered into the water. Out of the murky water a blue face appeared, and a steel dagger...<br />
He didn't last long, his scream was not heard, D'vinn was smart enough to stab him and throw him in the water.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
The orcs were excited by the blood in the water as they neared the surface. Jumping out of the water they stood feet away from the Freeport Office of the People. D'vinn smiled.<br />
&quot;Burn it.&quot;<br />
The orcs cried with joy, attracting the attention of a nearby drunken man. He leaped up, screaming for the gaurds. Out of nowhere, 30, maybe even 40 gaurds came from nowhere!<br />
The orcs through rocks, and spears, and knives at them; and eventually- corpses.<br />
A man screamed as an orc jammed a speak up into his ribs. The sounds of bones cracking, grown men crying, children screaming their father's and mother's names, orcs grunting with evil glee, all of this and then the thunder.<br />
Lucan was already on the scene.<br />
&quot;Please sir- ARGH!&quot;<br />
Lucan tried to give them orders, but it had begun to rain. The thunder crashed down as men soaked in blood, sweat, and rain fought viciously. <br />
The Office was smoldering, the rain had not totally put out the fire. The humans were outnumbered as outside the other orcs attacked the gates. More came from the sewers, in all directions people were running, fighting... praying.<br />
From nowhere, D'vinn took his oppurtunity. He jumped on Lucan's back and pushed his dagger through the beautifully crafted armor, sreaming a Teir Dal battle cry. Lucan screamed in anguish, as it seemed everyone stopped, staring. All of them staring in morbid awe... Then the orcs mimicked the cry and charged the men.<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
He was a young guard. He was 23, maybe 24. He was fighting beside Lucan, his hero. He saw D'vinn coming, he saw him stare evilly at Lucan's exposed back. He had tried to jump on D'vinn in time, but an orc from behind had tackled him wrestling him to the muddy ground. When he looked up from the mud, he saw D'vinn, he saw a huge bolt of lightning come down. He saw it all as Lucan fell to the ground, his mouth still open from the suprised. He watched, he listened as D'vinn equaled the crack of thunder with a battle cry. The orc ontop of him shouted the cry as it crushed him. He whispered into the mud with his dieing breath, &quot;We're put to shame-&quot; His skull would be another put on the walls in the Deathfist castle. Just another nameless skull...<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
We had to turn around. Freeport fell to the orcs. I have no words to describe the fear in the land. Even the pixies and brownies, and animals feel it. The elves have allied with all of them. The animals hate the orcs. The browines hate everyone, but orcs bother them alot, and elves leave them alone. The pixies simply love to baffle the stupid orcs with their clever tricks.<br />
We will eventually travel to Freeport, to help the humans reclaim it. The barbarians are up to shady dealings. We are not sure if they are with the orcs or us, they simply want the winning team. Which we don't look like. I hear that all the men who didn't escape or die have been enslaved. The enterence to Crushbone has a huge rock infront of it now. It was put there by the CrushBone orcs. We have a bad feeling about them. Most of Kelethin was successfully rebuilt. We are hopeful that we will be able to prevent the alliance between the Iksar and orcs. In Qeynos it was said that the gnolls are up to something. But the residents of SureFall glade have taken up arms and gaurd their city well. They have alot to fear being so close to Black Burrow. Tomorrow I will try and visit Merchant Kwein, it's been a long time...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-15-00, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a filled dinning room D'vinn sat triumphently at the head of the table. The King next to him. Endless plates of human remains and boiled rats appeared. D'vinn cackled.<br />
&quot;Well M'lord, what praise have you for me?&quot;<br />
The king grumbled. He walked out of the room into a darkened chamber. It was small in size and looked distinctly unused and sterile. Not a common thing for orcs to reserve a special room.<br />
&quot;I want D'vinn killed, legally.&quot;<br />
&quot;Legally?&quot;<br />
&quot;He's a hero, and a threat to the crown, it's only a matter of time...&quot;<br />
The assassin nodded grimly.<br />
&quot;How shall we kill him legally M'lord?&quot;<br />
&quot;A contest, a contest of the whole continent- to hell with that, the whole world!&quot;<br />
&quot;Explain M'lord...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well what we shall do is offer a large amount of money. Then we send D'vinn and an orc champion to defend it in a contest. D'vinn cannot hold up to many sucsesive opponents like an orc can. We shall also arouse propaganda about his loyalty to the orc cause. Have the rumor spreads do that...&quot;<br />
&quot;But if D'vinn dies then we will look like fools...&quot;<br />
&quot;We shall fix the games, the orc champion shall win them. D'vinn will be 'accidentally' killed on the way, understood?&quot;<br />
&quot;I doubt it will work though M'lord...&quot;<br />
The King rose, he took his sword out of the scabard.<br />
&quot;Put your chin up high, and say that again.&quot;<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
Sandrock was very depressed. He stayed drunk most of the time to conceal it. Freeport was his home for many years before his mishaps in Kunark. Which he never fully explained to me. He'd only drink brandy however. Nothing else. Which was a bit of a problem. Without his hourly dose of it he'd become very incoherent and violent.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;What did you say!?&quot;<br />
&quot;I said you are a stinky stupid INKY!!&quot;<br />
D'vinn grinned.<br />
As he squeezed the orcs neck he counted the sounds of the different segments of the spine breaking. Slowly counting each breath up to the dieing one.<br />
&quot;27&quot;, he mumbled.<br />
&quot;Give this one the record, he beat the old one of 23.&quot;<br />
The orc was only a few years old. No mother came and cried for its lose. A lone orc from the shadows approached slowly picking up the corpse. No tear down it's cheek, no frown on it's face. But somehow it looked sad. He sneered at D'vinn's black long cape trailing behind him.<br />
&quot;Gyforglan...&quot; he scratched onto a think wooden board. He walked to the top of a small hill and dug a whole. He put the young orc's corpse in it and jammed the board into the ground beside it. The orc slept there all night. He would be there when the gaurds dragged him away.<br />
The sun would rise on the wooden board for years until it was nothing but termite dust. And his bones only dry white dust beside it.<br />

Seriously though, you've got some talent at this sort of thing. It's good to see another writer of high caliber out there. I did the same thing, once, with another game. Took a relatively unused forum of a message board, one &quot;War Stories&quot;, and just brought it to life. That was about a year ago now, and the game itself in it's twilight stages. But last I checked, that forum was getting 10 posts a day, all stories from people that admired my writings, and went on to make their own. Some were bad, some were poorly spelled, and/or illegible. But some of those stories just shined. And to this day, I'm proud of that. And I still post something occasionally, just to let them know I'm still lurking around.<br />
Anyways, enough of that. You're actually putting me to shame here. About all I can suggest is better character development, and a bit more straight forward storyline, and you'll force me to upgrade MY style of writing.  <br />
Anyways, keep it up, I'm dying of suspense. And be aware, you've got some competition. *cackles*<br />
<br />
(PS: Isn't it weird how the bad guys always kill their allies, when they could REALLY use those allies later? i.e.: D'Vinn killing everybody but the maid, but she escaped.)<br />

&quot;Yes! That's what will do!&quot;<br />

A young gnome and his bestfriend, a halfling were witting on the high platforms talking.<br />
&quot;You thinking of enterin'?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nyah, I don know...&quot;<br />
&quot;I am! I am gonna be a hero!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, what can a 16 year old halfling do? Har har!&quot;<br />
&quot;Plenty of things! I can beat you at anything!&quot;<br />
&quot;No you can't!&quot;<br />
The gnome jumped on his friend and wrestle him, but Tjard as he will be known, pinned his gnomish friend down.<br />
&quot;Nyah nyah!&quot;<br />
&quot;Bah! Shud up!&quot;<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
D'vinn was drunk. He hollered and raved and was violent.<br />
But it gave the King a good chance to talk amidst his assassins about their ideas for disposing of D'vinn...<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Arf! Arf!&quot;<br />
&quot;I Fippy Darkpaw shall avenge my slain brothers! Feel the true wrath of the Gnoll people!&quot;<br />
Fippy charged at a young warrior. His name was Beim, Beim Fressen. Fippy had choosen a bad warrior to attack however. Beim had a huge fortune and many strong armors and weapons to wear. He smiled at Fippy. Fippy's claws did not dent, nor scratch his armor. Beim drew his sword so swiftly, so quietly, the action was barely seen or believed. Fippy stood there, stunned and blinking, with a vacant- morbid stare. He fell to the grass as Beim drew back an inch. An elvish ambassodor witnessed the fight, and pleaded with Beim to come with him back to Kelethin. To become a Man of the Seven Representitives.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">05-17-00, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole idea of the contest was becoming more important. It wasn't about the platinum, not anymore. We all knew it'd prove who was building a stronger empire, 'us' or the orcs.<br />
The High Council of Faydark decided to make sure that noone who was chosen could get away that they'd be tatooed. The tatoo said, &quot;a man of the seven&quot;. Some man named Beim had been already chosen, people admired his tatoo. Women swarmed around him... We were all jealous. Raedomort was totally intent on winning the contest. Which was in fact, tomorrow. I had been training with Sandrock, who also wanted to be a member.<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
*trumpets are heard in the backaround, in the forefront you hear a huge crowd*<br />
King Tearis Thex stood in his golden armor above all the spectators and competitors.<br />
His voice seemed to boom, &quot;Thank you my wonderful, loyal, and brave men who came to fight today!&quot;<br />
*cheers cheers cheers cheers*<br />
He waved his hand for silence and continued, &quot;The first event shall be of your choice between battle and skill showing!&quot;<br />
&quot;Battles!&quot;<br />
&quot;Skills! Skills!&quot;<br />
&quot;Bah! I want to see some blood! Let's fight!&quot;<br />
Sandrock knocked back a brandy, picked up a pike and a spell book which he pushed into his tabard pocket.<br />
Raedomort stood up, fire in his eyes as he stared at Sandrock.<br />
&quot;First battle, Sandrock Vs. Kyonto!&quot;<br />
Kyonto was a sturdy built dwarven man, a warrior. He took his stance and looked at Sandrock intently.<br />
&quot;Begin!&quot;<br />
Sandrock began to mumble an acient enchantment as Kyonto drew nearer. Suddenly roots sprang up from the gound underneath Kyonto. He slashed and clawed at them, but the only regrew. While he was distracted Sandrock ran around from behind holding the pike up high. He roared with an enchantment while he struck upon Kyonto, barely stopping in time to spare him his life. Kyonto slashed the last bit of root. He looked ashamed. Sandrock bowed out of respect. Kyonto bowed, but solemnly, with submission.<br />
&quot;Victory goes to Sandrock!&quot;<br />
Cheers ensued.<br />
&quot;Tjard Vs. Nipkin&quot;<br />
A young bold looking halfling stood. Proud,  maybe more so then necessary. <br />
Nipkin was a burly barbarian. He was a barbarian warrior.<br />
He stood in full gleaming, shiny armor.<br />
He laughed at the sight of the young halfling.<br />
&quot;Har har! Ye woont me to fight 'im? Har har! Noo point in gettin scoofed up eh?&quot;<br />
Tjard sneered at Nipkin and looked ready to lunge.<br />
&quot;Begin!&quot;<br />
Nipkin leaned on his sword pommel, biting a hang nail. He yawned, &quot;Go 'head, try it, stoopid furry foots.&quot;<br />
Tjard grinned. He dissapeared into the shadows. Nipkin looked slightly uneased, but whiped around as soon as he heard a twig break. Tjard had thrown a small stone, he jumped on Nipkin's exposed back. He only had a stick as a dagger and dented the armor.<br />
&quot;The vicroty goes to Tjard!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha!? You lil bastard! I'll get you!&quot; Two gaurds had to hold him back and pull him off the arena.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
At the orc castle a human spy walked toward the gates. He walked over a small hill, tripping over a wooden board.<br />
&quot;Gy-&quot; was all he could make out on the board. He was puzzled. From nowhere an adult orc jumped him. Sending a sword right through his ribs. He fell to the ground and saw the board more closely, &quot;Gyforglan...&quot;<br />

<br />
Vija- There are tons of wood elves, you can have your choice of any of them- as long as you can roleplay well. Study a bit of a woodelf-ish accent and try it out.  <br />
<br />
Wix- I hope you'll accept the role of Tjard, he seems minor so far, but that Halfling has some good stuff coming up.<br />
<br />
Sor- I have been thinking about doing a story where people suggest plot points. I am going to make a seperate story for that/ I appreciate everyone's respect yto keep this story just mine.<br />
<br />
Kegge- I know you're reading this so, I'll try and find you a role to...<br />
<br />
Baneorin- We'll see what we can do about the role of Sandrock, he is a popular characther and I expect many to try out for the role.<br />
<br />
Moderaters- I am glad that this thread has gotten it's enormous popularity. I'm very excited to write each day. I would appreciate it if anyone did start a flame that you'll simply delete the flame and not this whole thread. It's not like I expect it... I just DON'T want it to happen. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

The clerics had their hands full for days. Tjard, Sandrock, and Undaemon were the favorites so far. There are only 3 days left of the contest. The HeartWood Master told me I had already been choose, and I got the tatoo. It was painful as hell to get on, and still ached a little. But I impressed myself by not flinching very much...<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Who are the favorites in the contest so far?&quot;<br />
&quot;well M'lord all we have heard is of 5, a rogue by the name of Sett, a shaman by the name of Sandrock, another rogue by the name of Tjard, and Undeamon and Beim Fressen...&quot;<br />
&quot;Beim Fressen? Heh, I battled him once... He ran out of Crushbone so fast my daggers spung! Har Har!&quot;<br />
&quot;He is a very strong young lad now, we hear he is a paladin or warrior...&quot;<br />
&quot;He is a warrior.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ahh I see, we assumed so because he had some crafted armors-&quot;<br />
&quot;Crafted? Wow, he has grown, last I saw him he wore only leather.&quot;<br />
&quot;He is a very strong man, he was choosen second after Sett-&quot;<br />
&quot;Tell me more about this Sett person..&quot;<br />
&quot;His real name seems to be unknown, rumor has it he is the son of Qetra...&quot;<br />
&quot;Qetra!?!&quot;<br />
D'vinn looked unnerved, the scout looked afraid...<br />
&quot;Scout! Get the king, NOW! It is a matter of extreme importance!&quot;<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Growl, ARF ARF!&quot;<br />
&quot;You have tresspassed on BlackBurrow land long enough scum! DIE!&quot;<br />
A gnoll gaurd jammed a spear through the yonug barbarian.<br />
&quot;ARG!!!&quot;<br />
An older, senior gnoll saw it and congradulated the youngster. He told him to go to the king and tell him of his first proof of service.<br />
He kneeled before the king, and the king dubbed him Kyol.<br />
Kyol grew and grew, and eventually became a hero among the gnolls. All the gnolls looked up to him as the ideal soldier and gnoll. He soon became the general of the Gnollen Forces of Karana. And second only to the king and god he served...<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Sir! The GFK have become more of a presence in the Hills of Qeynos than us!&quot;<br />
&quot;What!? What of the gaurd posts!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Destroyed, 32 dead...&quot;<br />
&quot;Dear Karana what shall become of us!&quot;<br />

An Deathfist scout ran toward Qeynos. It was not the Humans of Qeynos, or the Elves of Surefall he headed to see...<br />

But finals are coming up and I needt to study. I'll write regularly again when I get outta school, thanks for your patience!<br />
<br />
Undaemon was a very strange man. He was a ranger near as I could tell. He wasn't a wood elf however. He was a half elf like me. So I must admit I immeadiately felt a kinship with him. He never drank, or gambled, not in battle or at casinos. He was in his late 20s, or early 30s. He came from a wealthy family. It was uncommon for Half Elves to make fortune, most were naturally distrusting of us. Humans shunned us and elves thought humans scum and us that too. Apparently his parents were citizens in High Pass where he grew up. There is a large half elf population in High Keep and High Pass. It's one of the few places half elves feel at home.<br />
<br />
Xvar was a very young man. 15 at most. He was a cold calculating man focused on the mission and nothing else. He had no family. No home, and no sympathy. He was a warrior. He wore a hood that made it hard to tell what races he was. I couldn't ever tell. All I knew was that he wasn't a troll or barbarian or ogre. Even at 15 a barbarian stands a full 2 feet above my head. He never spoke of himself. When he did speak it was usually about the mission. He wasn't bitter really, or particularily unfreindly and cold, he was simply to focused to have any emotions at all...<br />
<br />
Tjard could be described as one of my favorite members of the team. He cried with joy while they put the tatoo on. He was always positive and funny. He was young, 15 as Xvar was. But he was emotional and open. He was a halfing. With light blone hair and blue eyes. He was anxious and ready to jump into battle anytime, but lucky for us he had a good head on his shoulders. He rivaled me with his clever and inquisitive nature. But he had no exeperience, and eagerly followed my lead. It was funny but he was like a kid brother.<br />
<br />
Fyhn was a joker. He made fun of Xvar all the time. Fyhn was 30 or so I think. He and Xvar were at eachother's throats alot. Fyhn's real name was Fyahn Dorfius Nkyul. He was a noble from the court of Kaladim.  He was a dorf, in fact famous for being their tallest. He was at least as tall as a wood elf, and stood to my neck. He was a cheerful stout fellow. He drank alot, but it didn't seem to dull his thoughts or reflexes. He had seen alot of life and still was not bitter. It seems most dorfs are like that. He had lots of exeperience from being on the royal gaurd for 13 years.<br />
<br />
We set out on a day not fit for a fish. It was raining and cold. It paralled my mood more then I admitted... ==Jack of Hearts, Knight Errant... I'll come again, a theif I am. Your heart I'll steal, with a kiss to seal.==</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-02-00, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sandrock picked up a magget pie from the counter.<br />
&quot;Ugh, how the heck can you eat that?&quot;<br />
He snarfed it down and smiled, whiping a few stray maggits from his lip. I wretched.<br />
&quot;Har har! Big and toof eh?&quot;<br />
I whiped my face and he handed me a bottle of whiskey.<br />
&quot;Ahh, that's better. Ugh, don't eat that in front of me, if I get sick again, it'll be all over you.&quot;<br />
He smirked and I felt a tap on the shoulder. The man was a full foot taller then me and drunk, not the sort you like to meet when you don't feel well.<br />
*BURP* &quot;Let me- *HICCUP* see tha tattoo laddy...&quot;<br />
&quot;Excuse me but we have no buisness with you, go sober up.&quot; Sandrock smiled as he said it.<br />
The man tried to punch Sandrock but missed and was so tall he got his hand caught in the mouth of a bear head on the wall. We couldn't stop laughing. He ripped the head off the wall and snarled. He and everyone in the entire room drew their swords.<br />
Sandrock smiled and whispered in my ear, &quot;We're @#%$ed.&quot;<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
Kyol ran through the brisk air of the cold burrow. Several pups cooed and playfully tugged at his tale. He smiled and gently play wrestled. <br />
In a very deep bark, &quot;Hehe, and ye be the one to raise me childs. Ahh Kyol, what would we do without ye.&quot;<br />
Kyol smiled and bowed before the King. The King returned his bow and smiled. He then put on a more grim face and told the children to go play. He put his hands behind him and turned to Kyol.<br />
&quot;We have more serious buisness to discuss I'm afraid.&quot;<br />
Kyol nodded and followed him down to the deeper dungeons.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
The man stumbled over a table. Beim had been carousing a few wenchs, but then noticed the situation. Everyone turned to him. He's a tall man, with a big sword.<br />
&quot;Excuse me M'lady...&quot; He kneeled and stood up.<br />
He slowly turned around.<br />
&quot;Sett? Sandrock? what's this mess, you know I hate to have to interupt other activities to wipe your arses.&quot;<br />
Sandrock chuckled, &quot;Hehe, Beim, if you can still feel your legs when I'm through with you, you'd best run as far and as fast as you can.&quot;<br />
&quot;Har har, advance pigs, feel my steel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Beim, that is such a pathetic battle cry...&quot;<br />
The man and his gang charged us. Behind me Sandrock had rooted 3 of them to the ceiling and was working on the other 2 that were on him. Beim had one hand up against the bar wall while he talked to the wench and the other warding off 3 men. I was on the back of a rather tall man. He jumped up ramming my head to the ceiling.<br />
&quot;Arg! Bastard!&quot;<br />
&quot;Har har!&quot; He shouted then passed out. I wasn't sure if it had been my dagger in his back or the brandy that did it. He wasn't dead, in fact he smiled as he slept. I laughed, &quot;See Sandrock? I told ya that stuff can be a real killer!&quot;<br />
Beim then looked over his shoulder at the men who were exhausted but yet still fighting.<br />
&quot;Un momento, M'lady.&quot;<br />
He turned around and 1 by 1 sliced each straight through. Wel actually the 3 ran out of the bar screaming.<br />
I tipped my hat to him and fell into a chair.<br />
He continued talking to the wench, as he whispered in her ear she slapped him. He looked at us half smirking.<br />
&quot;Don't quit your day job.&quot; I snorted.<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sorry for such a short issue today. I was in a corky mood so I put in to many gags. Hope you enjoyed it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-06-00, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We set our early that morning, Sandrock seem quietly distracted by something. I asked him, &quot;Anything wrong?&quot; He simply grunted and pushed me away. Xvar was in a suspiciously cheerful mood. Considering he usually never demonstrated any mood...<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;M'lord? I have news of the contest winners.&quot;<br />
&quot;Continue D'vinn.&quot;<br />
&quot;One of them is the son of Qetra...&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT!?&quot; the king boomed.<br />
A servant looked in through the open door frame curious. D'vinn threw his blade so fast the motion was not obvious, but the dagger was, right between the eyes...<br />
&quot;Dammit D'vinn, don't show them our fear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fear! How dare you insinuate...&quot;<br />
&quot;SILENCE.&quot;<br />
&quot;Forgive my impertinence M'lord...&quot;<br />
&quot;Pardoned.&quot;<br />
&quot;Summon Kyol, we must speak with the gnolls.&quot;<br />
&quot;And M'lord? Freeport is in dire need of better care, we shall loose control of it if we aren't careful. The dwarves are asking for a temporary peace treaty so they may use our docks.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hehe, have the king himself come here, if he does, kill him and sink all ships coming.&quot;<br />
D'vinn knelt and stood, saltued then walked briskly out of the room.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
Xvar and Sandrock seemed to be talking all day. Tunare knows what they find in common, but I think Xvar is loosening up. He is still an unemotional, calculating warrior of rogueish sorts, but at least he talks now. Sandrock seems more troubled. We've been on the road several days now. We are heading to Freeport, via the Kaladim docks. The orcs will be offering us lodging and supplies. Apparently they aren't planning on killing us until after the contest. Unless we kill them first that is. It seems a secret plot to regain Freeport is unfolding with us at the fighting side. We haven't been breifed yet, we will be when we reach Kaladim, I'd say we're a day away or so. It's a little confusing but I think I'm begining to understand the motives...<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Kyol and his band of merry gnolls set out at midnight. Under the light of the Karana moon they managed to sneak through High Hold Pass and were escroted by the orcs through Kithicor. From there they were led to Orcport. The King recieved them with open arms. He quickly led them to a back room in the castle and discussed tactics over some elven wine.<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
It was raining again. We trudged through the Butcher Blok mountains on a far over used trail. We would get to Kaladim by dusk. On our way Fyhn kept us in spirits by telling us amusing anecdotes and dirty jokes. Sandrock was drinking, not much, but enough to make him worse. Beim was slowly sharpening a pocket knife as we walked. Tjard was tripping on Fyhn's heals, and they play wrestled. Tjard threw mud at him and got some on Beim. Beim tripped him into a giant pile of aviak dung then used the clean part of his pants to clean off the mud. He pulled Tjard out of the pile and grinned. He threw him in a pond. We all laughed and Tjard coughed for the rest of the day. He was ill, but we soon met up with a wandering dwarven cleric who healed him back to new. Then played a joke on Beim, rooting him to the ground and pulling his sword away. We laughed ourselves silly as he tore at the roots with little success.<br />

Sandrock and Undaemon were playing cards and drinking, they barely noticed the slow gentle movement of the ship, or me doubled over. Fyhn was sleeping the whole way on a shipment of wheat. Xvar simply sat up on stern not speaking or moving. For awhile we thought he had frozen to the spot. The trip would take another 3 days. I'm afriad I'll either starve or puke out most of my vital organs pretty soon.<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Welcome to Orcport Kyol, we have heard of your heroism and honor among the gnolls.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why thank you M'lord, your reputation of strength is quite far spread as well.&quot;<br />
The King chuckled and said, &quot;Strength? Does the scent of death on your enemie's lands  equal strength? Bah!&quot;<br />
Kyol bowed and asked to be excused. He went to the room with his party.<br />
&quot;I don't trust them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you see the way they treat eachother Kyol? They are horrible-- no families, no games, no hapiness...&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed, they are a culture of war Kyol, that is all they will bring us, how can we be certain we want to be pulled into that?&quot;<br />
Kyol's tale began to gently wag, &quot;Who said we were fighting *with* them?&quot;<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
We were about 2 days in our wonderful cleansing of my inards when we hit a storm. In fact 'storm' is a gross understatement, it was a squall.<br />
The captain was barking orders at his half naked, soaked crew. Most looked as if the Sea was not the larger part of their troubles. Scars ranged from an accidental hook cut to a mortally wounding dagger gash. I must say I found no enjoyment meeting them on the boat, but I'd have less in a dark alley. Prexus decided to let us live, but through the wettest of hells to get there. Most of us were below deck, Fyhn still was quite peacefully asleep, despite the choppy waters and booming thunder. Just as luck may have it it happened to be night time also, with that and the fog it made it hard to see or navigate. We were afriad we'd ram into the island of the Seafury Cyclops anytime.<br />

Kyol stood looking out of the balcon window silently thinking.<br />
&quot;It is so very unsafe these days, and I don't know who is good.&quot;<br />
He thought to himself, &quot;These orcs kill-- eachother, animals, us, humans, allies and foes, how can they be trusted?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-19-00, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This ship was tossed like a small toy upon the open water of tears. Sharks lay waiting under it, fully knowing it's fate, and their lunch plans. Sett held to the mast of the ship, clawing at it with bloody, splinter gashed fingers. He pulled himself up slowly. Inching his body painfully, pulled down by the weight if his wet armor and pushed down by the winds. The rain battered down on him in buckets, and the lightning boomed like a thunderous drum. He grabbed onto a hemp robe that hung from the crow's nest. The blood on his hands loosened his grip, he tried to put his leg over the edge of the crow's nest but to no avail. He soon found himself flying downward to the ocean below. With a great splash he hit the water. He had landed on his back, forcing the air from his body. He choked, thrown deeper by the insecent torent of rain and wave. A shark tackled him from his side, grabbing his leg and thrashing him at the surface. Sett gasped for air before he hit the water again. He tried to grap onto the shark's dorsel fin only to be thrown away from it again. He coughed and gasped for air at the surface. As he went limp the shark pulled him away from the surface. Sett looked up at the everdarker sky above the water, then fell into darkness. He felt some sort of tale brush his face. He tasted more blood. Then felt the rough, rocky ground of an island on his back. He stared up at a siren's face. He coughed up some sea water, then blood, then wretched. The sirens watched in bemusedment. His vision blurred and he fell asleep shivering.<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;M'lord D'vinn, good news it seem the ocean of tears may swallow up our competitors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ahh really? How dissapointing, I had a place on my wall all ready for their heads to be hung. What a shame.&quot;<br />
The messenger's brow tensed, he put one foot back, then turned around and sprinted out of the room. D'vinn sat laughing, slowly fingering his dagger handle. He chuckled and stood at the window. He looked down at several gnolls and orcs conversing.<br />
&quot;Heh, pathetic fools- They will soon know how strong I and MY people really are.&quot;<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
When Sett awoke, there was not a siren about. He looked down at his leg, which was healed and had about 20 seperate inch long scars where a jaw full of shark teeth had been. He wiggled his toes in his boot and smiled. He rubbed his neck and sat up, straining his eyes in the bright light. His hand was covered in small welts where the splinters had been. He rolled over slightly and hopped to his feet. He felt his tabard and found the small lump where his compass lay pressed against his chest. Reaching down the neck of his tabard he out pulled the compass and a small bottle of brandy. He flipped the cap of the bottle off and sipped the liquor. Looking at the compass he saw he was facing west. He grunted and rubbed his back. He felt a small gash mark in it. He looked down where he had been laying and saw his dagger. He picked it up and secured it in his belt. He grimaced slightly as he rubbed some ointment in the wound and put a bandage on it. Far in the distance he saw the top of a mast. The boat was not moving, and looked slightly damaged. He stuffed his compass and the small bottle back into his tabard and walked toward the beach. The water was dark and cold. He ran in place for a moment to get his blood flowing and dove in. He swam towards the mast, on the side of the ship it read, &quot;SIRENSBANE&quot;. He smiled and continued swimming.<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
I finnally got to the ship, I didn't tell anyone that I had been saved by sirens, they would've asked me if my head had been lost. When I got on the ship I was greeted by Tjard, who nearly knocked me right back into the water with a hug. Xvar chuckled and said, &quot;Pretty good- for a rogue.&quot;<br />
Tjard bonked him on the head and Fyhn started laughing. Beim smiled and pulled me aside, &quot;Sett, we thought we'd lost you- Tjard looks to you as a brother you know.&quot;<br />
I nodded and smiled. &quot;The captain said we'd wait to see if we could recover you, hehe, you got here by the skin of your teeth I see.&quot; he said pointing to the scars on my leg. I pushed my hair from my face and looked over to the horizon.<br />
&quot;Remind me to get a stronger pair of pants when we get to the mainland.&quot; I said smirking.<br />
Beim patted me on the back chuckling, &quot;Come below deck, let's get drunk-&quot; he turned to the others, &quot;You hear that? Time to get soused!&quot;<br />
Xvar chuckled and Tjard cheered leading the happy parade below deck.<br />
We got so drunk I passed out.<br />

Right now it'd make no sense-- He isn't guily, therefore needs no redemption right? But who knows, saying more about that would give away to much of the plot.  <br />
And yeah, there are sharks in the OOT, right by the docks at the brotherhood island you can find one. <br />
Thanks Wikedale  <br />
BTW: I left out the breifing in Kaladim on purpose, you find out later what was said there. Just in case anyone was wondering hehe.<br />
I'm at a friend's house right now so I can't really right an issue. I'll right later; cya all!<br />

Anyway, I feel like I must destroy you by writing my own story, from the other perspective, a Dark Elves perspective.  Mine probably will not be this sweeping but I promise... it will be good!  Anyway, keep writing.  Now that school is out I expect over time, chop to, on the double!</div></div><hr />

/sigh<br />
<br />
I wish EQ really was like this...<br />
<br />

Despite the fact that they are insanely powerful and useful, again stressing that we will have to be very careful implementing poison to insure that we don't severly overpower them, there are still a LOT of people out there who think that rogues are useless.- Abashi</div></div><hr />

My spelling/grammar is THE worst crap you'll ever see. I promise.    <br />
I'm working on it-- and my english teacher told me to submit this to a magazine. Who knows? I might just get it published; after endless hours of revision that is.  <br />
<br />
I'll write some more soon, but I have a bit of a sad annoucement to make--<br />
I retired Kooran Katshadow.<br />
I had to disband my guild, then I had to change my name-- long long story. None of it was my fault, but it discouraged me so much I was finnally-- well @#%$ it.<br />
Anywho, I'll still by playing EQ via other characthers so I'm NOT going to stop writing or playing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-27-00, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, despite the great misdeeds I was doing my stomach, I managed to keep my lunch down. The rest of the journy wasn't necessarily uneventful, it was mostly blurred or in a state of half consiousness. You could say being drunk is fun, but I don't think anyone knows past a certain point; eventually you just sort of blank out.<br />
Upon reaching Freeport I thoroughly and completly lost my lunch at the site. Although the orcs had kept 'their' sides of the city clean, the slums belonged to the humans. The humans did remidial monotonous work for hours on end. With only enough food to barely sustain them in a delicate suspense over death.<br />
Most buildings were in disrepair and infested by either rodents or roaches, or in many cases both. The taverns were all rough, cold, bitter places simply for selling beer. I remember my favorite bar, a warm friendly little place on the docks, but now it is more like a morgue then a tavern. With dead or drunken patrons on the floor and orcs making daily rounds beating all they saw. The whole party made not a sound. Noone talked, or remarked on the conditions of our once fellow neighbors.<br />
Only Beim's armor made a slight noise as we moved. All of us had our hoods over our heads-- except Xvar...<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;The Dwarven King lands tomorrow Milord, how shall we dispose of him? And ahhh yes, it seems the 7 representitives of the lesser races have arrived, what shall we do with them?&quot;<br />
D'vinn cackled maniacly and smirked at the King.<br />
&quot;Milord? May I answer the messenger?&quot;<br />
After a deep chuckled the King waved his hand in approval.<br />
&quot;Messanger?&quot; D'vinn cooed in a soothing calm voice.<br />
The messenger gulped and nodded.<br />
D'vinn picked a fingernail with his dirk and looked up at the messenger.<br />
D'vinn fingered a small wooden board and then suddenly stabbed his dirk through it, the blade point came only inches from the messenger's face, but he didn't grimace.<br />
D'vinn nodded pompously, &quot;Messenger? How did you know what we were planning to do to the King of the Dorfs? We had not told a soul outside of the elites...&quot;<br />
&quot;I- uh- um- er-&quot;<br />
D'vinn quietly pulled the dirk out of the board and smiled.<br />
&quot;What is your name?&quot;<br />
&quot;My name is-- Durhog Fmuner.&quot;<br />
D'vinn scratched a large D then a large F on the board and looked up at the messenger, like a scholar from his book.<br />
&quot;Hold this.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes- yes Milord!&quot;<br />
The messenger read the board then looked up in total terror, &quot;No! Please! You don't understand!!&quot;<br />
&quot;I? I don't understand?&quot;<br />
D'vinn smiled and turned to the King, making irrelevent small talk as he tripped the orc with his foot and put his blade to pad the fall of the orc. It worked well, the orc felt nothing upon landing on the cold stone floor-- in a puddle of blood.<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
Our accomodations are very good, velvet curtains, plush pillows-- warms baths. Everything is to perfectly tailored to our needs we wonder where our coffins are.<br />

Fyhn had taken everything in his room peice by peice and thrown it out the window to poor humans, velvet cusions and all. Sandrock had drained the liquor cabinet within an hour or so and Xvar sat at his window sill, quiet as usual. I sat at the desk, rumaging through the draws. I found some old letters, and inks and quills, nothing of great interest. Except an ornately crafted l
