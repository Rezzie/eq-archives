<br />
I'm currently doing the test of cunning in The Manor, but i can't figure out how to keep Milton from beating my ass (god i love the humor in this game, /salute Blizzard)<br />
<br />
anyways, i've tried a couple different things, soon as i'm done posting i'm going to spend 20 deaths and all my durability trying this one:<br />
<br />
open the chest, smack vanish immediately, hopefully fast enough that Milton will spawn but not aggro on me, then attempt to sap him, open the chest and sprint out of the cave<br />
<br />
here goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zark</div><div class="date">12-22-04, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a bit disappointed in this quest when I went through it.  I just think they could have done a better job with it.  If you're still stumped, here's what to do:  <br />
 <br />
[spoiler:0092384dbe]Turn on sense traps before entering the cave.  When you look at the chest, you see the message from before but above that is a blue glowing object.  Walk over to it and it will give you what you need.   <br />
 <br />
/rant on I wish they would have made it a door or something or made it clearer that you needed the &quot;Test of Cunning.&quot;  I walked right past the chest the first time and couldn't figure out why Fahrad wouldn't talk to me.  According to the quest info, I just needed the seal.  Anyway, I kicked myself for not thinking of it before taking Milton down with a hunter friend, but it was still a bit disappointing. /rant off[/spoiler:0092384dbe]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keroth</div><div class="date">12-22-04, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i figured it out a few minutes after this post<br />
<br />
anyways i pickpocketed those stupid emblems for like 2 hours until i turned in enough to get friendly faction with Ravenholdt, at which point all the npc's in there went from yellow to green, however i'm only level 29 and i think i'm too low to get any quests they offer<br />
<br />
then again, i don't see any gray ! so maybe that's it<br />
<br />
if that's all there is to it, i'm gonna be very unhappy</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InvisiBill</div><div class="date">12-23-04, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing here.  I'm only 25, but I'm not seeing any quest !'s (gray or yellow) after turning in the 30 emblems.<br />
<br />
P.S. Yay, first EQ-like stupid faction quest. At least it was something rogue-ish, and not just killing bears for 3 hours...</div></div><hr />

Well this one is WAY better than the killing centaurs for 3 hours or more that I gave up on in the desolace.  I was driving me nuts trying to get friendly with one of the other centaur clans.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that quest isn't worthwhile.  The rewards are crappy.  Admittedly, I haven't done the last in the series, killing the khan in the Valley of Spears, but the rest of them are low exp, little or no loot rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-25-04, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did the quests at lvl 40. 25 turn-ins to get past the emblems, I have yet to see anymore quests. I think it's just not completed.<br />
<br />
As for Desolace; took me only 30ish centaurs to gain the alliance for the SW clan. Wasn't too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legna</div><div class="date">12-27-04, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No further quests at 47. <br />
<br />
Was a very large letdown to see it dead end like that. But at least it was a fun way to raise faction (relatively).<br />
<br />

<br />
Just checked again tonight, and Winstone still isn't giving out any quests, FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been assuming partial implementation. Particularly since they switched the emblems to being stackable soon after (man am I glad I didn't run back and forth 40 times the first night), but didn't change anything else. Not to say it can't be a bug they just didn't fix, but it just seems like they put one step in and later they'll slip in some more.<br />
<br />
On a related note, hearing rogues ask for people to group to help kill their &quot;test of cunning&quot; is almost as painful as the ones who insist you'll never get your lockpicking up without buying practice locks.  :frown</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">01-04-05, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ill admit I got tricked by milton as well.  But I went one step farther in the dupe.<br />
After I fought him and died, Realized I messed up I went to talk to the guy anyway and said I didnt have the seal, which was really confusing because I was sure I had it before.  Looked in my bag and I couldent find it.  I figured milton had took it so I was pissed.  Ran back to IF and dropped the quest to take it again. (Ends up it was in a different bag I didnt look in, I didnt find this out until later though)  <br />
Get back and I had throught that the calling of milton was a trap.  Well in a way it was, I saw it and thought Ok, I see the trap ya dirty bastards, Now I can open the chest without him showing up..... :(<br />
As you can guess I was at the graveyard again.  Thinking once again Milton took my seal I went back to IF.  But when I went to drop the quest and take it again I saw that it was marked Complete and that milton dosnt actually take the seal.  Smacking myself in the head I went BACK to the manor to turn in cursing at my stupidity and wasted time with only the griffon to hear.<br />
<br />
Felt pretty stupid after that.  And then having the quest line end after collecting the badges made me feel even more that the person was correct that said the quest was a &quot;Quest in futality&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sancha</div><div class="date">09-12-05, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok....I know this is stupid.  That said, I'm stumped.  I was able to sense traps on the chest, and I got the action mouse icon on the trap, but it wouldn't do anything.  clicking, right clicking, shift clicking, nothing.  I see the chest is trapped, but still can't figure out how to disarm the trap to get the seal.  I can't find any reference to any kind of Disarm Traps skill.  Anyone have a little help?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zark</div><div class="date">09-12-05, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a while, but I believe all you have to do is walk up to the chest with sense traps active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sancha</div><div class="date">09-13-05, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally found the answer to my question last night.  Even though the quest is available at lvl 24 when you get sense traps, Disarm traps is a lvl 30 skill.  guess I'll put off doing this dead end for another 4 levels now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pickalots</div><div class="date">09-28-05, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just put sense traps up and walk by the chest.. I believe I did it in stealth mode - currently collecting emblems in my spare time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">11-17-05, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats what I did too.  Got it on the first try.  Walked into the cave, saw a chest, activated sense traps, saw that it was trapped, the floating thing above the chest was some kind of warning, so I just kept walking.  Guy at the castle talked to me fine.</div></div><hr />
