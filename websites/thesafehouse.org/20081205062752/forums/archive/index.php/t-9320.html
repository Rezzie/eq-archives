<br />
Our team has encountered alert conditions of criminal activities in Galaxy City and Atlas Park. The streets are *not* safe despite many partrolling hero parties and scouts. We have also heard rumours of this problem spreading around and reaching the critical level in King's Row and even in the ever-so-peaceful Perez Park.<br />
<br />
Because of these serious conditions, I am sad to inform that we find no alternative for the must to demand the immediate evacuation for entire human population of Galaxy City and Atlas Park - areas. This is short term solution, that would open up the means for more radical approach to clean up the criminal content.<br />
<br />
For longer term solution, we demand the authorities bring back the public schools and other necessary public facilities, that provide the tolerable means for every day life for everybody.<br />
<br />
As a personal request, I would like to see the mutant discrimination addressed and have some proper actions taken to prevent it from happening. The mutant community has been very disappointed for the results of the negotiations so far.<br />
<br />
All this aside some mutants even made personal sacrifices for the sake of successful negotiations and reduced the amount of consumed human babies into one per week (from the standard five per week). However this radical move was barely notified as a gesture of good will.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hoping to see the conditions becoming better and wishing better days for all the heroes,<br />
