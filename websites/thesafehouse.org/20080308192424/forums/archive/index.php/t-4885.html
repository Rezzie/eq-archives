<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jordinn</div><div class="date">02-17-02, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From Percival server standings in RvR: (Bold is archers, Plain is Rogue, Ital is the rest of them)<br />
<br />
1) Vestige Ventox (50th level Infiltrator) [Shadow Dancers] 304,245 <br />
2) Erebus Delirium (50th level Sorcerer)  295,984 <br />
3) Cinamon (44th level Ranger) [Emerald Dawn] 294,881 <br />
4) Timber (46th level Ranger) [Clann Eireann] 260,870 <br />
5) Pusky Dhearga (49th level Ranger) [Du Mintai] 254,874 <br />
6) Grayswandir (50th level Enchanter) [Du Mintai] 243,317 <br />
7) Syraxus DarkArrow (45th level Ranger) [Ravens of the Veil] 225,550 <br />
8) Galedeaf (46th level Hunter) [Fist Of The North] 215,154 <br />
9) Rastaf (50th level Skald) [Odin's Fury] 195,929 <br />
10) Seclruda Ventox (50th level Infiltrator) [Shadow Dancers] 177,524 <br />
11) Sinamon (45th level Ranger) [Emerald Dawn] 173,300 <br />
12) Demondrega (50th level Nightshade) [Tuatha De Danann] 169,831 <br />
13) Coal Trueshot (50th level Ranger) [Du Mintai] 166,305 <br />
14) Tesfaye Yasin (49th level Scout) [Invictus] 155,763 <br />
15) Sanyen Blacksun (44th level Ranger) [Du Mintai] 155,586 <br />
16) Rhiannon (49th level Huntress) [Odin's Fury] 149,827 <br />
<br />
Notice how many are archers..... *G*  I think that shows pretty much that archers still own RvR.<br />
<br />
Quick breakdown:<br />
<br />
10 out of 16 are archers, 3 rogues, 2 casters, 1 hybrid/melee<br />
13 out of the top 16 are stealth capable classes.<br />
16 out of 16 have ranged attack capabilities (ok, some of it is weak, but they have it)  Of those the archers have the distinct range advantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to which is better, looks like rangers are on the list quite a bit, but that could be for a lot of reasons, pick the one you like in the realm that seems most appealing.  <br />

It would if all these numbers were from the last 7 days, but they are from launch to present, which means it's never going to truly reflect what you are stating it reflects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Jordinn</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, these numbers do reflect since launch, so the changes to archers etc since then will impact overall effectiveness but don't show in these numbers.

No that would be some nice data to have a look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Xumten</div><div class="date">02-18-02, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think you would see too much difference. Archers still own RvR.  I can assure you the names on top of our server list are the names you see constantly in the death messages. The number one killer according to The Herald is most definately a name that ALL realms are familiar with. <br />
<br />
Just two nights ago he made pincusions out of about 16+ lvl 40+ players. His name definately strikes fear in many and makes everyone nervous. He's a lvl 50 Scout BTW.<br />
<br />
To answer the original topic, pick whatever realm you enjoy the most. All the archer classes are very strong in RvR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tugger Merlin</div><div class="date">02-19-02, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a nightshade turned ranger, I can tell you the order of power of archers from a purely class design standpoint: 1) Hunter, 2) Ranger, 3) Scout. What I *can't* comment on is the availability of good gear, quests, or Realm content specific issues.<br />
<br />
Check daoc.catacombs.com for exact skills and abilities but here's a quick summary:<br />
<br />
Midgard Hunter:<br />
2H Spear melee (slow, but high damage)<br />
Beastcraft (Self buffs, PET spell, Not as many self buffs as a Ranger[missing STR I think..])<br />
Bows (lowest delay out of the 3 archer classes, this means best chance at interruptions)<br />
Stealth<br />
Archery<br />
Commentary: Beastcraft is superior to Ranger Pathfinding because while a Ranger is sacraficing spec points they could spend in melee into pathfinding and a hunter does the same, their PET makes up for their lack of melee ability. So they're really not losing a thing! Additionally, they can hide and retain a pet. Also, they can sick the pet on a caster or archer to cause interruptions. Additionally, a Ranger has 2 lines to spec melee in: Melee type (piercing, blades) and Celtic Dual. Hunters need only worry about 1. And you may argue if 2H or dual weilding is better damage, but the pet will make up for any perceived lack. I feel these factors makes them the best Archer class out of the 3.<br />
<br />
Hibernian Ranger:<br />
Melee: Piercing or Blades, plus a Dual Weild skill called &quot;Celtic Dual&quot;. At 1 CD, you have a 25% chance for offhand weapon to go off. Can weild a shield, but it's not a trainable skill like Scouts.<br />
Spells: Pathfinding line of self buffs (Str, Dex/Qui buff, AF buff, Damage add buff, getaway spell)<br />
Stealth<br />
Archery, bows in the middle speed, but slower then hunters.<br />
Comments: Middle range power archer. See Hunter vs. Ranger comments above.<br />
<br />
Albion Scout:<br />
NO spells (why?)<br />
1H melee plus Shield ability (trainable, I believe, but dont quote me)<br />
Stealth<br />
Archery, slowest bows mean largest crits and larger chance of 1-shotting targets however this also means less chance to interrupt spells and other archers, so its a trade off, they are almost more geared towards a life of sniping.<br />
Comments: Least powered of all 3 archer types in my opinion. One realm specific issue in the favor of Albions, is that they are the only realm with a frontier that acts like a frontier. Their first 2 frontier realms are extremely dangerous to travel to. Snowdonia isn't all that dangerous, but it's filled to the brim with realm guards. Forest Sauvage isn't really used, and most mobs are gray at the level you can head there to PK so there aren't many targets since noone is there XPing. Not many go there to Alb to PK because of these factors, so you will not have to worry about leveling being interrupted as much as if you were a Mid or Hib. <br />
