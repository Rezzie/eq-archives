<br />
I would like to start a petition to see that Rogue's are granted complete invisibilty whilst stalking so NO characters or NPC's can see us whether buffed or not.<br />
<br />
There's no damn way we will ever be effective on a PVP server unless this is implemented ASAP. <br />
<br />
Currently all ranged characters can kill us before we even get close to them. Close quarter style fighters such as warriors, bards etc can beat us purely on damage output alone. Healers, can heal until we're all out of endurance and then bang we're dead.<br />
<br />
The Rogue is currently one of the least played characters and to be honest I can see why, I've stuck around to level 23 in the vain hope that my prayers will be answered but to date all we're fed are crappy moves which are pathetic at best. The only exclution to this is the smoke trick as it actually works in combat and is a valid move to combat the fact that all are good attacks have to come from behind a player.<br />
<br />
With the aid of complete invisibilty we can atleast choose the fights we want to engage in rather than acting like a free dinner at a homeless party. I've had levels that are 3/4 below me trying their luck and in some cases actually winning which is complete madness. Enough is enough, please give us what WOW'ers have enjoyed for so long.<br />
<br />

Make my group target me with their defensive window if my stealth is good enough cause they can't see me. For me on PvE it would mostly just be fun than of pratical use but it would be fun to sneak up to friends and depop stealth right next them, suddenly just appearing.</div></div><hr />

WoW doesn't have anything close to what your asking for, also i like the current implementation of stealth better than any other game so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daut</div><div class="date">03-05-07, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically I think we need a heafty bonus to our stealth checks as they are now.  My stealth skill was close to maxed when a group of players 2 levels below me could see me the whole time.</div></div><hr />

I don't want complete invisibility(unable to be seen)<br />
<br />
However, I will agree that the checks need to be increased. As far as NPC's go, I still get seen regularly by 19-21 NPC's  at lvl 22.  as well as being seen and beaten by level 15-17 caster types on an all to often basis. :oops<br />

but anyhoot.... :horse</div></div><hr />
