<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm a healer.<br />
<br />
Thats what I do. Thats All I do.<br />
<br />
I can't do any damage worth a crap, and I work best hiding behind some big meat shields who soak up damage for me to heal, and put out more damage than I ever can.<br />
<br />
So Why the heck can't I ever seem to find any?<br />
<br />
Every time I get invited to a group, Its inevitably Populated with 3 blasters, a couple defenders and a controller or 2.<br />
<br />
Every now and then, I get one, or if I'm insanely lucky, 2 scrappers to work with. (And thats only because a RL friend plays a Scrapper.) But never a Tank. I haven grouped with precisely 2 tanks from levels 1-15.<br />
<br />
I hate having the Blaster tank. Either they never get hit, or It takes all 3 heals as fast as I can cycle them to heal the blaster who insists on pulling the boss of every group by leading off with a sniper blast. Yeah, Blasters are Great at a lot of things, but tanking is NOT one of those things.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed a shortage of Tankers and Scrappers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnmish Gearbinder</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, generally that's true. Not alot of Tankers at all. Fortunately, I am one. Everyone else in my SG though, Blasters. That includes my alt. :pulid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemac Dushae</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feel free to send a call for help to Agent Abrams on Victory.  I'll happily tank for yas.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, anyway... If any Tanekr or Scrappers are ever looking for a group on Victory (Currently around lvl 15) Add me to your friends list.<br />
<br />
I'll almost always add melee types to my groups. Plus, my regular groupmates include a scrapper and another Empath, so we should have heals covered for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel for you meddik. Its actually the reason i quit my healer, retired at 22 =(  I just for the life of me could NOT find a group, even in talos / independance for multiple hours a night. The deathly efficient controller / blaster 3 - 4 man groups work. Scrappers can solo, blasters can solo, and well controllers are the best duo partner out there. Theres just not much for a defender.<br />
<br />
I guess thats my biggest gripe. Healing is such an after thought in this game. I think the reason you don't see that many tankers is because of that reason. The fact that if you make a *Good* group tanker your sacrificing your offense for defense, and i can tell you that makes for very little solo action. So many shy away from tankers. Yes there are tankers that solo, but for group efforts their defense is lacking * a majority of &quot;teh burnzinatorz&quot; tanks*.<br />
<br />
As is in all mmo's the support classes are the ones you offer cyborz for to recruit in nearly any group / guild / wtf ever. Not many people truly say &quot;Hey i want to sacrifice my solo ability to be useful to other people&quot;. I just feel in CoH theres not that demand anymore. I really think thats a big problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ill group with anyone anytime. i have duoed with healers,and i love it. keeps me moving with no downtime except stamina.  The only drawback is that im not suited to large 8 man groups,unless its a well set up group.<br />
<br />
<br />
whole point of the supergroup we set up on victory, i thought.<br />
<br />
im not the best tank,but in a 2-4 man group ive done well. <br />
<br />
Know there are alot of scrappers out there in the redeemed,just a matter of getting groups set up.<br />
<br />
Im  level 17 katana/reflexes scrapper at the moment,and i know there are quite a few around that level.<br />
<br />
Edit: ive got alot of you on my friends list,so drop me a tell. Only thing is ive run out of room on the friends list for more names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freonsmurf</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mythas, are you on victory?  <br />
<br />
My solution has been to form my own groups and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look for Anarchist X-lvl 11 currently (so I could be easily sidekicked) on Victory.  I love tanking for people.  With resist, resist elements and unyielding stance I can take a ok pounding, and I do have taunt to keep the jackasses off the healer as well.<br />
<br />
Also I've grouped with some other good tanks, Horrid Spinster for example, so now that I know there seems to be a shortage,  I'll keep track of more names and post them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepy</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to mention how much it sucks chasing down runners with no ranged abilities. Scrappers ought to at least get a low damage &quot;harpoon&quot; or a caltrops-like power or something. Anything to control runners. It's less of a hassle with my Stone tank now that he has Mud Pots (or whatever it's called).<br />
<br />
Anyways, out of an hour of soloing I must spend 20 minutes just chasing runners. A little of that goes long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found my jump kick helps a lot.  I run ahead of the runner using spring, then with a good kick they get knockdowned, then punch to dribble them again, they they are usually down for the count with a brawl and jab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemac Dushae</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For tankers I have found that Taunting runners will send them running back to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah lemac, im on victory. Mythas was a 22nd radiation / radiation defender. I've got a fire devices blaster whos at 16 now, but i have to go off for the weekend, I also have an 8 spines / regen scrapper, i just can't choose which i like to play better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a tank.  Unforently I haven't played at all this week, been super busy.   My tanks level 6 though and I have the weekend all to myself so hopefully I can grind a few levels I'd really like to start seeing the rest of the game. <br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell and i'll tank for anyone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My scrappers are only level 7 and 8 thus far, but look for Splitshadow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any of you not in a SG should ask about joining us in Redeemed, makes knowing who is online a lot easier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabatini Scratch</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny. I seem to mostly group with melee types. Or at least that's what the most successful groups for me have been. Whenever I get picked up by a large group it's always full of Controller, blasters and occasionally defenders and usually end up dying horribly. :)<br />
<br />
Whenever I'm in a small group with scrappers, tankers maybe one ranged type things go much smoother. Did a group of 4 scrappers the other day that was hysterical. Each of a different type. Tore through various street trolls with wild abandon and never got into more trouble than we could handle. Seems like the melee types I run into are slightly more sensible than the Controllers.<br />
<br />
But if anyone needs a Broadsword/Reflex scrapper just shy of 13th (Jack Scratch), let me know. Always fun to team with friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CogginsEQ</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look me up Meddik, im still a little on the low side(just into 12) but I will be glad to group with ya!<br />
<br />
Oh yea, im a invul/super strength tanker! hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dime</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol too bad you guys dont play on justice. our SG has about 4 true tankers that play nightly.  we are short on healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce</div><div class="date">05-14-04, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I got to play with a few of you all today wooot me!  <br />
<br />
Now the question is how did i do as a tankage ;) I think I did allright I think if i was truly 17 I'd have alot more tools at my disposal but just having the hps and damage of my level I did an allright job.  I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">05-15-04, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I rolled up a Tanker just to see what it is like.  Soccer Mom, is my tanker. :p  It wasn't bad, but I love playing my Controller/Storm character a lot more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">05-15-04, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, the Safehouse SG is what, 90% scrappers? :) <br />
<br />
If ya want a 14 katana/regen scrapper to take a couple hits, just give ol' Kuro Neko a call.</div></div><hr />
