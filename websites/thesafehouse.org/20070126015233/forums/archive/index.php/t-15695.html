<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joonling</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My roommate is looking for the same thing.  I suggested that he look in Blackburrow *shrugs* I've looked it up online, but no one seems to know anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maht Stohlit</div><div class="date">11-20-04, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a german site that suggested one was in Forest Ruins but there's not any that I can find.  It would make sense if it was in one of the younger zones, because the rest are.  The Sabertooth clan resides in blackburrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyy Daugg</div><div class="date">11-21-04, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure I've seen a mob called &quot;Flamepaw Loyalist's Remains&quot; in forest ruins, so I'm guessing he's a rare there?<br />

<br />
 was stuck on this guy for a little while as well.. but last night now that I'm 17 adv. level and pretty much everything in Forest Ruins is grey I was up in the castle complex with the elementals looking for resource nodes and in the back up top in a room of skeletons I saw 2 skeletons called Flamepaw Loyalists and was able to finish the quest.  Although I didn't get anything, the book gave me another quest to catalog some creatuers in the Down Below and the higher level zone beyond that I forget what it's called.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Labanen</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the named mob is up in the very top of the ruin in forrest ruin he ll have some guards where some or all of are called flamepaw loyalists. i *think* he only spawns at night but i didnt put in much effort to find out once i finally found him i was way over Forrest Ruin lvl and didnt bother to verify my idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giovanni</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The flame paw Loyalists spawn at the &quot;ruined mage tower&quot; or &quot;tower of the 3&quot; I think it is also called by a gnome in baubleshire by the waterfall who gives out a quest for wonkel arms or whatever they are called. So roll up to the tower in the ruins and there are a bunch of skeletons there waiting for a named to spawn, kill them all, kill the next round of them and repeat, this will cause the named to spawn at the podium there and a bunch of his flunkies (Flamepaw Loyalists) will spawn all around him. This IS where they spawned I did the quest and finished it a couple weeks ago. Hope this helps anyone who is still looking for these guys.</div></div><hr />
