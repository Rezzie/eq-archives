<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faegan</div><div class="date">10-16-06, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dwarvenholt is a well established and cohesive guild that was established in 2001 in preperation for the launch of the game Horizons. We are an all Dwarf clan that enjoys crafting, story telling, hunting, and becoming emmersed in the mythos of our clan and whatever land we find ourselves. Our purpose has always been the re-establishment of the Dwarven home of Khazad-dum. We believe Vanguard will suit our play style and advance our mythos and history since we will again be able to begin the construction of Khazad-dum.<br />

If ye be a Dwarf, and if ye seek the companionship of other stout hearted and true Dwarves, you owe it to yourself to become familiar with Dwarvenholt.<br />
