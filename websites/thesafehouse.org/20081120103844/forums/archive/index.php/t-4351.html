<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">11-12-03, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am liking being a Thief. I plan on doing a Thief/Ninja combo. But things may change because my friend decieded to be a Red Mage, and I duo with him all the time. So i might level a secondary job to play with him, like a Monk or Warrior, and switch to Thief when I'm not with him.<br />
<br />
Thieves just simply ain't good when it comes to tanking. It's not to say we're bad and can't tank, but major pita, that's all. I like all the skills we have. It feels like an interesting class to play, and hopefully even more so when I can sub-job a Ninja.<br />
<br />
Ninja's can gain TP fast and do great damage. They can also dual-wield. So Dual Wield + Triple Attack in mainhand, Sneak attack etc etc is awesome.<br />
<br />
But admittedly, I am mainly playing it because it just sounds awesome. I mean, DUDE! Ninja! That's just freaking awesome no matter how you look at it. Kerayu, Mithra Thief of Phoenix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, the class design points that way too. Thankfully, as you gain power, you can solo weaker mobs still worth xp, unlike EQ where a monster became killeable for a rogue levels after it was worth any xp. Thieves are very, very much a support class, but we are an ass kicking support class. &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;<br />
