<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Unfetered</div><div class="date">08-18-99, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last Night for the first time.. I journeyed to South Karana to complete a quest for the bards, with the NPC Valem Nostromo (is it).  While I was there I took a look around.  I found massive tree buildings with Aviaks, that warbled when you hit them .  Loadsa people here fighting.  I then thought I would seek out Infected Paw... after many a long walk (and stretched ham strings) I came upon the place and grouped with a bunch of adventurers. <br />
  <br />
 In we went and discovered that we were the only people there.  I was very scared as I did not know the layout, and didnt know what lvl the gnolls here were.  I discovered that everything conned green to me up until the gnoll gaurds (who were a light blue).  I remember thinking... I hope a train does not start here as there was hundreds of gnolls). <br />
  <br />
 We took out a few nobles, shamens, and gaurds and decided to get the captain.  When all of a sudden... in a circler room filled with gnolls, a shamen targeted me... and the biggest train I have ever seen went straight for me.  My group was hard put to it.  There must have been 20 of them.  Gaurds shamens and normals.  My lvl12 held his own.  I knew not to run away, as the train would have become massive.  We got down to about 4 gaurds left, I was very weak... almost passing out from pain.  My character was so brave, but I thought I was gonna make it.  HEAL ME PLZ, i cried to the caster in our group.... I sighed in relieve as I saw the familier blue spell surround her... but my relief was short lived as a gnoll interupted her spell and a gaurd cleaved my skull.  It was then in that horrible moment when I died, I realised with a heart sinking feeling that I forget to get bound at the Aviak settlement, and I would appear in Qeynos. <br />
  <br />
 A sow later and many buffs from sympathetic travellers at the gates of Qeynos, I was running back.  In the end I found my body (after giving consent to a member of the group for him to drag it to a zone.)  I BS'd a Captain for 30 HP to finish him off, and the kindly Rogue who dragged my body gave me a magical snakeskin mask, as I had missed many loots in my return journey. <br />
  <br />
 Doesnt sound like much of a deal, but it was new territory for me.. I was scared and not confident at all... and dying in an unfamilier place is one of the worst feelings ever.  I love this game <br />

  <br />
 Paw is a great dungeon.  It's scary but doable.  In upper teens it gets to be a cakewalk though.  It's also unique in that it's quite often EMPTY of players.  It's a goldmine for low-teens yet there's few playing there. <br />
  <br />
 I'm looking forward to this Saturday's Fennin Ro rogue bash in Paw.  It's gonna be a slaughterhouse of gnolls! <br />
  <br />

 (oh, I'm gonna move this thread to the Fireplace forum, so all safehousers can read it and post.  Not everyone can get in the cellar and i know there's a few young rogues that would benefit from reading your post.) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vaslin</div><div class="date">08-23-99, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't bind to the Aviak city. Sorry.  Quenos is the typical binding place for Paw adventurers... <br />
  <br />
 NOT! That's a typical thought by most newbies. Go to the Arena my friend!!  The walk through W. Karanas is too great for anyone.   <br />
  <br />
 Go back out of paw due south through the aviak city and continue until you get to Lake Rathe.   Make sure you either go through sneaking during the day time.  The skeletons there are quite tough.  Jump in the water and swim towards the SW until you find a dock along the side.  Go up into a tunnel and find yourself in the Arena.   <br />
  <br />
 It's not all PvP inside.  You actually have to go through a little passage to get there, but you CAN bind inside the entrance safely!! <br />
  <br />
 Good luck my friend and enjoy one of the most unutilized dungeons in the game! Vaslin SlickfingerTarew Marr</div></div><hr />
