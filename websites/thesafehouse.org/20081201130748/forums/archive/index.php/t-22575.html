Should have its name changed from &quot;Team SH and friends&quot; to &quot;Team SH and two idiots who lucked into getting into an amazing group&quot;<br />
<br />
(I'm the idiot in the brown on the right)<br />
<br />
Fanguard was fun and the safehouse bunch was by far the most energetic and fun to be around.  Thanks for the good times ;)<br />

I just spent the day rearranging my computer room and installing the new card (and the X-530 speakers I ran out and bought after winning the X-Fi).<br />

This thing rocks!</div></div><hr />

I agree, we had a great collection!<br />
<br />
I've got some higher res pics of our collection which I took with my real camera so I'll be uploading them soon the mugshot gallery pages (not the flickr place).</div></div><hr />

Esp. since the added productivity helped conceal the fact that I didn't actually find any items.</div></div><hr />
