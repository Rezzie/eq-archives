<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-20-07, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FUNimation Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Navarre Corporation, today announced that the company maintained its position as the anime market share leader for the home video sales of Anime for the sixth straight year. According to an analysis of Nielsen VideoScan data for the year 2006, FUNimation controls 23.2 percent of the market. The company's next closest competitor held 12.6 percent of the market. &quot;We knew when we started this company that our commitment to quality over quantity would put us into the leadership position in the United States,&quot; said Gen Fukunaga, president and CEO of FUNimation Entertainment. &quot;We have achieved this honored position through the hard work of all the employees of FUNimation and with the help of all of our great business partners in Japan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nielsen VideoScan collects sell-through POS (consumer purchase) sales data weekly from traditional channels of video distribution including mass merchants, audio/video and video specialty retailers, electronics outlets, grocery stores, drug stores, and some Internet sites. Nielsen VideoScan maintains this weekly POS data in one of the largest databases of VHS and DVD products in the country. FUNimation compiled data from Nielsen VideoScan reports for 2001 through 2006. The analysis showed that FUNimation has been the market share leader since 2001 and has continued to outdistance its competitors with a solid catalog of titles. &quot;This has been one of our biggest years and we plan to keep growing our market share in the years to come,&quot; continues Fukunaga.<br />
<br />
In 2006, FUNimation had DVD releases from such popular titles as Dragon Ball Z, Fullmetal Alchemist, Trinity Blood, Negima, Gunslinger Girl, Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid and many others. For 2007, FUNimation plans to continue its number one market share presence with releases from such titles as Afro Samurai, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, Witchblade, School Rumble, Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles and new releases from franchise titles such as Dragon Ball Z and Fullmetal Alchemist. <br />

Pretty interesting news, I've always wondered who was the most successful R1 company, I did think it was Funimation, but felt I might have been missing something. Looks like I was right.<br />
<br />
I will continue rooting for them, they are definitely my favorite company at the moment. I mean, if nothing else, for releasing Crayon Shin-chan and Kodomo no Omocha.</div></div><hr />
