<br />
I'm trying to do a tradeskill one that dosent violate the EULA, but cannot seem to get the tabbox to work outside of the abilities window.  Is this true, or am I just not coding it right?<br />
<br />
Anyhoo... here is a link to a different thread, with a screenshot and downloads and stuff...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AddoPovar</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what Knek at EQ-traders checked with a GM and got confirmed was not approved was modifying the HTML-based help file which is read by EQ and displayed in the help window in the new UI.<br />
<br />
He was designing a log parser program which changed the contents of the help file to reflect up-to-date parsed data (with the parser running in the background while EQ was running). He would then open the help window and see that fresh data.<br />
<br />
He had tested the concept by rewriting the help file HTML to display some recipes. However, modifying the help file before the game is started requires you to circumvent the patcher in order to run the game with your modified help file.<br />
<br />
Knek petitioned to check (the smart thing to do) and got the response doing stuff like that was not allowed. He was not specific about what made it not allowed, but I would think it is more likely the problem was with how he built his solution than that it was used to show recipes.<br />
<br />
What is shown here is not a change in a Verant patched file, and not something updated dynamically while EQ is running, just a static texture applied to one window of a custom skin. I have not (yet) heard of anyone getting in trouble for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Restyn</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm lost here too. There seems to be no problem with us printing off 146 pages of recipes to have in hand, but putting them into a window ingame suddenly makes things wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AddoPovar</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you allow alt-tab, you can check webpages with the info, but you can also perform other actions. The restriction on alt-tab is not there to stop recipereading.<br />
<br />
I did not say anything was wrong with the act of putting the recipes into a window ingame, it is how you do it that matters... The UI mod shown here uses an approved feature of the new UI, custom images in skins. It should therefore be totally OK to do.<br />
<br />
You mentioned that you at EQtraders had found recipes in game to be not OK, and I made an assumption as to what thread you were talking about over there. The solution which was used in that thread was based on replacing the info in the Verant-patched Help file. The fact that it required you to bypass the patcher is what makes it wrong, in my eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Restyn</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok ... I'm with you now. Man, I feel like “the slow cousin”<br />
<br />
So, modifying is okay, so long as we modify certain files and not others. Is there a list or post that outlines what ones are off-limits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Maxelbetel</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... lets try this. <br />
<br />
The help file is in the /everquest/help directory.  It is &quot;part of the game&quot; sort to say.  Editing this is no different than editing the eqgame.exe to, say, give you sow speed or whatever.<br />
<br />
The UI files (including the background) is in /eq/uifiles/&amp;lt;UI&gt; directory - which verant has pretty much said we can modify at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Restyn</div><div class="date">08-13-02, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very well put.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Will the files be overwritten with a patch program?<br />
Help directory will be.  UIFiles wont.  It is easy enough to add a tab or something to an existing window, and just add the recipes as text.  I might actually getting around to doing it one day.
