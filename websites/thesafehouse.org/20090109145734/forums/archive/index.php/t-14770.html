<br />
When the hero thing comes up, I click and nothing happens.  What gives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">10-16-04, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you examine your spells/abilities you'll see each one has a second icon.  Those are for heroic oportunities.  When an oportunity pops up it will have one or more icons around the outside of the ring.  If the next spell/ability that goes off is one of those icons then it will start the chain.  The chain will show a larger ring with one or more icons on it and a countdown timer (the outside of the ring).  If you manage to activate all the icons then the special effect (extra damage, group buff, group heal, etc) will occur.<br />
<br />
Caveats: The first ring will be cancelled if any spell or ability other than the one shown is used.  When you manage to get a chain started, your hotkey bar icons will flash if they are required for the chain.  If the chain has a green coin next to it, scouts can &quot;reroll&quot; the chain and possibly get a better chain.<br />
<br />
As I recall, the icons are all color coded, red for mages, gold for clerics, blue for fighters, and ummm some other color for scouts.<br />
<br />
Hope this is what you were asking about, otherwise ignore me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-16-04, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the first heroic opportunity for scouts will be Quick Strike to Evade then back to Quick Strike, which I found was great for taking down yellow bears on the starter island.<br />
<br />
I haven't quite understood why sometimes I'll get swindler's luck (an attack buff) and other times I'll get the damage shot.  I guess I'll actually have to read the instructions :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">10-17-04, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Supposedly each opening has 3 chains; a common, an uncommon, and a rare.  I've never seen the &quot;rare&quot; one off the starter scout chain so that may be wrong information.  I saw it in a player post, not a dev post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-17-04, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice when combat mechanices are based on things like, common uncommon and rare, aint it?  :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">10-17-04, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">scouts can change which will happen, when you see a coin on the wheel(maybe attached to it and not in the inside) you can use a coin based skill to alter it from one effect to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-17-04, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've clicked the coin and the next time I unleash the chain it goes back to Ringing Blow (from Swindler's Luck), but for me it doesn't do it right when I click on the green coin to choose which heroic opportunity I actually want to use.<br />
<br />
It's annoying when I do Swindler's Luck, then the next time I have a heroic opportunity it does another Swindler's Luck (which just refreshed the timer on the buff).  So far combat is entertaining though (and I'm only level 8).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don´t click the coin, just use another skill which has the coin-symbol, for instance the &quot;stun&quot; skill (forgot name) and it will revert chain to Ringing Blow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">10-18-04, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, I see.  So I start with Quick Strike, go for an Evade then if it pops up Swindler's Luck, instead of going for Quick Strike do one of the other two (Dirty Trick and another one I forget) to change the opportunity then go for Quick Strike.</div></div><hr />

Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy weapon towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.</div></div><hr />
