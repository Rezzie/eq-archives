Episode one looks very Spike TV-ish.  :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">01-04-07, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's more anime than anything, so I'll move it there.<br />
<br />
I watched it the other day; pretty interesting concept, and I like the graphical style.  Instead of watching it online you can also catch it on Spike TV tonight, as it looks to air three times in the span of a couple hours.<br />
<br />
Concept of the show is there are two headbands, the Number 1 headband and the Number 2 headband.  Only the Number 2 can challenge the Number 1 for his headband (supposed to become god-like with the Number 1 headband), but anybody and everybody can challenge the Number 2.</div></div><hr />

As opposed to Nocte I didnt care much for the art style.  Actually made me think of a gory Fat Albert episode. :b<br />
<br />
I agree it is very Spike-ish though.  Testosterone flows in rivers in that series.<br />
<br />
If you love this series you would probably like JoJo's Bazzare Adventure as well.<br />
Just as macho filled.</div></div><hr />
