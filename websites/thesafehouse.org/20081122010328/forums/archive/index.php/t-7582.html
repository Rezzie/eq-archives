<br />
Couple of quick questions...I have played on Bertoxx since Dec 99 and feel it is about time I tried a PVP Server...my question is...What is the atmosphere like...from a low level characters perspective on thru the levels...and which PVP servers have the most history..(ie: Dark vs Light wars...and other such things)...is the roleplayin aspect that much more evident on these servers?  I am really interested in some of your opinions on this, because at the end of this month my forced leave of absence ends and I will return to EQ...I really want to give PVP a shot and would love to know which servers offer the best experience..thanks for your time and replies..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Cylant</div><div class="date">06-03-01, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vallon and Tallon are basicly PvP driven servers from what i understand.<br />
Rallos is basicly a normal server with the added feature of PKs and PKing.  Playing on rallos for the sole purpose of killing people is pretty booring in my opinion.<br />
<br />
So if you're out to completely ignore the normal game and just do some hardcore roleplaying and killing - stick to vallon or tallon.  If you want to play the normal game but be able to PvP to solve conflicts and maybe start a few.. go to rallos.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole PvP server atmosphere.. it's great.  I learned more about the game in two levels on rallos than i did in twenty on my first server.. e'ci.  You have to pay a bit more attention to what you're doing on PvP servers.. and i like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lisboa</div><div class="date">06-03-01, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Sindrachh, this will probably be moved to the arena, hope you find it... anyway, a couple months ago I left Bertoxx to play on Vallon.  I had gotten up to level 9 on Rallos as well.  Apparently Vallon was more of a purist team server in the beginning.  Now it is fairly evenly divided between purists and light vs. dark players and random gankers.  <br />
<br />
   Roleplaying on Vallon is not as much as I had hoped for, but it is definitely better than Bertoxx.  There's a real sense of comradery when you fight alongside members of your team, and you will likely never forget the first time you are attacked or the first victory against another player.  Another interesting thing is there are a lot more European players, as well as a lot more intelligence casters.  <br />
  Twinking on Vallon is definitely present and is more discouraging than on Bertoxx, especially when it's your enemy--be glad that deleveling is gone now.  Don't be discouraged though, there are plenty of fresh penniless characters, veterans of bluebies or just newbies, on Vallon though.  And if you are a skilled player, you will know how where to hunt to get money fast and you will know the best buys that will make you well suited for both P v E and P v P (i.e. bloodstained mantle, DRT, cloak of the ice bear, etc.... if you saw my SK you'd think I was twinked, but I just bought judiciously).  The Warrens is truly fantastic for low levels.  Prices on Vallon are not as messed up as on Bertoxx (items are generally the same price as the average low prices on websites with less deflation to the low end ones), though Velious items are slower coming into the economy due to the server population.  (You'll notice that Vallon has many more exotic items than Bertoxx--lots of masks of obernation around).  The human team has no real economy however, so if you are on that team, I recommended you get by as long as you can and then create a mule to trade in Faydark.  <br />
   I have played up to level 18, and made an enchanter who is now up to 9, both on the human team.  If you start in the Qenyos area, P v P is quite rare except for the random raider (or unless you are not human team, then you will get plenty of P v P).  The Commons and WFP has plenty of P v P and I have killed many, many dark elves there.  There are plenty of high level teammates that are generous and will help out nontwinks with fine steel weapons, split paw tunics, or bronze weapons for selling.  Three of my characters have received gifts more generous than what you'd get in Bertoxx, without requesting freebies.  <br />
<br />
  As for Rallos, I played an ogre shaman there and got into P v P encounters only three times.  Basically how much newbie P v P you encounter depends on where you start.  Joining a guild is probably more important there.  Rallos had less twinking, as i remember, but that was a long time ago.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Luvarin</div><div class="date">06-04-01, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive played on Tallon for a bit now. Came back to EQ after a 7 month break and started on Tallon. What I hear about Rallos is they're against pvp. On Tallon some people will play light races versus the dark race, while other &quot;light&quot; teams will player kill any other team they see. Pvp on Tallon isn't automatic, in other words it's easy enough to avoid if you don't want to do it at some point, but there's always a chance of getting into a fight. Personally, I enjoy it most of the time, however, it can stop you from some goals and PVE can be a bit tougher.</div></div><hr />
