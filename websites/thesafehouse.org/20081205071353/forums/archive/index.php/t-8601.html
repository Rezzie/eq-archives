When he does, kill him. This will spawn Valdanov Zevfeer, the man you need, in the center of the balcony. Stays up for about 15 minutes and then poofs if nobody aggros him.<br />
     As for resisting his lifetap, it's probably possible since you can resist the normal vampyre tap, but given that it's 1k per tap on Valdanov you may not want to go experimenting either. He's killable with one good group without going to the trouble of getting your MR up.</div></div><hr />

Currently I am at scowl to the quest giver and other NPCs in his room, as well as Nathyn Illuminous.</div></div><hr />

Bard friend's been trying to get him for couple months but even kiting him around he despawns inside half an hour tops.</div></div><hr />

I was KoS, because of Lcea kills with my guild, then we started killing in Houses for reports and shards or Arxx key... I went from KoS to indifferent with one Head of House kill for shard for Arxx key. Mind you, I have become very unpopular in Seru...! So, if you are planning to do Sigil Earring quest, do the first two parts BEFORE you trash your Seru faction, easier to do them. You can do them in KoS in Seru but more of pain.<br />

All of the people you need to talk to, minus I think the guy in Netherbian, are on either neutral or some katta faction.  The guy in Netherbian you can just charm and do that part of the quest.</div></div><hr />
