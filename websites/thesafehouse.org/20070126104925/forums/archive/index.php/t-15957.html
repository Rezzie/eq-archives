<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">12-02-04, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished the poison quest last night and am wondering if I need the flare gun and whistle for anything else.  I have banked them at the moment, but as I don't envision going back that way anytime soon, they seem pretty pointless. <br />
Also, after running out to Taren Mill and getting &quot;cured&quot;, I got a potion to counter the poison.  Am I supposed to keep this for anything or is it just for general use if I come across the poison again?<br />
<br />
I must say that I did have fun last night.  I had already done all the killing and had the head from the NPC at the top of the tower, however at the time my picklock skill was not high enough due to server crash/character roll back (lost nearly 30 skill after crash).  So I climed to the top of the tower, &quot;sapped&quot; the guy, picked the chest, grabbed the loot, ran down the stairs and jumped from the ledge to the gable, from the gable to the ground.  Ran off into the sunset, leaving several irate NPC's.  It all felt very Cat Burglarish.</div></div><hr />

I doubt you need the whistle, but I've kept mine so far.  you don't need poison cure, you didn't even need it in the first place if you have an anti venom poison.  I cured the poison with a basic potion right away.</div></div><hr />
