Gokujo Seitokai (Best Student Council) I somewhat liked the series in a mediocre series kind of way if that makes any sense.</div></div><hr />

I know school series seem to be all the rage, but GS is very Japanese. I don't see there being a whole lot of market for that type of series, but who knows?</div></div><hr />

I actually enjoyed it a lot- kinda randomly picked it up on YouTube (ebil, I know, but hey, it saves me having to torrent a lot of stuff, as I'm on a 5gig/week download AND upstream limit). It was fun, and different yet similar from most of the stuff I usually watch. And the puppet is awesome :D</div></div><hr />

That's a hell of a deal. Not only that, the more people preorder the box, the less it will cost!<br />

<br />
The Japanese are funny like that. (I'm not kidding.)<br />

XXXholic TV, Ragnarok The Animation, Mushishi, Suzuka, Sakura Taisen: Le Nouveau Paris and ATASHIn'CHI are the other stuff.</div></div><hr />
