Its kinda sketchy but it soemwhat worked.<br />
<br />
Now that the game is live, I am unsure if they stealth nrefed stealth again?<br />
<br />
I seem to be visible to just about anyone of my level even after max Sneak/Hide.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alodar</div><div class="date">01-31-07, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's hard to say, especially since my (and most of the people I know) detection rate is through the roof....I mean, heck, it maxxed itself without barely trying.  So with Max detection rate, yup, they can see us super easily.  You'd think we'd have a higher detection rate than most, being masters of stealth and all, but.../shrug<br />
<br />
Dikamin, thoughts/comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilim</div><div class="date">01-31-07, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye.<br />
I don't understand the Detection thing also.<br />
It is VERY easy to max Detection without trying.<br />
<br />
You would have tought that the rogue would at least get a bonus for being sneaky /boggle.<br />
<br />
I guess we still need more info on the dynamics of it all and hopefully they improve us overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was me sitting there, waiting to gank this sorcerer, when he stops PvE'ing when the mob dies, and just waits.<br />
<br />
Turns out he cld see me :frown<br />
<br />
Absolutely negligable benefits presently for being a rogue!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnippins</div><div class="date">02-05-07, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe this is dependant by class. Maybe by characters that have a higher INT?<br />
<br />
I play on the FFA pvp server and I regularly get away from other characters by simply hitting sprint... running around a corner.. and hitting stealth. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only characters I have not seemed to fool with this yet are arcane casters, so I am assuming it is due to their high INT. <br />
<br />
<br />
**and yes, sneak/hide is maxed. :oops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vis</div><div class="date">02-06-07, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of right now, I'm pretty sure its dependent on level and probably sneak/hide detection skill.  Basically, anyone your level above can see you, below they cant.  Not much good eh?  It needs a couple of levels buffer to be of any use in PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorsauce</div><div class="date">03-07-07, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i hear about detection is that its acually NOT suposed to raise automatically when around stealthed mobs like it does.  Supposably its suposed to be a &quot;button&quot; you push every so often to raise the skill, kind of like sense heading in early EQ1.  <br />
<br />
Now i dont know if they still plan to impliment it this way one day or keep it the way it is.  I just know thats how its supposed to work.</div></div><hr />

Sense Heading for the win!!!  Oh I remember the days.</div></div><hr />

So where did you get this info?? <br />
<br />
<br />
But anyhoo guys iam working on a list of most wants and this will be the top priority for my list.Stealth in General is my highest priority to push to the Devs not only for Pvp but Pve also. I agree PVP stealth needs lotsa love</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelnozz</div><div class="date">04-09-07, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, it is kinda odd that someone knows something about a rogue skill that Dikamin doesn't know...</div></div><hr />

I havent heard that, but it would make sense for the pvp servers (though it would not be so practical for the pvm servers) if the ability had to be used to detect PCs (npcs should be detected as they currently are).<br />
<br />
Additionally, the ability should incur global cooldown to cut down on the number of people who simply loop it.<br />
<br />
That would definitely be a good first step to fix stealth on pvp servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunkface</div><div class="date">05-02-07, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i recently stopped having problems with stealth in pvp. in the past 2 or 3 weeks it has worked perfect for me in pvp. ive spent alot of time in the arena as an order rogue, and that place is crawling with shadow. yah sure higher level characters can still see me. but they have to be 4+ levels higher than me. i always use the shadow fletch. <br />
<br />
when the higher lvls attack me i just knee break them, throw dust in thier face(forget skill name). sprint away, and smoke bomb. they lose me everytime. <br />
<br />
ive even downed the caster in a group, and had the rest of the group literally run circles around me after a smoke bomb. wich is always AWESOME! pets are still broken though, and keep you in combat. so make sure you down those necros/shamans first!<br />
<br />
maxxed sneak/hide/detect btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnippins</div><div class="date">05-02-07, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok confirmed. <br />
<br />
I am lvl 36. I have the cloak from CiS, the wardship pants, and a shadow fletchette. and I can be seen by lvl 12 sorc, also was seen by a lvl 15 druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
was there a dead ally nearby them that could target you, then they could /assist off him... cause thats a bug... ;D where dead people can see stealthed people from the other team... people on your team can see you. of all lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnippins</div><div class="date">05-03-07, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no dead people. just cruddy stealth.  it's almost like stealth randomly works as intended, and then randomly doesn't even work at all. <br />
<br />
but no there were no outside forces... just straight up classes lower then me with high int seem to see thru stealth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lobo</div><div class="date">05-04-07, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, <br />
<br />
Stealth is broken in PvP couse atributes count to detection but dont count to stealth...<br />
<br />
Really...<br />
If Int and Wis helps you see things, shouldnt Dex and Int help you hide from things?<br />
I dont see that on the dex stats...<br />
<br />
If they do that stealth will be more eficient and balanced IMO...<br />
<br />
Should be an Issue to send to devs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunkface</div><div class="date">05-08-07, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you outlevel someone, they shouldnt see you, if they out level you, why shouldnt they be able to see you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you have Shadowy Flechette on and stuff. :ontome</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope...because stealth is our class...<br />
<br />
<br />
So if a sorc is 1 lvl higher then me they should be able to see me, until I am equal or greater level???  that completely kills us in pvp on anything except even or lower level players.<br />
<br />
That's like telling a sorc that if we are 1 lvl higher then them they can't cast spells on us or something.<br />
<br />
Stealth is part of our class, and part of our effectiveness in pvp as well as pve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, no it isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorceror and druid are both see invis classes.  Sorc have the spell and druids forage for see invis berries.</div></div><hr />
