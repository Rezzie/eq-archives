As my main is a paladin, that's the information I'll post in this first post, and hopefully other's can post the information for the other quests.<br />

[Mon Feb 24 21:33:36 2003] Millius Darkwater regards you indifferently -- what would you like your tombstone to say?[Mon Feb 24 21:33:42 2003] You say, 'Hail, Millius Darkwater'[Mon Feb 24 21:33:43 2003] Millius Darkwater lifts his sword out of the water at his feet and scans his eyes across you. 'Hello, Jonduval. The waters stir angrily today. Prexus is not pleased at the tarnishing of his waters by the spawn of Innoruuk. The Deepwater Knights have been trying to locate this place for many years.'[Mon Feb 24 21:33:57 2003] You say, 'what place?'[Mon Feb 24 21:33:57 2003] Millius Darkwater says 'The legends of Broken Skull Rock have been whispered for years. Indeed several of our greatest vessels were lost while in search of this island. Many of our knights died trying to cleanse Prexus' waters of this great Evil.'[Mon Feb 24 21:34:21 2003] You say, 'what knights?'[Mon Feb 24 21:34:21 2003] Millius Darkwater says 'Most recently a Cavalier named Chester Steelblade went in search of the legend. He was gone at sea for months before we received word from him. The letter we received spoke of a map that he'd found as well as a somewhat cryptic reference to having found the key to Broken Skull Rock. One of our clerics took a small group out in search of him, but we have received no news from either group.'[Mon Feb 24 21:34:50 2003] You say, 'what about the key?'[Mon Feb 24 21:34:51 2003] Millius Darkwater says 'He didn't give any more information about the key, but we're sure that he must have found something that led him here. We have found no sign of him or his crew yet. Truthfully it would be a miracle if he were still alive. I follow his path in hopes that I can continue his work where he left off. If he is dead then his spirit may yet linger here. Tied to this world by his unfinished task.'[Mon Feb 24 21:35:14 2003] You say, 'what about the clerics?'[Mon Feb 24 21:35:14 2003] Millius Darkwater says 'The cleric that went in search of Chester's crew is called Alina Crystalia and she was barely more then a student when she left. We didn't want to let her go, but ultimately we had little say in the matter. She was always very fond of Chester. She may have in fact found him, although I suspect too late to save either of them. Clerics of Prexus are required to carry with them a Deepwater Emblem to identify them, if nothing else I hope to find Alinia's emblem to return it to Erudin.'<br />

<br />
No one at PoN has provided any information about what the &quot;key&quot; conversation thread means.  The slightly easier one is from the &quot;Clerics&quot; thread.  This one suggests that Millius wants a Deepwater Emblem.  As it turns out, a Deepwater Symbol is apparently dropped in Gunthak (haven't found one myself, but others have seen it).  Unfortunately, turning it in to Millius apparently causes him to take it without saying anything (this has apparently happened even when paladins hand it in)...<br />
There's also a generic female Erudite ghost that is a rare spawn on the beach.  I've seen exactly one myself, and others have reported it as well.  It cons indifferent, and does not respond to hails.  After hailing it multiple times, I killed the one I found to see if it would drop anything, but didn't find anything.  Its possible that its tied to the quest, although since it doesn't respond to hails, and doesn't appear to drop anything, I'm clueless.<br />

Under the water in Gunthak there is &quot;an impassive sea spirit&quot; when hailed by my shaman he asked me if I wanted to know how to be free of emotion and asked me if I [dare to learn].<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare to learn&quot; (well duh)<br />
<br />
Then he asks for me to bring him something that was empty, something that in turn brought emptyness to its user.<br />
<br />
I tried giving him some alcohol (wich he took from me without response. Damn drunkard spirits). But then I re-read what he asked for and since he asked for something that was itself empty.  I wanted to try giving him one of those broken bottles that the broken skull like using for weapons or perhaps an empty bottle. More likely though, there is a no-drop item out there that would do the job. <br />

<br />
Head east off the rock to the beach.  There is a tunnel leading up from the back of the beach which has a fork left to a fort.  Take that fork left, then kill the multi race mauraders, pillages and other piratey sounding names until a nodrop &quot;deepwater emblem&quot; drops.<br />
<br />
Take this emblem back to Millius, he hands over &quot;Alina's emblem&quot; and will say to find Alina's spirit in the zone somewhere.<br />
<br />
She is actually &quot;erudite spirit&quot; (female form) and spawns at neg 840, neg 675, beside a shipwreck on the beach.  She is a random spawn on a 20 min timer.  Her PH is a savage pirate skeleton (I think, I posted this on allakhazam, but I can't access the page to check)  <br />
<br />
My 48 cleric duoed with a 44 pally to kill the mobs for the DW emblem, and the PH is green to 48. 2 banish undeads and change dispatches the PH.<br />
<br />
Hand Alina's emblem to theerudite spirit, she speaks and hands over Spell: Temperance.<br />
<br />
I have heard rumours, but havent checked myself yet, but if you do back and speak to Millius after getting bgeo, he'll speak of the other cleric spell.</div></div><hr />
