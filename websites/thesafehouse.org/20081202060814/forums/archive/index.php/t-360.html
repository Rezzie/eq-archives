<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Turlo</div><div class="date">06-03-00, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, some days, I just can't figure people out.  I was hanging around in Freeport, and I ran by an enchanter who was soloing guards.  Ok, big deal.  Happens all the time.  I walked into a store to sell some stuff, and this enchanter walks up to me, and challenges me to a duel.<br />
<br />
I peered at him, curious as to why.  No words were ever exchanged.  I wandered off...or so he thought.<br />
<br />
While hidden around the corner, i secretly applied poison to my blades.  The punk enchanter attacks another guard, and I let him use up a bit of his mana, he rooted the guard...and all of a sudden...<br />
<br />
Turlo backstabs you for 130 damage.  (Blast, not one of my better ones).  Guard breaks his root, and this enchanter starts to worry.  He is blasting me like crazy...or trying.  Every spell was interrupted except one or two...and he somehow managed to charm a guard to attack me.  But he was mine...<br />
<br />
Turlo defeats Lonan in a duel to the death.  Lonan flees like a cowardly dog.<br />
<br />
Since I don't kill guards as I value my faction, I zoned right after him.  On the other side, his health bar was about 1/2 of a bubble, if that.<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;What who you challenge to a duel in the future.  You have no clue what I am capable of.&quot;<br />
<br />
This fool says, &quot;Ass&quot; then challenged me again, and hits me with a /rude.<br />
<br />
I don't think he would expect I would accept it.  Man, I lit him up in seconds.<br />

<br />
One note...he probably didn't charm a guard to attack you, guards will attack people dueling by them. If you were closer, you were the victim, for however much it affected you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">06-04-00, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he did charm it, because, if I followed the story, the 'chanter was already engaged with a guard, and one would think that he'd be KoS, or close to...And you have to be like indiff or better for a guard to defend you... &quot;I'm not dumb. I just have a command of thoroughly useless information.&quot; -- Calvin &amp; Hobbes by Bill Watterson</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">06-05-00, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, faction (and class) play a big role in it. When I was low level, I remember a time when a bunch of PK's found out I was a Halfling Rogue in Qeynos; they also knew the guards wouldn't defend me. So I eventually had to keep zoning to the sewers behind Crow's, then zone back and go hide out underground in Crow's. Heh, it sure is nice having your guild leader down there, because then you learn where all the secrets are early on :p<br />
<br />

Despite the fact that they are insanely powerful and useful, again stressing that we will have to be very careful implementing poison to insure that we don't severly overpower them, there are still a LOT of people out there who think that rogues are useless.- Abashi</div></div><hr />
