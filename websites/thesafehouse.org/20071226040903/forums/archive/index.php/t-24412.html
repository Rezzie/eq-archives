<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I am looking for another series to watch because I don't have enough to watch as it is.<br />
<br />
I like Naruto, Bleach, Ghost in the Shell (Gotta get me some box sets I think), and Blood + is cool too.<br />
<br />
I like the kinda out there stuff in Naruto (the special moves and such) yet DBZ got on my nerves after a while (He who grunts/yells/screams the loudest or grows his hair the longest while chaning hair color wins, also 10 minutes of previous episode recpas sucks.  So in a big fight you have 10 minute recap, 9 minutes of commercials, 5 minutes of yelling and that leaves 6 minutes to get **** done.  Screw that)<br />
<br />
I also like GitS because the animation is top notch and the technology stuff they use is cool (cloaking, bad ass guns, wirelessly linked encoded neural network).<br />
<br />
So yeah, in between Bleach and Naruto (the two I watch mainly these days) I need some more stuff to fill the void left on every other night of the week apart from when the new episodes are out.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Black Lagoon. It's awesome and has action in every episode and of course it's awesome. Did I mention the awesome factor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You seem action-oriented, so the standard recommendations would be Fighting Spirit, which you are guaranteed to like after at least 5 episodes (also known as Hajime no Ippo), Berserk, Fullmetal Alchemist.<br />
<br />
If there are other genres you're interested in, let me know. Don't let the fact Hajime no Ippo is a boxing anime put you off, it's AWESOME because it's a Boxing anime. You all love Rock Lee of Naruto, I'm sure. Because of his melee combat style. You get that, but much more intense and prolonged in Hajime no Ippo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PUT THEM BACK IN THEIR OWN WORLD DAMMIT!  They could have kept going with the series :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">05-17-06, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">.hack/SIGN maybe? Can't say how much action it has though, only seen the first episode so far :)<br />
<br />
One Piece has some good action too as far as I saw, although it's probably less than Naruto or Bleach (I might be wrong on that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-18-06, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you like Naruto and Bleach and you aren't watching One Piece, you are retarded.<br />
<br />
It takes awhile to get good, but there are aloooooot of episodes.  So there's alooooooot of good.<br />
<br />
Alot of people don't like the art style, or think it's not so great at first.  The art never really gets better, but you don't care after awhile.  If by the end of the Arlong arc(ep 44) you aren't hooked on the series, you've got brain damage.</div></div><hr />

.hack//SIGN is an EXTREMELY slow-paced series. People looking for an action fix will be disappointed.<br />
 <br />
Remeber: When discussing One Piece on the Safehouse, we are referring to the fansubbed version. NOT THE ENGLISH DUB. And yes, One Piece is a bit different than most action anime- it is presented in a more 'epic yet comedic' style where reality takes a back seat to the storytelling.</div></div><hr />
