I couldn't find a better place to post this becuase I didn't see a vanguard specific forum but I would like to welcome you all to check out our guild Ferocia (http://www.guilduniverse.com/ferocia/forums.aspx) . <br />
<br />
A little bit of who we are: <br />
<br />
Ferocia is a guild for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes. We are a well organized, goal oriented guild whose basic core function will be to emphasize a strong community and build respect on the server we will be playing on. We will strongly encourage a guild first attitude. That is to say, helping out your fellow guild members should always come before helping those outside the guild. A guild is only as strong as its weakest member and therefore if every member in the guild focuses on making its members stronger than the outcome is a cohesive, finely tuned machine. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The officers that make up the leadership of Ferocia all have experience in MMOs some of the most popular being Everquest, DAOC, Everquest 2, FFXI, SWG, WoW, Shadowbane, and Lineage 2. We have a firm opinion that many of the games that have come out recently have all fallen short in comparison to the success of Everquest. It is our opinion that Vanguard will be the next huge success in the MMO genre. And we want to be prepared to help build a successful Vanguard community. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it sounds like we would fit into your style of play then feel free to join us on our forums at: <br />

<br />
I bumped this over to the Logged Out Forums where we discuss games that have yet to be released. A Vanguard section of the site is in the works, however.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkefang</div><div class="date">07-22-05, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does one prove their organizational skills in regards to a game that won't be out for 2 years or more?  And doesn't every guild claim to have a &quot;guild-first,&quot; and &quot;goal-oriented&quot; philosophy?  Aside from the Flowers of Happiness, pretty much every guild says something similar.  The reality may or may not be be the same.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to be negative, but I'm pretty cynical, and I know a lot of the MMO veterans here are as well.  You are going to have to give more info than some generic MMO guild description to even motivate us to click on that home page link.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not the first Vanguard guild recruitment post I've seen. I hope the game lives up to the hype, but I cannot envision the possibility of attaching myself to a guild full of people whose reputations, abilities, and playstyle I have no way of checking beforehand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scotius Lomond</div><div class="date">07-22-05, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have just &quot;officially&quot; started the guild yesterday so now we are trying to get our name out there and get the ball rolling. What can you do in a pre-release guild? Hang out and talk it up some but also as more and more info is released and beta draws nearer you can start planning things, getting things into action so when the game releases you can be solid. <br />
<br />
You also want a good amount of time so that guild members can become aquanted with one another, feel comfortable with one another, and then start to get a real good feel for how we will fit together and make this guild its best.<br />
<br />
I joined an EQ2 guild 2 years before EQ2 hit the shelves. We had a blast during pre-release. We had alot of guild game nights during that time too. We would play CS, Literati, isketch and what not, which is something that I would love to get going once we are grounded. When EQ2 hit the shelves we knew exactly who we were, what we wanted and we got it done and had a blast doing it. We became the number one guild on our server, hitting guild level 30 first on the server.<br />
<br />
I left EQ2 a few months back because it just wasn't what I was looking for. I felt that the game was rather restrictive. And what I was actually looking for was a game that was as addictive as EQ but modern. This is what I feel Vanguard is going to bring to the MMO community.<br />
<br />
I feel that giving 7-9 months or whatever before a game is released will be an excellent opportunity to get a guild and its members ready. This way when the game comes out we can have alot of fun and hit our guild goals, what ever they may be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll be the drunk guy fending off vanguard fanbois, infuriated by my &quot;WTF boobies, yo&quot; political leanings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scotius Lomond</div><div class="date">07-22-05, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I SO wish that I could make it out to Vegas for the fanguard!  However, I live in NH so it would be a bit of a hit to the purse :(</div></div><hr />
