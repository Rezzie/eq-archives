<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axian-OoP</div><div class="date">12-23-04, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah... Kinda lame... but I got addicted to making my house nice..  so I need lots of stuff to put in there...  Any quests that give Items that you can place in your home please list them here.  Thanks in advance :)<br />
<br />
Also I was wondering if there were any quests that reward you with a House Pet?  I/E/ a cat, pig, duck, rat...etc<br />
<br />
The Molar collection quest in Fallen Gate (Collect 3 molars - Silver, Gold &amp;amp; Platinum) rewards you with a scroll you can add to you house...<br />
<br />
(I'll post more when I find them - any help here would be greatly appreciated :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrocat Moonstalker</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A very easy one, in the erudite ghetto in Qeynos (forgot the name). There's a  kitty and a little girl, and all you have to do is talk to one or two people in the zone (I'm sorry most of the details escape me) and you get a cage for a pet as a reward to place in your home.<br />
<br />
Another is the &quot;Know Your Gnolls&quot; gnoll mastery quest. Fairly easy, it starts in Antoinca, at gnollslayer keep. Click a glowly chest and it gives you the know your gnolls book. Simply kill a fuckton of gnolls and collect tail/tooth/paw/eye .etc. Reward is a ton of exp, a book to place in your house, and a halbred to place in your house. It's called the gnollslayer or something similar, the description is cute &quot;Yip! Yip! Thunk&quot;.<br />
<br />
One more book quest, &quot;The Flood of Blackburrow&quot;. I believe it starts with a dropped book called, you guessed it, the flood of blackburrow. Read it and complete the tasks, it basically requires you to kill 5-10 of almost every type of mob in blackburrow, but the exp is nice. Final reward, exp, coin(?) and a book to place in your house &quot;The Flood of Blackburrow&quot;, detailing one barbarians treck accross bb in ye olden days.</div></div><hr />

I did that Kryssa quest back when I was still figuring out the game..<br />
<br />
Didn't know what the keg was for so I destroyed it :(<br />
<br />
Wish I hadn't, now that I know what its for.<br />

Also got a chair from somewhere I can not remember. All the Lore and Legend quests result in a book and weapon you can place in your house.
