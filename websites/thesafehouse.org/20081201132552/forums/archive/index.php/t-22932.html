I'd say that Tharashk fits best with a roguely theme based on a post from the WotC forums on Eberron detailing all the houses<br />
<br />
House Tharashk<br />
Race: Humans and Half-orcs<br />
DragonMark: The Mark of Finding<br />
House Tharask mostly works across Khorvaire as inquisitives, prospectors and bounty hunters. Finding resources, dragonshards and people for the right price.</div></div><hr />

Coincidentally, Effsee and I have made the same agreement... myself being the rogue, of course.</div></div><hr />

I'll see you in about 2 minutes. With a sledgehammer. Don't expect to be able to move your legs for a while.</div></div><hr />

COFFEE MUGS (http://www.offlinetshirts.com/cgi-bin/ol/gaming/mmorpg.cgi/fantasy/atshirtnexus/20547)... yeah. We rox.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure if it'll work but... if you're playing DDO, please get a few alts tossed into the guild, I'm not sure if multiple characters from the same account will count towards the 25 needed for the founder's guild head item or recognition on the DDO website, but every little bit helps, so donate a couple character slots on Tharashk if at all possible... it'll make baby Jebus happy!</div></div><hr />
