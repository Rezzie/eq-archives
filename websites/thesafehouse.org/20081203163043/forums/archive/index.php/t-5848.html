<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HinterDir</div><div class="date">08-02-01, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks to a multiple guild effort (about 60 people involved) the General was owned 4 times on SolRo this evening.<br />
The bastard just refused to give up that stupid quil even one time  (<br />
<br />
thanks all who helped<br />
4 Robes to go now!<br />
<br />
P.S.: one attempt sadly failed as Drozzee was agroed while he pushed the trade button, box lost  ( <br />
After the last General we did some testing with copper pieces and it seemed totaly random wether one gets agroed or not. Screw Verrant!<br />
If he needs any help redoing all the parts and than General once more, he can be sure i will do everything within my possibilities to aid him on that.  <br />

i thought i had told you earlier this week when it will happen?<br />
<br />
had some chaotic things going on prior to and early in the event so i forgot about checking who i missed :o(<br />
<br />
i will try and make up for that by inviting you to come when i finaly turn all the parts in to Stanos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HinterDir</div><div class="date">08-03-01, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i forgot to mention an advise (lol)<br />
<br />
here it is:<br />
<br />
make sure to bring as many Eru/DE/Hum/Iks SK and 2HS capable lvl 1 with you as you plan on Generals to spawn.<br />
<br />
We only had 1 DE SK and 4 Ashenbone shields as well as 4 ElegantDarkwood Katanas. (Along with some Mithril Daggers and such) <br />
<br />
One might imagine, a lvl 63 mob would drop something usefull once in a while but plan on beeing disappointed ;o)<br />
<br />
/em puts his Darkwood Katana next to his Ceremonial Wedding Sword in a special place of his Bank</div></div><hr />
