<br />
I have come to try to get us to convice the other people to start to hunt in LGuk again.  (That is the ones who still play, OT, DSP, etc).  I played there for less than an hour tonight, 30-45 mins and got one bubble of xp in 33, I know its low and thats probably normal.  But not only was it fast, it was FUN, and that is what this game is about.  I want us rogues, and you other classes to do a few things ^_^.<br />
<br />
1) When someone asks for a place to hunt for 30ish-50ish, suggest LGuk!  Tell them how fun it is and how it makes you a better player.  And throw in the xp.<br />
<br />
2) Tell them how to get there, and basic tips for hunting in dungeons so they don't die.<br />
<br />
This would be fun and bring back a great zone.<br />
<br />
Thanks, I hope we can get this done! ^_^<br />

<br />
LGUK is still ok.....but it has no XP bonus because it was overused at the time being one of 2 places to get good loot/xp.<br />
<br />
I can think of many better places to get xp/loot now.</div></div><hr />

Esp for higher levs, it's all PoP now, Nobody wants to go anyplace else cause the exp is so freaking obsurd inPoP.<br />
<br />
Players will choose the zones with the best exp/loot and nobody can change this but VI/SOE. Jondalar / Yaquin / Kelwan <br />
