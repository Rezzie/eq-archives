<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The experiment was thus, if I make a Dragonball Z inspired hero, how long would it take before I get called an anime fag?<br />
<br />
Character creation gave me everything I needed.  Spikey yellow hair, blue tights, white armor, little targeting doohickey over one eye and of course, a monkey tail.  Name the guy Saiyan Soldier and away I go!<br />
<br />
The answer to my original question was this:  About 10 seconds.  Yes indeed, thats how long I was in the tutorial before someone turned around and called me a &quot;****ing anima ****!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Time well spent I say!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surprisingly, you can make a fairly accurate pretty sammy replica. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's hilarious though about the anime.  :)</div></div><hr />

Indeed there is my good man! /ignore<br />
<br />
I love it so.<br />
<br />
Now if only I could figure out how to turn off channels such as Broadcast and Request.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pearll</div><div class="date">05-17-04, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, if you're a true DBZ freak, you make your character's hair spikey and black (or whatever other color you want).  Then you wait until level 10 and make a super group, choosing two shades of gold as the colors.<br />
<br />
Your character should also be an energy blaster, that way you can make your battle cry &quot;Kamehameha&quot;.<br />
<br />
Or, if you're like this one guy I saw, you can make your character Captain Ginyu...<br />

<br />
and the only reply was &quot;lol....so gay&quot;</div></div><hr />

The least he coulda done is be consistant with the Majin Vegeta thing =P   Aaaanyway. To each his own i always say. Let his playing judge him. He did pretty well too</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh. Not at all. My swashbuckler personna almost never fails to save a damsel in distress, no matter how grey...or how purple the enemy. Though in the latter case, I just give them time to run before getting the hell out of there myself.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda like how we had to &quot;tactically retreat&quot; near the hospital when the Tsoo showed up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol Sab...that is part of the reason it's taken me so long to get to lvl 12.  i rescue just about every purse-snatching victim I see.  I've even turned around a full minute after I saw the crime and gone back to help because my conscience got to me.  <br />
<br />
I just love saving the day.  As my battle cry shows, &quot;Leroy Green don't cop out when there's trouble all about!&quot;   :)</div></div><hr />
