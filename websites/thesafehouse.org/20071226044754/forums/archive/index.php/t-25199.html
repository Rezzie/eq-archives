Can you say kickarse when it comes out.. And also this looks like the main character of the offline play and *maybe* online play will definitely take off with after Vol.4 Cause one of the vids on the right side shows what looks like Kite all fully badarse and all when he does some transfiguration.<br />
<br />
And also on another note .hack//dusk anime... WTH i heard the book was not kid friendly needless to say im no kid *more like pre-20 yr old (19 for those who dont know what i mean)*<br />
<br />
But i am rushing out to all the gamestore's atm trying tog et a release date. hopefully for USA it will be a few months after the PS3 release for which it is going to be on =)</div></div><hr />

They made .hack//Fragment a PS3 title? Damn they said PS2 =/ oh well.<br />
<br />
.hack//dusk was our legend of the twilight bacelet right? If so it did have suggestive themes in them but nothing i would call really bad.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the book of .hack//dusk is pretty bad at times...I do think they tend to get a little more graphic in it. Dunno why tho.</div></div><hr />
