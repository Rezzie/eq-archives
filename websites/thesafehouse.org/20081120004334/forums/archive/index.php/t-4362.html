<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-16-03, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's been a long two weeks for me since FXI came out. Many sleepless nights, cups of coffee, and confused pizza delivery men have been my company. But in that time, I've found a new enjoyment for a MMOG that I haven't had since the Velious days of EQ. <br />
<br />
I should probably warn you, you shouldn't expect anything revolutionary out of FFXI. There will be many references and comparisons to EQ. The game is about a year old(released first in Japan), and it follows your typical MMO layout that we are all familiar with. But it accells in areas that other companies only tinkered in, polishing and refining certain aspects of the game so that they run very smoothly. Here's da break down:<br />
<br />
GRAPHICS:<br />
While not ground breaking, the graphics for FFXI are very pretty, and thoughtfully designed. The textures and models each have that attention to detail that the japanese are so famous for. The light effects, lens flares from the sun, seamless changing of weather conditions, all blend together to give you a very visually immersive feel. The city textures are intresting, looming, and worth looking at. The very japanese over the top spell effects combine and over lay quite nicely, colorfully, and do not need to be turned down turning semi-to large gatherings to keep your FR up. The animations are fluid and clean. About my only gripe with the graphics is that there seems to be a small pool of enemy models. So far I've seen only 9 or so different enemy models, out of the 2 regions and 9 or 10 areas I've visited. Somewhat disappointing.<br />
<br />
<br />
SOUND:<br />
In my opinion, the sound for FFXI is fanstastic. People's armor clinks as they run, the wet ground beneath your feet sloshs, the sand sighs as you run through it. The music is pleasant, and well orchestrated, if a little redundant, but that is too be expected. When the ambient sound mixes with the great looking levels, it only adds to the immersive feel of the game.<br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY:<br />
<br />
Ok, the nitty gritty. As I mentioned earlier, there is nothing earth shattering about FFXI in design. The treadmill is there, in force. Grinding xp is a favored past time in FFXI. However, unlike EQ, there are multitudes of very visible quests and challenges for players to engage in if they want to take a break from grinding. After lvl 5, many players notice that they die a lot more soloing, the game definetly increases in diffculty from 5 to 10 as newb players start facing harder monsters. However, once you pass 14th, groups become much more frequent. The xp system however, is balanced to lean towards grouping that soloing. The value of xp that you get for killing a certain difficulty of monster never changes, even though your level requirement does. Soloing will inevitably take longer, and longer, and longer to do as you go up in levels. Still, most people can solo for some kind of xp, small as it maybe, which already puts your flexibility in FFXI above EQ.<br />
<br />
But what about the job system you ask? One of the really big problems with EQ was, once you had a character, you were stuck with 'em! Sick of your druid at 30? Sell everything and retwink a new character. FFXI took a different approach. Being able to switch your primary job at any time, while keeping your original character, can be a big benefit in time, money, and effort. No more whining from people about their job being useless, because the player has the freedom to switch at any time. But, re-leveling in a new job is no cake walk either, all weapons, armors, spells, and items have level limits, firstly to stave off massive twinking, second to give you a reason to make use of everything you run across. I can't count the number of items I came across or could reasonably afford in EQ that were worthless compared to the lvl 35 dropped weapon I got at lvl 15 that I used for 1/2 my career. <br />
<br />
About the jobs. Each job has active-passive traits, and activated job skills. These are the bread and butter of a class for most people, particularly non-spell users. The acquisition rate of them is rather slow, meaning you have few real &quot;skills&quot; in use. For me, this tends to simplify what your character can and will do, it sort of dumbs down the game play IMO, considering all the abilities and noncombat versatility EQ offered a Rogue. But, never the less, each ability you acquire is a substantial upgrade in power and desireablity, and it definely keeps you wanting to gain levels.<br />
There are a variety of jobs to pick from, all the jobs you hoped were there pretty much are. Ninja, dragoon, samurai, summoner(no blue mage, damnit!). The ability to combine jobs together offers a huge range of combinations for you to play. While you won't be unique in every zone looking for a group, there won't be 7 exact copies of your class in every zone, and there will never be a &quot;useless&quot; job. Still can't do anything about stupid people, though         <br />
<br />
The zones. I've got somewhat of a love hate relationship with the zone design. I love them because, in combination with the graphics, the outdoor levels are intresting, thoughtfully designed, not like the randomly_placed_hill&amp;amp;tree_001 of EQ outdoor zones. Each area has real distinct character, from weather to geography. I actually WANT to explore new outdoor zones in FFXI. I'm just as shocked as you are.<br />
My hate. There is no z-axis interaction. You can walk up ramps, but you can't fall off them. You can climb tall buildings, but you can get off them from the top. Many intresting nooks and crannies that you'd like to go investigate, you can't. The line between wall, and ridge is very slim. There is no jump button. Objects tend to have very simple collision planes, so you tend to find the invisible wall in lots of places. All in all, it detracts from the feel of exploring an area. Kind of a bummer.<br />
<br />
Quests. Everything, I mean litterally everything that happens to you of substance involves a quest. In EQ, I spent the better half of my time trying not to talk to NPCs, I mean, what was the point? Most worthful quests were big news to everyone, and you could just buy whatever the other ones offered. Here quests(also &quot;Missions&quot; designated by your nation) are intergral to advancemenet in the story line and player power. While rewards may be somewhat lacking, most quests you can do in the lower teens and early 20s aren't hard. And they aren't particularly new either. Deliver this, fetch this, kill this. But the dialouge is intresting, and funny, cut scenes just for you makes quest doing cinematic, and the story lines weave together(more so than EQ claimed theirs did). Quests often compel you to explore places and areas, live a little dangerously. Simply put, while they didn't do much new or different(with some exceptions, expeditionary force? wtf?), FFXI has put the fun and intrest back in quest doing, at least that's how I feel, so may not agree, but it can't be denied there are a lot of them, and that a good number are actually worth doing.<br />
<br />
Other notables worth mentioning:<br />
<br />
-The auction system. You have to love the japanese, for what they can come up with. While this kind of auction system has been seen in other games somewhat, FFXI refined it, making it compact, easy to use, and very helpful. It's transworld, and allows you to have items up for sale while logged off, but delivers the sale to your own bank as well! You can view the sales history of an item for the last day, including seller and sellee. There is a blind bidding system in place, both to the benefit of sellers and buyers, so that newbies can undersell to make money, and not get bashed by egregious prices and price warring. It's ease in use makes it possible for newbies to collect crystals early in the game, sell them on the market for equipment money, and provide upper level craftsmen with buyable materials. I remember in EQ, it took me over a year to feel comfortable buying and selling, shopping for equipment in /auction. In 3 days, I was wheelin and dealin in FFXI, and now I boast some of the best equipment for my level. <br />
<br />
-The Friend System and Buddy System. Two things that many games make noises about, sometimes implement partially, but never full fill on. FFXI again, focused very intensely on this process and perfected it. You friends and buddy system is persasive through logging on and playing, updates frequently, is informative, and has a messaging system that reaches people the minute they log on, like an email. It works very well, and allows for a lot of communication.<br />
<br />
-The Party System. Again, you can tell where the game got some signifigant creative attention. Gone is the absolute need to scream your name in /shout to get groups, throwing up a lfg group flag automatically sticks you in the &quot;Find Members&quot; window you use to search for party members. And it doesn't just search the zone, it searches the entire 5 or 6 zones that comprise a region. It filters applicants by their level difference to you, +/- 2 levels. Looting is automatically set up in master pool, where you select each item item, and choose to bid or pass on it. If this is too much spam for you, or you want a ML, there is a Quarter Master function, where one person will distribute all dropped items. If you are even lazier still, you can let loot pile up in the treasure pool, and the game will randomly distribut loot to all parties members. It couldn't get any simpler.<br />
<br />
CONTROLS:<br />
<br />
I wouldn't normally mention this, but it seems to be an issue for some. Controls, because of the adaption to a PS2 controller, have some peculiarities that create a learing curve. There are many, many windows in this game that open up, and what you can and can't do changes will these windows are open. It can lead to some moments of confusion. The mouse also does not server it's traditional free look function, and it's a little jarring when you start playing. I've gotten entirely comfortable with playing totally off the keyboard though, and I think it won't present that much of a problem for people as they gain experience.<br />
<br />

MY RATING: 4 out of 5 RAGEBRINGERS<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: If you are looking to buy the MMO that will keep you busy for the next 3 years, this is not it, not yet. FFXI differs from EQ in it's staying power because, well, EQ has been there a lot longer. They've had more time to make new models, devise new skills, come up with new zones, create expansions, expand their world and offer more content. FFXI has been out somewhat over a year, and had to tackle coming TO the West, where as other companies launched and started thinking about what they could do next. As I play, I sometimes worry that I'm moving through it all at a fast pace, and I could find myself having seen it all and done it all in 6 to 7 months. I don't pay MMOs to have nothing to do at the top of the food chain. Having said that, I have high hopes. This is a really great game, and if the developers are as serious about making it big as Sony was with Everquest, FFXI has a bright, bright future. Thanks for reading.

<br />
<br />
I would disagree here. Compared to the overall amount of job/subjob combinations there are, there's almost a painfully small amount of useful combinations. For instance: Paladins. You'd think there would be a lot of good Paladin combinations, right? I mean, they have spells, give them a mage subclass for extra mana, etc. The problem? Every high-level paladin will probably be subclassed warrior, since without taunt you're a pretty useless tank, and that's what Paladins do - tank. A white mage? Take another mage class for extra mana/some bonus spells, you'll see mostly red mages and summoners as subs. Most jobs have a few useful subjobs, and a whole array of ones that you don't want to pick if you don't want to be outclassed by someone that picked the 'correct' subjob.<br />
<br />
The controls are also horrible, but that's because they were made for a console. Plug an analog gamepad in and it gets much better, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">11-16-03, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I agree there are certain combinations/jobs that aren't appropriate for the group dynamic(which is what people really rate the effectiveness of a class on in the end), they have thier perks. I can't think of a better class to solo with than Paladin/White Mage, or Red Mage/Anything. Some jobs are going to contribute a lot to the group dynamic/raid style play, some are going to contribute nothing. Thats the beauty of FFXI's job system though, if you don't have anything appropriate for the raid, switch to your combo that is! If you're having problems getting stuff done solo, take up a class that doesn't need taunt. MMOs sometimes dictate that people play certain things certain ways so they can get a party, or be part of a group, but that doesn't mean you have let that dictate your playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Random TM</div><div class="date">11-16-03, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And switching jobs (Including HP, since that's completely dictated by job) from your group config (Which will only get exp for your group config) to your solo config (which is only exp for your solo config) is inherently preferable to having different characters how? In some ways, it might be disadvantageous, since your teddy bear is a great mage, but hey, you want to play a fighter and now due to your stats you have HP of a rabbit (Not the omega rabbit). Especially since they're charging you for additional characters.<br />
<br />
It's not a bad system, and the idea of subclasses is intriguing - but it's not as good as people make it out to be, and it's not a 'no class is useless' sort of deal.<br />
<br />
Also, Ninjas are broken beyond belief and almost completely useless as a primary job. They're a good rogue subclass for the dex bonus and dual wield, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_JookaWoo</div><div class="date">11-16-03, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is why I mention PAINFULLY slow leveling times. Due to the job/sub job system, you are worthless for groups unless you have the correct combos going. When the standard leveling route is to go to 18th(20th for chocobo license) then start a sub job to be adequate for alot of groups not only makes it a grind(repeating content) but plain out boring as all get up. Getting a character to 70th + a 35th level sub job is a ridiculously long time.<br />
<br />
<br />
*EDIT* this is my only real complaint about the game, and more than likely why i wont be playing once the fees kick in. Edited by: JookaWoo at: 11/16/03 4:39 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
This means once you choose a race, you're stuck with it.  I'm by nature a power gamer, so I want a Tarutaru mage class and a Elvaan melee class, but I can't.  Kind of agravating. <br />

<br />
i just got the game this weekend,and im not sure levelling is painfully slow. THe thing i do realize,is that you must be grouped,the game is designed for groups,not solo charecters,so in that respect its painfully slow,because unless your one of the needed charecters,your odds of getting a group are a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zxing</div><div class="date">11-17-03, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think basically it's a storage issue. Look at all the character data someone that has several job combos will need stored, in relation to skills/spells/etc. It also remembers the equipment you had equiped for that particular main job, and re-equips it if it's in your inventory when you switch back.<br />
<br />
It's a lot of stuff that needs to be stored, which is most likely the extra cost for multiple characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE has never cleared inactive account data, at least not that they have told us about. They always said they would tell us if they did. The most they ever did was delete inactive level 1s. I think their subscriber base is just a *pinch* bigger than Square'.  <br />
<br />
So wait, someone explain that whole 'cancel your account, but don't lose your characters after 3-months' thing again. gnmish.gearbinder.ring.warden.sullon.zek<br />

<br />
According to FFreams (casters realm, but for final fantasy), FFXI has about 400,000 subscribers now.. 300,000 Japanese, 100,000 North American.. and EQ has about 480,000.. so you're right, EQ has just a pinch more..<br />

<br />
I think you missed the point entirely there.<br />
<br />
EQ hasn't deleted it's old characters, which means that the 1.X million people who have signed up and subsequently quit still have all their characters etc stored.<br />
<br />
The initial point was just a comparison that protests of storage space for having more than 1 character are literally absurd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and while SoE may not have deleted characters (that we know about) they say they will (Think I read that in the original manual, or on their site or something), if you let your account go on for too long without paying..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dur.  Of course they said that.  It gives them thier &quot;out&quot; clause.  Any MMORPG that doesn't have a &quot;we may or maynot delete characters after X time&quot; clause will have the players up in arms if they ever do have to delete characters (even if their reasons are good).<br />
<br />
But he's getting at the fact that the (hrm, lets use his 1mill subscribers + 480k current, all multiplied by, lets say 4 characters ( 3 average + the almost standard 1 bazaar mule))  SOE is storing close to 6k characters.  FFXI would have to store hella ammounts of info per 400k subscribers to rival that. Ninen of Saryrn<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazari</div><div class="date">05-10-04, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My comments/ observations from playing a fighter type character upto level 20 - until finally got bored with the repetition and lack of content.  Some comparisons with EQ:<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
Grouping - After lvl12 you basically need to group to get any exp - mobs you can kill solo will require a long time sitting to recover HP/Mana.  Higher level mobs will just kill you plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Like EQ you cannot do anything without a cleric or Mage (Whm/ Rdm)post lvl12 - if there are no White Mages lfg then you will sit and wait at the zone line twiddling your thumbs - this was one of the main reasons that I quit FFXI - 30 mins lfg waiting for mages to log on.  Seems everyone wants to be the hero and not the healer....<br />
<br />
Lacked content imo - especially after playing EQ for 4 years - FFXI was very flat in content.  Everything became a leveling grind with little imagination.<br />
<br />
Graphics - pretty average <br />
<br />
Advantages<br />
Trading system - really excellent auction system - you enter 7 items that you want to sell into the system, set the price and then go off fighting, also allows you to sell offline, see current trading prices, items stay on sale for 5-7 days and cash is automatically put into your account.  Also opportunities to make a market in items and look for arbitrage opportunities - I used this a lot as a noob to make cash - buy at a low price from the auction and sell to the vendors at a huge profit!!  Really hope that EQ2 sits up and puts in a system like this - surely beats hours sitting in EC reading spam or the lag hell in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Binding - outposts and guards are available at many zonelines to bind you near to zones that you are fighting in - these are really useful when travelling - it can be dangerous - so these allow you to minimise risk.<br />
<br />
No CR - on death you are fully equiped and ready to go again.<br />
<br />
In summary - it was fun for the 1st 15 levels and then got very repetitive not the game to invest lots of time imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yolos</div><div class="date">05-11-04, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on somethings but disagree on others.<br />
<br />
Grouping is one of my biggest pet peeves.  Yes, you need a healer or you will be sitting, but in what MMORPG dont you need a healer of some sort?<br />
<br />
I disagree that this game lacks content.  In fact its full of it. Majority of the quests have meaning and are tied into the storyline at some point in the game.  Some are just money/fame makers.  There are quests where if you turn in X number of items you get Y reward, but majority have a storyline involved.  If the game seemed nothing but a leveling grind in your first 20 levels, you didn't do much questing(however later on&amp;lt;post 40&gt; I do agree that there is a grind).<br />

Having only one character in game can be a pain at times, but paying $1 buck isn't going to break you.  MMORPGS are around 12-15 bucks anyway.  I think its just the thought of paying an extra dollar that makes people cringe.  If the going rate was 14.95 and they gave you two characters, most wouldn't never complain.<br />
<br />
The graphics in my opinion are quite good.  When I first started playing back when PC version came out, I was thoroughly impressed(just left SWG lag-fest).  FFXI was the first game where I saw trees move and grass/leaves blowing and it didn't bog down your fps.<br />
<br />
Lack of mob types.  Not sure I agree on this either.  Here are the beastmen types  that I know of: yagudo, orc, goblin, tonberry, Antican, and quadav.  There are about 15 repeatable mob types you will find often: worm, crab, rabbit, beetle, crawler, bee, lizard, giants, leeches, mandaraga, bird, mushroom, skeletons, and fish.  Then you have the not so common mobs: scorpion, spider, plant, jellys, bombs, monkey, cactus, elementals, and different types of zone specific mobs. <br />
<br />
Switching jobs:  I like switching jobs rather than switching characters because you keep your gained abilities accessed from your other jobs.  For example:  If you start as a Warrior and level up to 12, then decide you want to be a Red Mage, all of the Shield, Sword, Evasion, and parrying skills will still be there.  They will be capped for that level, but they are there and will go up as that job goes up.  So, if I want to have better evasion skills as a Mage, I'm going to have to get swung at a lot as a mage(ouch) or level up a thief, war, etc.  These inherent abilities can be beneficial when you start a class with similar traits as you won't have to level those skills up again.<br />
<br />
Content:  Every since release in NA, Square has released new content regularly.  They have meaningful events that are usually around the time of a RL event(ie halloween, christmas).  These events(not spawning werewolves in e common type events), where you can get rare items that may or may not be repeated when the event repeats are quite nice.<br />
<br />
They have also fixed a lot of stuff and given additional stuffs.  In the past 6 months, they've added additional moghouse space(quested), sorted the Auction House, added new quests, added new guild recipes, opened up new zones(dynamis, zilart), added new challenges(ballista), supply mission quests(this allows you to warp to that outpost from your home city), opened up guild quests for guild-specific items, new garrison encounter, added lower level arena type battles(bcnm 20, 30), and made chocobos available for younger characters.<br />
<br />
Most MMORPGS I've played do these things on MAJOR releases, not minor ones.  In addition, most MMORPGS are bug-riddled when new releases come out(DAOC comes to mind, SWG always comes to mind) and the game has to be taken down within two days to fix bugs they should have fixed prior to releasing it.<br />
<br />
While FFXI still has some of the painstaking tasks like grinding, I still enjoy the experience primarily because of the content and the frequency of which they add new things.<br />

--edit-- added two more beastmen</div></div><hr />

From finding out about the war 20 years ago, to current events and holiday quests (got my easter egg and candy!), not to mention the out-of-reach places that many people don't see untill well into thier career - and these places sometimes are inside/next to common everyday zones, ya just gotta know where to look/how to get in.<br />
<br />
The Mission quests are a great example of this: You find out backstory about the town, get privilages based on rank (Signet lasting longer, Airships, ect.)... all in all I've done quite a bit, yet I know there is still much, much more out there that I haven't even touched.</div></div><hr />
