<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ammon Talanton</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get this information, you need to get your Grandmaster Assassin's Seal and talk to the poison vendor Ciren Darkbog at -130, 1425 in PoK.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Ciren Darkbog'<br />
<br />
Ciren Darkbog squints his eyes at you 'I see you have a Seal similar to that Dark Assassin who came through.  He had many interesting suggestions of items we should sell and stock.  He even had an interesting base formula he shared with us on how to make a new style of Poison.  Perhaps you would like to know the basis making these advanced poisons?<br />
<br />
You say, 'i would like to know how to make advanced poisons'<br />
<br />
Ciren Darkbog barks a short laugh at you, 'Glady would I share this information with you for the cost of a mere 100 platinum pieces.'<br />
 <br />
Ciren Darkbog holds his hand out and starts inspecting his fingernails. 'Apparently if you combine a celestial essence with a ethereal suspension you can make a celestial suspension.  Also amber plus gnomish spirits will make an amber resin.  This ore he suggested I sell also apparently makes a type of resin as well.  Now what was I thinking?  My tongue seems clogged perhaps 200 platinum would get it working again.'<br />
<br />
Ciren Darkbog grins at you. 'I imagine you were curious how to make a poison vial?  Well by combing an advanced vial sketch, a large block of clay, purified water, and a pelt from a beast you can make an unfired vial.  Simply fire it with a high quality firing sheet.  He mentioned something about an easier way involving a gnome, a peridot and an old vial.  More expensive than doing it yourself on a wheel, but easier is always more costly on the purse wouldn't ye say Ammon?  Speaking of costly if ye wish to know more I would suggest lightening your load by 500 platinum.'<br />
<br />
Ciren Darkbog smiles. 'Quite eager for the information are't we Ammon?  Well here you have it, combine an advanced vial, a celestial suspension, one of the resins, and a poison element.  For the more durable poisons ye need to add a rare element in addition to the common element.  He also mentioned some of the more exotic poisons would require sketchs that various masters of shadow would have.  The Dark Assassin even gave Loran a book in which to place these sketchs.  Overall a very nice stranger, I couldn't help but admire the mortar he had as well, black as night and smooth as marble.  Too bad he wouldn't part with that recipe.'<br />

Looks like a lot of work for the poisons overall, but possibly worth it.  Also looks like the black moratr will be craftable.  Could be interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ammon Talanton</div><div class="date">10-24-02, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few more comments/observations:<br />
<br />
-The Grandmasters Assassins Seal is the result of the new Renux quest in WK. See the quest forum for details (my favorite part of that quest was what she says when you finish it).<br />
<br />
-The ore 'he suggested I sell' is Mercuric Ore, which he sells. It is not stackable and we still need to figure out the formula for making the resin. On the bright side, I can test mixing it with all kinds of beverages and drink my 'mistakes'.<br />
<br />
-With my limited testing it looks like old poisons don't combine in the Coffin Poison Bottle (summoned using the Grandmasters Assassins Seal).<br />
<br />
-There is a gnome somewhere that will trade for the new vials. Still need to find him, but he probably won't be hard to find if you have the new seal.<br />
<br />
-It would be nice if people could post any trivial information they get on these new components.<br />
<br />
-It would be nice in peope could post any actual formulas they figure out. I will certainly be carrying a stack of supplies and trying new combines on everything I loot. =)<br />
<br />
-He certainly implies there is a new mortar, probably using the Coffin Poison Bottle since you can summon a new one.<br />
<br />
-The icons for the Seal and Bottle are cool, I like them.  Hrm, ok, maybe that's not so relevent.<br />

<br />
I'm nudging my community over this direction so that we don't lose valuable information due to seaparate groups running around trying to test the same exact things.<br />
<br />
I can also contribute my own tiny part to the conversation.  The tinkering combine in a toolkit of 1 sealed poison vial plus 1 peridot is trivial</div></div><hr />

Additionally, did you try making it on the pottery wheel/kiln in Plane of Knowledge, as opposed to one elsewhere?  We're finding that a lot of the PoP recipes specifically need the stationary containers in PoK for the combines. ... Just a couple things you might want to think about while experimenting.   <br />

<br />
Comments:<br />
 -Thanks Mizznomer for making those vials for me and refusing to charge.<br />
<br />
-I got dnc on the Coffin Poison Bottle. Do some recipies later use it? Or is it just going to be used for something else? It doesn't seem like a replacement trade container when it has no weight reduction and a combine button (also not no rent).<br />
<br />
-Combining a Mercuric Ore with Gnomish Spirits makes a Drop of Mercury. Is this supposed to be the other Resin even thought its not called that, or is it for another trade skill I am not familiar with.<br />
<br />
-We still have a lot of work to go to get both larger use poisions and the more powerful versions. But its a start.<br />

<br />
You have to make it.  No-fail combine in mortar &amp;amp; pestle using celestial solvent and a high-end spell research item.  (Or you can be lazy and just buy stacks of scent of marr to use instead of figuring out which runes, words and pages will work.)  You'll find a full list at the below link, and links contained within it that show where the solvent and the scent of marr are sold.<br />

You think farming greens is bad? Try getting 5 other people to go hunt in a place with no loot (ssra) so you can pick up some no drop venom sacks. They could have at least had the courtesy to make the goddamned components droppable. As it stands, these poisons are worse than the previous ones in terms of time required to make, and usefullness.<br />

But I do agree.  Somewhere along the line, when we said &quot;We shouldn't have to farm greens for hours just for a handful of components.&quot;, they took the keyword to be &quot;green&quot; instead of &quot;farm&quot;.  Which is sad.<br />

Simply fire it with a high quality firing sheet. He mentioned something about an easier way involving a gnome, a peridot and an old vial. More expensive than doing it yourself on a wheel, but easier is always more costly on the purse wouldn't ye say Ammon?

EVERYTHING for these poisons can be bought in one zone, except for the final component. The final components are ALL NO DROP, so they can be bought - and they are pretty common.<br />

I cant remember exactly where all those are from sorry, gonna be all either Disease or Nightmare with the last being from Ssra.  Has anyone tried the Mercuric Ore with a Celestial Essence or 2 for the 2nd resin?  I dont think Drop of Mercury is what we're looking for.<br />

Many people are worried about the time required to gather components. I am more worried about the costs.  While you can buy almost everything in the PoK, it is not cheap.<br />
<br />
Celestial Solvent     0.1.5.0<br />
Scent of Marr         1.8.7.5<br />
Etheral Suspension  3.1.2.5<br />
Sealed Vial             7.5.0.0<br />
Peridot                 12.5.0.0<br />
Amber                    3.1.2.5<br />
Gnomish Spirits        0.0.7.5<br />
<br />
Total   28pp 3gp 5sp for 10 minutes duration<br />
<br />
That comes out to just over 170pp an hour in addition to the component time sink.  What do you get for this? In my totally brief statistically invalid test of on poison, I had 9 procs in 10 minutes plus one critical in 10 minutes from Ingenuity (just over 200 dex). While a much more valid tests need to be done, this level of dps does not come close to being worth the cost. I simply can't afford it at this rate now matter how good it is. The better quality poisons will probably increase the dps a bit, but at the price of more components. We also need to worry about resists... I did my test on Va'Dyn (not saying he is the best subject, he is just who we were fighting at the time) and he resisted 7 of the 9 procs... ouch. Will work on some longer tests on normal mobs as I get more components (and would love to see other people's details).<br />
<br />
Still, even keeping all this in mind, we should avoid jumping to conclusions until we know how all the poisons work. Maybe the black marble mortar is a trade skill item that will cost 5kpp to make but will have a permanent poison effect on it (ok not likely, but possible).<br />
<br />
I have a lot of hope for this poison revamp, it's hard to believe VI will mess it up as badly as the first version. If they do though, I think it will be relegated to a few rogues with 20kpp to burn who only use it for hate reduction and mana drain on appropriate boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Oh, also tried to put up Zombie Bane and Sting of the Shissar at the same time, and as expected the second did not hold. I figure there is still a slight chance that hate reduction might stick with damage poisons, etc... it would certainly be nice.<br />

your price on the poison is way out of line.  I admit it can be pricey, but your figures are way out of line.<br />
<br />
28pp per new poison?  hardly<br />
<br />
You list a sealed vial for 7.5pp, (you must have a really low CHA). You list a peridot at 12pp, (I get them for 10.5).   Regardless of that, you are not required to use either of these expensive items to make the new vials, (you can make them yourself).  (yes, could be a bit more time consumely, but making Sealed vials is WAY much cheaper)<br />
<br />
So subtract almost 20pp from the total.<br />
<br />
Yes, perhaps a time sink to make it, but take a night off and do a mass combine session.  Store the majority of it on a mule, or on a friends mule account, (so it's easier to access).   Enchanted clay is easy to get, and for the actually components.  Write up a list of the stuff you need and tell your friends.  Mostly ALL of my poison stuff comes from friends collecting it for me.

Sorry, I was probably a bit unclear. Those prices are were listed as a response to the suggestion of buying everything in PoK. They are that high not because of cha, but because you are neutral to everyone. I haven't yet seen anything that gets your faction up with the merchants there (I checked the Planar Travelers Manual, it does not increase merchant faction at all). My point was that it's just not going to be possible to just buy components there unless there is a way to raise faction that someone finds in the future. It would be interesting to see someone calculate the costs if you make everything yourself, buy ingredients where you are ally. farm everything you can, etc. I will post those numbers when I get them if someone doesn't beat me too it, but I am also not at the point yet where I am worried about pricing, I am still in my test and explore phase.<br />
<br />
Uh, to summarize more clearly, it's not worth it imho to make the new poisons by buying all the components in PoK, and probably never will be, even if you do get ally.<br />

BUT, money isn't the biggest concern here.  (personally i don't even care about the price, because i don't have anything else to spend money on but ports.  i know it screws the younger rogues though.)<br />
<br />
the fact that we must now involve other classes/races in &quot;our&quot; skill sucks ass.  the facts that it still involves farming @#%$ from all over, takes up MORE bankspace than before, takes longer to make, and requires a guide because it's so @#%$ complicated make it a horrible implementation.  and that's just for the basic poisons.  we don't even know how much more complicated this will get with more durable/exotic poisons.<br />
<br />
it's gonna take an enormous amount of time to produce what will be used up fairly quickly.  it will NOT be for general use.  we will only be able to use these on select encounters because of the difficulty in making it.  BUT, ya can't use it on boss mobs because they resist the @#%$ out of it!<br />

2 buy peri and pottery a sealed cost to make best cha<br />

<br />
3 make the thing from scratch ( farm unrest yard for about 1 hour ) then make get some clay enchanted cost best cha  2p3g8s3c ( yield of 2 is the kicker here)<br />
<br />
then remeber the cost of suspen and resin min cost 6p0g6s6c  <br />
<br />
but for the effect and stacking and ( seeming ease of reagants  ( no matter what any one says they are easier to get and faster than old poiosns) <br />
these kick ass and i for one say its about time we can proc and stack our poiosns..<br />

I made a batch of 10 sting of the shissar tonight since I had a ton of the essence from killing goblins the other night.  Filled the coffin with 10 vials.  Clicked combine, and voila.  10 dose of Sting of the Shissar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does alchemy work in a similar fashion, or can they combine 5 + 5 to make a 10?<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, the dex debuff poison I'm betting has a component from either a zone we haven't been frequenting much.  Or it's some off the wall thing we haven't thought of trying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given the level range of the zones these components are dropping from, using that range as a guide might help to narrow things down a bit.<br />

This post focuses on new poison recipes, three of which are needed for 1 sketch of the Sketch book quest.<br />
<br />
We need to find the third posion recipe A.S.A.P.<br />
<br />
How all these quest come together is still a mystery and is very exciting.   Is the Black Mortar even related to the Sketchbook? What IS the Black Mortar?  fun fun.<br />

All the info is either here, in Quests or Back Alley.<br />
<br />
How about reading about it, instead of getting it spoon-fed? If you are too lazy to inform yourself here on the board, the poisons won't be anything for you at all, because they are a lot of work for little result.</div></div><hr />

Also got 3 new 1st Tier poisons during the research process.<br />
<br />
Tier 1<br />
<br />
Anger of Incapacitation:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Amber Resin + Wax Flower + Sluggish Sketch <br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
Confusing Dreams:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Amber Resin + Nodding Blue Lilly + Remiss Sketch<br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
Withering Flesh:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Amber Resin + Ocean Ink + vein crush sketch<br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
Tier 2 (final quest poison)<br />
<br />
Dreams of Drusella:<br />
Adv vial + Celest susp + Drop of mercury + Nodding Blue Lilly + twilight worms + remiss Sketch<br />
(sketch is returned)<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
The tier 2 poison is combined with 2 other tier 2 poisons in a bone bottle to make &quot;bundle of poisons&quot;<br />
<br />
Give that to the gnome rogue GM and get the 4th sketch from the Sketch book quest (see thesafehouse.org)<br />
<br />
Result of combining 4 sketches is a &quot;Master sketch&quot; which is a substitute for the 3 notes used in the above poisons and in as yet undiscovered poisons! <br />
<br />
Whew.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to Bayler 59 rogue Xev for support.<br />

Spine Rend would be similar to Spine Bruiser as follows:<br />

Oozing Irritations would be similar to Minor irritation as follows:<br />
Adv Vial + Celest Susp + Drop of mercury + Clump of Fungus + ???<br />
<br />
I also suspect the fourth sketch is needed (or the master sketch ) for Itching Madness (tier 1) and for Scratching Madness (tier 2).  Try combines for these with the sketch and see if it works.<br />
<br />
hope this helps in your combining.  Just find the last ingreadiant.<br />

<br />
&amp;lt;edited to add&gt; Great spreadsheets!   I would add in the quest part that Lobal Postugger in Akonon returns the 4th sketch when given the &quot;bunch of Poisons&quot; you get by combining the three quest poisions in the Bone bottle.  You then get the Master sketch by combining the 4 sketches in the &quot;sketch book&quot; you purchase in th poison vendor area of Plane of Knowledge 2100pp.  The step about combining the 3 poisons in a bone bottle means you HAVE to have the Grandmasters Assassin Seal to finish this.<br />

Any clue on what could be wrong?  I notice on the spreadsheet the &quot;Resin&quot; column lists a &quot;Mercury Resin&quot;, could that be a step I'm not making?  Is a Drop of Mercury the right component or do I need to combine it with something to make a &quot;Mercury Resin&quot;?<br />
<br />
I know I have the right parts listed above, as I have triple and quadruple checked the ingredients in the containers before and after attempts and still can't get even a failure.  Are the recipes mixed up?  Just going through all the possibilities here trying to brainstorm why it's not combining.

Then the Grandmasters Assassin's Seal was found, then the sketch quests, then the Black Marble Mortar and Pestle.  All these related to the new Advanced Poisons.  It was getting to be too much for one spreadsheet and hard to print out.  So as I mentioned in a previous post I started creating a web page to gather this all together (at least for my own use).<br />
<br />
So here it is for you to use.<br />
<br />

I still have the Excel sheet but will soon stop updating this in favor of the website and the new One Sheet Reference.  This guide is designed to be printed double sided so it is one sheet.    I keep this one printed at my computer while I play.  It has the poison recipe's, component recipe's and component locations.  This will be converted to pdf soon.<br />

Excellent job, and I thank you for pulling together info that I otherwise would have had to do for myself to keep it all straight. <br />
<br />
One thing:<br />
<br />
After creating your GMAV, you can summon no rent bags. Whee. However if you give one of these no-rent bags to the gnome on the balcony of the bazaar who sells magician spells, he will give you a Grandmaster's Satchel - a 10 slot, 100pct weight reduction bag that is not norent. A nice little bonus. Since most rogues are probably going to create their GMAV as a step to getting their GMAS, they may not realize this or forget it, so you may wish to mention it on your GMAV page so they get this benefit.<br />

I found something ...<br />
<br />
Tier One :<br />
Advanced Poison Vial + Celestial Suspension + Amber Resin + Wax Flower + Sluggish Sketch or Master Sketch = Anger of Incapacitation or Withering Flesh ????<br />
I guess it should be Withering Flesh not Anger of Incapacitation . <br />
<br />
see Tier Two : Wasted Flesh = Advanced Poison Vial + Celestial Suspension + Drop of Mercury + Wax Flower + Golden Ember Dust + Sluggish Sketch or Master Sketch<br />
Withering Flesh and Wasted Flesh should be same DoT type .<br />
Anger of Incapacitation and Rage of Incapacitation should be same type too .<br />

<br />
One Question though; in the Advanced Poison Recipes page the recipe for Withering Flesh calls for a Vein Crush Sketch.  Rage of Incapacitation calles for a Vein Rot Sketch.  Aren't they one and the same?  Which is the proper name? Edited by: Azharan at: 10/31/02 7:46:39 am</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify you are saying when you combined 10 poisons you recieved ONE 10 dose poison and TEN Advanced Vials?  If so that is great. <br />

as a whole.. making the new poisons is a helluva lot more involved.. might make sense they would cut us a break somewhere.. but i thought gettin the coffin bottle was our payoff.. hhhehee<br />

I have made pleanty of ten dose potions using Tier one poisons.  None have given me vials back.  Will try Tier two poisons tonight.  Would love to see this be a patched change as it would REALLY help the bottom line for making poisons.  Speaking of this, I would love to see an empty vial appear on your cursor after you apply the poison.   After all, my rogue would  (A) not leave behind evidence and would pocket the empty.  (B) would not litter :-) (C) would be frugal enought to reuse what-ever he could.<br />

Hope to see confirmation on this and other combines.  Try the 5 potion combines too.<br />

Very very nice. The failure rate is still a bit high for the level 2 poisons (can you say Poison Mastery), but I don't mind that so much if in the end I get a usable, *cost effective* poison ability, and with this change it is definately looking like we are in the right range imho. At the moment the only real long term required expenses are the Ethereal Suspensions and arguably the Mercuric Ore (I haven't found what I consider to be any decent camp spots for the Drops of Mercury, but I am itching to get to the earth based planes to see if it drops there).<br />
<br />
Assuming this is new with the patch, it's very nice to see VI keeping an eye on things and making such a prompt change to make poisons more reasonable.<br />

I updated my listing with these recent recipe's as well as the testing done on poison stacking.<br />

Also in the first post from Vaslin on PoP it was mentioned that there will be more than one way to make these poisons.  So far only Sting and Bite of Shissar have alternate components.  I can't believe these are the only ones.  I need to grab the list of DNC's that Squink has created and see what else there is to throw in that mortar and pestle.<br />

One thing that i found really sucks is that Warr Epic proc (red blade) overwrites our Mangled tendon and Rage of incapacitation poisons.

<br />
It's a weapon proc on a 16/19 rogue only dagger that drops off of Mithaniel Marr.  I heard his loot tables were initially messed up, which is probably why this effect was recently added when they added the dagger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The grubs come from Plane of Tactic so they aren't exactly easy to get but this does show that there are alternates for some recipes.  <br />
<br />
The original MI recipe used all Luclin drops whereas this one used PoP.  Not sure if that is significant.<br />
<br />
Still trying out other combos w/ the few Grubs that I have.<br />

Lure snare would be nice, however it seems that even the current Tendonslice effect is bugged. The hate reduction effect has less of a resist check, and if you resist that, you resist the snare portion of the effect as well. /sigh</div></div><hr />

 Well today i got a skorpicus venom sack off one of the, you gessed  Skorpicuss' (cant remember if im spelling it right at the moment).    <br />
<br />
    Now this stuff is SUPER rare  or im very very unlucky.<br />
I only have 1 and have tried every posable combine and  all i got was DNC.  Does anyone else think this is a unsolved poison or am i barking up a dead tree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_KayleighDrake</div><div class="date">11-14-02, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say you're barking up the wrong tree.<br />
<br />
There's something I and others have noticed about new poison ingredients.<br />
<br />
1. They're common. When mobs drop them, they do so a lot. Maybe half the time, maybe a little less. (Streaky in some areas too. You get none for a while, then every mob has them for a while.)<br />
<br />
2. They always drop in pairs.<br />
<br />
3. They tend to have a consistent npc vendor purchase price around 6-7pp.<br />
<br />
4. They are always stackable<br />
<br />
5. They're not nodrop<br />
<br />
If you come across something unusual, see if it fits those criteria. If it does, start messing with it in the ol' mortar. If not, you might want to hold off. It's not a guarantee of course, but it does seem to be the general trend.<br />

So i know you can do the quest before lvl 60 and (250) skill...but I am wondering if I need to look deeper or if it is just a simple matter of : Not being able to combine any of those poisons till I get a higher skill  (250) ? or (237.5 + the GM seal's 5% to poison making to bring it up to 250)... or ???<br />
