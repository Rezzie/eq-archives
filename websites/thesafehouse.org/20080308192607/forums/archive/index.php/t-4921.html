<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_OK Killer Cat</div><div class="date">02-23-02, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am about to reach 19th as an Infiltrator.  Before they added the extra spec points I resolved to max out my Critical Hit and split the remaining points between Thrust and Stealth.  I decided to use a small shield instead of duel wield since I usually block at least 1 or 2 extra blows per solo combat and I can then get Beartooth off to stun the mob.  Now with the extra spec points I can build up either Envenom or Duel Wield.  Do the extra attacks really make up for getting hit more often and losing the ability to stun with Beartooth (15th Thrust) and using the 44th level Thrust follow-up?  Should I instead try to get Envenom up to 15th or 20th and just use dagger with small shield?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gharrick</div><div class="date">02-23-02, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it can be worth it at high level, I don't know about level 19 though. I'm level 45 and my thrust level is around 34. I have pretty low DW, I think its 2 or three. In the future, though, I plan on increasing DW to some extent instead of spending the points on thrust. I figured out that every level of thrust would only increase my damage by .7%. Every level of DW only increases my damage by .5% (on average), but it is much cheaper since my DW is still low level in DW. So I can increase it several levels for the same cost on increasing thrust one level. This is ignoring styles, however I mostly stick with CS styles anyway. (except for Tranqualize)<br />
<br />
If you plan on sticking with a shield, of course DW wouldn't make sense. But with a shield you also have one les poison that you can use. I don't know whether the extra poison is a better advantage than a shield. But to me it's more fun so it doesn't matter. With the extra points we got from the increase to 2.5, I spent a lot of them on envenom and pushed it up to level 36.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Infiltrator X</div><div class="date">02-23-02, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've tried a shield on a few occassions and it never performs as well as my DW, and at level 42 my DW is only at 10. When I solo a blue or yellow mob I take significantly more damage when I don't use DW because the fight takes longer. In group situations you'd better not be drawing agro anyway, unless you've got a pulser, so there's no point in using a shield and forsaking the extra damage you'd add to the group with DW.<br />
<br />
I don't block regularly enough to make it worthwhile, and if I put the beartooth style on my hotbar I'd have to ditch one of my other styles. I prefer to leave my evade reactionary styles up instead if I'm soloing. I'm much more likely to be able to use them during a fight. Usually several times.<br />
<br />
Generally the only time I equip my shield is during RvR when I'm being shot at by an archer.<br />

<br />
but yes DW is very worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Olmoss</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where is the chart that tells you how much it increases the chance of your left hand going off ? I saw one a long time ago and can't find it. <br />
  I am trying to figure out if raising DW at all is worth it if it reduces my Critical Strike..  or envenom (Stealth HAS to be 40+ in my view)  <br />

 Thanks, Moth is 25 now and still trying to come up with a spec plan. 'Shades are tough to figure out   PatrickBard to the Rising Phoenix&quot;Doc&quot; BllueClan House of the Rising PhoenixMoonflower Bllue RIP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">each point in DW increases your chance to swing with both weapons by half a percent. The formula testers have come up with is 25% + .5% * skill_rank + .25% * char_level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_HanzouHattori</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently have only 8 points in it at level 39, and I hit with both weapons pretty frequently.  My final template is going to have me at either 21 or 25 DW, it's still up in the air.  I'd like to have it higher, but I value my other skills a bit more I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dikus</div><div class="date">02-24-02, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only for ya Info:<br />
Duel Wield and Celtic Dual was changed some time ago to help the speccing BM and Mercs.<br />
<br />
Now the formula is around:<br />
Specclvl (1-20):<br />
25% + (Specc/2)<br />
<br />
Specclvl (21 - 50):<br />
35% + (Specc&gt;20 * 0,75)<br />
<br />
Good Luck,</div></div><hr />

Any links or logs to help match those numbers?  Sunthas Bayne<br />
