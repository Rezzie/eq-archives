<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">12-22-06, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At an anime club meeting, somebody happened to play a music video someone had made of the ending to Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu, except, instead of the dancing and kid petting a kitty and all that, it was all with manga scans from Death Note.<br />
<br />
It was seventy-two different flavors of awesome.<br />
<br />
It even had it synced up so that there were panels declaring &quot;a&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;bou&quot; and &quot;ookii na&quot; &quot;yume&quot; &quot;suki&quot; &quot;deshou&quot; at the appropriate times.   <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, all the guy could tell me was that he'd found it on 4chan.  Since that's not searchable, or at least I couldn't find any central archive or means to looking for specific things in it before my eyeballs exploded, I've had little luck. YouTube was of similarly little use.  All I've found is something like the same idea, but all crappy and in Korean.  Bleh.    <br />
<br />
Any help?</div></div><hr />
