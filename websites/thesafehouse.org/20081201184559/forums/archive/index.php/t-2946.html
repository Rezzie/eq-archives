After much preperation, me and the guys who are staying for summer quarter @ RIT started our summer campaign last night. There was even roleplaying, and with our &quot;miniatures&quot; combat was much more interesting. I made 2' x 2' sheet of 1&quot; graph paper, and we used various dice and large capacitors (does it get any geekier) for our miniatures. All monsters were D10's with the pointy side indicating facing. Occurance of the night was the Fighter/Wizard convincing the NPC that resuced the party when their caravan got attacked that the bald, female wizard had married her cousin. He thought they were all wierd and slept under one of the wagons for the night. <br />
<br />
He's really an evil guy who is just going to try to manipulate the party for his own ends. Actually, most of the campaign is driven by evil guys, and the PCs think they are doing good...ahahahaha.         Krimzan Anklestabber<br />

<br />
Sounds great!<br />
<br />
We've actually got some nice mats with grids on one and hexes on the other for our minatures. Most of the players use actual figs, and the GM uses chits for monsters, and figs for NPC's and special monsters.<br />
<br />
Instead of dice you might want to consider cutting some chits out of posterboard/card stock until you can get some mins. =)<br />

So it's easy to know which monster is which from your little monster scrap paper sheet thing. So for example, I know that the dice that is 8 is a bugbear with 13 initiative, 12 hp left etc...<br />
<br />
I'm really proud of that because I did, in fact, think it up as I was getting a slice of cold pizza from the fridge.</div></div><hr />

It added to the atmosphere of the campaign. So much more gratifying that the damn dry erase board )</div></div><hr />

Or stylish roman numerals on the shield face, if youre playing fantasy.</div></div><hr />
