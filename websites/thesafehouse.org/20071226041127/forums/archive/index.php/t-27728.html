<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-13-07, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maintaining the sticky, here (http://www.thesafehouse.org/forums/showthread.php?t=24244) has proven to be more work than most of us really want to do. So I figure instead of letting it die and take up space, I'll go ahead and turn it into a more pratical use, a SH recommendation thread.<br />
<br />
Now, please feel free to debate what I'm about to say. If you disagree in any way, we can work it out. It's just my brainstorm of sorts, and hasn't been completely thought out.<br />
<br />
Here's what I want to do. I want to make a SH recommendation thread. However, everyone has their own niche. Everyone will think a certain title is something the other guy should see, and due to his love for the anime and participating in related fansites, threads, etc, gain a perception that everyone else agrees. When it's basically just those in similar niche.<br />
<br />
It's hard to say which titles fall in this category, and which doesn't. I'm working on a rough draft of sorts to give an idea of what's included and what isn't, and why, which will be posted later.<br />
<br />
I want titles that have cross-genre appeal. What's considered a cross-genre appeal in the USA and Japan are completely different, as I will demostrate.<br />
<br />
Cowboy Bebop is undoubtly a humongous influence on the USA crowd, however it's disposable to the Japanese. Conversely, Super Dimensional Fortress (SDF) Macross is considered a revolution in Japan, but in the USA only appeals to mecha fans.<br />
<br />
On this issue I don't have any particular feelings one way or another. So think hard about what you want to recommend - we're not just recommending to the casual anime fan, but even to the longtime fans who may have missed some titles of importance. I want to try to make it as close to an list where you can put a blindfold on and randomly pick any title, and KNOW it will be a high quality title.<br />
<br />
I adore Ichigo Mashimaro, and think it's one of my favorite anime. But would I recommend it to ANYONE as a high quality title? Not particularly, it's a high quality title to those who are in the moe~ niche.<br />
<br />
Conversely, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu would qualify as a high quality title that you can recommend to anyone. It gets solid marks on all fronts - animation, story, and music. The fandom speaks for itself, there is not a single person who does not know who Suzumiya Haruhi is in the world of anime fandom.<br />
<br />
Opinions? Recommendations? Just give me ideas here. If you disagree with another poster's recommendation, don't trash the title. People don't like hearing their favorite titles suck. Explain objectively what makes the title not qualify that excludes your personal bias.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I am new to the whole Anime thing, so I am still unsure what is what, especially with the use of Japanese names. (I am sure I will get used to them after some time however) Knowing what people recomend would be a great help to me.  I am not sure I am knowledgeable enough yet to contribute, but I certainly will read everyones recomendations with great interest.<br />

This is just a rough outline to start us off. After a little while, I will create a new post which include all the recommendations which are unanimous and undebated.  Also, I will create a new post for each series that got added which includes a sysnopis of the show, reasons why it got included, and so on. That way, if you find a title of interest, you can click it, and it will direct you to the post relating to the show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If older stuff is being included, not just what's in fansub release right now, there's going to have to be a hell of a lot of stuff up there.  Cowboy Bebop and Trigun should be there. I've never heard of anybody who watched CB and didn't like it.  Also, Samurai Champloo.  <br />
<br />
What's the difference between shoujo-style and shounen-style magical girl? <br />
<br />
I'd recommend noting that Maria-sama ga Miteru isn't plain shoujo, but shoujo-ai.  For people like me, that makes all the difference. :wink<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, how about a shounen-ai category?  It's a, er, niche-ish genre, so it's tough to find recommendations for what's currently out in the fansub-verse.</div></div><hr />

Ill let stalk tell ya about some of this stuff....but there are few shounen-ai stuff but generaly you find your greatest source of shounen-ai in manga. There is a TON of shounen-ai in manga heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree, but it's not even halfway through. So I think it might be best to wait a bit before putting it up.<br />
<br />
If older stuff is being included, not just what's in fansub release right now, there's going to have to be a hell of a lot of stuff up there.  Cowboy Bebop and Trigun should be there. I've never heard of anybody who watched CB and didn't like it.  Also, Samurai Champloo.  <br />
<br />
Put anything, fansub, licensed, whatever. I'll put Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, and Samurai Champloo up there, though I think Trigun and Champloo are pretty debatable. We can discuss that later, though.<br />
<br />
What's the difference between shoujo-style and shounen-style magical girl? <br />
<br />
Shounen style, like Nanoha's, incorporates very shounen-specific traits and is marketed towards an male audience. You know, powerups, screaming, I'll never forgive you!, etc. Shoujo style incorporates girly things, like accessories, love and friendship, OUR TWO HEARTS AS ONE, PRETTY CURE MARBLE SCREW!, etc.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend noting that Maria-sama ga Miteru isn't plain shoujo, but shoujo-ai.  For people like me, that makes all the difference. :wink<br />
<br />
Actualy, Maria-sama ga Miteru was marketed towards the shoujo crowd to begin with. Male otaku never noticed the existence of Maria-sama until the novels were well underway, it became so popular with the female crowd that it spilled over to the male crowd and got embraced by the male otaku. With the obvious exception of Sei, any -ai content is the figment of male otaku's imaginations.<br />
<br />
That being said, it would be worth noting that it has a strong shoujo-ai feel for male otaku with vivid fantasies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, how about a shounen-ai category?  It's a, er, niche-ish genre, so it's tough to find recommendations for what's currently out in the fansub-verse.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to add any genre you want. Shounen-ai and yaoi will make most male posters here uncomfortable, but no less so than I imagine shoujo-ai does to some of our female posters. Though I'm not well versed in those titles, I've read a few volumes of Gravitation and it sent chills up my spine. But it's popular, so I hear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is correct. Thare are billions of shounen-ai manga. Very few female-oriented (shoujo, shounen-ai, yaoi) titles ever get animated, for some gender genetic psychobabble reason which explains that women like manga better than anime.<br />
<br />
Misc:<br />
Kino's Journey<br />
<br />
I'm trying to find a place to put this and Mushishi. The two fall under the same genre, but I can't think of what it is off hand.</div></div><hr />

But we can get into that later, I just want recommendations!<br />
<br />
But please don't just recommend ANYTHING you liked. Recommend shows you really LOVED. The less titles to filter out, the better. It will make it easier to get going. I don't want the list to be humongous and intimidating, because if I was giong based on what people liked, I'd probably have to list every anime ever created! <br />
<br />
I added all suggestions so far.<br />

 <br />
 <br />
Edit: add Mahoraba ~Heartful Days~<br />
 <br />
this isn't a 'best of' list, so I dont feel bad at all about listing something not considered to be the absolute 'must watch' kind of thing and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well thats one problem with Recommending<br />
You can't Just have a small list , it has to be big<br />
<br />
i used to think Beserk is The Best Anime to recomend to People ( i realy loved that show ) but i made the mistake of not asking what a guy loved before recomending it , and he came back to me a week later pissed because he bought a DVD and said it was crap complaining about why would he want to see muscular men with sword and do i think he is gay ( strangely he enjoyed Rose of Versailles ) <br />
<br />
Couple of my friends HATE mecha , one of them once he  see a mech he delete the anime ( if he download it ) or cancel all preorders , i had to promise to pay his DVD cost if he didn't like  Full Metal Panic! after the second DVD <br />
Because he ordered them when i recomended them<br />
<br />
<br />
And too many other example :P <br />
<br />
So in most cases , you need to test the Waters , if its cold or hot , or the tempreture suit you or not before you dive :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-14-07, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the thing here is that it's easy to recommend 50 good shounen anime. But do we want to list them all? Not really. Preference plays a big part into things, but I'm looking for something like, about 10 great anime for each genre (number is not set, just an example). That way, a person can pick one, if he doesn't like it due to x reason, he can pick one of the other 9 which are good too, instead of having to narrow down a list of 50.<br />
<br />
That's the concept I'm working at here. But I can work the kinks out later, I just need recommendations, my suggestions on what type of recommendations are not to stop you from giving them, but to request that people don't go totally nuts on suggestions and bogging me down with work filtering it out. So far, all the suggestions have been just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
well you have a plan , thats cool <br />
<br />
why not collect for now , then start narrowing down<br />
<br />
for example when you have 15 comdey anime , discuss each one and see what doesn't fit much or not <br />
like lets say someone recomended Smash Hit ( which no one did which is good ) , the show is comdey , but its linked to Cosprayers , so you shouldn't recomend it to people unless they saw Cosprayers which make it useless as recomendation for anyone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-15-07, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep that's the plan, just recommend what's good, we'll narrow it down later.</div></div><hr />

As for recommendations, Haibane Renmei is one of my favourite anime series, and Noir is good as well.  The movie Akira is one of the grandfathers of the anime movement in North America, so it should find its way onto most any recommendation list.  Perfect Blue is another movie which jumps into my mind as quality anime.</div></div><hr />

Haibane's a good recommendation. Point taken on Akira, I'll put it up. Perfect Blue is great as well, I think i'll put it in it's own movie section for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">01-16-07, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest adding Ah! My Goddess to the romance list.  Its a fun, cute series.  One of the ones that got me into the genere of romance anime.<br />
<br />
Great Teacher Onizuka should definally be added right beside Gokusen.  Both of them are great Teacher Comedy's in my opnion.  Though I'll admit they do have a nich crowd so does Cromartie High, I hate that series.<br />
<br />
Experimental Anime category should probably include Excel Saga and its partner Poni-Poni Poemy.   They can be a riot if youve watched a lot of anime.<br />
<br />
Stuidio Ghibili should just say EVERYTHING. :b<br />
<br />
I'll agree that Last Exile would be a good adition to Sci-Fi<br />
<br />
Gantz would either fall under Sci-Fi or Action.   Probably more Action.  Its a rather intresting series and I would have liked to see more of it.  BTW - Anybody know if the manga goes beyond what the anime showed?<br />
<br />
Haibane Renmei is a really good series in my opnion as well.</div></div><hr />

Sci-fi/action/drama.  Great shorter and easily digestable series at 13 episodes, and I believe it could appeal to many an anime(and non-anime) fan.  Needs to be added to this list</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;His and her circumstances&quot; Was very nice untill near end where apparently the studio had their budget cut to below 100yen, at least that's how it seemed to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I'm only putting things under one category right now. The list became too big to add multiple categories, so I'll figure that out later.</div></div><hr />

Get backers is a comedy, action, drama, mixed in. Definitely should watch that series. I loved it.</div></div><hr />

I'll also second Noir.</div></div><hr />

Put Get Backers and Noir up. Guess I'll check Get Backers out, it's the only title recommended so far I haven't seen. Googling the pics turned up bishounens, which probably would trigger my do not watch list. But since you think it's worth recommending, i'll give it a try.<br />
<br />
Kamichu is awesome! Too bad there's not much in the way of figures. The ones that did come out didn't really appeal to me. It's kinda like Miyazaki plus moe~, best of both worlds if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">02-15-07, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Figured I'd add a few more suggestions to the list:  Millenium Actress, Jin-Roh, and Serial Experiments Lain.<br />
<br />
The first two movies I just watched today and enjoyed both for very different reasons.  Millenium Actress (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=374) is a very unique movie about a director and cameraman doing a documentary about a famous aging actress.  As they interview her they hop around in her movies and in parts of her real life, as if they were actually there.  It's a very enjoyable movie and I really liked the ending as well.<br />
<br />
Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=161) is a slower, graphically violent movie which deals both in a man's emotions about being an elite soldier for a government organization, and in being one of the chess pieces in a larger plot between government organizations.  It's a darker, brooding style anime that conveys what it wants to very well.<br />
<br />
Serial Experiments Lain (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=166) is a series I bought a while back and I recently rewatched some of it.  I love the opening theme song, and the plot about the real world and the wired world, and Lain's connection to both is interesting for those into computers and technology.  It also has an unusual visual style to it that I like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">02-15-07, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoops, thanks for bumping this Ruccus. I completely forgot about it. I'll work on compiling an temporary list this weekend.<br />
<br />
I agree on all counts, all three of those shows are excellent. I adore Millenium Actress, it's a really beautiful and well done story. Jin-roh was very tragic. I immensely enjoyed both.</div></div><hr />

Serial Experiments: Lain was the first anime I ever bought. I later gave it away as a present.</div></div><hr />

Ah interesting...most ppl who watch this hate it a lot. But I thought it would be interesting as it deals with real world and computers. Kinda like .hack// does for real life and Online games.</div></div><hr />

I also really liked the ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion though, which is another love/hate part of anime.<br />
<br />
As for first anime I ever bought, it was Ghost in the Shell after seeing a blurb on it on Siskel&amp;Ebert. They showed the 'invisible fight' scene.  First series I ever bought was Neon Genesis Evangelion.  First series I can remember following closely was Star Blazers (then Robotech).</div></div><hr />

Ya think most of the hate comes from its slowness. &quot;most&quot; anime types like faster type shows...so shows like .hack//sign and .hack//roots get overlooked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh btw if you liked .hack//sign you will prob like .hack//roots. But overall signs was still better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">02-16-07, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Roots is terrible. I'm halfway thru forcing myself to finish that series.<br />
 <br />
Let's pretend .hack//SIGN was liscenced by 4-kids. First, you remove all emotion from the voices and dialogue. Next, you make people talk just to fill up the rediculous amount of time each scene takes; mostly where characters stare out into space for no reason, or stare at a person for minutes on end while making 'confused' noises. After that, you take away the music (which was one of SIGN's best parts) and replace it with 'popular_semi-talented_but_has_nothing_to_do_with _the_story_band'; make sure to make the music in a different language too. (SIGN had mostly english-lyric music, ROOTS is back to japanese) You then introduce a character partway thru that is, basically, an evil looking version of a well-known character from a video game on which this current anime is based.<br />
 <br />
Seriously, ROOTS is like watching the equivalent of an english dub, in Japanese.</div></div><hr />

Well I agree its not as good as .hack//Sign but it is setup the same way Sign's was. I think .hack//Roots was trying to create this show where you have to think really deeply about some meanings and also have a LOT of knownlege about .hack books too seeing as it draws apon some of those concepts. Overall ya the chars are emotionless but really I think they where ment to be that way. Think they wanted to go for the japanese &quot;emo&quot; type speech or something. And the cat-girl is SUPER annoying....she says the same **** over and over &gt;&lt;. Its not as good or developed as Signs but it is still pretty good and has to be better then the Twilight Bracelet :P.<br />
<br />
I also think the music kinda made ROOTS as well but thats kinda true with most .hack anime series/games.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Omfg, i thought the same thing! I looked and was like, holy ****, she looks like the chick from madlax! WTF is she doing playing videogames?!?!?!<br />
 <br />
Sad part is, Margaret is way cooler, simply cause she's one messed-up fractured chick.</div></div><hr />

I was starting to get bored through part of the first one.  And I never did finish the video game.<br />
I bought the fourth game and played it for about an hour before I put in a different one because I was bored.  I STILL havent gone back to it yet.<br />
<br />
.Hack is a cool concept but I just cant seem to keep intrest in it.  Which is kind of sad because I want to have intrest in it.</div></div><hr />
