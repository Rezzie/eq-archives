<br />
Raze Guild is a pre release guild dedicated to becoming a top tier guild. We are looking for strong players with a solid background and a willingness to be part of a top tier guild. We will be playing on a PVP server, role-play if you want but don’t expect it to be what everyone does, in fact very few will. We will have raids and you will be expected to attend, we realize not all raids can be attended but don’t expect to not raid or not put in effort into the guild. We don’t write this to be harsh, just to put expectations out. We are a group of seasoned players with backgrounds in most MMOG’s out there. We will have a strong crafting and harvesting focus, and if you are not crafting you will be expected to help the guild and donate some resources which will come back to you in the form of gear. Seeing as we are playing on a PVP server, gear will be very important hence the focus on raids and crafting. Do not bring large ego’s to this guild as it will not be tolerated, also if you are squeamish about language and cant take a joke, we are not for you. Raze is dedicated to having a strong guild community and dominate the PVP server. If you think this is for you visit us at www.razeguild.com and register on the forums and post an app. Thank you very much, RAZEGUILD.</div></div><hr />
