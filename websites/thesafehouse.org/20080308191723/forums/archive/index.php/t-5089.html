Stealthing around the grounds and spying on the Mids was a blast.  However, I had one incident that puzzled me.  I had several Trolls (Red con to me) walk right past me and seemingly didn't see me, which was fine with me.     As I was patrolling around the bridge to the center keep, I was stealthed and in the water and suddenly was attacked with a first hit of 319.  A orange con Kobold had been stealthed in the water as well as me.  My question is how in the world did I not see a tag or something when I was near him?  Any other infiltrators or even SBs care to enlighten me as to how a stealther can be seen by another stealther.  I am at a total lose here.<br />

But if a small race (Lurikeen, Kobold, and Dwarf I think are it) is in the water, it can be a major pain in the ass to see them.  (I generally go around in over-the-shoulder with the camera way up in the sky, and I can't see them at all in the water like that.  So I either have to switch to first-person, or bring my camera angle down to where it's level with the water.)<br />

<br />
But, it is based on your stealth level to the level of that character ( whether he can see you) , plus, if he has his stealth higher than you, then he will see you first.... and lastly as mentioned above, if he has See Hidden Stealth ability, then he can see you futher away.<br />
<br />
I know this is not an exact desciption, but suffice it to say, he who has the better stealth wins..... I had lvl 14 + 2 stealth and still had people &quot;POP&quot; in front of me.<br />
<br />
If you are one of those players who auto trained in stealth, then count on being owned and just fight with a group of people. You will never sneek up on anyone with a low stealth.<br />
<br />
Sorry, if my post is not too accurate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AGLuhowy</div><div class="date">06-18-02, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1)  If they have higher stealth than you, you will not see them, or at the least have less chance.  Same with level.<br />
<br />
2)  Those little classes can sometimes hide in the water and not be seen at all.  Stealthing or not.</div></div><hr />
