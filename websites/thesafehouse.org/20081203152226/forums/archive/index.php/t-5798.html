The Safehouse's Trivia ContestSaturday, June 16, 2001.<br />
Starts at 9:00 p.m.<br />
Contest RulesThe 'quiz' consists of 27 general knowledge multiple-choice questions<br />
Teams of 1-4 people allowed per quiz.<br />
Participants have 30 minutes to complete the quiz<br />
You may not leave the room once the contest has started unless you are done<br />
The team that has the highest score will advance to the final round<br />
An answer sheet is available after the contest<br />
<br />
Final RoundThe final round consists of 10 oral questions.<br />
The individuals on the winning team(s) will complete solo<br />
Each individual will answer by writing the answer in a notebook and all participants will show the answer simultaneously<br />
If no clear winner is received at the end of the 10 questions, two more questions have been prepared to break the tie<br />
<br />
PrizesFirst Prize: Original Artwork by Keith Parkinson, Special Edition Safehouse T-Shirt, mug, mousepad<br />
Second Prize: Special Edition Safehouse T-Shirt, mug, mousepad<br />
Third Prize: Special Edition Safehouse T-Shirt, mousepad<br />
Fourth Prize: Special Edition Safehouse T-Shirt<br />
<br />
I'd say most of the questions are quite challenging, and the players who are familiar with the entire world of Norrath will definitely have an advantage.  There are only a couple of rogue specific questions since there is certainly a plethora of player types come here to the safehouse.<br />
<br />
Of the administrators, Glip did quite well, getting over 80% of the questions right.  Zato on the otherhand... well, he's a dwarf.<br />
<br />
I will be posting the quiz on the Safehouse soon after I return.  Oh, and no, several of the questions are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; in the compendium.<br />

<br />
Who won?  'Team: Am Fek'<br />
<br />
But unfortunately there was a little bit of controversy since I gave out the rule '4 people to a team' downstairs, and the group upstairs didn't hear that.  Let me see if I can find their names somewhere.</div></div><hr />
