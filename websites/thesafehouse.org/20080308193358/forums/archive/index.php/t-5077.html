<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Mesrour</div><div class="date">05-18-02, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was considering doing:<br />
19 stealth (+5 from items for 24 stealth)<br />
9 pierce<br />
18 envenom<br />
21 cs<br />
<br />
Should i take pierce up any higher?  does more pierce add to my cs dmg? I would also like to know how many points i can save by auto-training my stealth until 24.  Would it be worth it?  I don't plan to play in the BG until im 24 so i won't be needing stealth for rvr purposes.<br />
<br />
Thanks Edited by: Mesrour at: 5/18/02 7:39:37 pm</div></div><hr />

He doesn't stand a chance against others, but I think you have a decent hit and run template there.  My friend plays about the same - solo he gets owned by about every class except solo blue mages, but with another shade or an archer you'll have fun.<br />
<br />
If a shadowblade finds you, better snare him and run probably be able to kill archers with that though. one thing I might change if I were you is from pierce to blades since slash damage has a bonus to leather...<br />
<br />
small note - by letting stealth auto-train till your level 24 you basically get one extra point in one of your 20+ stats, so you could have 20 stealth there or 19 envenom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Thormael</div><div class="date">05-21-02, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">9 pierce is WAY too low. You -need- more. I'd say get your weapon skill to 15-18 base at 24, try for items helping there too.<br />
<br />
Autotraining stealth to 24 will get you 20 more training points (2+3+4+5+6). Edited by: Thormael  at: 5/21/02 4:09:00 am</div></div><hr />

<br />
I autotrained stealth till I was 32, no currently I'm at 19+7 in stealth.  Sure I get seen, but with a 26+5 in piercing, 29 CS, my garotte/hamstring combos tear through them, even though they are a higher con. Once I get to 35 I'll have a pretty darn good stealth, and still be a meelee machine.  Otm casters are down in 5 hits if I perf, ytm in 3...   <br />
<br />
But piercing is what everyone ignores, and from what I've seen it governs your base for CS styles.</div></div><hr />

You want your pierce/blade spec line to be at least 2/3 of your level to minimize your damage variance.   Bloodreign  *Pellinor*Level 45 Lurikeen Nightshade~Oh you were finished?!!  Well allow me to retort!!</div></div><hr />
