Do I need to watch a series first to get the story of it or can I start with the movie? And is it a sequel or...?<br />
<br />
I'm sick so maybe I'm just confused?  :beatup</div></div><hr />

It's all three.  First there was the movie, then a series based on the characters called Stand Alone Complex, then the recent sequel movie, Innocence.<br />
<br />
I've only seen the first movie, but I thought it was pretty good.  I don't really know much about anime, but this one is definitely worth a watch.</div></div><hr />

Essentially, the only thing you should know at the start of the movie is that Major Kusanagi is a cyborg, almost completely robotic, but she does have human brain cells.  Because she almost completely machine, she's beginning to doubt her humanity.<br />
<br />
In GitS: Stand Alone Complex, it's an alternate reality in which The Puppetmaster (the person Kusanagi was tracking down in the movie) didn't exist.  I've only seen the first eight episodes, but the Major is played with more feeling and caring (she's not doubting her humanity in the series), and interacts more freely with her team.  In SAC it comes up that Kusanagi was forced into her cyborg body by a childhood illness, so she didn't actually volunteer to become a cyborg, it was a way to save her life when she was young (episode eight: 'Missing Hearts' deals with this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Berdusk</div><div class="date">11-11-04, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skip the movie. Read Masamune Shirow's manga Ghost In The Shell. The movie tried to cover everything in there and failed. Then go watch the TV series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">11-11-04, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt she has access to the manga.  As for the movie 'failing', it's an excellent piece which stands on its own merit, independant of the manga and TV series.  I actually just watched it again yesterday for the first time since I bought my Dolby DTS receiver and the gunfights and The Puppetmaster's voice is so much better with a good sound system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you're a pretty elitist anime nerd, Ghost in the Shell is generally considered to be a pretty good anime movie.  One of the standards of the early introduction of anime into the United States.</div></div><hr />

It's a good show. You can watch the first movie, second movie, or series in any order you wish. But if you want to watch it in order that they came out, it's Ghost in the Shell Movie, then Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (26 episodes), then Ghost in the Shell: Innocence movie, then Ghost in the Shell: Second Gig.<br />
<br />
Something like that. But ultimately, you don't need to see it in any specific order.</div></div><hr />
