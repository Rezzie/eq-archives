With me being a complete newbie to tradeskills, could someone point me in the correct direction as to what I need to do to make some runes? (I dunno, I kinda liked the options that EQ1 had with tradeskills. I worked on doing one thing one day, and another thing another day. Having only one tree open to me is kinda disconcerting, and I want to make sure that what I want to do sticks.)<br />

Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

If any of you are hardcore tradeskillers with a rogue bent, feel free to write up an article. ;) We'd gladly post it!</div></div><hr />
