<br />
The Japanese ministry of foreign affairs is currently considering a plan to subsidize anime broadcasts in underdeveloped nations. The program would aim to foster understanding of the Japanese culture and help develop future anime markets.<br />
<br />
The Japanese government would not only pay for the TV broadcasting licenses, but would also function as a sponsor for the programs (this program brought to you by...) to the broadcasting stations. The plan would look to provide titles with worldwide appeal, such as popular soccer anime series. The purchase of a number of 30 minute / 20 episode series is being considered.<br />
<br />
Since December, a survey was conducted in African, Middle-Eastern and Asian nations to determine what Japanese anime are actually broadcast, and what kinds of anime are popular in the regions.<br />
<br />
Although the popularity of anime is rapidly growing in North America and Europe, its not currently very accessible in developing nations that have limited resources for media. <br />
<br />
Now I just have to get Arizona listed as an underdeveloped region.   ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it would be far cheaper to just take out a couple adds that say. &quot;Japan is a country full of lunatics, thats all you need to know&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
then they could put the money they save towards those robots AND get the message out :)</div></div><hr />
