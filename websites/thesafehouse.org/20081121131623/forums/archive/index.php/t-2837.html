Compiled by Zato<br />
<br />
This is a listing of all the information about poisons I could gather.  The credits from all the Rogues who helped are too lengthy to list.  But I must mention Sethric who posted the Poison book info.  There IS Honor amongst Thieves!<br />
<br />
First off, what does poison do?  Well, there are many different effects depending on the type of poison.  Once your weapon is poisoned you then have the chance of poisoning your foe when you hit.  If the poison effect is attempted on your foe (it CAN be resisted) the weapon is NO LONGER poisoned until another successful application is made to that weapon.  Also if you zone before the poison effect goes off, the weapon loses it's poison and must be re-applied.  Keep in mind that the poison is considered by the game to be a spell.  Thus if you are moving or are hit when the effect goes off, it will say your spell has been interrupted and the weapon is no longer poisoned!  Hopefully this is merely a bug.<br />
<br />
Poisons can be fully or partially resisted so resulting effects will vary.<br />

APPLYING POISON<br />
Simply sit and click a piercing weapon on a poison to apply it.<br />
<br />
The strength of the poison effects is directly related to your level.  So a level 50 Rogue can make a more potent Spider poison than a level 25 Rogue. Zato ThornBlade the Dwarven Rogue <br />
