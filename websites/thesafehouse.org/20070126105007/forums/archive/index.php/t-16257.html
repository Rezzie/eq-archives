<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithiun</div><div class="date">12-15-04, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So ya, the topic says it all, I can find axe, sword, club quests, but cant seem to find any with a good dagger as a result--thinking something compareable to Wingblade with a 15.8 dps rating.<br />
<br />
Or am I just shafted for a long time?  If so, what level should I look forward to being able to quest a good dagger?<br />
<br />
Are there any good daggers out there I can start hunting for as drops?<br />
<br />
Not looking for spoilers, just a quest name/quest giver, or mob/zone for drop.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips, if I find any I will post em here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biral</div><div class="date">12-17-04, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is don't buy anything. Save your money. There is a blue dagger drop in every instance at your level, wait for one of those, or for one of the green ones to drop. Go to Shadowfang Keep - Arugal drops a nice dagger, semi rare. Blackfathom depths - Serrakis drops a dagger (underwater btw). One BFD quest also gives a killer sword that i still use offhand at 37 (granted i could buy better but i'dr ather save my money for a mount at 40 thx). A nice one also drops off Viscious fallout in Gnomeregan. All of those daggers are semi rare but you will want to do them more then once, at least in my opinion, because exp in instances is great and quest exp rewards are generally good from instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llamas</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not exactly a level 22 dagger, but just continuing with what Biral was talking about, you can get some nice daggers in Scarlet Monestary.  I picked up two Torturing Pokers (20 and change DPS) in just three run-throughs, two of them solo.  That is also a good location to farm for mount money, especially for rogues.  Go into the left instance (with the torturers and the graveyard), and just avoid the group of 4 torturers in the main room there.  All of the others are in pairs, with one patroller.  Sap and kill, rinse, repeat.  I was able to clear both the humans and the outside part of the graveyard at level 40, aside from the group of 4 I mentioned.  The named torturer is the one who drops to Poker, from my experiences about one time in three.  He's a little bit rough, so be ready with evasion and a potion--sometimes I needed both, occasionally I didn't need either.</div></div><hr />
