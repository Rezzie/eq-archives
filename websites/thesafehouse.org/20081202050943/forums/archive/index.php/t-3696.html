I've skimmed some info on it but I have no idea how to actually spell it out.. And the few descriptions I've seen seem to be writen under the assumption that you already know what you're doing. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

Accessing Hot Keys In A Macro<br />
<br />
Simply use the following command in your macro to access a specific hotkey:<br />
<br />
/ui action toolbarSlot[xx]<br />
<br />
[xx] is a number 00-23 that directly relates to the slot (two banks of 12 slots, 24 total slots, starting at position 00).<br />
<br />
So, if I had a macro or command I wanted to execute in say the third slot on the first row of the toolbar I'd use the following:<br />
<br />
/ui action toolbarSlot02<br />
<br />
And this leads up to one of the BIGGEST questions ever...<br />
<br />
How to Equip/Unequip Items In A Macro<br />
<br />
So far, this is the only way I know how to do it since /equip, and /unequip do not work.<br />
Since you have a plethora of toolbars available, place all the items that you want into a toolbar or bars.<br />
I.E. weapons in one part, armor in the next, etc.<br />
<br />
To equip, simply use the same command as above, to unequip, call the command again on the same slot.<br />
For example, I have a pistol in the first slot, rifle in the second, and melee in the third. I want to equip my pistol (doing something in between), unequip it and equip my rifle, etc.<br />
<br />
/ui action toolbarSlot00 # This equips my pistol<br />
/doaction # I'm doin my thing.<br />
/ui action toolbarSlot01 # I need to equip my rifle<br />
/doaction2 # Taking potshots at the pedestrians from my porch, guzzling beer.<br />
/ui action toolbarSlot02 # Some fat slob's up in my face about shooting his dog, so now I'm gonna beat him <br />
senseless <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How To Change Toolbar Panes<br />
<br />
Similar to the above, you can change your toolbar panes in a macro. Say I want to have all my weapons in one toolbar, and all my armor in another. In order to use a macro to change to that pane, then call the appropriate slot, I need to first switch to that Toolbar Pane. Let's say I'm using Pane 6.<br />
<br />
/ui action toolbarPane05 <br />
<br />
Again, you actually have 12 toolbar panes, from 00 to 11. Why 12? Well, since each toolbar has two rows of possible slots, each toolbar then has two panes. A pane is a row. Let's leave it at that. You obviously need to be careful as to where you are placing items on your toolbar and remember that if you do NOT have it expanded to two rows, it will always be the odd number that you need to call.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/command;<br />
/pause X;<br />
/command;<br />
<br />
<br />
X is the ammount of time you want. 1=1 second 100=100 seconds etc</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">11-01-03, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.. another n00b question.. how do I turn this @#%$ off? I made a macro, tested it out, and it won't stop cycling. I dissconnect, it's still doing it when I logged back in (And in fact kept making the sound, even from the character select screen). I shut down SWG altogether, log back on, still doing it. The macro button doesn't seem to have an off command in the radial, the only way I can guess to stop it at this point is to just delete it. <br />
<br />
I only programed 8 actions (yeah yeah, flourishes) divided by pauses, so it shouldn't have even continued to go that many times, unless macros automatically repeat? <br />
<br />
Hlep.<br />

Edit: Nm, someone sent me a page that clears everything up. Edited by: Jhani Vandolay  at: 11/1/03 1:49 pm</div></div><hr />
