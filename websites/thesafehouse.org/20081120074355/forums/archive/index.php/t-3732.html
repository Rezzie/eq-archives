<br />
Backstab damage is what has given rogues their edge damage wise over other duel wielding melees so it stands to reason that backstab damage must increase as weapon ratios get better or that edge will disapear entirely.<br />
<br />
It would seem to me that if you compare the kunark era standards to pot class weapons that ratios still have improved quite a bit more than base bs.  Whether this is so in reality and whether this is balanced I couldn't say.</div></div><hr />

The next closest dagger is only 17 physical dmg right? (not counting bane)  And a killer proc too, IMO.<br />
<br />
Just have to evade more I suppose, and/or have another aggro reducing proc in offhand as well.<br />
<br />
Negative 200 resist adjust on the proc as well, and poison based, very unlikely to be resisted. Edited by: Skewert at: 8/3/03 9:41 pm</div></div><hr />

Huh?<br />
<br />
150 damage == 150 hate (your claim)<br />
Proc reduces 150 hate.<br />
<br />
So proc generates zero net aggro.<br />

150 damage and 150 hate reduction balance each other out. What you failed to take into account, which the original poster pointed out, was that there still remains a -60 dex debuff. Ergo, the proc generates aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean i came into PoTime with 305 unbuffed in all melee stats and now after i got some Time loot i dropped to 250 agi but my str and sta and dex are getting much higher OVER the cap every time. I really dont know what the loot designers are dreaming when they put str sta int wis on nearly every item i mean if u are in Time u have maxed out these stats already with more (sometimes much much more) than 100 points over the cap and u get even more every item u get while other stats getting lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you care so much about not having the resists YOU wanted, quit now since this is by far the best dagger for a rogue of all time along with having a unique pimp look. the dmg/dly is what matters, not the fact it has +25 to two resists instead of like +15 to all like you'd hope for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rage of Incapacitation has poison counters.  That's where it's aggro comes from, similiar to why tash is a lot more aggro than malo.  Cripples aggro comes from the ac debuff, not the dex or agil.  Stat debuffs have very little aggro.<br />

so we got <br />
-150 hate<br />

pretty nice btw against rampagers but i wonder if the rogues getting it really wanted a -60 dex when -200 resist DDs are usually +agro anyway.<br />

<br />
I was only under the impression that the resist adjust on a spell only factored into whether an NPC/PC resisted the spell, not having anything to do with +hate?<br />
<br />
IE, Mob X has 100 Poison resist against spells without a resist adjust, but this spell checks against said mob as if it had -100 PR.<br />
<br />
Necro's lifetaps are pretty much all -200 Magic resist adjust, why they are so rarely resisted, but they're usually low aggro compared to other nukes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(that is unless a resisted proc deals the same amount of aggro as a non-resisted would)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Izzuri</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 12:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience you get the same amount of aggro if the proc is resisted. You might get more as the lower aggro part is resisted aswell.<br />

Haven't looked further into it than a gutfeeling when using Tendonslicer though, so can't say for sure.</div></div><hr />

Procs are the same agro whether they are resisted or not.  If anything, it means less agro because the proc is resisted less (hence the 150 hate reducing part lands more and reduces agro).  All around a badass dagger, anyone that complains about this dagger should be shot.</div></div><hr />

Not that Ingenuity was hugely useful when I was swinging Ifir/GRMK combo.</div></div><hr />

Does nothing for DoD or Inny Dagger, does nothing for Quarm Hammer, and nothing for rathe sword. That would definitely be a wish list thing for me. Let DoD and Inny dagger procs crit. A nice crit proc on DoD would put it in line with Khala deaggro. <br />
<br />
I beg to differ about ingenuity being worthless. I have 5 procs going off all the time . I get crit blasts quite often also .. its not a big major DPS adder, but its nice to have to add some extra DPS in here and there.</div></div><hr />

Once you have a JTB and slap on the Dmg aug. Ingenuity does what??? nothing, nothing at all. You have a dagger that is uneffected by ingenuity. Lets go even further and say u get Quarms hammer and you put on ur favorite aug proc to it. WOW, ingenuity only helps you on the aug proc u put on the Quarm hammer.<br />

Do you understand what he was trying to say now?</div></div><hr />

I have JTB and DoD offhand and I use Ruj Venom for JTB and Flaming Blade for DoD. I also use the poison off stanos pants so I have 4 dmg procs and 3 of them can crit.  I was unaware of any base dmg adders Type 8, Unless there is a Hard Raid one that I don't know about?</div></div><hr />

Was in the serverwide rogue channel at least about 2 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />
