Anyone else notice a change with this ? Not sure if this might be a bug, a fix, or just me being dumb.</div></div><hr />

He also gave make poison as an option to train, it just had the train button greyed out like the skill was maxed and can not be trained anymore.</div></div><hr />

Then moved to Stanos to finish it to 250 (had the plat and skill points, didn't have the patience).<br />

I was about 157 skill when I started to use skill points. - - - - - - -<br />
