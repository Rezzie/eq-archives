We at TG believe very firmly that it’s important to recruit good people even more so than good gamers. While we seek excellence in gaming and online competition, we want your real life to be first priority, seeking excellence in life ahead of all things. TG is a family. We dream, cry and laugh together in games and in life.<br />
<br />
In everything we do, we adhere strictly to The Code. The Code is an operational manual or guidelines for our behavior in-game and in our online communications via the forums, voice chat, or text chat. By applying to The Guardians you agree to adhere to this Code in all online interactions you make.<br />
<br />
Joining The Guardians isn’t about joining us for a single game. Once you’re family, you’re family in all our endeavors. Everyone will have their main game, but we allow every member to play within any of our divisions.<br />
<br />
As you apply, officers and division leaders from all our divisions will have a chance to review your application. We will certainly take into account your qualifications as a gamer, but we are more concerned with the person behind the avatar, so we involved all leadership in the appointment of new members.</div></div><hr />
