<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-20-05, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, We've talked time and time again about Fansubbed and unlisenced anime, not it's time to review what's come over onto the shelves here in the US. I'm slightly tipsy (you can guess why (http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=20018)) so forgive any spelling mistakes and such, ya?<br />
<br />
<br />
Last Exile:  Me like. Great CG balanced with animation typically reserved for movies or OVA's. Great soundtracks as well, Dolce Triade does some great work. Story never quite tells you everything that's ever happened, and you're often left to accept things at face value with no history given, but that should only cause a problem for people with no ability to accept the suspension of disbelief. <br />
<br />
Elfen Lied: Still watching. Me liking. Your standard Chobits case of 'cute girl that can only say one word mysteriously shows up one day' meets Kill Bill esque massive amount of bloodletting due to her other personality happens to be a raging psychopath with spooky mind powers. Pretty dark series, some of the trauma incurred by various people makes Evangelion look downright normal. (Mommy, I don't like Daddy... WHACK) :blink <br />
So, in summary:  Chobits + Evangellion + Kill Bill = Elfen Lied.<br />
<br />
FLCL: Yeah, it's been out for a long time, but it's still one of the most bizarrely kick-ass anime there is, period.<br />
<br />
Read Or Die TV: Me like. Three sisters that can 'use' paper by forming it into whatever shape they want just by thinking about it go on guard duty for a Japanese author. What initally is an action series quickly becomes more as plots and characters from the OVA come into play, leading to some very well-scripted drama intermixed with some imaginitive action scenes using simple paper. <br />
<br />
Gunslinger Girl: One of the most beautifully tragic anime, ever. A must-see.<br />
<br />
Maburaho: Me NOT like. It's hard to think that you could actually screw up a magic shool story, but what starts out promising just doesn't go as far as it could have. If you could only use magic 8 times in your life; and you'd die upon using #8, you'd prolly not use it to, say, magically restore someone's lunch that they dropped. I mean WTF. Granted, he's also the typical 'guy that's beset upon by every woman in the school cause his child will be a super-powerful mage due to the bloodline he carries', but for some odd reason he never even tries to get busy with anyone, even his childhood friend that claims to be his wife. Can we have a character that acts like a guy at some point, and starts his own harem, please???<br />
<br />
Haibane Renmei: Oh so wonderful story. Putting into words without spoiling anything is hard (I watched it the first time with no prior knowledge), but let me say that if you like a touching, well-told story involving people with angellic charcoal-grey wings in a warm small town setting that feels like it's out of a Miyazaki film, this is a definate must see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Me tired. Add some more, folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunavae</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just picked up Elfen Lied the other day, I love it so far, hopefully it continues to be just as good.  The transition between Nyu and Lucy is downright scary at times. Mew! =^.^=<br />
<br />
I'll have to check out Gunslinger Girl.<br />
<br />
I'll add:<br />
<br />
Steel Angel Kurumi (+Encore &amp;amp; 2):  I just finished Kurumi a little bit ago, the first series is pretty good.  It's got a decent amount of &quot;fan service&quot; but still delivers a serious plot at times.  If you want an even amount of comedy, swearing, action and nudity with your hyperactive anime girl taking lead, Kurumi will most likely do it for you.  I didn't care for the Kurumi 2 as much as the first series, but that's just based on the fact it seemed more like a school / drama take on the first plot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last Exile was pimp.  Best artwork I've seen in an anime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... the Gunslinger Girl is awesome, of course. The box it came with is one of the best I've seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to PlanetES being released. Elfin Lied was ok if only for the blood and service, but it does not have much else going for it.<br />
<br />
Read or Die is great as usual. I'm loving Popotan.<br />
<br />
Haha this is harder to do than I thought. I've seen most of my DVD collection on fansubs before buying them, so it's not like I can rate the series itself. But for the DVD releases...<br />
<br />
Scrapped Princess LE was cool, the Pacificia figure stands at about 12&quot;. But I'm not too happy with it because it is misproportioned and her posture is terrifyingly unnatural. But the other LE figures look to be much better, hopefully.<br />
<br />
Gunslinger Girl came with a wonderful box. Even the cardboard insert is beautiful. The wallpaper is nice. You can buy some of those plastic tubes and hang it, they should only cost a dollar or two. Mine fit in the tube perfectly without falling out.<br />
<br />
Read or Die book box was really cool. But I also plan to buy the box with figure that comes with volume 7. I've seen the figure and it looks really nice.<br />
<br />
The Ai Yori Aoshi ~Enishi~ Gashapon were a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
Onegai Twins had a lot of neat extras, just like Onegai Teacher.<br />
<br />
The Fullmetal Alchemist tin box was awesome. I'm also looking forward to GitS:SAC box.<br />
<br />
The Midori Days (Midori no Hibi) box came with a T-Shirt. While Midori is cute, the graphic itself is very blurry if you look closely. And god-damn, that shirt is huge. I'm 6'0 and 220 and the shirt is way too big for me.<br />
<br />
Last Exile with Alvis figure and Range Murata mousepad was awesome.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's dump my Netflix queue out here and see what we've got... <br />
 <br />
Azumanga Daioh - A set of vignettes around a group of high school girls.  Cute and just slightly twisted.  A great low-energy comedy that produces some really memorable characters and visuals.  One of the best series I've seen in a while. <br />
 <br />
Excel Saga - If you're reading this thread, chances are you don't need me to tell you about Excel Saga.  Worth watching, it's got its funny moments ands Menchi is doubleplus awesome, but it also just tries too hard in a lot of places and falls flat.  I think a more coherent storyline could have really pulled it all together. <br />
 <br />
Last Exile - I haven't really gotten into Last Exile like a lot of people.  It's very stylish, but the story just isn't doing it for me. <br />
 <br />
His and Her Circumstances - The famous Kare Kano, Gainax does highschool romantic comedy.  I've only seen the first disc so far and its hovering at the edge of a thumbs up, could go either way. <br />
 <br />
Haibane-Renmei - /second Lenilya.  Beautiful and touching and just remarkable.  It's better if you go in blind. <br />
 <br />
Ai Yori Aoshi - Netflix kicked this one out at me as a Recommended, but I'm not sure why.  Pretty standard harem comedy so far, decent but not special. <br />
 <br />
Texhnolyze - Wow, freaky.  Your dystopian future setting, dark, brooding and bloody.  I found the first disc pretty blah but the action started to pick up at the end of the second.  Number three is sitting on my table right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does &quot;fan service&quot; mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It means, well, &quot;service&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some things that are called fanservice would be... panty shots, swimsuit episodes, revealing clothing, suggestive positions, gratitious nudity. A fanservice show would be Love Hina, Girls Bravo, Futakoi Alternative, He is my Master.<br />
<br />
But even &quot;non-fanservce shows&quot; have service in it, like One Piece (Nami's magic boobs and bra shot, and the bath scene) Naruto's Sexy no Jutsu, etc.<br />
<br />
I've also heard it referred to in mecha anime, where the detail of a mecha is &quot;fanservice&quot;. But I hardly ever watch any mecha so I don't really understand what it means in this context.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunavae</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excel Saga is one of my favorites. ^_^  A lot of my friends find Excel to be highly annoying but I &amp;lt;3 her.  She keeps me entertained with her high-speed voice and poor Menchi is awesome too. ~_~ *comfort Menchi*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">05-21-05, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, Fan Service is when a situation happens for no other reason than to produce a sexual result as a 'service' to the 'fans' (thus, fan service. clever, huh?)<br />
<br />
Fanservice to me at least doesn't matter, as long as it's not forced. Here's an example of the situations that would make me think wether or not something was really fanservice-based:<br />
<br />
In Love Hina, you have a dorm at a hot spring. of COURSE there's going to be girls in towels. And, amazingly, not a panty shot in sight- even super-hyper Kaolla in a short skirt never once flashes the camera. Nothing is really 'forced' at all, execpt for the potato-stew event, and the dress Mutsumi is wearing. So, as opposed to the rest of the world, I didn't really register Love Hina as fanservice-y. <br />
<br />
Now, in Love Hina Again, suddenly we have half naked characters wandering around for no reason, and a bevvy of panty shots where suddenly there were none. Fanservice, ahoy. That is an example of my definition. Course, It's just my opinion, so take it as you will.</div></div><hr />
