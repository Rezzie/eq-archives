Why can't we have totally invisibility? I really can't see the logic in including Rogues in Vanguard unless you're willing and able to stick to the foundations of what a rogue is.

Swag would be dead on here. Honestly I really fail to see why anyone would possibly want to pvp in a level based game like this...such rediculously unbalanced pvp =/<br />

I will take freeshard UO PVP over this any day.</div></div><hr />

I tried sneaking on someone, used Ravage, Knee Break, Flash, Backstab...and they couldn't do anything until Backstab was done...HAD i gotten the critical, i would have had 2 backstabs within 8 seconds of each other. Now, it felt good to be on par with that Psioniscist. We were both lvl 15's...i ALMOST had him...i just kept missing the last 2 or 3 big hits i needed to off him...it was all good fun. Had i used Hemorrhidge or Lacerate, he would have also died. :) So, Rogue has been fixed somewhat, and now we're a threat. Feels good...really good. It's not that every class should be almighty, it's that every class should take skill to be a force to reckon with in PvP. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will fix the main game and then worry about pvp. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most PVP servers(regardless of the game) are split into 2 groups.<br />
<br />
Group 1 - Those that made the character for no other reason then to just pvp all day 24/7, they take pride and joy in killing other players and causing them set backs. <br />
<br />
Group 2 - This group of players made characters on the PVP server for the extra challenge. They don't pvp 24/7 but they like the option being there if someone ticks them off. <br />
<br />
<br />
I personally am in group 2. I know all of you guys have had someone that has come into your camp and stole a named monster, or trained you on purpose, or whatnot. Well on the FFA server you have to option to make that person kiss the group when they do that. which is why I choose to play there, not because I want to kill people 24/7, if I wanted to do that I would go play a 1st person shooter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pedigru</div><div class="date">02-24-07, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But there are always moments like today. <br />
<br />
After my partner was ganked by 4 RPKers who quickly moved up the road and nearer to the bindstone to catch my partner a second time.  They made the mistake of splitting up...perhaps they fell for his feign death...but the sorc chased my partner to me while the others remained behind for some reason.<br />
<br />
It was my very first crit-stun-shank...but didn't make it to the third chain. I saw in a big font the numbers 1438 and heard the ching sound of coin being paid.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I nearly cried.<br />
<br />
Then I focused and saw an infamy hit of 117. A true kodac moment.</div></div><hr />
