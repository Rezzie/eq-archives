<br />
It seems that the Trap line skill that is granted to casters and the like does not go off if you pass though stealthed. I also found out soon as you unstealth it DOES go off.<br />
<br />
Hope this little tidbit helps.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the level of the person applying the trap versus your stealth skill, kind of like in PvE mobs 'uncovering you'. If you get 'uncovered' it goes off. After all, we are rogues and dealing with traps is one of the things we are known for, at least in other games. <br />
Would also like to see some kind of detect/disarm traps ability based on stealth. Like you get a message 'There is a trap nearby' if you don't set it off, and then you can click a Disarm button, but if you screw it up theres another chance for it to go boom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those casters should be glad we don't have the ability to remove them as well.</div></div><hr />

I had a couple hit me last night whil stealthed.  I was travelling with a group though, so it is possible one of the door-bangers may have triggered it and I just got cought in the blast.</div></div><hr />

It seems much more appropriate for a rogue to set traps than a runemaster.   Thrax Wormtongue41 season SB Guinevere</div></div><hr />

It was also advertised for Runemasters, and using runes to set magical traps makes sense too. Ciardha Sidhe, Elven Nightshade of Guinevere<br />
