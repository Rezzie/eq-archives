<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">10-12-02, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, this goes for any system really:<br />
<br />
try to know the rules as best you can, it cuts down on in-session book reading and arguing.<br />
<br />
if a player is doing something you know is wrong, or says YOU got a rule wrong, either look it up very quickly or tell them that things run how *you* want until the end of the session, when you can look it up and know to change things if you were wrong for the next time you play.<br />
<br />
try to get your players to keep focused on the game - nothing annoys me more then when I'm trying to run something and people in the group are constantly blurting out stupid @#%$ that has nothing at all to do with the session, or even gaming in general. out of context talk should be saved for before or after the game, or maybe during a lunch/dinner break if you play around then.<br />
<br />
try to come up with a fairly concrete story and good set of encounters. don't hesitate to write anything and everything down, scratch paper is your friend   but also be prepared for the players to go completely away from your plans, as that's often the way it happens. having a quick mind for impromptu situations &amp;amp; characters really helps, but obviously takes practice.<br />
<br />
those're a few suggestions :P Edited by: Matheren at: 10/12/02 3:29:57 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
And about people talking about non-game related stuff in the game, I find that very annoying also while playing!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">10-15-02, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2nd edition? I have a very simple piece of advice for DMing second edition. Don't.<br />
<br />
More generally, there are two ways of GMing.<br />
<br />
Type 1) The Cunning Plan.<br />
<br />
Type 2) Wing it.<br />
<br />
I am a type 2, so correct for bias.<br />
<br />
Type 1.<br />
<br />
What you need: <br />
30 Reams of A4 writing paper.<br />
30 Reams of A4 squared paper.<br />
A length of 2x4 with a nail through it.<br />
<br />
The type 1 GM is the type who has the entire adventure written up in advance. Every NPC is detailed, every monster set, every square foot mapped, every incident planned. The PCs commence the adventure at the beginning and proceed until the end.<br />
<br />
Pros. The possibilities for a very detailed plot are greater. With careful preparation, intricate strands can be woven into a fine tapestry.<br />
<br />
Consistency is easier to achieve with the whole game prepared in advance.<br />
<br />
Cons. The PCs have very limited free will. Some such games may have a few branches where the PCs get actual choices, but these are usually little more than choosing the order encounters are done in. It is simply impossible to adequately detail a larger number of choices.<br />
<br />
Large amounts of time are required. If you and your friends find yourselves with a free evening, 'why doesn't someone run something' is not an option.<br />
<br />
Losing your notes is a campaign shattering catastrophe.<br />
<br />
Carrying your notes is near-impossible....<br />
<br />
Type 2:<br />
<br />
What you need.<br />
<br />
1 Pad of paper.<br />
A couple of maps of useful places the PCs are bound to go for.<br />
A solid general understanding of what's going on where.<br />
Timeline.<br />
<br />
The Type 2 GM has a good understanding of the world and what's happening, and a grasp of what relevant NPCs are up to. They then run there game with events happening according to a timeline (with frequant rewrites) and the PCs react to it.<br />
<br />
Pros. The PCS have far more free will. They can do what they like, and their choices really mean something.<br />
<br />
The world is far more lifelike and less mechanical. There can be far more variety too, city adventures work far better this way.<br />
<br />
The GM needs far fewer notes; basically only a Continuity @#%$-up Avoidance Pad. Every time a fact about the world is established (names mostly) it goes on the pad for future reference. The CCAP (and that's &quot;see-cap&quot;, not &quot;see-cup&quot; thank you) may need rationalising from time to time, but that's it.<br />
<br />
Preparation time very low.<br />
<br />
Cons: Plots can't be as intiricate: hard to keep track of, and PCs have a tendency to wander off.<br />
<br />
Harder work on the day. You need to think fast, on your feet, and if you're tired or run dry the game can go downhill fast. Still, you can just have a ninja assassin burst in. Fights are great for stalling for time to think, and there's always SOMEONE who wants to bump the PCs off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">10-15-02, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend towards being type 2.  I find that once I set up the political situation in the area sufficiently well, and with enough conflicting factions and motivations, there is plenty of opportunity for the PCs to get into trouble or go looking for it.  Some lord or another is always coming up with a plot that just needs a few hirelings or manipulatable fools to pull it off...<br />
<br />
Setting your campaing on a frontier is good too, because frontiers tend not to be dominated by hugely powerful established interests, who, really, would just squash any uppity PCs like bugs should they prove an annoyance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">10-16-02, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AD&amp;amp;D second edition is a very poor roleplaying game. You so want to be using 3rd, which is okay.<br />
<br />
Reasons 1) Very limited scope.<br />
Fundamentally, 2ed is about combat. If you want to do anything else, forget it. There is at least a skills system bolted on, but it's very limited and fits poorly. This is not to mention the thieves skills/proficiencies issue; No other system has ever had two completely different and incompatible skills system in one game, and with good reason.<br />
<br />
2) Classes lack balance. Fighters do okay, Mages suck righteously at lower levels but get better later. Clerics are very very dull to play, since they have the duty of filling up with healing spells and never doing anything else, and don't even get me started about thieves.<br />
<br />
3) Legion of the superclones: All classes of a certain level are the same. No choice. The only exception to this are mages. Stats do cause some difference, which leads us on to;<br />
<br />
4) Capitalist in the extreme. Random stats (I hate them) with only the extremes actually making any difference. Not only that, but the classes actively worsen balance by ensuring that the character who is already unbalanced by rolling good stats is made even more unbalanced, as those stats provide access to cooler, more powerful classes like the paladin and specialist mage. The weaker stated character gets no perks at all, and the Have Nots, Have Lots gap never narrows.<br />
<br />
Woeful inconsistency of system: There are three major task resolution systems; Combat and saves are d20 high, proficiences are d20 low, and skills are d100 low. There are also several others such as bend bars, spell resistance, System shock, etc. Several of these work poorly, and/or are inflexible. For example, Spell resistance, being a percentage, makes high level mages and low level mages just as easy to resist. Saves are specific to certain attack forms, with others being included by being bolted on to vaguely similar ones.<br />
<br />
The only reason to play second edition was the very high quality and quantity of the support material; adventures, campaigns, and settings. Since these are all more or less compatible with 3rd edition, which corrects MOST of the problems above, there is really no reason at all to stick with 2nd ed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">10-16-02, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just start a campaign with 2 simple rules.<br />
<br />
1) You aren't allowed to do anything that will make me have to change my terrain map.  Its in ink on paper.  The political map is a cellophane overlay, go to town on that one.<br />
<br />
2) Anything you do to the NPCs they, or their next of kin, will be able to do back to you.  Think before you do anything too abusive, such as hiring the worlds greatest assassin to get rid of a troublesome baron.  He WILL have zero chance against such an assassin, and end up dead.  Then it will be established that there is an assassin out there who can kill a nobleman despite all his guards, wards, and castle walls.  And you're much easier targets than that...</div></div><hr />

Demihuman Dieties<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BD Nightfall</div><div class="date">10-16-02, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I already a lot of 2 ed. books.  Buying new, 3d. books is expensive.  <br />
<br />
I have (as memory serves...) Player's Handbook, DM Book, Demihuman Dieties, Faiths and Avatars, all spell books for priests AND mages, Spells and Magic, Priest's Handbook, Psionist's Handbook, Tome of Magic, Monstrous Manual, and an Arms book....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">10-16-02, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll only need the 3rd edition PHB. All the other books are trivial to convert. It'll normally be obvious what sort of save a spell uses, and monster stats aren't very different at all.<br />
<br />
And Jhani, yeah sure. Great books. Which made it all the more frustrating that I never got to use any of them, since I had to mem healing spells all the damn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">10-16-02, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;what? a dweomercaster? what class is that? huh? specialty priest?&quot;<br />
<br />
that really sums up one of the other problems with 2nd edition, that of course 3e is already heading towards - when the players own more books than the gm (assuming your group only has one or two people that like gm'ing), then it all of a sudden becomes VERY annoying when each character has a million different spells/abilities/kits/whatever from some book they bought. <br />
<br />
if your players own other books that you haven't read, make SURE that you either read said books *before* character creation, or flat out ban them. better to try and read them, or at least the things your players will want to use, so you don't have whining players for the rest of the campaign</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymm</div><div class="date">10-18-02, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most important rule of running a campaign in my opinion, make the players work for it.<br />
<br />
Always be willing to adjust on the fly so the players are working for their goal.  If you see the NPCs are trivial for a party, give em a couple of levels, or create a 'boss' for them that will be a challenge.  By the same token, if you suddenly realize that an encounter is going to go horribly and kill the entire party then you need to come up with a way to 'fix' that without breaking the roleplay.<br />
<br />
If you're doing it right, the players will never know that things didn't go exactly as you planned all along.  They'll never realize that the 5th level ogre mage was generated on the fly nor will they realize that you 'forgot' to roll spell resistance on those 6 fiendish dire bears. - Nymm<br />
