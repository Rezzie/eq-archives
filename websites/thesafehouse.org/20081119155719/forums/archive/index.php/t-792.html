<br />
all i can think of right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astlin</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not in beta and so my primary source of information is the WoW beta boards.  I am sure these questions will be asked a hundred times, but maybe by asking once more it will bring a little dev love our way.<br />
<br />
1) Will the Rogue be given anything to make them more appealing to a group?<br />
<br />
As I read the forums I am a little concerned that Rogues will be one of the last ones in line when it comes to getting into a group.  I understand that Sap was overpowered and that they do not want to make it a 'mez all and fight one' game.  At the same time a Rogue needs something that makes them wanted in a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) It appears that the Mage can do anything a Rogue can do but better.  Are there any plans to give each of these classes there own niche?<br />
<br />
A Mage has high damage output (at range), Invisibility, and can open locks.  I am not asking for a nerf to the Mage, every class should be fun to play.  I am just worried that the abilities of these two classes are too similar.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Does the Rogue get the 'Unarmed Weapon' skill?  Does this line of weapons include Wolverine style claws?  Are the weapons in this line as varied and on par with daggers, swords and axes?<br />
<br />
This one was for my wife.  She was Unarmed in AC and likes 'unarmed' style combat characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Are you considering relaxing the Race/Class limitations?  Would it be possible to allow Humans to play Druids?<br />
<br />
I am trying to bring as many of my guild mates to WoW with me as I can.  This change would make a few of them very happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Fricka<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arafain</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, rogues can learn unarmed combat style, even now.<br />
<br />
Fricka, I have a suggestion or two that I would like for you to pass along.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that rogues need to fill the role of the 'utility melee' class.  Along with the damage ability rogues currently have, they also need to be able to either negatively affect enemies in some unique way or positively affect allies.  I would suggest that rogues be given a finishing move that is an attack speed slow, unique to the class, that would make them much more viable.  The mechanics could be set up to be similar to both slice and dice and cheap shot, where the higher the number of combo counters, the longer the slow lasts, and a single monster cannot be slowed more than 3 times by a single player.  Also, require that this finishing move be performed from the rear.  This would make the skill much more group-friendly, and still viable for solo thanks to Gouge, but not overpowered.  This also provides stackability for both other rogues and for warriors and their Thunderclap skill.<br />
<br />
Another idea, probably not as well-thought-out, but worth mentioning would be the exchange of the Backstab and Ambush skills for Sneak Attack and Stealth Attack - instead of adding damage to a single attack that takes place off the timer, Sneak Attack would add a &quot;buff&quot; to the rogue for 6 seconds, with a 10-second cooldown, that would cause all attacks during that window to do 150% damage.  This would allow a great deal of variety between Rogues and make both fast and slow weapons viable for different types of sneak attacks.  Stealth Attack would be the same, but cause 250% damage and only be usable from stealth (and would break stealth when used).  Currently there is a great deal of controversy about Swords and Daggers, and their usability for Backstab - some feel Rogues should not be able to backstab with swords, due to their higher damage.  However, others feel that restricting rogues from using anything but daggers in their mainhand is a poor idea.  I think that the beta period would be an invaluable time to test such an idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Release date of game?<br />
<br />
**** I wish I could be there this year.<br />
<br />
Also, when you see Tigole tell em i said he rocks!<br />
<br />
<br />
and WTF is furor doing on the payroll?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, can you bring a copy of my resume? I'll be at Firaxis this summer and possibly more, but if they take interns/have openings get me t3h m4d h00kupz11!!<br />
<br />
They probably won't have a release date, or won't commit to one.<br />
<br />
So how about cross platform support. I haven't read a lot, but what does the Mac side of this look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kroe</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a good qestion you can ask them &quot;So what's it like being cool enough to have beautiful women from rogue gaming boards come and interview you?&quot;<br />
<br />
;) /stalkermodeoff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JookaWoo</div><div class="date">05-05-04, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">any dynamic content planned for the PvP servers or just generic turn your switch on type stuff? screw instanced battlegrounds, put em on the real map.  <br />
<br />
why did you ruin the rogue class this push and replace them w/ of all classes, the mage?<br />
<br />
best dmg<br />
unlock chests<br />
invis as good as stealth from my reading<br />
teleports<br />
CC<br />
<br />
any reason not to play one vs a rogue? they are seemingly more roguely now.  :crazy <br />
<br />
<br />
seems the did the same to priests this push and put them into there EQ state of heal/buff/rez. woopee!<br />
<br />
<br />
god why do they copy EQ so fricken much. it only leads down the same path EQ travels and puts us through the same amount of crap SoE did. Its like tivo of the last 4 years of EQ w/ new textures installed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikus</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Fricka, (sweetheart)  :naughty <br />
<br />
Got some questions:<br />
<br />
- Are Rogues supposed to be the highest noncasting dmg class ?<br />
- How much are Druids in Catform different from rogues in group play?<br />
- After 2h Dmg was increased (patched) to be on par with dualwielding where is the favor on using 2 weapons at a same time ? <br />
Sounds logical there should be one, otherwise DMG shields will kill rogues in PvP to easily.<br />
<br />
BTW Vallon Zek rulez *harharhar*<br />
<br />
Thx in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzena</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a good one for you, Fricka. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fricka</div><div class="date">05-06-04, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feedback guys!<br />
<br />
&quot;European beta sign-up is planned for when?&quot; hehe eager Itzena? ;)<br />
<br />
Dikus, though ye are a dwarf I'll have to agree about VZ ruling.<br />
<br />
These questions are also great because they are good brainstorming points too for more questions. Hmm I may have to ask them in 2 sessions.</div></div><hr />
