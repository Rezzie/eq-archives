<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-15-03, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the EQ book. I have 3 friends who are interested in doing some EQRPG. That makes four of us, three of us are familiar with EQ. I will probably DM or at least begin DM'ing primarily because I am initiating and leading this whole idea.<br />
<br />
What would be an easy campaign idea which would help me more understand the DM conception?<br />
<br />
For instance, can I just pick a quest out of EQ, a newbie quest, give them all their gear, start them in a city and expect them to do it? What information do I give beforehand or is discovered in the campaign?<br />
<br />
How can I give them the right PC conception?<br />
<br />
What do they need to know before they begin about the game itself? What do I need to teach them and how do I learn that in the first place?<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Think the Sparring Program in the Matrix. I am not looking here for a two week nightly campaign. I am looking for something more of a tutorial feel, which will help me to learn the ropes of DM'ing and them the ropes of RP'ing. Something which would include small NPC interaction, some combat, etc.<br />
<br />
A few quests (preferably in-game EQ quests) here and there that we could go through one by one and then step out into imagination.<br />
<br />
My problem here is that I have no foundation and neither do they. Three of us have a foundation in EQ, and all of us are familiar with RPG's, but this is the next level. This is them stepping into the RPG themself, and me stepping out over the RPG.<br />
<br />
I need some advice here, I need to know the answers to stupid questions and I am so ingorant I do not even know to ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As this isn't a serious game, buff them to mid level and set them off on a mid level quest.<br />
<br />
But, instead of it going like it does in EQ, it goes horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Ghoulbane, perhaps. They spend most of their money hiring a wizard to teleport them around and provide damage for them. When they finally get to the quest giver, thieves show up, kill the quest giver, and the wizard ports out with the thieves and ghoulbane.<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps that could turn into a serious game. Sensei Pren,<br />

You've been using that one almost since the last movie came out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorax S</div><div class="date">05-16-03, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started an EQRPG game about 2 months ago, first time DMing in about 4 years, I started them off in Freeport working for the Militia getting Orc belts now they've moved on to Befallen doing the quest in the Player's Handbook (The ghost guy). It is working out pretty well, I had to increase difficulty on a few encounters I had thought up for the game cause I noticed that things aren't as hard as they appear in this game. The magic system works much better for longer fights then the D&amp;amp;D spell system does. Only 1 other person in the group has played EQ and they are really enjoying the game alot. The other 5 members of the group (Yeah I made it 6 people just like EQ hehe) all play D&amp;amp;D and Star Wars RPGs about 3-4 times a week and they have said they love EQs system over D&amp;amp;Ds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">05-16-03, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple of small modules floating around that would probably suit your needs.  Highway Robbery and Homestead Attacks are the names of a couple that you can download, both designed for lower levels if I remember correctly. You can download both from www.eqrpg.com/eqrpg/downloads.html <br />

Wish I could find all that in .txt form or something not so graphic intensive, makes my computer go into labor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargesh</div><div class="date">05-16-03, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kambic<br />
I just converted highway robbery to rtf and mailed it too you.<br />
It looses a lot, but it might be easier to work with. I also misnamed it, it should appear as Homestead Attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">05-17-03, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank I appreciate it, this makes it much easier :)<br />
<br />
I think with cutting out some unnecessary stuff might be feasible to print it now ;)</div></div><hr />
