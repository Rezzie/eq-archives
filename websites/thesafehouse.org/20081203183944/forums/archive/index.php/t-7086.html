<br />
Ancient spells are not designed so that everyone should have them, more thought to be something which will set apart the casters who have fought the games worst beasts, rather like us melee can get special weapons or armor from those same top bosses which is more powerful than what the average melee has. Casters can also get armor or weapons, but since those items do not to the same extent as for melee make them more powerful than just the average player, the Ancient spells were added.<br />
<br />
Ancient spells were added to the game in a rather odd fashion, first some bug reportedly made them drop from non-boss mobs, then they did not drop at all for several months. Now they do drop, but good luck in getting one  .</div></div><hr />
