<br />
What kind of experience do you have so far? You can even post (!!!) if you werent playing a rogue till now. The more experience the better it is.<br />
<br />
As far as I heard that Druids and Shamans (if well played) are the powerclasses in PvP. <br />
- Druids root and nuke and change form if things go worse<br />
- Shaman can melee / nuke / debuff alot<br />
<br />
Paladins and Priest are hard to kill for any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">11-08-04, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to say really,as a warrior i have killed every class in the game and been killed by them.<br />
<br />
overall i would say,that classes are reasonably balanced. this might change with the latest patch,as alot of things were added and alot of things were changed.<br />
<br />
i think its more a matter of knowing the classes,and there strengths and weaknesses then saying that Class X is the best.In normal pvp situations,the group,or people who get the jump are usually going to win anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SnibbsQ</div><div class="date">11-08-04, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what it sounds like, though, Hunters and...something else, I forget which because Hunters and Rogues are the only classes I'm really interested in, but Hunters and whatever really, really suck in PvP. Anyone who actually played to verify this? Also heard rogues are pretty well off in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caowyth</div><div class="date">11-08-04, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunters are balanced across their pet, which unfortunately means that they really aren't that great if you ignore the pet and focus on them exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">11-08-04, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunter needs to get the drop on the target instead of vice versa.  If he can start opening up from afar while pet goes at the target he will do a lot better than if caught flat footed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tavr</div><div class="date">11-09-04, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogues will tear through cloth and leather wearing classes, its the plate ones that you have to be careful of. It also depends on your build, and if you have the upper hand of an ambush.<br />
<br />
With sprint you can run away, or chase a fleeing enemy. <br />
<br />
Pally's before the changes were fairly fubar, but who knows now. <br />
<br />
Just dont be undead :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">11-09-04, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Undead need no longer fear Undead.    Undead are humanoids now, not undead so the undead specific spells don't affect them.<br />
<br />
Hunters are actually a bit of a bane for rogues, and people in general in that, if you are overwhelmed, it's very hard to escape from them.  Hunters mark and a good pet can run you down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SnibbsQ</div><div class="date">11-09-04, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slight derail, but it has to do with PvP. Can you actually PvP on the normal servers, a'la DAoC and frontiers type combat? Or is PvP restricted to the PvP servers? Been reading up on it for a while and could never find a clear answer. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deristation</div><div class="date">11-30-04, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to buy WoW but I hope it isnt the same as EVERY other online world game.The classes that are the most powerfull are always the classes with ridiculous holds,and stuns,(evan worse sometimes they have player charm)and or the classes that along with the ability to fight have several powerfull assistant abilities such as super speed,or teleport.<br />
<br />
Im looking for a list of spells/abilities now,but im hopeing the holds and stuns are weak,and that classes that are stacked with assistant spells are not great fighters.And if player on player charm exists I may not evan play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthien</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was under the impression, in open beta that is, that warlock's fear spell tends to make opponent's pets also unresponsive, and as long the combatants don't have resist to fear, warlock wins every time 1:1 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">12-01-04, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was under the impression, in open beta that is, that warlock's fear spell tends to make opponent's pets also unresponsive, and as long the combatants don't have resist to fear, warlock wins every time 1:1 ?<br />
<br />
    Often depends on who suprises who.  I get the drop on a warlock, he's going to be half dead after my initial attack, I'm throwing all sort of interrupting damage on him, hopefully getting some spell time increasing poison procs off, and likely gouging him if he turned to face me and then finishing him off with another backstab.  <br />
<br />
  If he gets the drop on me, I will kick in my 15sec fear immune asap and then try to kill him before his dots and pet get me.   Had great luck versus them so far, but who knows in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">12-08-04, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From everything I read, everyone horde bitches about paladins being impossible to kill, everyone alliance bitches about shamans being too hard to kill. As far as I can tell, Hunters and warriors are the only others that really complain about not being able to hold their own in pvp. Don't know anything about warriors but as a hunter if I don't get to start the fight.. I just snare em,  sick my pet on em, warstomp.. hit cheetah and hope I outrun whatever form of range attack they have before stun wears off.  Everything else I've tried generally leads to death. I have no way of using my gun in a pvp fight if I don't get to start the fight.. and my melee sucks, as does my ac/hp. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aruyall</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can say our guild is well balanced across class lines for Horde, and weve dueled each other praticing techniques to an extent.<br />
<br />
I can go toe to toe with almost any class =level and there are so many factors that can change a fight.<br />
<br />
I can say the 2 classes I hate to go up against most are Hunters and Paladins.  I have NEVER beat a paladin even with the jump on him.  Hunters I always go toe to toe with them and its a close fight.<br />
<br />
You can't beat Mark, so if your marked best thing to do is just give it all you have and pray you can take them out.  Can't out run the pet and 2 minutes is next to impossible to evade someone.  <br />
<br />
Now I have a hunter friend same level in my guild beats my A$$ reguarly in one on one combat, in fact Ive seen him get jumped by a Alliance rogue 3 levels above him and he ended up winning with half life left.  I attest this to his superior weapons/armor and just game skills:) but it has made me sick and tired of hearing people say Hunters are underpowered.<br />
<br />
And BTW no idea why you HP/AC might stink, hunters are= on stats as rogues with only modifiers coming from racial, and at 40 Hunters get mail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seanie Connerie</div><div class="date">12-21-04, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would reccomend not running away when fighting a Hunter, baaaad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llamas</div><div class="date">12-24-04, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spend one or two nights a week doing PVP.  Last night was the latest such instance, and in all 3 conflicts I got into, I was one of the highest levels on the horde side, going up against the same hunter each time, two levels higher than me (I'm 42, he's 44).  In each battle, the results of each little fight were consistent, if we were left more or less to ourselves.<br />
<br />
If I got the jump on him, I destroyed him.  If he caught me at medium bowshot range, he dominated me.<br />
<br />
Every now and then this would change.  One time he managed to get away from me, I'm ashamed to say, even when I got the jump on him.  A number of times I managed to get behind something that blocked LOS, stun the pet, and summon my mount and escape.<br />
<br />
If you get the jump on a hunter and lose to him consistently, you're doing something wrong.  Seriously.  When there were no other combatants around, any time I got the jump on him I would waste him and lose less than half my health, without using any potions or evasion.  I've found the same with other hunters of similar level in the past.<br />
<br />
Use crippling poison.  A lot.<br />
<br />
One thing I'm curious about, anyone have a strategy for what to do about druids using their travel form?  It breaks snare effects and makes em pretty speedy.  Other than popping a sprint or potion of swiftness, is there a good way to handle em?  Paladins and their immunity are similar, but they don't get the speed boost, so it's not a problem.<br />
<br />
I have to concur with the above, paladins are probably the roughest class to go up against in PVP.  I'd say they're followed by druids (maybe my strategies for druids just suck), and and then warlocks and hunters togher (although I haven't fought a warlock around my level since before the fear duration was reduced).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyorg</div><div class="date">02-10-05, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a warrior's perspective, warriors suck against anyone with range.  I've heard warriors are rogue killers at the upper levels because of plate armor, but against anything range, warriors get thrashed.  I know I am so slow I can't chase down anyone unless I get a snare in before they're out of range.  All it takes is a blink or a sprint and they're out of my range.  On the other hand, many times I can just run from a ranged and if they are relatively even level to me they just get tired of following even though they can keep up.</div></div><hr />
