Almost all my skills would be 39, which would allow me to use realm points to boost them too 50.  What I am wondering, is it worth putting into L Axe?  Are SB that use L Axe putting out more damage, than the equivalent SB that is using a 2h Axe or Sword??<br />
<br />
I apologize if this has been posted, I didnt see it.</div></div><hr />

That means up to 11 seconds with a 5.5 delay weapon of NO damage to the target. A infil with a 2.0 speed weapon hits you 5 times in that span. I have roughly the same specs I think and if I go up against something that isn't an archer or a mage, I switch to LA. Also at 39 LA you get a stun style that chains off Comeback, named Frosty Glaze that gives 6 secs worth of stun. So if you don't get the PA/CD chain you can still get the stun effect off.<br />
<br />
General consensu is if you don't go 39 in LA then don't bother. Hope this helps.<br />
