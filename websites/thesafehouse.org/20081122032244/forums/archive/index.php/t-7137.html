<br />
Once you get &quot;Charm&quot;, you go to some zone with mobs that are blue to you, and charm one. Sic your new &quot;pet&quot; on another blue mob. Root the mob it is attacking (this is in case your charm breaks... that way you dont have two to worry about...). Now wait until your pet starts getting low on health - either slow the other mob, blast him, whatever - just make sure your pet wins. You get expy from the kill. <br />
<br />
Then while your pet is still very weak, and near death's door from the battle, cast invis on yourself and it will break the charm. Then either kill your former weakened pet for full expy or root it and charm another fresh pet to kill it.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat...   <br />
