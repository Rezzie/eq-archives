Only got one proc and he resisted.<br />
<br />
On Iki I applied the second I saw him, 5 procs, 5 resists.<br />
<br />
An unbelievable amount of time and pp wasted so far for poisons to be useless on mobs that it matters on.  WTF</div></div><hr />

OF COURSE you are gonna get resisted on Ikiatar.  Probably on most undead too, which have insane poison resist.  Poison isn't, and has never really been, a &quot;read the spoiler and go kick ass&quot; , you are gonna have to do some research and know about the mobs you are fighting and choose the poison for that occasion.  If that isn't your style, well, please hand over any components you get cos I sure as hell want to be the best rogue I can be.</div></div><hr />

I have tried on Emp, Blood, Shade so far all resists, works great when I am out exping though.  Still nice to have exping. Dulok - 60 Rogue<br />

I pretty much kept it on them the entire fight (6-7 procs per fight).  I'm fairly pleased with how they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Hotcana Wupaz</div><div class="date">10-26-02, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here, dagarn and Flesh I was able to stick it on too.<br />
<br />
I forgot Iki was high on PR.<br />
<br />
Once I clicked a vial and had max buffs  <br />
<br />
The Dust of decay drops kinda rare in HS off skellies, but when it did drop they always had 2 on them.<br />
<br />
Got 6 in an hours time.<br />
<br />
Goldem ember powder is dropping like mad in NToV too, wish i knew what it was for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RunawayRogue</div><div class="date">10-26-02, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've been using Minor Irritation a lot and loving it! Went romping around UP and Akheva today and had these results...<br />
<br />
Dark Assassins/Masters... don't EVEN try. I'm guessing cause they're undead they got mass poison resist. Also don't use any knockback poisons as that is an automatic resist since they're immune to stun<br />
<br />
Moktors/Zelnithak however... paled at the sight of my poisoned blades.<br />
<br />
In Akheva I had no problems whatsoever landing anything. I didn't bother on The Protector since I figured he'd resist. On all the lil alien guys and even the mind burrowers (the big ones) I didn't get a single resist. Managed to keep them mostly poisoned as well. I'm pretty happy with the proc rates.<br />
<br />
BTW I was around 220 dex at most times.<br />

They're super poison resistant.  Undead elsewhere are usually suspectible to poisons.  I'm not sure, the horses in UP might be tough too.
