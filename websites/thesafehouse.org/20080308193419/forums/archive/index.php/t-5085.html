<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ylailea</div><div class="date">05-26-02, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, I just started DAoC 2 days ago, I'm a lvl 8 inf, and I love it, but I have a couple questions. <br />
<br />
First, I don't really know where I should be hunting or when I should move to a dungeon or any of that stuff.  I know this is something I'll learn with time in the game, but any advice would be appreciated.<br />
Also, I don't know what kind of equipment I could feasibly attain at this level or what I should be working for in the near future.  I was lucky enough to have a couple very friendly mid level players give me a little gold, so I can afford some decent equipment, but I don't want to get a bunch of stuff that's way above my level that will either make me too powerful to be having fun, or that I will damage and not get good use out of.  This includes rings, jewelry, cloaks, all that stuff.  I have no idea what to look for or where to get it.<br />
<br />
I'm an old EQ convert, so I know the users on this board are really helpful and I want to thank you all in advance for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Blacule</div><div class="date">05-28-02, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't remember where I hunted at that lvl, but check out a dungeon called The Tomb of Mithra. I believe you may be around the right lvl for it. Around lvl 12 check out Keltoi.<br />
<br />
As for equipment, these early lvl's will go by so fast that I wouldn't bother spending cash on anything with the exception of a good player made weap(s). <br />
<br />
On the other hand, a player made set of armor at this lvl will hardly cost anything and most of the time people will make it for free. Check the merchant's items before you buy to see whats available.<br />
<br />
If you plan on RVR in the battle grounds at lvls 20-24, work towards building your char for this.</div></div><hr />
