I guess at least you won't be able to just roll one without investing some time into a character to get enough favor at least.  Of course, how much favor you need it still unknown.<br />

Kirris Tor'kha of the Venomblade slipped quietly through the jungle foliage of the postern gate wilds, crouching down behind a rock to observe her surroundings. The decadent city of Stormreach lay just ahead, built by the foreigners upon the bones of the old giant city. This is the city that would become her new home.<br />
<br />
She was sent to be an emissary of sorts – the outsiders were vast in numbers and were growing more powerful each day from the riches they plundered from the ruins of Xen'drik, causing the Elders concern. These newcomers were a force that could no longer be ignored, and they hoped that with careful assistance, they could be guided to greater ends than simple tomb raiding.<br />
<br />
Whispering a brief prayer to Vulkoor the Hunter, Kirris bade farewell to the comforts of the jungle and sprinted across the final clearing to reach the harbor gate. Halting before the surprised guard, her first challenge of the many to come began – parleying her way into the city itself...<br />
<br />
Most Drow choose a life of adventure out of necessity, given the dangers of their homeland. Still, they greatly desire personal power, and many Drow take up the mantle of adventurer seeking to satisfy their ambitions. The majority of Drow follow the evil scorpion-god Vulkoor, though exposure to the cultures of Stormreach has brought a few of them to less malevolent deities.<br />
<br />
The elves of Eberron were born on the mysterious southern continent of Xen'drik, where they were slaves of the giant kingdoms. Tens of thousands of years ago, Elf slaves rebelled against their masters. Unlike other Elf races who fled the continent, the Drow stayed behind on Xen'drik. Today most of the Drow live within the ancient giant ruins, hoping to take vengeance on their former masters and to learn the secrets of the giants' long-lost might. The Drow believe that they alone preserve the dignity and valor of the Elf race, dismissing the rebels who fled to Aerenal and their Valenar heirs.<br />
<br />
Only recently, a few Drow have allied themselves with foreign-born heroes who have come to Stormreach. Members of the Venomblade tribe led by Elder Durandimon, these skilled warriors, cunning trackers, and wielders of arcane power have joined their might with their new friends to turn back to the tide of evil that threatens both human-dominated cities and the wilds of Xen'drik that the Drow claim as their own.<br />
<br />
In order to gain the approval of the drow tribes and access one of their great heroes for your side, you must first prove yourself a hero of renown. To do this, succeed in many of the quests and adventurers located about Stormreach. In each of those, you’ll gain favor that’s noted in your own adventure compendium. You get more favor the more difficult the quest, especially if you dare to accept challenges that are hard or elite. Once you’ve reached a certain amount of favor, the drow will send you a message through Stormreach’s new mail system about the availability of their bravest and strongest.<br />
<br />
    * +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution: Also known as dark Elves, Drow are nimble, clever, and magnetic, but physically delicate.<br />
    * Magical Defense: Drow are immune to magic sleep effects, and they gain a +2 saving throw bonus against Enchantment spells and an additional +2 Will save bonus against spells and spell-like effects. Finally, Drow characters begin play with Spell Resistance 11, and this resistance can be increased as the Drow gains levels.<br />
    * +2 bonus on Listen, Search and Spot checks: A Drow's senses are extremely sensitive.<br />
    * Bonus Weapon Proficiency Feats: Drow are proficient with the rapier, shortsword, and shuriken.</div></div><hr />

Wonder if they will be able to roll &quot;evil?&quot;</div></div><hr />
