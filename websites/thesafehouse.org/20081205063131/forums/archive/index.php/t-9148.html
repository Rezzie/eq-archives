But my 13 mind/rad controller 6-slot enhanced pure accuracy debuff can go afk in a crowd of 4 or 5 whites and not worry.  Add yellows to the mix and health will slowly fall and rise, and eventually fall.  Add an orange, and well, best to stay attentive.  Add a scrapper partner and it's game over - non-stop xp.  Crowd them all up in a group and leave the green ring standing till end, and it's next next next, rest, next next. <br />

My rad/rad was great in grps with those... sadly, the endurance drain was too much for me to do anyhting else.  He got put on the shelf until respec trials.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes those debuffs do own, I can effictively tank oranges / reds with both of them running. Sadly i retired my rad defender too. If i can respec both AM and Hasten, and the 5 levels i wasted on slotting those powers, i'd be back in a heart beat. <br />
<br />
Enervating field, isn't so much of a -def - acc debuff as it is a joygasm for blasters and scappers. What it does is let the mob take more dmg, from all attacks. My eye beam would do about 17 dmg normally, with EF on it did about 20. Not much, but in a group it really adds up.<br />
<br />
If your interested in playing a rad defender i would deffinately reccomend picking EF and Lingering Radiation asap. Also putting at least two DO End Redux, or one SO in them asap. Running those will drain you of end, and you won't be able to heal!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feist</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 3 Major debuffs for Radiation are,<br />
<br />
Radiation Infection<br />
Enervating Field<br />
Lingering Radiation<br />
<br />
I personally opted for Radiation Infection as my main debuff until I get Lingering at 12.  Infection is a targeted AE toggle power.  You pick a mob, infect him, and everyone around the target is infected as well (you see a nifty little graphic effect for all those infected).  As soon as the targeted mob is dead the infection dies off and the rest of the mobs are OK to beat you down once again.  Infection is easy to keep going (very low END cost) and severely decreases the Defense and Accuracy of all mobs infected.  Very, very nice.<br />
<br />
Enervating Field looks very handy but the END cost of this toggle power is much higher than Infection.  Its a hog and not something to be used while soloing or even on minions, save it for the big boys.  It decreases the resists of the mob as well as decreases the overall damage they can do.<br />
<br />
Lingering Radation is NOT a toggle power and thus very useful as long as you can keep the mobs in one place (Provoke tanker, controller, etc).  It slows down the enemy's attack speed and movement speed by a lot from what I've heard.<br />
<br />
Rad/Rad is a very fun build.  I never got involved in the Hasten/Accelerate Metabolism thing so I'm just enjoying him as it.  In a group such a defender is very useful and quite a bit of fun to play.  Just don't get involved with min/maxers who want you to debuff and stand around.<br />

<br />
At 16 in a full group killing 19's I can keep EF on the entire battle after I lay down and ice slick with hardly and end loss (I think i got 3 do's in it), the group kills ultra fast then on to the next spot.<br />
<br />
However solo its not viable as i run out of end before i can kill the 3 mobs i am taking on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually enjoy that gig.  Well, with my mind/rad controller there can be a little more to it, since I have 6-slotted DO heal on him too, and he tends to lay a mez on a mob outside the circle now and then.  The only thing I hate about him is he can't solo (which reminds me: those that say anyone can solo if they want, well - some are much better soloers than others...seriously)<br />
<br />
Lately I've been favoring my rad/energy defender for reasons of soloability (missions).  <br />
<br />
In either case, I'm in love with the radiation line as you can see, hehe.<br />
