<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bayler</div><div class="date">04-01-00, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fought my first duel a few days ago.  This other rogue and I had gathered around a warrior who wanted help getting his corpse from Befallen.<br />
<br />
While waiting for the warrior to get his act together, the rogue inspected me and then laughed at my equipment.  (Dragoon Dirk, FS Dagger, Lockjaw tunic with mostly leather armor, lots of AC jewelry.)  I inspected her, and she was dual-wielding SBDs and wearing full Banded.  I took offense, and told her so.  <br />
<br />
I let it go for the time; my focus was on showing this warrior that a lone rogue could sometimes accomplish things better than a full group at the same level.<br />
<br />
After I brought the warrior his body, I gave a tell to the other rogue, inviting her to a demonstration of just how effective my equipment was.  She was anon, so I didn't know her level.  She had dual-wield, so I knew she was at least 13th.  I was 15th, so I figured I'd probably get stomped.  Still, we mustn't let such insults go untested.<br />
<br />
She accepted my challenge, and we agreed to meet in the foyer of Befallen.  In a short while, she asked me to come and unlock the first door for her - she didn't have her lockpicks with her.  I let her through.<br />
<br />
We started to fight.  This being my first duel, I didn't really know what to expect.  We both tried to maneuver around behind each other, but neither was able.  It ended up being just a slugfest, but she was hitting a lot harder than I was.  At least the SBDs weren't proc'ing.<br />
<br />
When I was down to about 1 bubble (and she was at 4 and a half), I whipped out my lockpicks and ran for that door.  I managed to get the door between us and myself hidden, whereapon she told me, &quot;you suck&quot;.  I took it as a compliment to my strategy.<br />
<br />
It didn't save me.  No sooner had I begun to bandage then she followed some party through the door and broke my hide with her autoattack in passing.  (Lesson: If you're going to hide from someone you're duelling, don't do it in a narrow hallway.)  After that, all I could do was throw a few last proud swipes at her before she cut me down with her twin 27th level weapons.<br />
<br />
I lost the duel, but damn it, for that one joyful moment, my Lockpicking actually meant something!<br />

<br />
Dragoon, LJ tunic, ac jewelry at 15? Some good work there.<br />
Twinking happens, don't let it get you too down. Dual SBD's before the 20's even is overkill IMHO... let the rogues who can benefit the most use these. Of course, if it was some druid that won them both in a lotto while camping supplier/assassin in a group, well, they earned it, but they're ruining the rogue experience for themselves. Woof woof woof!<br />

<br />
I have a wizzie that I did a good turn for holding a SBD for me until I come up with 500 plat - half the going rate.<br />
<br />
I'm at 375 and figure I can get it in 2 more sessions.  It won't proc for me at 23/22/23/23/22, but increasing my pierce and backstab by 33% will help a ton..<br />
<br />
I hate twinks and would have challenged as well.  Lockjaw is OK, but I'd sell it &amp;amp; replace all leather you can afford with banded - I did have full banded by 15.  It may not look very rogue-ish - but AC is KING and its the best you'll do without spending huge dough.<br />
<br />
If you're in befallen already, see if you can get someone to help you pop the Ogre SK a few times &amp;amp; get a set of barbed arms and legs.  Arms are easy, legs a little tougher.<br />

Plan?  You want a plan?  We go in, I start hitting people hard in the face; we see where that takes us.</div></div><hr />
