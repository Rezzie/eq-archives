<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Nocha</div><div class="date">06-06-01, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 questions: <br />
<br />
one-can you steal from players on pvp servers or is this limited to NPCs<br />
<br />
two-ive heard people say they assign backstab hotkey to a letter on keyboard (eg. &quot;L&quot;) and am wondering how to do so, also even better if theres a mouse  one can purchase with buttons for hotkeys.<br />
<br />
Back to in game question: <br />
<br />
I have a walrus tooth and crystal fiber which i was going to try and upgrade to SBD and crystal fiber. Being that im not twinked and have a very limited PP stash in the bank (not able to afford SBD yet but soon) is it worthwhile for me to upgrade the tooth. <br />
<br />
Id venture to sya i can let these carry me into the 30s? or would that suck on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

Check the Training Studio for Hotkey tips.<br />

SBD is a great weapon when combined with Instll Doubt (PvE).  The slow effect and DoT are good for PvP.  Backstab cries for the highest damge weapon you can get though. Edited by: MajestykVZ at: 6/6/01 3:50:23 pm</div></div><hr />

No you can't Pickpocket from players, but an emote has gotten me into several fights and duels.  <br />
