Tonight was the first night in roughly a week I ended up with positive xp, so I been having a rough go of it lately. Am I completely gimped here or is it just a run of bad luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Brandyn Aquilius</div><div class="date">04-02-02, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like maybe a run of bad luck, or the wrong choices in MOBs.  What are you attempting to kill?  Do you get penalties?  Are you evading at all?<br />
<br />
At 41 I'm soloing blue Dunters without losing more than 1/8 of my health and usually using less than 1/2 of my endurance.  I get bonuses against them.  I found a yellow one and took it down almost as fast... had about 4/5 health and 1/2 endurance I think.  EVADE ROCKS!  Hamstring/Leaper are quite nice.<br />
<br />
That was without using poisons, which make the job even easier.  I'd suggest finding some MOBs you get bonuses against and try them.  Anything furry usually works I think.  Reptilian is good too.  G'Luck. Aurra Sing - 40 Infiltrator<br />

I havent even tried to use any of the evade styles yet. Well I have tried them but can never seem to time em right. Guess I'll go out and work on timing off of evades.</div></div><hr />
