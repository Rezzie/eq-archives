Do they like being treated like crap and come back for more?  Why is it someone who can be polite, kind, and have morals be over looked and people who don't give a crap, treat people badly, and are rude be put in the spot light?  This is just something that doesn't register with me.  I don't get why people continue to be treated badly while someone else can treat them great and still stick with the person who is treating them like crap.  Is there are reason for this?<br />

<br />
Women want the best of both worlds. Stable, nice, sensitive, yet domineering, exciting, mysterious, macho.<br />
<br />
Younger women say they want it all, when in reality, they just want everything after yet. As far as I can tell, women associate the nice guy with stability, a guarentee, a shoe in for that guy who will be your prince. Except when they have it, they feel bored(probably not the right word), trapped, like they are missing out on something even more special than having someone who really cares about you. <br />
<br />
This only barely covers why women date guys other than nice guys, it doesn't explain why girls date guys who beat them, or cheat on them, but I think it explains why just a nice girl will pass a sweet, caring guy for an aloof, dashing schmoe, because they dashing guy excites them, the nice guy makes them smile. When they come to value smiles more than excitement, they will probably start thinking about finding a real partner.  &quot;They will come back, come back again, as long as the Red Earth rolls. He never wasted a tree or a leaf, why should he squander souls?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the guy/girl you percieve as a mean mistreater has qualities you (general you, not just about the poster) don't have? Perhaps you have qualities that annoy the hell out of the person rejecting you? Maybe there's just no chemistry? Maybe they find you (gasp) unnatractive?  <br />
<br />
It's easy to write off rejection as &quot;Well, they just wanted someone jerkier than me.&quot;, and not look at the whole picture. That way, you can get rejected ad nauseum and never feel like it has anything to do with you. In fact that way, you're not only never at fault, but always &quot;too good&quot; for the person who rejected you. <br />
<br />
Yes it happens sometimes, but it seems more often than not, it is just an attractive cop out. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Peebs</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of the problems that the 'nice' guys have is they are 'nice' to the point of not being themselves.  I've actually been right in the middle of this sort of scenario recently, except that I guess I'm the ****.   <br />
<br />
We've all seen it or done it.  All of a sudden every joke she says is funny, every slight or percieved slight (even joking) is apologized for profusely, and wouldn't you know it, you like all the same music, movies, and blah blah blah as her too.  Why would she want to be with somebody who is exactly like herself?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is how it is in your case, just a general observation.  Sometimes 'jerkiness' can also be misinterpreted, and usually if you're the 'nice guy' you're not going to think too favorably of the other guy anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope.  Doesn't matter.  You could disagree with everything a girl says and show some difference and be as interesting as you want.  She'd still go for the jerk.  <br />
<br />
Classic example:  There was a girl that wrecked her car one night near the club my friends and I were at.  I took her with us to the next club, bought her a drink, and bandaged up her leg that had been cut.  <br />
<br />
She went home with a guy that had passed her up on the way to the club.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're just going after sex with stupid hot chicks....be a jerk.  But that's a pretty shallow life.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhani Vandolay</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhere, right now, there is an ugly woman complaining that guys always choose hoes who will cheat on them and spend their money, and never give the nice girl a chance. I imagine something along the lines of &quot;I even did his math and Latin homework, but he went home with that cheerleader who wouldn't give him the time of day when he was a freshman. Why oh why do guys only go for bitches?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ain't got no love for hoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaielen</div><div class="date">09-17-03, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds feasible...but the ugly chicks go for jerks too.  I'm not as shallow as most guys.  I still can't help but stop and watch a looker when she walks past, but if a girl is a bitch, I don't care how good looking they are they're not getting my affection.  <br />
<br />
Also, I don't care what ANYONE says...any girl that wants to go out guy hunting is going to find one.  Period.  I don't know how many times my friends and I have gone out with the sole purpose of trying to meet some women and maybe get a phone number and have spent the night playing Royal Air Force to an establishment full of Red Barons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_lenweni</div><div class="date">09-18-03, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A common nice guy mistake is they dont step up to the plate they more or less hover over it waiting for conformation before asking a girl out. This is deemed a lack of confidence A.K.A. a bad thing.<br />
<br />
 After a bad first date always ask yourself &quot;So did I insult her or was I boring?&quot; this usually can narrow down what went wrong early. I know some very nice guys who have terrible luck with women because they are TRAGICALLY boring.</div></div><hr />
