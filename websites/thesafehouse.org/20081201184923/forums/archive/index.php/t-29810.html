<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erik</div><div class="date">05-03-07, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ancient world of Telon holds many secrets…Constantly torn with conflict through it’s many ages, civilization has forgotten much of it’s origin…<br />
<br />
Myths and legends, stories of adventure, of life, of death…With the passing of time, many of these tales die out while the minds of men are consumed in the struggle of existence…<br />
<br />
Yet, there are some stories, some forbidden tales that lie in darkness, patiently festering with fierce resolve until they are once again discovered…<br />
<br />
One such legend tells of a band of ancient warriors bound together by cause and purpose…Warriors that have roamed the vast continents of Telon for thousands of years, making their mark on the land through their acts of bravery…<br />
<br />
Only the forgotten scrolls of Telon know of whom I speak, and know there is truth to this mythical tale. The Seraphim, as they are called, are indeed a mysterious clan, appearing but a few times across the centuries. No one can say for certain what their purpose is, except that their presence usually comes at a time of great peril…but the secret will not be kept much longer…the world will soon know… <br />
<br />
Greetings Defenders of Telon... <br />
<br />
The Seraphim has finally opened her recruiting doors once more after a short hiatus, and we're looking for fresh recruits to bring into the ranks....<br />
<br />
We are a mature, Role-Play optional guild that will facilitate and support many elements of gameplay, from all three spheres, for our members. We will support players that cater to the raiding spectrum, as well as crafters, explorers, hardcore role-players, PvPers, social focused players, and diplomats.<br />
<br />
This sounds extensive, we are aware. But trust in the fact that our core group and system of diversity has had tremendous success in previous MMO’s.  We have been in existence for over a year in a half in pre-release form waiting on Telon to open her doors.  Presently our enrollment is over 100 members strong and growing.  The passage through the Gates to enter our family style guild is not for the faint of heart, but the rewards far outnumber the risk.<br />
<br />
As well, we like giving our members the power to shape their organization over time. Our guild is much more of a democracy than a dictatorship, and once a member is accepted into our ranks, he/she has complete voting rights with the chance to make their opinion count on many critical issues.<br />
<br />
But enough rambling….All your questions can be answered by visiting our official site at:<br />
<br />
www.seraphimvg.com<br />
Seraphim at VGPlayers (http://vgplayers.station.sony.com/guildsProfiles.vm?guildId=51539607561)<br />
<br />
<br />
It is here that you will learn more about our philosophy, standards, members, and role-playing lore of the Seraphim, as well as any new updates on guild sponsored events, milestones, or achievements.<br />
<br />
Everyone is also encouraged to come by our forums to read our F.A.Q., or to just stop by and socialize with our members and friends. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and be strong in battle!!  See you all in Telon.<br />

Seraphim Creed:<br />
The Seraphim cower before no enemy, hindered by no evil. <br />
With forethought and valiant effort they do triumph over all adversity. <br />
They do fiercely embrace the clan and with haste answer its call to render justice where justice is due. <br />
Seraphim are always the champion, defender of the weak, without falsehood. <br />
As Seraphim, your blood is your oath.<br />
<br />
Are ye Seraphim?</div></div><hr />
