For the past few nights I've had super hero dreams...and in most of them I am my toon, Leroy Green.  Scary.</div></div><hr />

On a sidenote, everytime I play an RPG I always have a nightmare sometime while I'm playing. In EQ, gnolls were attacking me. In DAoC, my guild leader made everyone go out into the frontier naked.<br />

Creepy~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aura</div><div class="date">05-25-04, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dream in CoH - I feel your pain. I'm always soloing, and I always get to blinking red health on a mob, run away, go back, repeat process and never kill the basatard. It's actually much like trying to take on a red boss IRL.<br />
<br />
I never dreamt in EQ, mostly because I never slept when I was playing EQ. (See? I avoided the obvious &quot;EQ was a nightmare... not a dream&quot; joke!) <br />
<br />
I did dream in Gauntlet once... it was bizarre. It all started at school in the cafeteria. I turned to one of my friends and he said &quot;Food is good.&quot; Then cafeteria ladies started throwing bombs at us. Sometimes being a nerd is like being on drugs. Only when you do drugs, you wake up with strange women in your bed. When you do nerd, you wake up with an XBox.</div></div><hr />

Luckily the mob slept even longer.<br />
<br />
In the end both had forgotten each other and wandered off.<br />
