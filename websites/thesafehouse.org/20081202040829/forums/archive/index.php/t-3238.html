<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-07-02, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a problem creating some of the magic items in the game. I have all of the reagents/spells required, but apparently I am missing a step.<br />
<br />
I am currently in chapter 3, and I have access to a wizard's laboratory. Would someone be willing to post step by step instructions on how to create one or both of the following items? I have the manuals in game, so I don't need you to tell me the exact ingredients. I DO need the procedure though.<br />
<br />
Staff of Command<br />
(I do need to know the spell involved for this)<br />
<br />
Gargoyle boots.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, which wizard lab are you talking about?<br />
There's the one that is kind of free, then there's the one that the lady who asks you to collect those books lets you use.  I'm assuming it's the free kind of one.  Anyways, you put the components in the apparatus, then cast a spell on the apparatus.  I *think* the Staff of Command uses Dominate (I don't remember the exact name in NWN, it was called Dominate in BG :P  I think it's Dominate (Something)).<br />
I wasn't gonna reply since I wasn't sure, but no one else has :P &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I am currently using the free one in chapter 3 (in the wizard's dungeon.) I'm not paying 2k gold to use the one in town mostly cause I have a plethora of the reagents in my inventory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Apparently, It's not working. I've placed the reagents and a magic staff in the container, cast the spell, and nothing happens. If I had caught all this earlier, then I would just reinstall, but I didn't start having problems till I got to Luskan. That was just a little bit too late to restart for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a note about how to make the staff, right?<br />
Do you still have the text? :P<br />
I doubt it's just you, we might be missing a step :P &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a book about it. You have to put a Rashaka eye inside a quartz crystal then cast the spell on it (I am quoting this from memory. Sue me if I am off a bit.)<br />
<br />
This is all the note says. I assume that you have to put a staff in the mix somewhere. I have used magic and non-magic. Each time I cast the spell on the altar either nothing happens or it damages me in the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I might have found the problem here :P<br />
Did you use the apparatus?<br />
I went into the editor, you have to put them on the ALTAR (There's only one in the dungeon), then cast Dominate Person on the altar).<br />
There's only one recipie on that altar, BTW. &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, the altar is what damages me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you used Dominate Person?<br />
Not a different charm? &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to put a rashaka eye, quartz crystal, and magic staff in the altar and cast dominate person on it, right?<br />
<br />
I've tried it that exact combo before, will try it again when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Zulian</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there were only two items listed as regants, I'm assuming they were the eye and crystal, I didn't check the tags.<br />
Try it without the staff. &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will do.</div></div><hr />

I found a wizards lab in the portal dungeon in Coldwood in Chapter 3.</div></div><hr />
