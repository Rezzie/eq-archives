<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Karhikshade</div><div class="date">06-17-02, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(I posted this in the main hall at first, but I think it belongs over here)<br />
<br />
I'm a newb, so, sorry if this is a common question.<br />
<br />
I have been reading a few guides but I wanted to get some input on how I have been spec-ing so far. I just started playing, so my shade is only level 10.<br />
<br />
So far, here is what I have:<br />
Pierce: 8 <br />
Crit Strike: 8<br />
Stealth: 5<br />
Venom: 5<br />
Celtic Dual: i speced this once by accident.. misclicked  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I was just wondering if there were any shades out there with any input. As you can see I have been focusing on Pierce and Critical Strike mainly, with Stealth and Venom on the second tier, and trained whenever I have some points to spare. <br />
<br />
Celtic Dual I was told I needed to put one point in, to have a chance of hitting with both my weapons, so I did that. Then, as stated above, I spec-ed in it once again by accident. I wondered, what does this do? I seem to hit with both weapons about half the time (maybe a little less), but what would be the advantage of training it a lot?<br />
<br />
Blades I haven't touched, mainly because I like the idea of piercing on this sort of a character, seems more natural for him. <br />
<br />
Envenom I have heard becomes important later, so I have been specing it sometimes. I have been using poisons but haven't seen much difference yet, does this change later? How much damage should I expect my poison to do? Are poisons something that I am going to want to use all the time, to live and die by, or are they something situational (and thus not worthy of so many points)<br />
<br />
Any other advice you could give would be great. I just am a little confused about which of these abilities is more useful at higher levels, and didn't want to waste my points in the meantime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AGLuhowy</div><div class="date">06-18-02, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want weapon skill max, period.  Get it to 50 and be done.  Styles in most weapons aren't that bad anyway, but it does not matter cause you will be using critical strike styles all the time anyway.  Just get the weapon skill up there for better damage.<br />
<br />
Get stealth to 35 and envenom to 36.  Those will hit 50 with items and realm points.  No reason to even chance those going over 50, as having then over 50 does not benefit like weapon skill and critical strike.<br />
<br />
Dump the rest into critical strike.<br />
<br />
As you level get weapon and critical strike max, and envenom to 5 for the second DOT.  Leave stealth and other skills alone.<br />
<br />
Stealth will auto-train to stay at 25% of your level, and for the first 20 or 24 levels you don't really need it, until you hit the battle grounds.  So save points but not bumping up stealth early on.<br />
<br />
You do not need to put anypoints into Celtic dual or dualwield to be able to use it.  It will just go off every now and then on its own.  More points mean more styles and higher percentage to go off.  But it goes off alot anyway, so don't bother until you hit 50 and put extra points into it.</div></div><hr />
