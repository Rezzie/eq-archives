<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-29-03, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PCs are involved in a fairly major roof top combat right now. One of my newbie PCs decided to use one of the random magic items I gave him, the Bag of Beans!, to help the situation. If you don't know, the beans basically sprout into ANYTHING, be it creature, item, spell effect, what have you.<br />
<br />
The first one he threw produced a 60+' version of the plant from little shop of horrors, which proceeded to eat some of the Goblyns they were fighting, and to take some shots at the PCs. So my newbie decides he needs to throw another one.<br />
<br />
Now, it's not that I have any shortage of ideas for what this next bean could be, but I figured, seeing as it can be ANYTHING, I thought I'd tap the SH pool of ideas for something really wacky. It can be ANYTHING, a Wyvern, Elder Dragon, bunny, 60X60 ice storm effect, a portal door, a bastard sword +1, whatever your twisted little minds can come up with. Need to know for Sunday 8/31.<br />
<br />
edit<br />
<br />
Quick view of the situation, the PCs are on top of the main keep, with a steeped roof in the middle, an a ~10' walkway around the roof. Goblyns are pouring in the from 2 of the 3 trap doors on the south side of the roof, each in an opposite corner. There is one additional trap door in the middle of the southern walkway, directly under where the party is fighting. While battling a werewolf, the wizard threw out a web spell to fence them off from the ever increasing numbers of goblyns, basically cornering them in the middle of the south wall. Web spell will hold for at least 3 more TURNS. There are at least 12 goblyns either stuck in the webbing, or out on the roof attempting to get to the PCs.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-29-03, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I said the plant appeared and started attacking @#%$, the first thing I heard was &quot;Don't you just love it when the DM gives you magic stuff and it ends up attacking you?&quot;.  <br />
<br />
So I'd like this to have some impact on what's going on(even though the cow would be funny). Doesn't need to be beneficial to anyone, either the gobbos or the PCs, but something with some....yeah, impact on the situation. I thought about having a little red cloud appear that spits out fireballs, but I don't want the buiding to burn down, there is still stuff for them to find there.</div></div><hr />

As it rapidly approaches the planet, the gigantic mass becomes more and more apparent. It evaporates entirely except for a tiny pebble that bounces off one of the pcs.<br />
<br />
But the vapor from the magical ice settles over the area, imparing everyone's (nonmagic) vision and imposing strength/subdual penalties on everyone in the icy embrace.<br />
<br />
Or a strange mist appears and turns every currently active goblyn (not your unspawned reinforcements) into a zombiegoblyn. Sensei Pren,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TribalGeek</div><div class="date">08-29-03, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be interesting to have him throw it and it turns one or two of the other pcs into gobos. Could have it dispell the webs. Could have it teleport one or more of the pcs to someplace and replace it with or person the pc just swicthed places with. Would cause them to a have to fight antoher monster and find pc or help the person who arrivied and then find the pc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Urusai</div><div class="date">08-29-03, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about for mildly benificial magic.  Every round for 1d10 rounds. 1d6 goblins become dressed in bell adorned clown costumes in place of their armor.  And their weapons turn into jester sticks with mini laughing goblin heads on to tops of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe a Magic Mouth that starts acting as the announcer for the battle.  &quot;And the little goblins keep on coming, theres no end to them ladies and gentelmen.  Oooohh.  There goes another one to the plant.  Thats gotta hurt.  The ranger loads another arrow...  takes aim...  and releases!  ITS HEADING FOR A HEADSHOT!!!  ITS HEADING FOR A HEADSHOT!!  AND ITS GOOD!!  What a fight we have here folks.  Who knows where its going to end.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Or how about the aging affect from Ice Pirates.  Every round each person ages for 1d6 years.  At the end of the fight everything returns to normal however.<br />
If the fight lasts long enough for them to get up to their 80's start having them make Fortitude saves or have heart attacks.  Thrown in some althimers.  &quot;Who are you again?&quot;<br />
This would affect both sides equally.  Youd have a band of gray bearded gobins hobbling across the path using their short swords as canes to reach the party.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bean begins to grow as it flies through the air.  It grows and grows and grows until its about 10' long, then lands on a batch of the goblins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arafain</div><div class="date">08-30-03, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, you should make up a random table of about 20 things that you like (make sure some of them are beneficial, preferably magic items) and roll d20 when the party uses the beans.  When one thing get summoned, scratch it off the list and replace it with something else.<br />
<br />
Introduce random chance into the game whenever possible - that way whatever happens surprises you as much as it does the PCs.   -- Marauder Arafain Entreri, 65 Deceiver<br />
  -- Arafein Soulstriker, 54 Champion Relic (deceased)<br />
  -- Arafax Kokorozan, 20 Monk Giantfriend (missing)<br />

  -- Formerly of The Rathe Server, now of Zebuxoruk<br />

Soooo... the town marketplace was soon beset by rampaging hordes of stampeding rhinos, kittens, and fireballs...<br />

It just sits there.  Watch and see how they avoid it.   <br />
<br />
Another option is to turn it into a Holy Hand Grenade type thing.  Have it have something written on it but be just covered abit.  Someone walks over and picks it up, everyone within 5' dissappears in a poof of smoke.  Of course it would always fall that the text is barely readable.<br />
If you dont want to be deadly malicious then just have it be that it teleports them back to the last place they slept that's not the current area.</div></div><hr />

Wont do any damage unless you roll the crit which takes of a limb.  And they get two attacks for every one they have normally.<br />
<br />
They throw the one bean on the grown and another lands near it.  Then another a second later.  By the third round theres a rainstorm of beans hailing out of the sky hampering vision and becoming quite anoying on the helmet. <br />
