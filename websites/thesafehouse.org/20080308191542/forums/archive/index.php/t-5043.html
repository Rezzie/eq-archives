<br />
The current specializations I'm thinking of pursuing (w/ a Saracen) are:<br />
<br />
Stealth 40<br />
Slashing 29<br />
Envenom 50<br />
Critical 44<br />
Dual Wield 19<br />
<br />
So am I totally cracked or what? I'd appreciate any help here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ralis DeNatharr</div><div class="date">04-28-02, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stealth 40<br />
<br />
40 in stealth is a good number. It gives you safe fall 4 which is pretty useful and it cna be maxed with items<br />
<br />
Slashing 29<br />
<br />
I would raise this just because every point spent increases your damage.<br />
<br />
Envenom 50<br />
<br />
No need to take it that high, spec in the low 40s and you can get it to 50 with items. Envenom when raised with items allows you to use the higher level poisons anyway.<br />
<br />
Critical 44<br />
<br />
Good number. Infils get the 2.5 spec which allows them to raise Crit that high.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield 19<br />
<br />
Don't really need it. I would raise all the other stats higher and put left over points here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Serial Curiosity</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help, Ralis. Appreciate it immensely.<br />
<br />
Taking your suggestions, how about something like this?<br />
<br />
Stealth 40<br />
Slashing 44<br />
Envenom 42<br />
Critical 44<br />
Dual Wield 3<br />
<br />
Is that completely ridiculous, or would it work fairly well? At this point, I'm wondering if I'd be better off using a two-handed weapon rather than a dual wield at all though. Edited by: Serial Curiosity at: 4/29/02 2:11:22 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Iriki</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Infs can't use 2 hand weapons. (only shadowblades can)<br />
<br />
Spec looks fine. <br />
<br />
With a dw that low you won't swing that often with both weapons so applying two poison will require swapping weapons or swinging a few more times (to let the offhand hit). This isn't that bad but is something you will need to be aware of.<br />
<br />
Plus with so few points in dw using a shield will be fine sometimes without that nagging feeling of not using those points put in dw. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ralis DeNatharr</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea I actually think that spec looks good and thats one of the specs I was thinking of doing for my infil. Most say to take DW up to about 6-8 pts as swinging rates improve then. If you auto-train stealth up til you are level 16 or 20, you should save enough points to bring DW just a tad higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Larandon</div><div class="date">04-29-02, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With that spec (DW=3) - isn't his DW chance:<br />
<br />
25% + 0.5%*3 + 0.25%*50 = 36.5% (hope my math is right)<br />
<br />
That seems a pretty good number - over 1 swing in 3 will be a double swing?<br />
<br />
Note that the vast majority of this percentage comes from the base DW chance (25%) and from the level of your character (10%).  That's why Dual Wield is the &quot;leftover&quot; bucket to put points in when you don't have anywhere else to put them.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, is that right? I think that's a fairly good percentage as well, but only if your numbers are accurate.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, everyone, for the help. Now for one more bit of business...autotraining vs. spec'ing outright. In other words, which of the skills that I've listed in the above message should I spec directly into with my points and which should I allow to autotrain? I figure Stealth should be autotrained already. Should I put most of my points into Critical Strike and Slashing at first, and allow autotrain to work on the others?<br />

[As you can likely tell, I'm an idiot regarding this sort of thing - my first rogue and all.]</div></div><hr />
