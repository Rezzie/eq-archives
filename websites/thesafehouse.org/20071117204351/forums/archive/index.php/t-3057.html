I wonder if the fact that this year they held it during Easter Weekend had anything to do with the declining admission.  Dumbasses.</div></div><hr />

Man I cant stand that guy.  He's directly responsibly for the Indianapolis move, and then the split to 2 US shows.<br />
<br />
Just thinking about it makes me angry, his reasons for moving the con in the first place were complete and utter BS.  The only reason he moved it is because he wanted it in Indi -- he liked the town better.  He'd only been to a couple GenCons in Milwaukee and in no way comprehended what that city meant.<br />
<br />
I so hate that.  I wish White Wolf would just hurry up and buy the entire industry so things can stop sucking. Glip the Gnome<br />
