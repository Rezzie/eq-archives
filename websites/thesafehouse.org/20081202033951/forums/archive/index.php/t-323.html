<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Unfetered</div><div class="date">04-10-00, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rain lashed down upon the rocky fortress of High Pass Hold. There upon a large boulder sat the Unfetered One, the sight of the keep and it gaurds patrolling the vicinity not too far away, but far enough not to be noticed in the moon lit night. Sheltered from the rain by an out cropping of rock above his head, but still the wind did manage to bite at him through the folds of his cloak. There the theif waited for his chance to way lay some unsuspecting soul, of their possesions... not that the Unfetered One needed the money or the jewelery, but as with most thieves, he was an oppotunist and lived for the excitement. There, hooded and shadowed, he waited.<br />
He didnt have to wait long, for there next to the keep, just out of the way of the gaurds two figures walkerd into view. They were hard to make out, but one it seemed wore a bluish looking kind of livery.<br />
&quot;A bard, perhaps&quot; Unfetered thought, as he dipped his dirk into his poison vial &quot;Lambent sells quite well&quot;<br />
The figures were now no more than three feet from him, and deep in conversation, there muffled whispers carrying softly through the rain, but Unfetered was undetected. He is a master at hiding, and only the best detection spells by the greatest of the spell casters could thwart him.<br />
<br />
His dirk poisoned and ready, he steadied himself for his swift attack. But the talk from the bard and his mysterious friend made him stop. They were talking about a planned raid, but Unfetered could only discern snatchies of the talk through the weather. Some thing about a planned raid in one months time. A certain guild was to be attacked, but he couldnt make out the name. The guilds stronghold is at a tower it seemed, but he couldnt quiet make out the location. Something about water? And maybe boats? The guild making the raid he could not make out in the least, and if these debating figures before him was from the attacking guild, he could not tell. But one sentence made its way through the rain and the wind, a sentence that chilled him to his core.<br />
&quot;The world of Norrath will be a much better place when the Shadow Stalkers are no more, we shall be doing everyone a favour...&quot; The figure in lambent spoke some more before he and his companion departed into the Keep, but Unfetered heard none of it. He had long departed moving swiftly and undetectable as only a rogue knows how. He knew the location of the tower to be attacked, he knew its location and whats more, he knew the guild... He had to get to his leader Ansuz. He had to warn Ansuz, that they were soon to be attacked by an opposing army of unknown name, or for that matter , motive. He had to warn Ansuz that the storm is coming... The Respected Unfetered One Shadow Stalker Of Norrath and Warden of Innoruuk</div></div><hr />
