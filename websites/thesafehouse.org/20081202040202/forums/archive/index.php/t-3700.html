I failed on crafting a City Hall ... Cost me $800,000 credits.  Player cities look like they are going to be great!  I can make street lamps.  lol<br />
<br />
Mounts look awesome too.  I've very impressed.  Looking forward to vehicles.<br />

I was very frustrated at the failure.  I doubt I'll ever make another City Hall because of the limitations on the number of Player cities.  I did get one made though and I have two guilds using me for their city buildings.  I could have actually sold about 4 today, if I had just had enough resources set up in advance.  That failure was my worst so far, because of the time line, they were forced to find it elsewhere.<br />

Granted they still haven't found a way to keep Arch's from oversaturating the market with houses, redoing all the harvesters after this patch will only last so long. Then I'll have little to no business again.</div></div><hr />
