As for the big raids, the only buff a druid is good for is Cos (providing they don't have all their 63-65 spells, which most don't).  As for potg - MGB BoA is always used at raids I've been on.  I could probably write a lot of pages on the subject, but I'm not here to start a rant.  Just stating my opinion.<br />

<br />
Guess I've always thought of druids as able to be more than an out of mana back-up healer in a regular experience group.<br />
<br />
I'll charge up to 65, and get all my healing AA's, perhaps then I'll be able to better flesh out my role in a group(PoP flavor).    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aaliane</div><div class="date">01-16-03, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, my earlier post was a bit harsh.  I was thinking more in lines with big raids.  You can still bring a lot to a group.  Basically, you fill in whatever class isn't there.  Before the last patch, I was primary healer in a lot of PoV groups.  The patch seems to have stopped that.  Too much agro with no way to reduce agro.  Nuke, dot whatever you like really.  No mage in group - you provide DS.  Situation changes with every group.  As long as you pull your own weight in the group and have fun, you be fine.  Druid is a fun class to play.  Just learn your personal strengths and wekanesses.<br />

I play primary healer and have been in a lot of CH chains. <br />
I nuke, Dot, resist buff and debuff mobs. I am kept pretty darn busy. Almost forgot, when no mage around add DS to MT.  Regnon 58 Druid <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ishinru BlenderMonk</div><div class="date">02-11-03, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My druid's not PoPable yet... only 49, so this might not apply.  But for levels 20-49 my role has been the same in groups, just different (better!) spells used.<br />
<br />
From Seb group that had a cleric and ranger:<br />
1- debuff (fixation of Ro)<br />
2- debuff (Ro's fiery sundering)<br />
3- DoT 1 (creeping crud)<br />
4- DoT 2 (immolate)<br />
5- Nuke 1 (Fire)<br />
6- STR/DS/Banish/Cure/...<br />
7- Pack Regen<br />
8- Succor<br />
<br />
have click-Droons of Doom so I opted for that instead of drifting death.  mobs died too fast.. only 1 in 10 DoTs would wear off.<br />
<br />
If no cleric, then most of the slots become useless as the wimpy-ass 300 point heal sucks unless you are healing a monk that is tanking primarily light-blues to him (god bless Mend)... can't wait for 51 heal.<br />
<br />
If no ranger, replace secondary dots and nukes with Root and Ensnare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Trist McHairfoots</div><div class="date">02-19-03, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">druids are just a fun class to play despite how useful they are in raids or groups(though I think they are extremely useful in groups as they can nuke very effectively and heal very effectively).<br />
I, for one, never ever get bored or caught sitting around with nothing to do as a druid.  We can solo a large variety of things in a large variety of ways one minute and then go and then go be in the CH cycle another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_beastmaze</div><div class="date">02-20-03, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok on Raid<br />
you do one or a few of those things.<br />
CCH <br />
You nuke if mana permit<br />
You MGB PoTn and the cleric MGB symbol and EVERYONE are happy, except for paladins but who care about them.<br />
It's about time that all the noobs will stop telling everyone how uber is BoA/HoV they SUCKS, you get 9 more mana regen for all raid + more Hp, so less down time.<br />
You PoS (cos upgrade)<br />
You Heal your Group<br />
You Pull.<br />
You MGB heal.<br />
Your on radiant watch.<br />
<br />
In short if your in a raid and you feel useless then one of the following is true<br />
a) It's time you stop raiding orc camps and move to something harder.<br />
b) You missing some data on your class<br />
c) You should move to a new guild since your current one have no idea how to max out the guild potantial.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fanra</div><div class="date">02-28-03, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids can be useful.  But you have to be willing to play them the way they are.  Just remember that you are rarely going to be the first choice for the situation.  Main use for a 58+ druid is as the cleric replacement.  Of course a real cleric is much better at healing but if there is not one around, you can fill in under most conditions.<br />
<br />
You do get some spells that have their uses.  Hand of Ro and the Ro debuff line comes in handy.  But you have to watch your aggro with them since they really piss mobs off.  The Ro line has its main use in lowering the fire resist so that others can nuke for full but since it is a small amount of mana, I tend to use it also for the lower ATK / AC, even though I have no idea if it is helping at all, really.<br />
<br />
If we have a cleric in the group, then my job becomes backing them up and being the Emergency Response Team.  Usually, I keep myself at close to full mana at all times and just wait in case something goes wrong.  Then I jump in with plenty of heals, root some adds and if all fails, evac.<br />
<br />
Playing a druid has become less fun due to nerfs that have no logic behind them but it still can be fun.  You just have to adjust to the fact that you are not usually the first choice for the job.  If you want to play a character that is really wanted, you need to make a shaman.<br />
<br />
Every character has their job to do and you need to pick one that makes you happy.  For druids, 58+ means you mostly heal.  At least the way I play.  I know that the objective is to keep the group alive and my nukes and such are really too lame to make much difference, while healing the heavy DPS dudes lets us kill the mobs and survive.  There might not be much glory in being healer or ERT but those I group with tend to appreciate my ubar skillz :) Fanra<br />
