<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">08-26-06, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in need, for the life of me I can't find episode guides. The reason, I quit watching both bleach and naruto due to issues with free time quite a while ago. I was wondering if you might make this a bit easier. I need help remembering the  numbers of the last episodes I left off on.<br />
<br />
Bleach - The last ep I watched was when ichigo was about to take a fireball to the face and at the last moment rukia jumps in and tells him to get off his lazy arse. Or something.. .. it was a vampire or something.<br />
<br />
Naruto - The curry arc.. that black stuff, anyhow it involved lee, naruto and company, an electrical blade wielding madman, and a paralyzed little girl... It was a girl, I don't care what you say, girl!<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thats what I remember, don't work too hard, and thanks much for the help. Want to get back on watching a couple a week, for a while though I'm going to be watching quite a bit I fear.</div></div><hr />

You want to start on episode 70.<br />
<br />
Naruto<br />
http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1825&amp;page=25<br />
The arc you talk about started in 152.  Not sure exactly where in it you stopped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go now young padawan.  Considering its all filler in both series, you have a boatload of ass ahead of you.</div></div><hr />
