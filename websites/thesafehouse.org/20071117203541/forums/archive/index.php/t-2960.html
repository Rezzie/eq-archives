<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_bugoo</div><div class="date">07-05-02, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have a few questions about the whip/whip dagger/etc:<br />
<br />
1) will the point blank shot and presise shot feats work with a whip?<br />
<br />
2) does a whip get -4 to hit for shooting into melee?<br />
<br />
3) can you take weapon finesse whip?<br />
<br />
4) could you dual wield whips?<br />
<br />
5) do you suffer an attack of opertunity if you use it within an enemyies threat radius (i think you do)<br />
<br />
6) can you flank with a whip, if so how close to the enemy do you have to be?<br />
<br />
7) can you trip/disarm from 15ft away with a whip?<br />
<br />
and one last bard question, does Inspire Greatness give +2 to damage or just to hit?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">07-05-02, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. no<br />
2. no<br />
3. yes<br />
4. sure<br />
5. no<br />
6. yes, 15 feet<br />
7. If that's the range of the whip, yes<br />
<br />
most of those questions can be explained by this: a whip has range, but is not a ranged weapon. It's a melee weapon, like a halberd.<br />
<br />
+2 only to hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_bugoo</div><div class="date">07-06-02, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">forgot to mention 3rd edition, is all you said still correct then and can you give like evidence for my DM?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kethaal</div><div class="date">07-08-02, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, all information pertains to 3rd edition. it's all in the PHB (look at the special rules for whips, it's a light weapon, it has range [similar to a halberd] but is NOT a &quot;ranged&quot; weapon.)<br />
<br />
present said evidence, if your GM disagrees, either smack them around, and tell them to read it more carefully, or just give up on the whip idea, and take MW Wakizashi's. They'll probably change their mind quickly after that. lol</div></div><hr />
