<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bahamut1</div><div class="date">07-21-05, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest was just added last patch to change the bind point of Call of Qeynos and Call of the Overlord spells that port you back to town. I didn't do the Freeport quest, but did do the Qeynos quest. Hopefully, someone can add the Freeport quest.<br />
<br />
There is a new npc, erudite, standing by the lighthouse. When you talk to him, he'll give ya a bracelet looking object. You'll have to solve 4 riddles, visiting those areas in Antonica.<br />
<br />
First one is about water, so go to the aqueduct between Oracle Tower and Windstalker village. There is a tree right by the aqueduct that you can &quot;climb&quot; to get up on the aqueduct. On the aqueduct, you'll see an orb. Touch it, get the update and you'll auto pop back on the ground near the tree. I believe the loc is -1400, -360.<br />
<br />
Second one is about air. Go on a griffon ride. Don't know if it makes any difference, but I took the Oracle Tower to Steppes Station.<br />
<br />
Third one is about fire. Touch the campfire at Sir Jeager's camp. He is near the ocean by Blackburrow. Paladin in shiny armor with a little squire boy at a camp.<br />
<br />
Fourth one is about earth. Just walk on Qeynos Highway. This is the main path/road through Antonica. As soon as you get to the road, it will update. <br />
<br />
After this is all done, you'll learn a new skill called Set Bind Point. It is in your abilities tab under knowledge. Apprentice II level.<br />
<br />
I set my bind point in Starcrest Commune, in the bank/inn, right next to my door to my room. :)</div></div><hr />

Qeynos Harbor already has received a great deal of people relocating.</div></div><hr />
