<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenilya</div><div class="date">10-16-06, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going to school, kind of become a tutor to a japanese exchange student. She's 5 years older than me, and I'm looking for some good expresions/sayings for her. She's pretty independent, and doesn't mind the informality of the US, but I'd like some more 'proper' ways of saying things to someone older than me.<br />
 <br />
I've also learned that I know way more japanese than I realized. And that my accent is very decent. (she said)<br />
 <br />
Oh, and since I cant use kawaii, and I've allready used utsukushii, what is another way to compliment her looks?</div></div><hr />

Good, so read the kanji in Suzuka's post! :)</div></div><hr />

tatoeba = for example, that blouse suits (you) very well. literal: that blouse very suits is.<br />
<br />
ano blouse ha totemo niau desu<br />
<br />
&#32654;&#12375;&#12356;  utsukushii = beautiful; lovely.<br />
<br />
&#32186;&#40599; kirei = pretty, beautiful, can also deviate a bit from those but the 1st 2 are the most used.</div></div><hr />

Just curious but why did you use desu?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzuka</div><div class="date">10-18-06, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because he wanted polite version, and it sounds more natural to say desu at the end, if you say it fast. I speak japanese with few of my japanese friends from time to time, but I use more familiar form such as &quot;da&quot; as for desu, you can never go wrong with it. If you have some experience speaking the language you just know, that is &quot;right&quot;. Same thing with English. As for desu the &quot;u&quot; is barely if not at all heard.<br />
<br />
Can also say, Anatano(your) blouse(or whatever you want) ha totemo niau desu<br />
Of course it is better to just say the name of the person. For example Akiko-san no blouse&#12288;ha totemo&#65288;can also avoid this workd if you want) kawaii(kirei, niau,etc&#65289;desu</div></div><hr />
