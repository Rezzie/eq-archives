All Stealths are successful, &quot;failure&quot; is when a mob unhides you or a player sees you (ghosty).  High Stealth spec will decrease the chance of both, see Squink's Detect Hidden FAQ for details.<br />
<br />
#1: &quot;You are now hidden!&quot;  See above.<br />
#2: The only timer is for the time between combat and when you can restealth, which is 10 seconds.  You may remain stealthed as long as you wish.<br />
#3: I don't know what F5 defaults to, it's mapped different for me.  Ground target?  That works with Distraction.<br />
#4: Higher Stealth will increase your movement speed slightly while Stealthed, decrease your &quot;You are too close to an enemy to hide!&quot; radius, and make you generally harder to detect.  Read the FAQ.<br />
#5: You may want to head on over to the Ranger's Glade, though I don't have the URL.  Archers frequently run into hostility here</div></div><hr />
