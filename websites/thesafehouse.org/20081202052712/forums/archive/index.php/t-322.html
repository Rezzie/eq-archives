You know that any Kobold that attacked you in this area would end up as a stain upon your dagger... but perhaps you are a bit careless. <br />
 Failing to look brings you upon a horde of Kobolds, you know not from where they came or where they go; only that they hate you.<br />
 At first the fighting is easy, your daggers rip apart the dogs quickly. You take only minimal wounds with each you slay... yet more continue to come. Gradually you realize they are becoming more powerful, as if you were nearing someone/ something that needed guarding. <br />
<br />
BOOOM!! A huge fireball sends you hurtling backwards.<br />
<br />

Cat-man Ninja <br />
<br />
You look ahead to see some sort of huge kobold lord before you.<br />
<br />
 He pauses briefly to regain control, and readies another spell. You know you cannot live through this next blast, and look up to see your approaching doom- but instead you see the the Kobold in fierce combat with a cat-like figure. <br />
<br />
 The Cat clearly is more skilled however, and soon the Kobold turns to flee. The Cat then pulls out a knife from his belt and throws it right between the kobold's shoulder-blades.<br />
