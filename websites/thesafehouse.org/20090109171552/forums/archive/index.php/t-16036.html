<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arakasi</div><div class="date">12-07-04, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm close to becoming level 10 in my artisanship, but I'm curious as to where to go from there. I had planned on carpenter (or that path, whatever it is) because I want to make furniture for my home and stuff, but I'm wondering if it's the most feasible option. Is there an end all be all of the artisan path, like, smithing or something or does it not matter much? Also, I've made all of my App III runes that I can so far, is there a crafting path that I should choose for this instead? Will choosing something else effect my ability to make more runes in the future?<br />
<br />
BTW, the tradeskill system in EQ2 rocks, never thought I'd say that about any tradeskill system.</div></div><hr />

I can't quite recall what path you would have to take later on to craft your 20+ abilities, but be warned that there's a lot of interdependency later on that you'll have to deal with.<br />
Carpenter is a very viable path though. Wood staves (Maple, etc.) are in high demand among Outfitters and Weaponsmiths, and quills/paper are in equally high demand from anyone scribing skills. Also, by providing people with those essential supplies, they would most likely be more than willing to craft equipment and abilities for you. As far as I know, the Carpenter path doesn't rely on other tradeskills too much. You'll have to consult with Scholars and Alchemists, mainly for washes, resins, oils, and such.<br />

Hope that helped. :)</div></div><hr />

They sell like hotcakes, and I trade them to top armorers and weaponsmiths for good armor/weapons.<br />
<br />
And damn I make sweet looking furniture.  Have made 2 rare alder items - oval table and desk - they look so good.   Made a nice rare painting out of yarrow too, it's the centerpiece of my wife's place.  We have friends and relatives on Crushbone who often sell out of her apartment and what-not, and I'm told we've gotten alot of comments on how sweet our apartment is.  <br />
<br />
I love the carpenter class.   Consider myself an artisan before adventuere, for now anyways.  Only lvl 19 adventurer hehe.  Anyways, i do highly reccomend the carpenter class, it's a fun one for sure, mostly because of the furniture.  =)<br />
