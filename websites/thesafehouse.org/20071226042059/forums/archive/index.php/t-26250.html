At the GONZO Festa Fall '06 held this past weekend in Tokyo a sneak preview clip of a hitherto unnanounced studio adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet was slipped in at the tail end of the show surprising attendees. After the clip was shown the title was revealed as &quot;Romeo x Juliet&quot;. Release is set for 2007 with a format as yet to be determined. Attendees say the trailer was of high quality and the content was something along the lines of Chevalier. The title was shown only at the end, catching many offguard with the Romeo and Juliet connection. Confirmed staff include Director Fumitoshi Oisaki (Kaleido Star, Sgt. Frog) Series Composition by Reiko Yoshida (Kaleido Star, ARIA) and Producer: Dongyang Ikeda (Kaleido Star)<br />

Very interesting. Gonzo also made Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo. Gankutsuou is very highly regarded all-around. Hope they pull some of that magic on Romeo and Juliet!</div></div><hr />
