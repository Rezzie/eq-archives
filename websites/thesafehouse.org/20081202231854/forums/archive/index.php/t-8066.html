<br />
Not just bizziching. I mean to say, A) is anyone getting reimbursed for Poison Mastery, B) or has it been changed to accomodate?<br />
<br />
Or C) did anyone else in the game put points into it?<br />

<br />
I'm a little upset about it now. I got it for the &quot;never fail apply&quot; part. Now that PooP has been released, Vaslin tells us that the new poisons do not have an apply check. Increased speed is useless with them because they are buffs and so I just don't see anyone needing to sit down during a fight to apply one.<br />

<br />
From what I've seen of the new poisons, they don't seem to be a complete replacement of the &quot;old world&quot; poisons, just a complement...</div></div><hr />

Besides, it will help with making the &quot;new&quot; potions (if we ever find any).  <br />

The 50% bonus to success in combining alone makes Mastery worth it.<br />
<br />
However..<br />
<br />
As someone said above, these new poisons are very limited in effect and only a compliment to the old poisons. I find it quite beneficial to apply an old poison before a fight for my initial proc and then a 2 or 4 sec 'buff' poison to last the duration of the fight. When you hear &quot;--Incoming Mob--&quot; its quite nice to have yer poison ready in 3 seconds instead of 10. <br />

Even w/ 250 skill and GMAS you will still fail on poisons quite a bit and they're only tier2.  I'm sure Tier 3 or maybe 4 will not be fun to make especially w/ poisons up to 10 reagents in size. &amp;lt;a href=&quot;       <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rebu</div><div class="date">11-04-02, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think the reason they got rid of the APply Poison check is because higher skill Rogues can sell poisons to lesser Rogues.  But the check on 250+ skill poisons is insane for any level.  So this saves tiem, components and frustration for all and makes it a little easier for lower lev Rogues to buy poisons when they are hard for them to make.<br />
<br />
That and the way old poisons work is very, very different from that of the new ones.  <br />
<br />
And if you want to get knitpicky, you still need to make an Apply Poison skill check on old poisons.  I dunno about you but in duels old school blind poison + new snare one is fairly scary for others~. &amp;lt;center&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66715&quot;&amp;lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Pokn&amp;lt;BR&gt;&amp;lt;/font&gt;&amp;lt;/b&gt;&amp;lt;/a&gt;<br />
