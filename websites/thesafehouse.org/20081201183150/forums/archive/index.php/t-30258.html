We're only level 15-ish, but are both really enjoying it.  Sure, it's like WoW in nearly every aspect, but that makes is super easy to pickup.<br />
<br />
I wish it had a more centric PVP system, we tried the Monster Player thing but couldn't find any real players to fight.<br />
<br />
Not 100% sure we're going to activate after our 10 days is up, but it's looking like it :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pedric Cuf</div><div class="date">06-01-07, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love that the game doesn't bother itself with PVP. It's certainly hard enough to balance a game around one system of play; balancing it around two is simply impossible. WoW's PVP suffers for this, and then it carries over into PVE. I'm really enjoying this game, too.</div></div><hr />

O'course I was secretly sacrificing gnomes and halflings in hopes to appease the MMOG Gods to make it FUN and so it is! Does this mean I have to stop the rituals now? BAH! *Remmi scowls and skulks off*<br />

<br />
something about getting upgrades every 5 minutes irked me too.  i mean, i love upgrades and all, but i dunno.</div></div><hr />

I think you level waaay too fast in LoTRO. Seems to me you should spend a few weeks getting through your twenties, not a few days.</div></div><hr />

A lot of it has to do with how you play the game as well. You can just blow through quests and never stop to look around... hitting the cap pretty quick. But that's not really what LotRO is about. It's about the lore and the world. I find it a refreshing change that killing some pigs actually has a storyline worth reading in it and you find other quests referencing each other. NPCs that thank you for helping them out and inquire about how things are going. Yah, I know... they're NPCs, but the flavor is quite nice.<br />
