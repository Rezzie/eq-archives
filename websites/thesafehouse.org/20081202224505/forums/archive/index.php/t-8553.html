<br />
Went there yesterday and found the Maestro of Rancor easily. When you zone in, take the small stairs at your right then the hall in front of you, the large stairs and enter the big house (double door). cross the hall, through the doors and the Master is there at your right.<br />
<br />
Beware, he is now a lot harder to kill !!! (red to 65, double for 1khp proc and summon but slowable). We got wiped in no time.<br />
<br />
Was not able to go pass him and see if the book still near him.<br />
<br />
Any information about the new location would be interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">awarsoca</div><div class="date">05-15-03, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">supposedly its in the building immediately across from the entrance to the Maestro's house, first room on the right.  I haven't been there myself to verify though.<br />

Note, there were three mobs in the house, but none saw through hide. Your mileage my vary.</div></div><hr />

Now then, how drastically has the zone changed?  Is the infamous, elusive map with colored pathing completely out the window now?  Should I just gather the testicular fortitude and make my solo run and find out myself?  Why am I asking so many fking questions?<br />
Thank you for the input, this helps a lot!   <br />

Megalor01 is right. Its in that room, on a nightstand type thing though. Its a half open book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tholin</div><div class="date">05-16-03, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well is the book easier to get this time around then taking the route into the Maestros room? Or same all in all.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shibi The Wizard</div><div class="date">05-16-03, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ID say harder niw. From what i heard before, only thing that would see through sneak/hide before was specters, but only if you werent behind them. Even with a rogue at my level. lvl 52.<br />
<br />
But even around ent, mobs saw through my sneak/hide.<br />
<br />
All dark blue mobs i found around the ent didnt see through, cept specters, and maybe a chest. Evens and yellows were about 50/50 that could see through. Reds. almost allways, if not always, saw through it. But i havent had alot of experiance useing, and learning sneak/hide to its fullest with my rogue, so i could be just saying stuff everyone else would know.<br />
<br />
As for the building it self, that the book is in, i was able to sneak in there while the raid was buffing and stuff for maestro, and get the book no problem. Zero see invis mobs in it for me.</div></div><hr />

Faster? Slower? I'm guessing it's the same as before but it would be cool if it was faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Escado</div><div class="date">05-17-03, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Infos for Maestro.<br />
<br />
Lvl 70<br />
<br />
Hits 1k got 1.5k Lifetap. Not Slowable.<br />
at 75% 2 Hands spawn. They hit for 500 and got about 30k HP. Need to be killed fast or MoR regains HP.<br />
Later 3 Banshee adds to drain Mana and Charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phack</div><div class="date">05-17-03, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got the book tonight... didnt go myself, took the chance to go while guild was exploring the new Hate.<br />
<br />
Fun zone, the mobs were kinda gimp.  No named up except Inny and we didnt have the firepower to try him.<br />
<br />
Guess I'll just verify that, yes it spawns in the house across from the Maestro's place where everyone else said, and none of the mobs see through a level 51 hide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Delghinn00</div><div class="date">05-18-03, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so you zone in.  There's a some stairs to the right that go up and then go right back down on the other side.  You take those?<br />
<br />
Then where?  I think I saw where the Cathereal is that you are talking about.  Two double doors, both facing in at an angle?  Don't know about all these other doors, seems most buildings have open door ways.<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
The first time I went up to the new plane, plane seemed to be at full pop and just about nothing saw through H/S.. I went to an open door way &quot;house&quot; across the street from two double doors and didn't see a book in the room that had a bed in it.  I think I was in the right place.<br />
<br />
I went up a second time and in the same spot as other mobs previous where mobs that could see through h/s.  It was just about half the mobs (that I could see and get semi near) were now see through h/s.  So there was no way I could move around without a raid that time.<br />
<br />
Tried to find a back way and of course one of the zillions of now 'see through all' mobs aggroed, I just choose to die instead of use my instant gate potion.  Hope I'll get up there before it rots and get it off.. should have a bit.<br />
<br />
I hope I'm in the right area looking for the book? Edited by: Delghinn00 at: 5/17/03 11:50:57 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ranwyn</div><div class="date">05-19-03, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got it!  First time in Hate, and it is amazing.  There was a raid party camped at the zone-in which probably greatly contributed to my success, but anyway.  Take the bridge on your immediate right...and just keeeeeeeep going.  You'll bounce off buildings, but keep creeping south and or southwest.  Just when you think you are way off and start to retrace your steps, keep going S/SW and you'll come to the staircase leading up to the Maestro's house, it is unmistakeable.  Directly in front of the steps is another house, with a goofy entrance.  You have to walk around a wall to get to the door, if that makes sense.  Inside the building &quot;foyer&quot;, were clerics, revenants, and a drake.  I nearly pissed myself when I opened the door.  Just inside on the right, there is a short flight of stairs leading to the target room.  From the doorway, the Book was there on the second table to the left, as an actual book, opened to the &quot;centerfold&quot;.  Inside that room was a sole revenant.  Through the entire crawl, I passed by mobs in doorways and alleys, none of them Lichs or Banshees mind you, but plenty of others (clerics, chests, golems, revenants, abhorrents, ire ghasts, kiraikuei, rats) and NONE of them saw through h/s.  When I first zoned in, the raid was fighting a Loathling Lich.  I'd swear I was facing it, or perhaps it was preoccupied with dying, but it DID NOT see me.  I was neither invised nor ITU'd, merely hidden and sneaking.  My opologies for the lack of loc's, but I was preoccupied with my own death at the time.  Hope this helps a bit; good luck!<br />

Was attacked from behind by one and died very quickly.  Even Thurg gate potion was not fast enuf to save me.  It must have been a rogue, cause it snuck up behind me!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Talmyrc</div><div class="date">06-22-03, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for info everyone, directions were 100% correct.  Location of house is 65, -176 and the book is loc 177, -326.  Used hide/sneak the whole way, no problems.  I assume some mobs saw through because they did not con &quot;indifferent&quot; but still no aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_mengelt</div><div class="date">06-24-03, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks to the tips on this board I got my book last night. Within 1 minute from zone in I had the book and was being ported out. The map in another thread was perfect. I studied the map aqnd visualized what I would be seeing when I was ported to poh. When I got ported in I didn't have to check back with the map at all I just knew the way. Went in the building and the book was sitting right there. (Was a little hard to see on the table for a Dwarf) Grabbed it, ran straight out never one problem. Was in zone for less than a minute! I dunno if the difficulty has been hyped up or I just got lucky, but it was extremley easy for me to run in and get it and run out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furnok</div><div class="date">04-27-04, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Location of the house is actually p105, N276.<br />
<br />
It is the house due north of the cathedral.  You go in, mount 1 short flight of stairs, turn right, mount another flight of stairs and the book is at the loc already specified P177, N326.<br />
<br />
I saw an ashenbone drake at the top of the first short flight of stairs.<br />
<br />
Nothing saw thru SoS, although I did accidentally hit Ctrl+1 once trying to do a loc while strafing, and accidentally trigged my counterattack discipline.  Fortunately, I was not within aggro range of anything.<br />
<br />
The zone in is safe.  However, don't wander far, as there are mobs nearby.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_slypit</div><div class="date">05-07-04, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am sitting in front of the building with supposedly no mobs that see through SH but first mob inside the building is a Loathing Lich.... one of the few who see through SH. So either SoE changed the spawn OR the spawns can be random inside the building. <br />
...So am sitting here flipping through more info on web sites hoping to find some post missed saying &quot;OH it's easy do this and that and go here and there &quot; and be accurate .. /sigh<br />
Well back to looking /rant off <br />
This is for my baby rogue on second account ... 65 rog alt on main account has long been epicized (sp ? ) <br />

<br />
I grabbed it ran out to the steps of the Cathedral to meet my untimely death. Went back up and got my book on the corpse recovery. Still much fun though.</div></div><hr />
