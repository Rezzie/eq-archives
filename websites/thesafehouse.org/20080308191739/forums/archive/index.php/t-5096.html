21th level and placed my one rp into aug dex   <br />
<br />
Enven 7<br />
Stealth 7 (auto training errr maybe 6)<br />
LA 18 (maybe 19 cant rem for sure)<br />
Axe 14<br />
CS 18<br />
<br />
Anytips for BG? I'm going pretty much a pure Soulblade (low enven) but I almost wonder if thats even viable anymore? <br />

It allows you to do 4 spell like effects.  Sure as hell a lot more friendly and useful than a little extra damage from using two axes.<br />
<br />
Also at level 21 you should have perforated artery.  @#%$ that up, but you will get it eventually.  =)<br />
<br />
Also at level 20 your auto trained stealth will be 5.<br />
<br />
I figure if you are going for melee damage, which is why people go high LA, then they mind as well go berzerker since you are forgoing envenom.<br />
<br />
As for tips, stealth, crit and chew up with left axe =)...and use what little venom you have...its like free damage.  And the snare is so crucial.</div></div><hr />
