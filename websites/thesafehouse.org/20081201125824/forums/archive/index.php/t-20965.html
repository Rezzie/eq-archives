Any one else excited about this new DBZ fighter that is coming out soon?</div></div><hr />

Got Budokai 1 when it came out, and was so-so happy with it. Then they made Budokai 2 with cell shading, and that just made me even more disinterested. Plus it didn't seem like the game play changed. Then they put out...more? I didn't keep up. Basically I'm not going to be happy until I get fully 3-d movement with high speed manuevers, a cool fighting system, and a wide range of powers that are flexible. Kind of a long list I know, but that's the only way I'd be engrossed with another DBZ fighter.<br />
<br />
So...what's the deal with this one, anyways? :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every anime game they trash is TRASH.  I've seen them give good scores to the rare anime game that's actually good.  90% of all anime games are cheap pieces of crap thrown together to cash in on whatever is most popular with the kids at the time.  And their X-Play scores reflect that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya that is really neat. I like how the new company that made this game went for action this time..It also seems from the videos that battles are longer and you can take more dmg somewhat. I kinda hated in DBZ:B3 that fights where pretty fast but in the new game it just seems more like the show in a way...<br />
<br />
Also did anyone notice that now when your char gets low on HP he looks dmged now?? I found that neat.</div></div><hr />

The trailer looks pretty action packed, but in the review there's alot of characters punching air and shooting at nothing type stuff.<br />

It looks like they added alot of great stuff, but in the most important area, gameplay, they went with something that, from the videos, looks like its worse than before.</div></div><hr />

Not sure..the camera thing could be strange but dunno. But you can press a button to lock on but in the video the guy didn't seem to use it a lot..I guess that is something you would have to try to be sure..but i know there is atlest a lock on of some sort.</div></div><hr />

Heh 3 &gt; 1&amp;2 IMO. But its been so long i forgot how the first one went :P...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TorchTheDresser</div><div class="date">10-17-05, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played all of the Dragon Ball Z games (including the crappy Japanese ones and their American crappy counterpart, Sagas) and I can say without hyperbole that this looks like it's going to be the greatest, most important thing ever. <br />
<br />
Seriously though, I think this game will capture the essence of DBZ fighting at last, something that the previous developer of the Budokai series did their best to emulate but fell just a little bit short of achieving. <br />
<br />
My only real concern regards the diversity of the movesets for each character. Even though the last two installments added an array of new moves to the game's repertoire, I still thought as though each character had pretty much the same moveset (i.e. transformation, dragon rush, a fireball, and a finisher), which made the game quite stale after a while. Hopefully, that issue will be rectified and the series will soar to new heights.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, I'm sure I will buy it anyway because I have no idea how to handle money.<br />
<br />
P.S. I also hope they fix that bug when some characters would keep their first form voices even after transforming into their final form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My gut tells me this is going to be an issue in Tenkaichi too, just based on Budokai 1. You can't have 60 actual characters without some over lap occuring, and considering how real little variance there is in the kinds of abilities used in DBZ, you'll probably be seeing a lot of duplicate moves. That was a gripe of mine with Budokai as well, it rarely mattered which character you played. The HTH moves were different but the range of powers available generally wasn't. Again, I'm really going to be looking at the flow of game play less than the diversity of characters. DBZ the cartoon series had enough cookie cutter bad and good guys, I don't expect the powers to be any different. As long as the game play comes close enough to capturing the way a DBZ fight should be, I'll be satisfied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">10-17-05, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya. I think the moves for each char in Dragonball Z:Tenkaichi will be almost the same due to what you all say. But as long as it feels like a DBZ fight its all good. Im sure if this turns out well they will make a 2nd and maybe focus some more time on moves etc...<br />

They say wed afternoon but who knows hehe. But im kinda upset about not being able to transform during battles but I guess its more realistic to have them stay one form...b/c in the show they kept that form for most of the fight anyway....</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're watching what show now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-19-05, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, after doing some practice, here's what I have (and mind you I haven't stayed up to date with the game series). <br />
<br />
It's all about timing and the kinds of combos you want to create. There are no complicated button combos to memorize to launch power attacks now, it's just hold a shoulder button, triangle, and one of the d-pad buttons. But there are an a ton of ways to approach basic gameplay. Between dashing, different style combo attacks, the smash attacks, the dragon rush, teleportation, perfect blocks, blocks, positional blocks, ect.... there is a lot more to remember in regards to basic combat. Add on the top of that learning to manuever effectively, and the real challenge I think is in mastering and using all the basics effectively, rather than mastering your super move button combo. <br />
<br />
As for differentiation between characters, there seems to be quite a bit. The different melee attacks, throws, charging attacks ect... have lots of room for variation. The speed at which other characters can target and lock on to each other is different (as to whether they are a z-fighter, a human, using a scouter, or have some innate ability to detect stuff). Plus with character favorite abilties (which are just another easy 2 or 3 button combo pressed simultaenously) add another layer of character differentiation. Then you can upgrade and customize, so....yeah, lots of variety, even at the basic default level. <br />
<br />
That's about it for now, other than to say I'm getting my ass tossed around by the AI whenever I drop the ball. There's so many nuances to remember when you get hit and need to recover, and I get the dash and evade button mixed up a bunch and it costs me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">10-19-05, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya its a lot different hehe. Even sometimes on easy the AI is super hard....think its b/c of the stage tho since most of the time the AI goes up a level or so when ya reach the final boss of a saga...Overall attacking is not too bad but learning to defend is prob the hardest like Nen said....<br />
<br />
Edit:The base forms suck :P...altho the use of kaio-ken now is neat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-19-05, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">omg the super-monkey fight with piccolo sucks. Took me like 20 tries just to figure out what the strategy was, and then another 20 just to achieve it. (Normal difficulty here). My hands are still cramping from the effort. Don't give the ****** any quarter! Just stay on his ass until you get enough ki built up to SBC his ass. Of course, you have to do it like 5 times in a row....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-20-05, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so about 9 hours, and 500 monkey fights later....<br />
<br />
This game isn't so hard. The real trick to the game is no holds bar, never let your enemy breathe, take the fight to them style of game play. Sitting back or trying to be tricky and dodgy with your opponent just gets you blasted in the long run. When the AI has the chance to build power, it will do so, and then abuse the **** out of it's abilities. On medium, sans the ******* monkey fights, I pretty much plowed through every opponent by dashing in, starting with a dashing attack, couple combo attacks, a smash attack to follow it up, rinse, repeat. After about 3 times of that, do a finishing move, repeat the beat down, do a finishing move.....<br />
<br />
And that got me through the first two sagas in one night. Not that it's a total cake walk, it's not, and the AI still gets the drop on you once in a while.<br />
<br />
Still haven't done MP gaming, we saved that for today after we'd figured out how to play the game. MP fights are going to be intense. There is so much potential in DBZ:T for turn arounds during the fight it's crazy. <br />
<br />
On character diversity....meh. Not really too suprised by it in the end. Your favorite abilities are preset and can't be altered, same with your Z powers. Z-Evolution is all about slotting enhancements to a character that bump up strength, health count, ki count, ect.... plus a few utility items. Not a whole lot of difference between the characters in terms of power, although speed and toughness do seem to be a variable factor between characters. Style certainly is. <br />
<br />
THere is some small part of me that is a wee bit disappointed in the powers aspect of the game. The powers are basically peacemakers in this game. They either end games,  or equalize the fight. The entire fight pivots around not letting your opponent power up to hit you with their worst attack. So there's a lot less power usage than I would like. Plus the Finishing Move HTH combo attacks are a little over powered, being able to rush across the entire map to hit your opponent 20 times, with no button coordination required, is just too easy. Still, it's not bad, and if your opponent is mildly talented, they should give you a run for your money with instant transmission dodges, which are the greatest equalizers of all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">10-20-05, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question...When in Cell saga...at the end where ya fight with SSJ2 gho and a super powered up cell. How the heck do you counter his rush lol he seems to do the same cheap combo attacks we do on them haha? I just can't seem to teleport or counter fast enough to get a hit in =/.<br />

I haven't gotten into the cell saga yet. But I will say this. I'm not too hot on dodging as a strategy for winning, I'm not consistent enough. My strategy involves making sure my opponent never has the chance to get an attack off.</div></div><hr />

You use them in combination with other fusions to make get something &quot;unlocked&quot;...<br />
<br />
IE. Vegeta + scouter = vegeta with a scouter....<br />
or Absorbtion + Super mystic gho = majin buu absorbed with super mystic gho...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-20-05, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just did it. It works just fine. I was worried about the split screen as well, but it sizes down perfectly. Findiing your target isn't a problem. The camera putting you in a blind spot does kinda suck, but it's not a major issue because it doesn't happen all the time, and because the fight is always on the move, and you've got a lot of mobility, you can get yourself out of those positions.<br />
<br />
 The multi-player is straight up awesome. The CPU opponents can get kinda repetitive because the hardest enemies require the same basic strategy, but multi-player games are totally unpredicatable. Tons of block interrupts, instant tranmissioning out of the way of punches, shoot outs with ki blasts, last minute saves against super attacks that win the game....multiplayer is just ******* awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
That enough?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-21-05, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing I forgot to add. The targeting system in game is pretty good. Once  you've sighted your target for the first time, you will stay locked on pretty much forever, even at huge distances, even if you turn around and move backwards or side to side. Some characters that don't have top notch detection abilities lose lock when they lose line of sight. But for the z fighters and most bad asses, they stay locked on until they decide not to be. <br />
<br />
So when you're locked on, everything you do like (non-dragon) dashes and attacks go straight to where they are supposed to, even when **** gets all crazy and people are moving all around or soaring off through mountains and such. I know this sounds a little *der* to be explaining, but I'm pretty impressed by how well the locking system keeps you 'on point' with your enemy no matter what, while still allowing you alot of freedom of movement.<br />
<br />
I think you mentioned players whiffing into mid air due to the camera. That most definetly doesn't happen. What does happen though is super powers sometimes get caught up on the terrain, or can't fire at the angles the players  are positioned at. Sometimes it saves your ass. Sometimes it screws you. As long as someone it's directly beneath you, or above you, your super powers usually hit on the mark. Other than that there's really no whiffing involved that isn't the player's fault. I pretty much don't screw with the target lock once it's established. If you have no target lock, you are basically a sitting duck.</div></div><hr />

Like if you pick Krillain or Yamucha and your oppenent is roughly the same skill but he's playing like Gotenks or Vegeto, do you stand no chance of winning, or are they balanced despite how that would be unrealistic of the show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what i can tell yes they are different...<br />
<br />
Like SSJ4 goku vs base vegeta is kind a joke (this is in duel with no evo)...Vegeta's punch dmg is like nothing vs goku but goku's punches hit vegeta HARD. Only way vegeta might win is to spam finishers/fav to win. But if SSJ4 got off a Super Kamehameha on base vegeta...base vegeta would prob lose allmost 1/2 his HPs....while if base vegeta did a GG on goku, goku would only take a little dmg...<br />
<br />
Might need nin to help tell if this is true but from what i see there is a difference in all the different forms....<br />
<br />
Like androids can't power up (wow they got it right...). They get there power by hiting ppl..( They get it super fast too)<br />
<br />
Or like USSJ trunks...He is big and buff...he can hit hard but is kinda slow and KI is slow to get....<br />
<br />
But like SSJ gohan(kid) is fast and can hit fast but he needs to produce a ton of hits to do dmg or get enough combo to knock back....but like Buu(Fat) he is slow and KI is kinda slow but he hits hard and takes him less combo to knock back....<br />
<br />
Something like that..I wrote something longer but it got lost =/.</div></div><hr />

But there are counter balancing effects. Like most of the advanced forms don't have full power as a favorite ability (well Frieza's final form does). That's a big edge for the fighters, assuming they can survive the 20 some odd seconds it takes to get 2 favorite points. But the advanced forms are generally faster, tougher, do more ki and HTH damage, and yes, have more hp too. <br />
<br />
Here's the caveat. If the lesser Z fighter can keep the pressure on the other one, use powers intelligently and promptly, they can win. But it's the kind of thing where the first time you misstep, an astute player will lay you out. So I wouldn't say Kid Gohan vs. Majin Vegeta is a fair fight, but Kid Gohan can win. The player just has to be on top of their game. <br />
<br />
To give an example, Chouzu (sp?) is actually really good. He's quick as ****, he's got a 10 hit combo that is really quick, and he builds Ki like no body's business. If you're on top of things, you can litterally rush in, do 10 hits, finish with a smash hit, use finishing move, rush in, do 10 hits...I think you can win with just about any character, if you are aggressive enough.</div></div><hr />

Ya. Thats all assuming also your doing normal duel mode with no Z-evo....<br />
<br />
Hey nin you get to the part in the majin buu saga where vegeta has to live for like 120 seconds vs kid buu??<br />
<br />
Hehe i remember someone saying that when they did it that they felt like vegeta did vs him in the show lol. I almost agree it was hard as _#(@_( b/c kid buu was sooooooo much more powerful than vegeta....</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, I mean with no Z-evo. With z-evo you can balance out most of any of the character's short comings, health most of all. But using a Z-evo character for an advanced form against a normal z-fighter, like Krillian, is a lot like hitting a 4 year old with a sledge hammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think dodging is too bad....dodging finishing move ect.. really depends a lot on the angle the camera is set at. When the angle is really sheer it's practically impossible to guage where to hit the dodge, you have to do it on faith. Wider angles it's easier to predict when the ability is about to hit. Distance between attacker and defender also determines how easy it is to dodge an attack. If you're far enough you can just dash out of harm's way.<br />
<br />
 I think the melee dodging is pretty good actually. Dodging in the middle of a rush combo could be a little bit easier, but being able to instant transmission out of the way of smash attacks is pretty handy. Just wish it didn't eat up so much Ki to do so.</div></div><hr />

Well i mean as far as outside melee dodging...ya that is fine hehe. I mean some of the melee type dodges.  Could be the rush combos i have a hard time getting out off...and isn't goku the only one with the instant transmission? or do others get some form of it also? I find when it gets up close i can't seem to do a teleport to the side or behind them for some reason...I can only seem to side step =/. Maybe im doing the combo wrong...</div></div><hr />

But the character balance really dissapoints me.  Means I can't just pick a character I think is cool and not lose all the time so someone who plays to win.<br />

I think only the Goku line of characters and cell get it. <br />
<br />
The character balance isn't THAT bad. It's just that they will do a little more damage on their super attacks, and their melee attacks. If you let them cake walk you, then it doesn't really matter how powerful they were in the first place, everyone is equal when handing out a major ass whooping. The expcetions to this are charaters like Broly and Bojack, who shrug off the first 3 or 4 rush attacks. They are the exception to this. But if Krillian starts a match against Majin Vegeta, and Krillan busts out 2 kamehaha waves and another finisher in the first 30 seconds, it doesn't really matter who was more powerful to start with.</div></div><hr />

No like nin said it is possible to win if you out smart them...but if you #)(@_# up badly those blasts from SSJ3 Goku will hurt. I think the makers of the game wanted as close to the show as possible....you have the ability to win with every char but will not be easy. But as in the show you would expect the different forms to be a little more powerful. Or you could Z-evo Rikoom some and fight SSJ3 goku (with him set on normal no Z-evo). Kinda to simulate that Rikoom has trained beyond his base and is now stronger..while SSJ3 goku has not trained his new form at all and has standard powers...<br />
<br />
Kinda have to RP it sometimes :D....<br />

You will be at a slight disadvantage. But like I said, lots of characters that aren't in their nth form have perks that the more advanced characters don't. Full power is not something to take lightly. You can bust out super finisher after 30 seconds have passed in less than 3 seconds. Doesn't matter if you're the saibaman taking on Broly, that will equalize the fight very quickly.</div></div><hr />
