He thought it could have been better. My sister thought it would be funnier. I think it was worth the $5 matiné price, but am glad we didn't go at night for full price.<br />
<br />
worth seeing imo. Edited by: Greldek  at: 3/6/04 5:33 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eldoren</div><div class="date">03-06-04, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, that was sort of my reaction, it could be better, but most comedies aren't award winners anyway, so I'm satisfied.  And as for Snoop, I think hes a much better actor than rapper, but that's not saying all too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">03-06-04, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I was surprised I didn't hate snoop in this movie.<br />
<br />
SPOILERS <br />
I wish at the end though, they woulda showed more footage of the car getting trashed, than just the what, 2 or 3 scenes? Oh and the cameo by the original starsky and hutch dooders was kinda lame imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Eldoren</div><div class="date">03-06-04, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, but you sort of had to know that cameo was coming, I mean, they do those sorts of things in all the remakes that have been made.  And I wish Will Ferrel was in the movie more.... I love that guy.  *Arches back like a dragon*</div></div><hr />

Definitely worth the money we woulda spent on it if we hadn't used free tickets. :P<br />
<br />
Was very funny, and I liked the cameos at the end.<br />

<br />
Basically, if you liked the humor in Zoolander, you'll like this movie.</div></div><hr />
