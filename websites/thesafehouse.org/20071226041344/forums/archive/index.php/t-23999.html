<br />
So, episode four got released. Some stuff you may want to know before getting into the episode so you don't spend time confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, they jumped into the future. Yes, they will go back to the past. Yes, all the nifty stuff you saw in episode four will be explained, probably. You pretty much find out the secret behind Haruhi Suzumiya and the SOS, if you think about the scenes a bit.<br />
<br />
In more detail, episode two and three were titled &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya I and II&quot;, where this episode four is titled &quot;The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, the fifth episode is &quot;The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya III&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know, they're being funny about this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Episode four spoilers:<br />
The ear biting was MOE~ <br />
<br />
I find it funny how they are talking like everything depends on something for the end of the world. &quot;For the sake of the world, win this game.&quot; &quot;This last pitch deciedes our future.&quot; So ******* funny.<br />
<br />
The cat's out of the bag about the secret of everyone on SOS. But the secret of Haruhi herself may be a bit harder to guess. All will be revealed eventually, however.<br />
<br />
I can't get over the ear biting. It was so awesome~ I really loved how Yuki was catching NOTHING but anything that might hit her. Throw it to second! *flicks wrist* Haruhi's glove gets blown away.<br />
<br />
It was funny how apologetic Itsuki was, &quot;Sorry we're being so unreasonable.&quot;<br />

<br />
I'm not really sure how it's a spoiler, as you see that in the first two seconds of the episode. In any case, I apologize if it took away enjoyment, it was meant to help people not be confused and think they missed something.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, knowing this actually for me would have helped when I watched the first episode- at first, I was like... Did I download the wrong anime? haha :p</div></div><hr />

Loving it.  You really cant base anything off the first one (Episode 00)<br />
I do like it though.  ITs like a mild excel saga crossed with a school drama.</div></div><hr />

 Think the main point was to show that something happened that they had to turn back time...and that when she gets depressed something really bad happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Episode 5 was awesome. More Mikuru fanservice. Many mysteries solved.<br />
<br />
So now, we find out, Haruhi is God. Awesome. We have an ESPer, Alien, and Time Traveler. And Haruhi still doesn't realize it. Hmm. /bonks her<br />
<br />
Haruhi was so cool this episode, again. But being missing at the club? I sense bad mojo coming!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't advise reading the following spoiler unless you've seen ep. 5. But it's an explaination, although simple one, for the episode orders.<br />
<br />
It is this way because Haruhi wills it. If you see the next episode previews, you'll see that Kyon says things normally (i.e. the next episode is 5...) but Haruhi will say (It's gonna be episode 9!).<br />
<br />
It's also an &quot;play&quot; of sorts on the whole &quot;time plane&quot; thing. Time is just... bah, read what Mikuru said.<br />
<br />
If you ask me, it makes the series more fun and amusing. It's like KyoAni is trying to make you feel what Kyon feels. Being thrown around all over the freaking place by Haruhi for no particular reason. A nice touch if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

Oddly, that actually makes it make sense in the nonsenicalness of it all. :kroe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">05-09-06, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Episode six was awesome! Spoilers contained within.<br />
<br />
Man, did you see that upward angle shot of Haruhi? She was wearing a miniskirt, dammit! I was like, duuuude, just a little more... panty shot! What a tease. She has sexy legs~<br />
<br />
And Mikuru's swimsuit was a joke in itself. Outwardly, it looks like a cute one-piece bathingsuit. Then what! Another upward-angle shot of her jumping to hit the ball... it's a G-String!!!! *noseblowout*<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one is the beach ball....?&quot; yowza!<br />
<br />
They really layed the fanservice thick this episode. However, those aside, it was another brilliant episode. Haruhi announcing the culprit before anything even happens?! *Imitate's Kyon's forehead slap* But looks like she was wrong! The culprit is dead! Or is he?! Ha ha.<br />
<br />
From the interactions between the characters, you can tell a lot has happened in the episodes we haven't seen yet for character development. Pretty interesting, yes? I'm really loving this style of throwing you all over the place. It's like a cliffhanger every week, in a good way.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for episode 7!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked the end of this episode, where Kyon reflected upon what Yuki has been doing all this time for years. His treatment of her is so odd, because at times he treats her as a mere object, then other times he treats her as if she was an important person to him.<br />
<br />
Scared Mikuru moe~ Don't worry Mikuru, we'll protect you!<br />
<br />
While it was mostly talking, it seemed to be some premonition to a big event that's upcoming. I wonder what it is! No fanservice this time.</div></div><hr />

I mean I'm cool with that don't get me wrong, but I likes me some action too.<br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna make a post and ask for series advice based on what I like and currently watch, but I'll snag episode two and see how that one goes.</div></div><hr />

Think this series is more for its comedy/weirdness value then anything else. Not really that much action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Watch Haruhi's actions at the end of the episode, also Itsuki and compare to Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney<br />
<br />
Spoilered just in case people are sensitive, but it doesn't tell anything, just gives you a chance to recognize the parody your first time through.</div></div><hr />

An interesting episode, especially towards the end about the shadow perpetuator. I had a good idea on what happened before they reached the conclusion, but I didn't have any evidence to back it up.<br />
<br />
The Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney parody had me rolling on the floor. And man, did they lay on the Haruhi fanservice thick! Mmmm, delicious legs~</div></div><hr />

Aye it was, holy hell, i was like wtf on the class across the hall part,<br />

it did seem like a filler, but i dont think so, the only filler i think was the first episode.. even that wasnt much of a filler..<br />
<br />
yea, those two lines were funny.<br />

Anyways, they finally get to episode 4(10).. wonder what will happen?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">06-01-06, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The novels are interesting for the little details that get lost in adaptation, but it's a different beast than anime so one may not neccessarily like the novels.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for what you guys call &quot;class across the hall&quot;, while I was half asleep during the episode (shame on me, I'll rewatch it later) I believe you are referring to the children's pronouncation guide that is often told when they are kids, to teach how to pronounce the syllables in Japanese (ko, ki, ka, ku, sa, si, su, i, and so on) or the word games that are common in Japan.<br />
<br />
It's an issue of being lost in translation. I'll expand more on this in my guide.</div></div><hr />

Closed space, and  i cant wait for the episode that shows the &quot;dream&quot; Haruhi and Kyon have</div></div><hr />

In my humble opinion this is the best episode out of the whole series right now, just because of how cool and hilarious it is! Haruhi kicking the computer chief was :rofl :rofl :rofl <br />
I was also laughing hard when they showed who crewed Mikuru's fleet.. go go kitties! hahahaha<br />
Yuki, is, AWESOME!</div></div><hr />

I really liked the maid cafe. Especially Tsuruya! She's awesome as usual. And to see her cosplaying as a maid, a super awesome kind no less. KyoAni does not let us down for the 12th time!<br />
<br />
And I have to echo the sentiments on Haruhi under the tree. To see her so relaxed and reflective was a refreshing change of pace considering her personality. <br />
<br />
Can't wait for the last two episodes.</div></div><hr />

I liked it. There could never be a firm 'end', but this works nicely, with no feeling of a 'cop-out' in terms of the lack of finality.</div></div><hr />
