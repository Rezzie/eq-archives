<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Drakc</div><div class="date">06-05-00, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drakc wondered aimlessly through the trees of Kelethin. The guards watched him constantly. He chuckled, the only reason they saw him was because he allowed them to.<br />
    Most the merchents where wary of him, some wouldnt even sell to him. He didnt particularily care, he had the five finger discount.<br />
     His rapier made of the finest elven steel bounced rythmitically at his hip. He unconciously used this as a foot pace. The dirk of a Dark Elven Dragoon hung on his sagged belt below the waist.<br />
     Again he chuckled, the memory of the inky staring wide-eyed, with a rapier to the hilt potruding through his chest, as Drakc slowly removed his Dark Elven face reveiling his identity of a Half Elf, his true race.<br />
     The mask had allowed him to do this, his mask, his prized possesion second only to his mighty weapons. The trouble he had gone through to get this mask, well, was more then most could claim.<br />
      He had gone into Guk, the place of the foul Frogloks. This race was pretty much hated by all. But in tuth that wasnt their biggest problem. They where cursed by thier own kind, just in a different stage of life, or as most would call it, the after life.<br />
      Drakc had gone into the lowest levels of their unholy kingdom. Where the mightiest warriors and wizards of all the races battled the foul undead frogs.<br />
       He had heard rumors of several masks of this nature had existed down here, He had to have one of his own. While exploring these low chambers of Guk, he stumbled upon one with several humans and elves battling the common enemy. Not really wanting to get into the fight, he stayed in the shadows and moved towards the boddies of the slain froggies in search of some good loot(though in truth he was more after money then anything else).<br />
       He discovered a plain looking leather mask on one of the frog bodies. He felt a desire to put it on, as if some magical force was pulling him(though it was probably just his unquinchable curiosity).<br />
       Drakc slipped the mask on, and behold! The dark chamber turned as light as day.<br />
       Thinking this new treasure no more then a source of ultravision(witch was quite exiting to him) he began the long road(or maze) back to the top.<br />
       Being exited with this new treasure had somewhat thrown off his sense of danger, he fell upon a chamber with two dark elf warrios resting frome the battle(dark elf hated the frogs as well). <br />
        As he became aware of thier presence he drew his rapier quiker then even he noticed. But they merely said something in Dark elvish and waved him to put it away.<br />
        Curiosity nagged, but he wasnt stupid, Dark elves where trouble, and most where better dead then alive.<br />
        With his free hand he pulled one of his many hidden throwing knives and threw it at the closest warrior.<br />
         The inky fell, Drakc's dagger in his left eye never to be removed.<br />
          The second warrior was up, moving with unbelievable speed he drew his serrated blade and steel short sword while charging at Drakc. <br />
           Drakc held his ground till the last moment, spinning right as a serrated blade slashed through the air where Drakc once stood.<br />
          Drakc comtinued the spin while he drew his fine steel dagger, holding it in a back hand fashion.<br />
          The Dark Elf turned to face Drakc, and yelped as he dodged a backhand slash from Drakc's dagger, while bringing the short sword down on at a dangerous angle to block the peircing rapier moving in.<br />
          Drakc fell onto his back, brought his left foot between the warriors legs and hooked it around the knees pulling foward causing the warrior to fall. Drakc was up in a split second, the ebony warrior taking longer due to his heavy armor.<br />
          Drakc dove onto the warrior, rapier leading.  The blade sunk into the Dark Elfs right shoulder. With his right hand the warrior punched out with the hilt of his short sword smashing Drakc in the eye.<br />
          Both oponets at a disadvantage, they decided to end it fast.<br />
          The dark elf stabed foward with his short sword in the right hand, the move was easily parried by drakcs dagger, but the attack wasnt to score any hits, it allowed the warrior a fast downward swipe with his serrated blade to Drakcs blind side.  Drakc moved his rapier up to block, but then jumped back and pivoted right, bringing his dagger in for the kill, but again pivoted to the right and spun moving his rapier to the angle of the Dark elfs throught.  The warrior moved to block, but with the shoulder wound was too slow, there was a flash of steel and a spray of blood. The dark elf clutched his throat as he fell.<br />
          Drakc moved out of the room with more  caution then usual, leaving two Dark elves iin now one, large, pile of blood<br />
           (back in kelethin)<br />
<br />
          Drakc again decided to change directions, this time actually going somewhere.<br />
          Drakc was now one of the finest swordsmen in the city of Kelethin. He was a gired thief, not one of any cheap price, and he was also a mercenary, again one of the most expensive. <br />
          So where did one of the most famous rogues from Kelethin to Erudin spend most of his free time? Where else, the place where he slept at the doorway everynight(and most of his days as well), his humble home, the local tavern.<br />
          Between missions and rigs he was pretty much never sober. His hobby(besides dropping pebbles on the gaurds from the higher trees) was getting drunk.<br />
          He had never really learned the bartenders name, but he was one of the few Drakc actually called a friend.<br />
          Drakc removed several gold coins from his pocket, the bartender brought him several ales and wines.<br />
          Drakc sighed. Just another short wait till the next mission......<br />
<br />

&amp;lt;author input&gt; Hey, I just found this great site. I read several of the stories posted here and several of the tips on the other subjects, it helped me out a ton! I just started a new rogue (Drakc) and I am thankful that all of you have helped me(and alot of other people). I have never shown anyone my writing, but I want to publish books someday. If any of you read this story(I do plan to continue my little adventures of Drakc) please fell free to leave any coments or constructive critisism. I have several other stories I plan to post if I get any feed back at all(and the feed back is at least kinda positive).  Edited by Drakc at: 6/6/00 10:42:37 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-06-00, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Berdusk told me when I started, &quot;Try to learn and notice your grammar and spelling, your writing will seem more professional.&quot; Coming from the backround of 2 English proffesors I have to agree with this advice alot, although I'm not a pure model of it sometimes. Hehe. It seems before I started posting not much new blood was coming in, it was pointed out to me I may be inspiring or simply showing people to write. I'm not bragging here, simply stating an infered fact.   That made me want to write more, just remember someone might be reading and saying, &quot;Hey, this looks like fun, I think I'll try it!&quot; Anyway, You gave some wonderful posts on my stories, and I hope to extend that courtisy to you also. My only advice on writing is that to do it you have to be:<br />
a) observent - Writing is telling in words how things come together and describing situations and emotions. If you don't look, it's harder to write.<br />
b) creative - The DUH factor here is off the scale...<br />
c) persistant - People WILL and CAN rip your writing apart. I'm pretty used to this, but you may not be, don't stop because everyone says, &quot;you suck.&quot; LEARN from what you're doing wrong. If your writing doesn't EVOLVE, it will become boring.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's just my humble opinion. <br />
<br />
Keep it up, looks like I have some competition.   ==Jack of Hearts, Knight Errant... I'll come again, a theif I am. Your heart I'll steal, with a kiss to seal.==</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Drakc</div><div class="date">06-06-00, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx Kooran, I really appriciate your advice, I will plan to check my spelling and grammer better in the future. My mom is an english major as well, and when she read my story she said the exact same thing. This is the first time I have actually shown anyone my writing in public, I have always wanted to publish books someday.<br />
        And I cant wait to read the rest of your saga as well.<br />
        Thank you again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-07-00, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're very welcome. I'm 14 and still planning my career. As either a creative writer, or an animator. I just want a job I love and can do well.<br />
Give your mother my best regards.<br />

<br />
PS. Never start a sentence with 'and'.   I still have problems with that damn word.   ==Jack of Hearts, Knight Errant... I'll come again, a theif I am. Your heart I'll steal, with a kiss to seal.==</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Antikos</div><div class="date">06-29-00, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... you say to check your grammar and spelling in every piece of work you write, and then in the next sentence you spell &quot;professor&quot; wrong... hmm...<br />
No offense, just seemed a little hypocritical to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kooran Katshadow</div><div class="date">06-29-00, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL I said a million times, I am horrible in this area.<br />
I didn't say I was the one to look to- I only gave the advice I should be following. My gosh, what makes you so high and mighty eh?    Watch it or I'll write you in my story as an orc messenger! HAH! LOL, J/k man, but you seriously sound like you hate me! Boyoboy!<br />
BTW Wanna talk hypocrit? You're a rogue in a warrior guild?<br />
And you're talking like you own this place?    You're lvl 5 bud, go get some lvls-- and skills in politeness or I'll personally see how much the tongue of a fumbling blagard is worth.    Okies?<br />
Besides, my parents are PhD holding english professors and I am a 14 year old kid who likes to write. I just start getting where I think-- gee, I am actually kinda good at this and my parents find every mistake on the page.    Try dealing with that as encouragement.    As the famous John Cleese said when being asked why he wasn't still a newt, &quot;I got betta!&quot;<br />
And I'll get better to... eventually.   <br />
Just trying to give him the edge I don't have.<br />
YOU try and write with a buncha people looking at it, critizing it, and telling you how to write. THEN and only then do I think you have right to tell me I'm a hypocrit.   <br />
<br />
It's easier SAID then DONE.<br />
<br />
Nuff sed?<br />
<br />
LOL someone please agree with me?<br />
FYI I have high lvl characthers, am in an open guild, don't care about grammar as much as I should, and hate those who are patrionising to me.  &quot;The search for knowledge hath a pleasure like wrestling with a fine woman.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Arc CK</div><div class="date">07-05-00, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best advice I could give you is to try and paint a picture with words. Readers will really appreciate your work when they can actully see in thier minds what you are putting in your writing. As Kooran said: make sure you never start a sentence with &quot;and.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kooran I am 14 as well and was looking into a writing standpoint. I'm not much of a creative writer; I more or less like to argue with people from time to time. I do however love to write fantasy stories. Nothing better than using your imagination. <br />
<br />
One thing that I find so frustrating is that I might show my parents something that I just wrote and they criticize it horribly. I may have just put my best work out there and they tear it down. It is kind of discouraging. They aren't English professors but Lawyers. I can never win an argument with them ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Drakc</div><div class="date">07-11-00, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I know it has been forever since I have written anything.<br />
 So what if my first story wasnt a hit  , im gonna try again, youll see.<br />
I am going to follow all the advice I can get, thanks everyone for looking at my story</div></div><hr />
