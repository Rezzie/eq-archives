Any statistical evidence? Edited by: akra at: 10/27/03 7:16 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Heka01</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we were farming them heavily there were no noticable trends in 1 named being more chain liable than others.<br />
<br />
The only trends noticed were that Leather was FAR too common, Silk arms rediculously common and Plate gloves rotted very frequently.<br />
<br />
The various named essentially drop for 2 slots each with some overlap and PoEb named have more than 2 slots that they can drop for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most pof mobs drop molds for 2 slots each, not every mob drops every type of each mold though.  For instance, AMY drops gloves &amp;amp; hats, but doesnt drop leather or silk gloves &amp;amp; doesnt drop chain or plate hats, reparm drops are the opposite of amy - drops gloves &amp;amp; hats, but only leather &amp;amp; silk gloves &amp;amp; plate &amp;amp; chain hats.  gate bird drops any sleeves, think all other mobs drop 1 type of bracer + 2 types of either boots or gloves.<br />
<br />
poa mobs drop molds for 1 slot per avatar (minus of course the broken avatar who doesnt drop anything except after patches cause he never respawns, thx soe).<br />
<br />
the 3 lesser poeb mobs drop 3 slots (hats, gloves boots), gintolaken drops sleeves, vine ring in poe drops bracers.<br />
<br />
pow named I think drop 1 slot each (ofassa boots, hydrotha sleeves, mighty bracers)<br />
<br />
roughly 30% of all plate drops are gloves, roughly 10% of all plate drops are hats - yay for balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:roughly 30% of all plate drops are gloves, roughly 10% of all plate drops are hats - yay for balance<br />
<br />
Think that's just your luck with RNG, combined with possibly which molds you're farming. Our number of plate gloves and plate helms are roughly equivalent (from a pretty large sample of both), and the small discrepency I would attribute to which mobs we've farmed more than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are more plate glove droppers than plate hat droppers:<br />
<br />
plate hats drop off: reparm, 3rd avatar in poa, lesser poeb named.<br />
<br />
Plate gloves drop off: pyronis, amy, broken avatar in poa, lesser poeb named.<br />
<br />
The only way I could see having hats = gloves in drop rate is if you farm poa heavily (/barf).  If you spend the majority of time in fire, it would be hard not to have far more gloves than hats drop, due to the fact that there is 2 mobs that drop plate gloves vs 1 for plate hats.  The 30% gloves vs 15% hats is our rate after farming over 400 molds/patterns, thats a decent sized sample I would think.<br />
<br />
We got like 3 reparms in a row that dropped silk glovesx2 once which doesnt help our numbers out though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kalledar</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plate helms are one of our most common drops. They drop off EarthB Chieftains and Arch Mage Yozanni as well. Reparm has dropped 2 plate helms several times for us. Until we started doing EarthB chieftains, chain/leather helms were extremely rare for us. The chieftains seem to drop non plate helms more frequently than Reparm does, but they only drop one item per kill.<br />
<br />
I've heard that Magmaton can not drop plate, and I've not seen him drop it yet. He drops chain/leather quite often.<br />
<br />
Silk arms are far too common. Hydrotha and Quavonis both drop them way too much. <br />
<br />
Silk arms combined with all leather (minus helm and legs) are the items that are close to rotting for us (would rot if not for twinks and recruits). Several times we've had a caster recruit win charm bird arms, then 20 minutes later win elemental arms off Quavonis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Rasil Sabishi</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leather has our guild furious. It's a ridiculous waste of time to continually farm and get huge amouns of rotting leather. <br />
<br />
PoEB is known as the leather and silk emporium. Not that there is any truth to that on other servers or for other guilds, but we've just had bad luck with those named there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Derrict</div><div class="date">10-27-03, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">best source for chain boots, magmaton, though there's a remote chance ofossaa can drop it but OtE tends to drop more plate/silk boots for us.<br />
<br />
chain bracers are common pretty much everywhere, kriziik the mighty, avatar of wind, blazzax, earth-a vine rings, minis during coirnav script.<br />
<br />
chain helm your best bet is reparm<br />
<br />
chain gloves from AMY, pyronis, avatar of dust<br />
<br />
chain sleeves from quavonis, hydrotha, or poe-b chiefs.  quav and hydro are all random, unlike some of the other mobs that seem to be more class/slot specific (ie AMY, Reparm)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might wanna double check that - amy does not drop plate hats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;plate hats drop off: reparm, 3rd avatar in poa, lesser poeb named.<br />
<br />
Plate gloves drop off: pyronis, amy, broken avatar in poa, lesser poeb named.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The overwhelming majority of our plate helms have come from Reparm. And you're counting AoSmoke? Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was simply listing the places where plate hats are available.  Obviously you are going to get the majority of your plate hats from reparm as pof is where most farming of molds/patterns is done &amp;amp; he is the only mob that can drop them there (avatar of smoke was listed as it is one of the other sources of plate hats - I listed all possible sources).<br />
<br />
Since there are 2 mobs that drop plate gloves in pof vs. 1 that drops hats, it is very likely that you will have far more gloves than hats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_akra</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We too have 2 gloves per 1 hat but let's keep this on chain droppers since they have the least chance to drop compared to the number of people that need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shareel</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got 2 chaingloves from AMY and one changloves from reparm in one night around 3 weeks ago. Chaingloves can drop from both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dubbo</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never ever seen chain gloves drop from Reparm, have a hard time believing that. There was a while where nobody (in particular the French guild that's in EPs on my server and clears stuff before we log in) would touch Reparm, but of course everyone kills froggie. Thus we've had many more Reparm/AMY kills.<br />
<br />
Overall, we are way behind on chain. Leather practically rots, plate is 2x as plentiful as silk/leather, and chain is still needed by virtually every chain wearer in guild. I chalk it up to bad luck with RNG and relative rarity of rogue loots, same as every expansion (like us getting 1 GRMK in 18 or more Solusek kills, for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Aliandra</div><div class="date">10-30-03, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chain: 62 (3 legs)<br />
Leather: 65 (8 legs)<br />
Plate: 117 (9 legs)<br />
Silk: 97 (5 legs)<br />
<br />
This is our drops.  As you can see leather isn't that much more common than chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">10-30-03, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our drops are similar, but we have leather going to alts and rotting, which chain is still in high demand. Part of it is due to our leather classes having some very nice gear from Emp and VT that they wont part with even for elemental gear. Another part is that we have less leather class people than we have chain people.<br />
<br />
We have a shaman main whose BL alt is far better geared that he is. Pretty sad.</div></div><hr />

----My Comments<br />
<br />
AMY has indeed dropped Plate helms for us, quite exstensivly infact, however in the last month or So I cant rememeber him dropping any plate helms...<br />
<br />
And yes leather drop are annoying....<br />
<br />
Plate Arms were weird for us, they used to be the RAREST plate mold for us, after 2-3 months in planes we had like 4 total plate arms, now they go to alts while people still need others...<br />
<br />
Overall for Plate I'd say Boots are the rarest.... Edited by: MadroneDorf at: 10/30/03 10:21 pm</div></div><hr />
