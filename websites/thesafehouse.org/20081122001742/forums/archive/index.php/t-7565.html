<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FinnMacKool</div><div class="date">05-21-01, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there, Im 33 human Rogue on TZ and what a rush, licked em fair and square. I had logged the night before at FV bank with about 1/2 health. THe next night I logged on and was getting my bearings, checking who in zone and who all in guild was on and bam Im attacked by a pet and blasted by major spells. I couldnt find who was casting the spells and was watching my health go down big time. I died and had a long journey from Freeport back to corpse (teaches me to forget to get bind). During the boat rip back I went throught the dialoge and was sure I knew who had been the caster. I collected my things in FV and went into sneak/hide mode, switched my BSF to primary (from inventory) and made sure it was my Tombcarver in off hand. I found the High Elf caster and snuck up behind her and delivered a 123 BS, switched BSF for my Stiletto of bloddClaw and started to slice and dice. I watched my health drop some but hers was going down fast. My heart sank as I watched someone healher almost back to full health but I kept on moving fast and using BS every time I could. She had another Nec friend that started to cast on me and I shouted out to leave us be.....Well, she died and I was pumped for about 20 mins heheh...Iloved it!<br />

casters should learn that one good bs is about 1/3rd of their life. and it doesnt cost any mana!<br />

It makes all the crap you've been through completely worth it.<br />
You haven't enjoyed everquest until you start shaking while playing the game from excitement and nervousness. 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />
