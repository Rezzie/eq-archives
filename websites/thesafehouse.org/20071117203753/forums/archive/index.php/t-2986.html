I know I asked this here before but it wasn't about EQ so without further ado:<br />
<br />
Besides the EQ player handbook itself what else do I need? And what major store chains can I get these things at (or net retailers)? Please be as specific and exhaustive as possible :(<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, as far as I'm aware, all you need is the EQrpg handbook. you MAY want the d&amp;amp;d player's handbook, but I don't think you need that.<br />
<br />
other than that, there aren't any eq books out - the other books (such as monsters of norrath) are still forthcoming. since I'm not sure how many monsters are given stats and such in the eq book, you may want to get the d&amp;amp;d monstrous manual just for a variety of stuff.<br />
<br />
but I think, for the most part, you should be able to get by with just the base book.<br />
<br />
as for chain stores, I've seen it at the following places: hastings, barnes &amp;amp; noble, and uncle's. you also shouldn't have any trouble finding it at any other local comic/game/hobby stores in your area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I'm talking dice etc. do these come with the book or do you know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">11-02-02, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh okay. no, dice don't come with the book, so you'll have to buy your own set.<br />
<br />
at the hobby stores you can find sets of d20/d12/two d10/d8/d6/d4.<br />
<br />
it's good to have two d10, and at least a few d6s for each person. other than that you can generally get by with only one of each of the others (per person), though as you get higher in level spells tend to start taking multiple dice (usually d6s or d8s). <br />
<br />
a good bit of scratch paper usually helps, especially for the dm. since the eq rpg runs off a mana system for magic, mages will want that (or a calculator) to keep track of their mana pool.<br />
<br />
also something to consider, if you're really serious about it, is trying to get a mini hex map and some kinds of miniatures. when you're in combat, or moving through a dungeon, they can really help to give everyone a perspective on where their characters are placed. certain skills/feats/spells can require moving through enemies, like tumble to move around for a backstab, or there are the area spells like fireball that you obviously want to know where you can shoot for maximum effect and mininum harm to yourself or your group.<br />
<br />
our group generally doesn't use miniatures, but if you have three or four characters playing and come up against at least that many monsters, miniatures can be a huge aid.  Edited by: Matheren at: 11/2/02 3:28:57 pm</div></div><hr />
