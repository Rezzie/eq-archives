<br />
   &quot;Grontag like this camp.  Warm fire, good for cooking Dwarves over.  Plenty of Dwarves to cook too.  Shaman good at cooking Dwarf.  Gets all hair off first so doesn't stick in teeth.<br />
   &quot;Who is this?  He not Dwarf, he much bigger.  He wearing metal.  Metal not tasty, metal doesn't roast good.  I not look at him, maybe he go away.&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;Tibis bashes YOU for 1 point of damage&gt;<br />
   &quot;OW!  Me kill you!  Come on everyone, roast human tonight!<br />
   &quot;Not coming?  Hah, more meat for me when he roasted!&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;You try to hit Tibis but you miss!&gt;<br />
   &quot;Hah!  Lucky!&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;You try to hit Tibis, but Tibis dodges!&gt;<br />
   &quot;Now what he doing?  He not fighting.  Oy!  Get yer hands out me loincloth!&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;Ten minutes later.&gt;<br />
   &quot;Grontag not believe this, he still not fighting, just feeling me up occasionally!&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;Another ten minutes later.&gt;<br />
   &quot;Grontag bored with this.  Me going away.&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;You hear a ghostly voice say &quot;Pizza's arrived!&quot;&gt;<br />
   &amp;lt;Tibis Heartseeker pierces YOU for 14 damage!&gt;<br />
   &amp;lt;Tibis Heartseeker pierces YOU for 12 damage!&gt;<br />
   &amp;lt;Tibis Heartseeker slashes YOU for 5 damage!&gt;<br />
   &quot;Aargh!  Run away!&quot;<br />
   &amp;lt;Tibis Heartseeker pierces YOU for 10 damage!&gt;<br />
   &amp;lt;Tibis Heartseeker backstabs YOU for 52 damage!&gt;<br />
   &amp;lt;YOU have been slain by Tibis Heartseeker!&gt;<br />

In case you hadn't guessed, I was doing pickpocket practise on a goblin in Butcherblock.  My mind was thinking about the fact that goblins only wear loincloths which is where they probably keep their money.  The rest of my train of thought you can work out for yourselves   <br />
