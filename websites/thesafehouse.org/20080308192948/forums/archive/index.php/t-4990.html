<br />
In numerous posts, I have seen people say that it is pointless to put more than 30 points into stealth, because the benefits of Safefall 4 are not needed.  <br />
<br />
What my question is, is it harder for someone to see you with 50 points in stealth, than if you have 30?  Do the points put in only give you the attached skills (ie new safe fall) or does it make it harder to be detected.<br />
<br />
Also, if i only put 30 points into stealth, is it safe to assume I will be able to get enough +items and RP to get me to 50.<br />
<br />
Oh...one last thing, if I do in fact get into my 40's in stealth by items/RP, that only gives me the ability to go stealthy with a 40's skill, but I dont get the Safefall ability that would be attached if I had put points in....Right??  Damn this is all confusing   <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I don't know whether Realm Point bonuses are capped.  If so, than probably not.  If not, then yes, but you'll spend a looooooong time on the frontier to get that many  <br />
<br />
As I understand the skill bonus system, item and Realm Point bonuses increase your effective skill, but don't grant any special effects/styles associated with the increased skill level.  So, yes - you'd have Safe Fall 3, but would hide as well as someone with a trained Stealth of 50 (but with a few more spec points to put somewhere else  ).

L39 should do ya fine.<br />

How stealth works, <br />
<br />
Non Stealthers as Detector;<br />
Detecter Character Level - Stealth Train Level * 1/2 = <br />
# paces you can be seen at. <br />
<br />
Stealthers as Detector<br />
Detecter Character Level- Stealth Train Level =  <br />
# Paces you can be seen at. <br />
<br />
So if your training is Skill 30 and a L50 tries to detect you (Non Stealther) about 10 Paces Stealther about 20 Paces.<br />
<br />
Be aware it takes some Lag for your comp tp transmit position, other players comp to send location, Game to compare, make y/n, and display. In those (assume) 3 seconds a player will cover about 6 paces. So a player you CAN see coming right for you enters your visible envelope 10 paces away and is actually on your screen at 4 paces. By the same token a player who crosses inside your envelope moving away will recieve a &quot;Yes&quot; command and pop visible 16 paces away. Same player. There is supposed to be a &quot;2 Pace&quot; envelope where you are ALWAYS visible. It still takes 3 seconds to pop visible. <br />
<br />

<br />
ps; I use the &quot;Pace&quot; because it's far easier to understand. A &quot;pace&quot; in DAoC is about 50-55 &quot;clics&quot;. The actual formulae above per Mythic is 25 and 50, hence 1/2 a pace and 1 Pace. Most players have a good sense of how far they move in 10 paces; while &quot;500 clics&quot; means next to nothing to many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shandray</div><div class="date">04-01-02, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, reason why people say 29 base stealth is that you can &quot;supposedly&quot; get:<br />
(+11 stealth from items [by lvl50 ] ) + (another +10 stealth from realm rank 11) equalling +21 to stealth.<br />
<br />
29+21=50 stealth<br />
Most people say go 39 to base stealth +11 in items 'cause they know it takes a long time to attain realm rank and they want to reap some rewards early on.  Valid point.<br />
<br />
realize that you will have a very hard life as an assassin with a base 29 stealth before you can aquire +11 worth in items AND especially the +10bonus for realm rank11 RPs.  Also, since you can only have item buff equal to LVL/5+1 to any skill, you will have to be lvl50 to get full item effect.  BUT, in the loooooonnnng run, you will have saved enough specs for other skills from leaving your stealth at 29 or 39 that you will &quot;likely&quot; be a superior assassin in the end.<br />
