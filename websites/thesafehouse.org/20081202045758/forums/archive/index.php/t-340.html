<br />
I'm camping the frenzied (were rolling 300 to 400 and I got a 307 on the only FBSS roll) with some friends and some other people I don't even know, but I became to like them all.  They were a good group of poeple that knew how to do their job and had a good sense of humor as well.  We were sitting there in between pulls and someone shouts &quot;looking to loot a mask of deception.&quot;  So did a /who and he was a lvl 7 rogue.  I REALLY hate young rogues running into one of the most dangerous parts of the world just so they look like an inky.  So I shouted &quot;Argh, I hope you know what you are getting into.&quot;  And he replies &quot;Hell, I ran my blind (he's a barb) ass though kith at night to get here.  I'm not turning around now.&quot;  I was impressed.  Just then, a female warrior in my group that I go WAY back with says in groupsay, &quot;That sounds like a little Kul.&quot;  Then she said &quot;his balls are hanging to the ground.&quot;  Heh, I thought that was a damn good compliment.  It got me thinking.  I remember when Kunark came out, I was one of the fools that went to the Dreadlands right away and even though the mobs scowled through hide sneak, I ran under them, bumped them, etc to see if they attacked, without sow, mind you.  Then like two days later, I saw some friends of mine in the emerald jungle and I decided to head over there alone, sneaking through three zones of stuff that scowls , just to get there.  When I get there, a friend of mine says &quot;man, you're nuts walking all the way up here by yourself.&quot;  So I guess I'm a bad ass now    Just thought I'd share my stories of people jacking my ego.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dove in, swam for what seemed like minutes, my lungs burning with stale air. I carefully surfaced, filling my lungs with stagnant, but beautifully tasting cave air, and brought myself up into the Lower Guk bedroom.<br />
<br />
What a feeling! It was like sneaking through the goblin tunnels that zone from Lake of Ill Omens to Warsilks Woods.<br />
