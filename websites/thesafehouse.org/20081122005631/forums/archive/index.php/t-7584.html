Not one.<br />
Two of the targets they were used on were four levels above me - the other was a few below me.  I can understand the resists on the person above me - but the person below me was a completely naked halfling druid with no buffs up.  I was using paralyze I and spine break I.  <br />
If this continues happening i'm just going to stop using poison, freaking ubsurd.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any simmilar or different experiences? 											Cylant Butdeadly<br />
