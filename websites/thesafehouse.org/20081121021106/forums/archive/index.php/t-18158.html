Click for the full scene in high res, it's got terrific detail!</div></div><hr />

You'd think Aradune would have sent us over a sweet pic of a rogue.  Ah well, one can dream.  Maybe next time Mr. McQuaid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pulid</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That guy needs a much bigger sword. That kitchen knife isn't going to chop anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetrose</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so is this guy a NPC or is he a PC?  Pretty sweet graphics either way :O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd think Aradune would have sent us over a sweet pic of a rogue.<br />
<br />
Ya know, that's what I was secretly hoping for. :D Class structure has not been mentioned much at all and is part of the top secret special sauce that hasn't been spilled yet. I'm assuming with Kendrick on staff we needn't worry.  :evil No pressure there, eh?<br />
<br />
That guy needs a much bigger sword. That kitchen knife isn't going to chop anything<br />
<br />
From what I gather from the Vanguard web site, much of the weaponry is still in development. The sword may be a generic place holder or it could be simply a newbie zone acquisition. Though, that armor appears pretty uber for such a minor blade.<br />
<br />
I find the face stunning and the detail in the garb is beautiful. The only thing that kind of looks awkward to me is the boots. I wouldn't want to be kicked in the shin by Gregor Macrae, that's fo sho'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">04-04-05, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are lots of place holder graphics still in place, as was said. And again as Nocte mentioned, considering no one outside of the Summit atendees or Sigil staff has any idea what classes look like.....we're all just excited to see a guy wearing armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">04-05-05, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty nice! I like it :)<br />
<br />
But I have to admit that I totally dislike the large chainmail rings on the legs. Those are waaaay to big for realistic mail. Rings usually measure like 1/2&quot; or less, not 2-3&quot; as on his thighs.<br />
<br />
 The only thing that kind of looks awkward to me is the boots.<br />
<br />
While awkward looking, they are quite realistic and resemble old medival plate boots. And I guess the very reason they were made that way was to kick people while being on horseback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velvetrose</div><div class="date">04-05-05, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the boots looked correct...thats what they look like in Museums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nocte</div><div class="date">04-05-05, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've seen the style before. I think it's their proportion that's bugging my eyes. It may be a trick of the lighting as the shadows fall behind the model. The lighting effect may just be tricking my eyes into enlongating the feet. Either that, or Macrae is a real ladies man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cedon</div><div class="date">04-06-05, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">very sweet pic.<br />
and who's to say Gregor Macrae isnt a rogue  :evil  lol what with the short sword and hooded cape.<br />
very cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">04-06-05, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogues don't use shields :p And they dual wield :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thwick</div><div class="date">04-07-05, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They don't wear plate, or fairy boots like those as well (unless they have an insane Agility modifier).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">04-07-05, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on the suit of plate armor :p If it is complete noiseless and has nice dex/agi-modifiers and no hinderance, I'd wear it for sure!<br />
<br />
*remembers the days of Mrylokar's Suit*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulthien</div><div class="date">04-07-05, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ2 also has ways more hi-res renderings in pre-marketing phase then what really came out with the engine implementation. <br />
<br />
Do we know if this is a redered still-shot or already engine screenshot (what FPS on what card)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">04-07-05, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As noted on Vanguard's screenshots page (http://www.vanguardsagaofheroes.com/screenshots.php), all Vanguards shots are in-game and un-enhanced (except for the addition of a Sigil logo).  fps doesn't matter because items (such as environmental shadows) haven't been added to the engine yet.  Quoting one of Brad's Vanguard posts:<br />
Environment shadows come later and are very expensive -- one of the strategies we've been using is to wait on implementing certain technologies when we know better ones are on the horizon but before release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lashiec</div><div class="date">04-08-05, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i understand it, the pointy elf shoes were for stirrups on a horse :)<br />
so i guess the picture might imply mounts of some variety?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">04-08-05, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanguard FAQ:<br />
<br />
13.1.5 Will there be horses? How will they work, how important will they be, and are they just a status symbol or integral to the game?<br />
<br />
Horses are integral to ground-based travel. We expect characters to own a horse fairly quickly to help with travel. <br />
Horses will also be able to store goods and even be enhanced with certain items, just like your character and/or your ship. <br />
<br />
It is also possible for combat to take place while on a mount, or even while on board ships.</div></div><hr />
