<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">El Sorriso</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any really good info on what the powers do beyond the same blurb you can get from the game?<br />
<br />
   I guess I am specifically interested in which ones I should go for early, and which ones I should skip altogether.<br />
<br />
   It woulda been really nice if someone had told me to avoid certain powers, now I feel like remaking.<br />
<br />
   Edit: More specifically: does anyone have info on Invuln, War Mace. Katana. Assault Rifle, Devices?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess first off you should say what you are, what you took and when. In all honesty Theres not much else to say about the powers from what you get in the book. Some of them might not do as much dmg as you like but that can always be cured with a level and two SO's.<br />
<br />
Heres a go at what you asked for though with what i can help with.<br />
<br />
Assault Rilfe:<br />
<br />
Burst: Pretty standard multi hit dmg skill. Meat and potatoes like all first skills are.<br />
<br />
Slug: Pretty much the same, your gonna wanna get this etc. More dmg, longer recharge yadda yadda..<br />
<br />
Buck Shot: Cone attack. This depends on your play style. Do you want to do the &quot;Flying i kill bosses + lt's only kind of exping&quot; or &quot; kill every one in the room type. If the latter then get this. If your on the fence, Hold off on this one until later.<br />
<br />
M30 Grenade: This is a pretty good skill to get. Its got good damage on the intial hit, and does some decent AE damage around the target. I'd pick it up if you group alot early on.<br />
<br />
Bean bag: Single target yet still has a chance to disorent...not worth getting IMO.<br />
<br />
Sniper Rifle: Great for any play style, pick it up. Very nice damage good range. Can be quite godly ehanced well.<br />
<br />
Flame Thrower: This does some nice damage in a pretty good sized starting cone area. Again it depends on your play style...but in groups its good to have one of the cone powers so you can AE a little.<br />
<br />
Ignite / Full auto: I'd like to say these two would be an either or. Yes, ignite has the chance to effect more foes, but full auto has a very good cone range. If in the end you cant think of any other power to get, pick up both of these.<br />
<br />
~~ Devices ~~<br />
<br />
This is an amazing utility skill set, you can do about everything with this one.<br />
<br />
Web Grenade: You start with this skill, its decent later on when the mobs still shoot you for 50 but hit you for 150. you will find good use of this all through out.<br />
<br />
Caltrops: If you go AR you won't really need this skill much. You spread some tacks on the ground and the enemies run slow. This skills + a rain AE = rocket powered jeebus. Again since the AR set really doesn't have a rain ae till later on, i would reccomend on skipping this skill unless you really want it. You will still find uses for it in groups most deffinately, again that depends on your play style.<br />
<br />
Taser: Taser i really don't like. Its effective only when the mobs right in your face with thier sledge hammers. Almost no damage, i would reccomend NOT getting this skill.<br />
<br />
Targeting Drone: Yes, yes, and more yes. This lil bad boy is very nice. Increases accuracy quite a bit. I usually delete the accuracy inspirations unless i know im commin up on a big boss fight, its that good. Put an end reducer in it, and you don't even know its there.<br />
<br />
Smoke Grenade: This is a good skill. It helps to get close to either use caltrops or trip mine, or time bomb, and combined with steal you can waltz right through groups of mobs. * o how roguely * However, this is a skill that does no damage, and only has utility value, you really want to think about your play style before wasting 2 levels on this. <br />
<br />
Cloaking device: Again, great in conjunction with Smoke Grenade. However its utility only. In groups, its almost never needed. So think carefully before picking this up.<br />
<br />
Trip mine: This skill is amazing. Now i had a fire devices mage, so what i did was throw smoke, run up, place the trip mine / throw caltrops / rain of fire. When rain wore off they would come running for me, then BOOOOOM  trip mine goes off, then i shoot a fire ball * like M30 grenade * then most orange minions would be dead. This skill is amazing in closed cooridors like door missions. I would deffinately reccomend this skill. It does great great dmg.<br />
<br />
Time bomb. Again like trip mine, its got nice nice dmg. However the 15 seconds is a bit of a gamble. If you've got good timing then pick this one up. Though in higher levels the mobs die even faster due to nearly everyone getting an AE at 25+ Still a nice thing solo as well as grouped. I would pick it up.<br />
<br />
Auto Turret: This is a good skill. It shines in larger mob encounters. It follows what you target and does some nice dmg. Higher end cost, but what last power doesn't. Like i said it shines in larger groups where the up front end cost is matched with it lasting long enough to do dmg to 10 - 15 mobs or so. Im on the fence about it, i would give it a 2.5 outa 5 rage bringers.<br />
<br />
If you are a blaster, there are many powerpool powers you want to take. First, you WANT stamina at 20, this skill helps so so much. Infact except for regen scrappers, i should think about anyone wants stamina at 20. It really does change the game. It makes it so most classes can solo, yes even healing oriented defenders. That has two skill pre req's i'd pick Hurdle, and Health then get Stamina. Yes, you need to have those picked by 20.<br />
<br />
Second big thing you want is hasten. When Enhanced right you can run hasten 24 / 7 and make your endurance last a while too. For most blasters thier build up skill + hasten means a boss is usually dead in 20 seconds or less.<br />
<br />
As for order to get powers in. In any skill set *focued mainly on blasters, other classes differ* i follow a pretty basic template.<br />
<br />
Level 2: power of choice<br />
Level 4: Power of Choice<br />
Level 6: Power of Choice, not a mobility pre req though<br />
Level 8: Power of Choice<br />
Level 10: Hasten<br />
Level 12: Mobility Pre req power<br />
Level 14: Mobility power<br />
Level 16: Hurdle *Speed if you go super leap*<br />
Level 18: Health<br />
Level 20: Stamina<br />
<br />
For blasters i have found this to be one of the best ways to ensure that at 20, you have all your utility out of the way. By this time you'll have seen enough and decide how you want to play your blaster, and can pick the dmg skills that fit your play style. <br />
<br />
Note: alot of this goes hand in hand with pretty much all the other classes. Stamina changes the game, it really does. I would really really reccomend everyone getting it at 20, you won't be disapointed.</div></div><hr />

I dunno tough as I haven't picked it up yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-08-04, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mythas, post is pretty much correct with a few exceptions.<br />
<br />
If you plan on taking the regen secondary set,or primary if your a defender. then you dont need to take the fitness line as you will be overlapping your specific powers with generic power sets.<br />
<br />
The other thing is,that you dont have alot of free room,if you want to get your travel power,and stamina at 20. If you want both of those,you need to plan out your powers.<br />
<br />
For myself, i took stealth early,which means that i either have to sacrifice my travel power , a primary attack,or defensive secondary,or stamina to 22.<br />
<br />
As a scrapper, my endurence drain is massive every fight,while i have the reflexes secondary so my health doesnt fall as much.<br />
<br />
i recommend getting the hero planner from warcry,as you can plot out your levels after you learn the game.  im not saying you should take the EQ mentality and take the best skills/powers. But even for roleplay intents it will help you out, as you can get a general idea of what kind of powers you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What are you talking about? You need Health in order to get stamina. No defenders have a &quot;regen&quot; primary or secondary set. Sacrificing two powers that may over lap for stamina is something thats very worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can do swift+hurdle and then stamina ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">El Sorriso</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is hasten really that good?  And what about burst?  It's damage seemed sub-par to me with a wide variety of enhancements tried.<br />
<br />
   Also I've got a couple friends that are slow zoners and often get lost, so Recall friend was a must for me.  With that in mind here's my current build.<br />
<br />
   Here's what the build looks like so far based on your advice : )  All the 8 or less powers are already picked.<br />
<br />
<br />
   1: Slug, Web grenade,<br />
<br />
   2: Buckshot.<br />
<br />
   4: Caltrops<br />
<br />
   6: Recall friend<br />
<br />
   8: M80 Grenade<br />
<br />
  10: Targetting Drone<br />
<br />
  12: Sniper Rifle or Hasten<br />
<br />
  14: Teleport<br />
<br />
  16: Hurdle<br />
<br />
  18: Health<br />
<br />
  20: Stamina<br />
<br />
  22: Sniper Rifle/Hasten<br />
<br />
  Any way you'd change that?<br />
<br />
   thanks for all the answers and help so far. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mythas</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No i really wouldn't change that, you could afford to get hasten at 22. Basically what hasten is going to do for you is to put alot of hurt down fast. When you get some DO end reducers its gonna allow you to do alot of dmg in a short amt of time. I think you'd be fine with picking up hasten at 22 no problem.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you give caltrops at least 2 extra slots for &quot;Slow&quot; enhancements at 3 they barely move with 5 - 6 they don't move hardly at all, its though they are perma rooted. You'll see some fast leveling in perez if you can caltrops a group and use M80. You'll want to be doing greens though, you can do blues as long as they are all minions. Its a quantity over quality thing. 10 - 13 in perez can go very fast.<br />
<br />
Just some general advice when your solo, sell enhances when you get full. If you keep selling you can build up quite a bit of influence. My fire blaster had 50k to spend at 12, those DO's make quite a bit of difference now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pratell</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think with 2 SO's on it, Hasten is practically a perma buff and it's pretty kickass. Between Hasten and Sniper Blast, i can kill pretty much any yellow i come across within 2 shots (plus build up).<br />
<br />
The neatest thing about Hasten is that it hasten's it's own recharge timer, so with no enhancements it's still 2 minutes on, 1 minute 15 seconds off :heart</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepy</div><div class="date">05-09-04, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt overlook Beanbag. It almost always disorients anything short of a boss. Great for when your 'trops get jumped over and someone is getting beat on. You can drop a yellow at 12th easily with Sniper, Beanbag, Slug, Buckshot and he never even gets a chance to hit back.</div></div><hr />
