After four films and two successful television series, you’ve never seen the HIGHLANDER like this. MacLeod returns with a vengeance in an animated feature length epic! <br />
<br />
from the Key Animation of Metropolis (movie) , the Original creator of Ninja Scroll and other great anime Yoshiaki KAWAJIRI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pimpsareus</div><div class="date">06-12-05, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow I would love this!!<br />
<br />
I'm surprised though... I mean the TV shows and movies (other than the first) weren't THAT successful.</div></div><hr />

Don't sell it short :P (yes yes, I'm a blatant Highlander: The Series fanboi *grin*)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok, just watched the teaser. I dont want to be a killjoy or anything but I hope that never sees the light of day :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
some white guy with a sword that looks nothing like Connor's, fighting a bunch of futuristic looking armored troops, and people flying with jetpacks. wee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">06-13-05, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, it's like Highlander (3?) combined with cliche' Japanese tough guy swordsmen theme. I forsee a lot of guys with pony tails and fake katanas getting quite irate about this one :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, if they're following the 'official' Highlander continuity (which they may not be, its never stopped them before :P) it'd be Duncan, rather than Connor. And while it looks slightly more like him than Connor its still not even close :P</div></div><hr />

Which suggests that it might not even be a McLeod involved.<br />

Which is fine, seeing as how this looks more like a continuation of Highlander 2 than anything else.</div></div><hr />

I think &quot;Japanese master&quot; refers to Yoshiaki Kawajiri.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In revenge, patience is a virtue.<br />
<br />
And after a few thousand years, <br />
Colin MacLeod doesn't give a damn about virtue...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only way I see this anime working, is if it takes place FAR in the future, using another Maccloud.  Of course it wouldn't be Highlander then, but at least it wouldn't be complete trash like Highlander 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glip the Gnome</div><div class="date">06-13-05, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Colin MacLeod? Ugh.<br />
<br />
If they're going to keep pumping out worthless garbage I wish they'd just let the franchise die instead. Creating Duncan as a member of the MacLeod clan was a cool idea. Creating Quentin as a third MacLeod immortal for the old cartoon series that doesnt officially even exist anymore was retarded, which is why it bombed horribly -- did Panzer/Davis not learn from that at all?<br />
<br />
argh. I need to stop caring and just enjoy my Highlander series DVDs while ignoring everything else...  /walks away<br />
<br />
<br />
.<br />

<br />
<br />
/runs back<br />
<br />
Okay okay... if they can't get Adrian Paul to come back as Duncan again GIVE US A METHOS SERIES ALREADY! Come on, you know Peter Wingfield would jump all over it. Shoulda given him the spinoff to begin with, instead of the &quot;Amanda. the Supporting Character. gets her own immortal cop show !&quot; hour. Not that I dont' like Amanda, but I want a show about immortals, not a show about the big annoying soap opera guy from One Tree Hill trying to be a cop with Amanda *cough* THE THIEF *cough* helping him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pimpsareus</div><div class="date">06-14-05, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still give it a shot. To  me the most interesting thing about Highlander has always been the flashbacks. I wonder if they will implement that in the series.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly the other animated series was set in a wierd futuristic era as well.<br />
<br />
Also... the soundtrack should be almost exclusively Queen songs. Love Queen!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">06-14-05, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, I remember that cartoon.  Man that sucked.  I mean, if theres no decapitation, it can't ****ing be highlander!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">06-28-07, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I just got done watching this.<br />
<br />
Animation/art-wise, it looks EXACTLY like the second Vampire Hunter D movie.<br />
<br />
I liked the story allright.  The &quot;present&quot; in the movie is dystopian future instead of the actual present.  But it's definatly set in the timeline of the TV series, not the cartoon, and seems to have nothing to do with Highlander 2.  In fact, they pretty much don't get into the Highlander mythos much at all.  It's kinda assumed you already know it.  Which is good.  It's just a story about one particular highlander, doing his thing.<br />
<br />
Colins: &quot;backstory&quot;<br />
Colin isn't actually born a MacLeod.  He's the leader of his own clan during the time of the Roman invasion of Scotland.  Later, he returns to Scotland during the time of the English invading Scotland and joins the clan MacLeod and ends up keeping the name.<br />
<br />
I will say that the action in Highlander lends itself really well to anime style.  They have alot of superhuman phyical actions but no outright magic powers or anything wierd like that.<br />
<br />
The story was decent.  But Colin is a little bit of a one-dimensional, typical anime badass loner type(not unlike D, or even Afro Samurai!  Complete with wierd supernatural sidekick thats always bothering him).<br />
<br />
All-in-all, I did not hate it.  And I would totally watch a series of this.</div></div><hr />
