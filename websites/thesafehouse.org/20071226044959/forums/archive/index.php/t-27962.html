<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">01-26-07, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today Funimation announced that it has acquired North American rights for Mushishi, one of the licenses that was accidentally leaked in Funimation's October cease &amp; desist letter to fansubbers.<br />
<br />
Other titles from that leak had also been announced this week, including Ragnarok The Animation on Monday and Suzuka on Tuesday. So far no official announcements regarding XXXholic TV, Sakura Taisen: Le Nouveau Paris or ATASHIn'CHI have been made.<br />
<br />
Funimation also announced today that they have acquired three titles from Right Stuf to be broadcast on the Funimation Channel; Boogiepop Phantom, Ninja Nonsense: The Legend of Shinobu and Shingu: Secret of the Stellar Wars.<br />
<br />
Finally, they announced the creation of a new programing block for the Funimation Channel, Pow Wasabi, which will focus on action shows.<br />
<br />
Mushishi? Sign me up!<br />
<br />
On a related note, Mushishi live action movie was a hit at Sundance in Utah, receiving 10 distribution offers. Interesting.</div></div><hr />

You are the very representation of BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH And so you must learn from this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I asked someone what it was about, they said, &quot;Tennis&quot;.<br />
<br />
I thought, well, it's from shonen jump.  Do the tennis players have powers where they make the ball catch fire or split into three balls and stuff like that?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, regular tennis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gay!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, there ARE powers in Prince of Tennis. Lots of it. I don't remember most of it.</div></div><hr />

Hope they get Ginko's voice right.</div></div><hr />

Prince of Tennis has a regular Tennis /cough, Most of the characters in that Anime would dominate the world with their &quot;normal&quot; tennis.</div></div><hr />
