So yeah, I'll be there, possibly with a brand new shiny +1 Heavy Repeating Crossbow of Destruction (In talks to obtain)<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I can't be up ridiculously late that night, as I have to get up early in the morning to do stuff on wednesday... so yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-19-06, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me and troz got the group a +2 Maladroit 1/4 Staff and I got us a +1 Maladroit Greatclub, thats good right? I think it is... not sure... Anyhow.. you know I'll be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">06-19-06, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be on tomorrow.<br />
<br />
2 maladroit weapons...dex beatdown fast, then we switch to the heavy hitters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-19-06, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think curse and sunder should come first, allowing for easy multiple hits, then we dex beatdown, once beatdown we will get nothing but crits, tried it out on a giant earlier, about 8 hits into it and all I got was crits....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">06-20-06, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ill be there. I hope we can finish south...dunno how much more we have to go. Im pretty sure its a lot tho hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-20-06, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're not going to crit any more often because of lowered AC.... still have to roll in the threat range of your weapon no matter what...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">06-20-06, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Insta-crit or not with no dex the AC will be next to nothign meaning you can hit almost every time so they still die fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-20-06, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh definitely, hehe... anyhow... I'm gonna need to come up with something good for that destruction Crossbow... it's coming from Triggerman/Killer/Krugar/Decypher though, so I might be able to snag it on an IOU basis, but who knows...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">06-22-06, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was, umm, housesitting on Tuesday night.  With orders to grab the cat if a sheriff knocked on the door with an eviction notice.  It's something of a long story...  Said cat is now locked in my bedroom, much to the consternation of my dog, as his owner has basically been living at the courthouse for the past three days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what'd I miss?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 2 wipes on the crazy wave attacks at the end of East (I think it was east).  Once we got a strat down it was cake.  Would have been 1 wipe but the second time we had some unfortunate fire mephit problems.  Go us.</div></div><hr />
