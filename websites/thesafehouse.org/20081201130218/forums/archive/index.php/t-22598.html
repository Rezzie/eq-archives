Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll double your salary! ;)<br />
<br />
Regarding the impromptu room party attendees, aside from those you've already listed we also had: Leon Pryor (L-Train), Game Producer/Program Manager; Paul Luna (Vladmiir), VG Forum mod and Associate Producer; Steve Williams, GM &amp; Associate Designer; Cindy Bowens (Abigale), Community Manager; Destral, and Lisa Boleyn, Associate Game Designer.<br />
<br />
We even had Fisher's childhood friend and his girlfriend at the party as well... which was a story unto itself since the friend had gone to the Fanguard not even knowing Fisher worked for Sigil so was shocked to see him.<br />
<br />
I think we would've had more folks stop by but when we had to close the room door I know we missed hearing at least one person's knock and there were probably others.</div></div><hr />

I really wish I could have been there. I think it's really great that I can put faces to some of the people I've been reading posts from. The fact that fans can look at the events they are unable to attend and see the fun the crew from sigil really had together seems to build trust. Thanks for the behind the scenes look.</div></div><hr />

You know, that is one of the most important things (for me anyway) I brought back from Fanguard. These guys love what they do. It's not all marketing speak. Regardless of who you talk to- you can see the fire in their eyes.</div></div><hr />
