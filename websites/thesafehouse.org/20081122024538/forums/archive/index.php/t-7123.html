<br />
Shame that Monkly Business is now a tool for an ebayers advertising.  Hopefully the Safehouse will always stay true and offer decent info.<br />

So long as the people remain the same in the community, and from the initial impression of Yantis' intentions this is what will occur, then what's the problem with it?<br />

Honestly the way some of you complain about customer support and about time sinks and say that the game is addictive and evil yet you burn someone at the stake that beats verant at their own game and makes enough real life money to plop down $3600 just on a message board. Yantis isnt doing anything wrong in fact I think it is amazing he is as successfull as he is.</div></div><hr />

How is it a tool for his advertising? Because theres a small link at the top of the forum index? Nothing has changed and he says he plans to support the community, even the old mods are still there. Way to talk without knowing. Zzorn <br />

Do you really think that someone, whose main source of income is a business that makes cash off of selling EQ items and plat would plunk down $3,600 just so he could have a tiny text link on the main site? <br />
<br />
The guy has scrapped to create a business in a really tough environment. Seedy, but tough. He's not some philanthropist. He's also no fool. If that was the case, he could have just made a donation. Heck, he could have made a donation and asked to have his link. But, he didn't do that. He bought Monkly-Business. Take a look at his site, go ahead, give him a hit on his counter, and ask yourself. <br />
<br />
Does this look like the website of a person who has the best interests of Everquest, or the Monk community in mind?</div></div><hr />

Your original post, where you equate someone making a business out of buying up plat on a server (bet you 10k a ton of that was macrod) as being some sort of vigilante hero shows that you and I could never agree on this. Ebaying is wrong. It hurts the game. Selling of in game items for real life cash is wrong. It hurts the game.  It's not &quot;someone beating Verant at their own game&quot;.  How you can see this as getting back at &quot;the man&quot; is beyond me. <br />
<br />
He would have been an idiot to install giant banners the first day.  Likewise, he wouldn't ad a forum for buying and selling items/plat right off either, but I guarantee you that unless Verant cracks down on EZboard about it, the forum will probably become a vehicle for selling items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well given that I was banned for mentioning Zadkiel's taking of 2500 dollars for &quot;handing the baord over to the community&quot; it's pretty accurate.  He doesn't like it when you mention the money he took under false pretences.<br />

Doesnt affect me in the slightest if someone out there buys a buncha plat or sells their items. Zero impact on my character. Not sure how these things hurt the game in any way.</div></div><hr />

Get your facts straight before you troll here (because you are uhm banned on monkly-business ... for trolling and being a dink whenever you spotted a chance).<br />

It wasn't just one instance, you were spoken with by your peers several times, warned by the admins a few times, and finally, banned.<br />
<br />
You aren't a martyr Ed, and regardless of some of the intelligence demonstrated in a few of your posts, you manage to nullify any good you might have done by your caustic and rude commentary.<br />
