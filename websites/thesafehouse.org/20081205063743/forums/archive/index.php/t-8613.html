<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen Cryingleaf</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
<br />
As a reminder for those who do not know the quest:<br />
<br />
1. Find Barraguj Zuul and start aggro -&gt; your raid get ported into its stomach.<br />
2. Kill waves of mobs until you defeat Unimaginable Horror, at which point you get ported back in front of Barraguj.<br />
3. Kill Baraguj, loot the container.<br />
4. Kill each of the 4 Avatars in the zone, each one loots an Orb.<br />
5. Place the 4 different Orbs into the container, combine and you get the single Key to Saryrn's chamber.<br />
<br />
Then the fun can begin as you make your way up to the tower to meet with her. One key opens the door for an unlimited number of people.<br />
<br />
My question is: Where do you find Baraguj Zuul and where do you find the 4 Avatars?? I can see them on track as I progress through the zone, but I have never found any of those 5 mobs!<br />
<br />
Also, I am not sure about these mini-towers-like pits-of-death-like where constructs are crawling along with breeders and harvesters (you know the cleric types that gate and summons you back in hell, surrounded by 20 mobs). I suppose the avatars are there but where exactly?? Inside the pits ?? If so, is there any good strategy on how to reach them and give your raid a safe fight against those?<br />
<br />
So any loc, map with red circles (lol), directions, strategy or hint is welcome!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Sindawen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IIRC Baraguj is in the tower at the bottom end of the map, 2nd floor.<br />
<br />
The Avatars spawn either in the pits or the 2nd floors of the towers.. their PHs are the &quot;Construct of Xxxx&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that!<br />
<br />
And how do you &quot;safely&quot; get there ? Single pull each one of mobs in the pits? There are like masses of them!<br />
<br />
Basically it seems like the strategy is the following routine:<br />
<br />
1. Get to a mini tower, clear it (aggro through walls btw)<br />
2. Clear 2nd floor of that tower. Hope that at the time the Avatar will have spawned (should be the case though, I'm not to worried given the amount of mobs in there).<br />
3. Kill Avatar of X<br />
4. Loot Orb of X.<br />
<br />
Repeat on next mini tower.<br />
<br />
Then head towards last mini tower (bottom of map above) and eventually start point 1 of my initial post, namely start aggro on Baraguj.<br />
<br />
Wow, that's quite a good one ;-) Can anybody tell us how is the event? boring, awesome, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Event inside him is cool  <br />
<br />
About getting there safely.. really, if you need advice on that you shouldn't be doing the event. The zone isn't hard at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it seems to be when you have only one group :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">06-26-03, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, how about bringing more then?    I'm not sure if you can kill Barraguj with just one group anyhow... and unless you've got access to a raid you don't need the key    Edited by: Shadowcross  at: 6/26/03 5:00 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">06-28-03, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first version of Barraguj that ports you into the stomach isnt a factor since you only attack him to get ported. Mobs in the stomach are not that hard either.<br />
<br />
However, if you manage to kill the Unimaginable Horror inside the stomach, loot FAST, as you have maybe 20-30 seconds before you are ported back out to just a little aways from the real Barraguj, and most of the time right into 2 to 4 mobs. Kill the mobs, kill the others in front of Barraguj's room, and then be ready for a fight with some serious DPS output. Barraguj hits HARD and FAST. We tried 3 times with 2 clerics and about 18 people, and he wiped us quickly each time. However, he did not despawn, and a few hours later, we went back with our raid force, and dropped him.<br />
<br />
The avatars are spawned by killing the mobs in their pits. 2 groups is enough for this, and a bard helps tons. They are random spawns, and there seems to always be one that takes forever to spawn.<br />
<br />
Once you have your key, be ready for some fun fights up in the tower. One mob up there was doing quad 3654 hits. Fortunately, he misses sometimes.  <br />
<br />
Took us a few hours to get to Saryn, but she wasnt that hard if you know what to expect, which I wont spoil here.</div></div><hr />

Raid force as in....? 5 full groups ? More ? What is the key to this fight ? Is he slowable, stunnable, etc etc...?<br />
<br />
Another remark is that there should be some sort of &quot;flag&quot; thingie then if Barraguj does not despawn and he's actually ready for his final fight after he wiped you once or twice. It's good that you don't have to redo the whole stomach thing if he wipes you. Good to know ! Then the alternative is, I suppose, that if any other group comes and starts a fight with him they are not ported either ;-) And somehow would steal your version of Barraguj ! Mind you it's not as if PoTorment is overcamped lol !<br />

Geez !! then that requires the same raid force I suppose</div></div><hr />

I was playing my rogue, so I wasnt involved in the debuffing. But it seems to me that someone said he was not slowable, but do NOT consider this reliable information.<br />
<br />
Its been a couple months since we did Barraguj. I seem to remember him as a blue con before the stomach, and a yellow con after... but again, this was something I did months ago, once.<br />

<br />
Thanks for those precious informations, I'll try to set up something to get the orbs first, then prepare a raid at some point to do Barraguj ;-) I suppose chanters are a must...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lindianae</div><div class="date">06-29-03, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just did Barraguj last night. Hes a yellow con both before and after the stomach bit. Hes slowable and our MT said he doesn't hit hard only hit around 900 most in the 400s. Actually he seemed to be a pretty easy fight though we did have 52 or so in the raid. The Horror in the stomach didn't drop any loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yellow before and after but what level are you ? How about stunnable, slowable etc...<br />
<br />
52 people ? I'm not sure I can gather 52 peeps for a pick up raid lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if I happen to do it somehow I'll update the thread and will let you know guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Bigmeeno</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Baraguj Szuul is level 66 based on alla... eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...l?id=10477<br />
<br />
The mobs in Saryns' tower are definately raid level mobs. At least 4 mobs in the tower are between level 68 and 70.<br />
<br />
I have serious doubts that a pickup raid could make it to Saryn. They possibly could kill Baraguj Szuul though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Ddrak NFyre</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Baraguj really isn't hard.  I think we did him with about 15 people for our first key, maybe less.  There's no secret to the fight - just get his hp to zero and you win.  If it's really taking you 50+ people to kill him then you really have to question whether you are ready to go into Saryn's tower where one of the mobs on the way hits for a fast 3k+.  I'd be more concentrating on levels.<br />
<br />
Pickup raids have done most of the Tier 2 and 3 gods as far as I'm aware.<br />

<br />
We wiped twice with 24 or so people.  Brain lapses mostly.  I as a shaman puled with Malos, All enchanters cast mez on him (yes he can be mezzed).  Put all debuffs on him, (can be slowed). Tank Broke mez when he was ready.  Allowed us the time to debuff.  Considerably easier at that point.<br />
<br />
I think we had 25-30 when we did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Juujuu</div><div class="date">06-30-03, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BZ isn't that rough.  With 2 groups including only 2 clerics and a shaman healing, we almost beat him.  If the enchanter with us had charmed an add instead of mezzing, we would have beat him.  He flurries a lot.  He's slowable but you want tash/malos/hos on him for quick reliable slows.  First time we killed him we only got the bag.  Second time we killed him, we got 2 loots.  Weird.<br />
<br />
As for the Avatars, they are annoying camps to say the least.  There 2 &quot;houses&quot; of mobs at the south end of the zone on the east and west of the super big house that BZ is in.  Each of those has the PH for the Avatar on the 2nd floor of the house, in the very center of the room.  Those are the only places I've seen those 2 Avatars spawn.  The location of the 3rd Avatar is in the house of mobs that's just down the left turn at the first intersection from zone in.  The fourth one is straight through the first intersection, then hang a right, and another right.  Clear those 2 buildings and eventually somewhere in there the Avatar will spawn.<br />
<br />
These camps are easy enough for a good solid group.  Bring bard/enchanter.  Expect pulls of 4+ mobs if you get unlucky.  Expect mobs to cheal and gate.  Bringing 2 groups makes things easier.<br />
<br />
Working on this key will make you realize why I shall never refer to this zone as anything but PoSuck.</div></div><hr />

Wow you're the first person telling that about him ;-) It's quite interesting then to know how you did this and who was in raid roughly (class/level). Did you mezz him as well first thing when you get ported back? How debuffed/lom where you after last fight in stomach?<br />
<br />
Quote:If the enchanter with us had charmed an add instead of mezzing, we would have beat him<br />
I recall a chanter telling me he could not DC mobs here but birds... Maybe it depends on chanter level... What kind of mob can u DC there, Saryrn's servants, or smaller ones like A Kaniz Hunter or alike?<br />
<br />
Quote:Working on this key will make you realize why I shall never refer to this zone as anything but PoSuck. <br />
Why ? Because it's boring, uninteresting or because you died there a lot?   I've found this whole storytelling/level design interesting... Maybe because I have not done it yet mind you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, enchanters get regular charms too - who cares about DC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I shall start a thread on how DC works  <br />
What I thought was that DC is unresistable (if mob is eligible) and unlimited time (as in get a new &quot;pet&quot; and destroy it when u feel like it).<br />
<br />
Charm is the alternative if mob is not eligible for DC, that's what I understood from hearing enchanter's talks ;-) so with normal charm you get the stress that your mob will break the charm whereas it's never possible iwith DC. It's quite a nice alternative anyway, just gets a lil rough for raid if mob breaks charm, but I suppose chanter is experimented enough to deal with it and mezz recharm or whatever they need to do to make sure raid is not harmed.<br />
<br />
Any good link on DC/charm question ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the higher the CHA of the enchanter, the less chance to break it has is that correct ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lindianae</div><div class="date">07-01-03, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chanters don't typically use DC in pop zones at least none of the ones I know do. They simply grab a nearby mob use it to kill the boss then we kill the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sindawen</div><div class="date">07-02-03, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday I was in Torment again in a very nice group with a chanter 65, who both explained and demonstrated it to me    What she said was that there was no real problem if charm breaks as she can remezz it right away and then recharm or whatever the group wants to do with the mezzed mob. However she told me the tricky part was about getting adds (read &quot;not yet mezzed/slowed&quot;) and simultaneously losing the charm. You end up with two mobs to mezz, one of which very angry at her, possibly two, and she would then drop really fast even with rune.<br />
<br />
So the tricky part of the charming question for a chanter is apparently when charm breaks while there's at least a non mezzed add. that's what I understood from her explanations. Anybody welcome to comment of course   <br />
<br />
As a side note she was reluctant to speed the charmed mob, what would other chanters do? Do you use to speed highly dangerous mobs you charm or not? Do you have a logical rule to assess this question or is it just feeling about zone and group? I can not imagine how dangerous (to group and other mobs) would a speeded up Saryrn's Servant be... Is it just insane or simply measured risk? Edited by: Sindawen at: 7/2/03 5:09 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Shaderick</div><div class="date">07-09-03, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The charm info here is largely correct, but I'll offer a little further clarification.<br />
<br />
Dire Charm: 9 AA pts, 72 minute re-use timer.  Not resistable, though mobs flagged immune to charm are not charmable.  Level cap of 46. <br />
<br />
Beckon: 62nd level enchanter spell. 500 mana. Max duration of 8 minutes, but random, depending on charisma of the enchanter and (more importantly) the magic resistance of the target.  Level cap of 57.<br />
<br />
Command of Druzzil: 64th level enchanter spell. 700 mana. Max duration of 8 minutes, but random, depending on the charisma of the enchanter and (more importantly) the magic resistance of the target. Level cap of 64.<br />
<br />
First off, you can pretty much toss Beckon out the window. It's an impossibly poorly implemented spell because the only targets charmable with it in any non-tier 1 PoP zone are the level 46 &quot;trash&quot; mobs that you can also Dire Charm. <br />
<br />
So that really leaves Dire Charm, and Command of Druzzil.  Dire charm effectively gives a permanent pet, with pretty good DPS and no chance of charm breaking.   It's good when the enchanter is lazy, or when there's zero tolerance for bad luck.   The DPS of a dire charmed mob can be safely improved by slapping Speed of Vallon onto it, and possibly giving it weapons to dual wield as well.  However, dire charm is limited in that: A) The dire charm mobs are invariably flimsy, and won't be able to tank worth a darn if that becomes necessary. and B) The dire charm mobs aren't always around or easy to find - in most zones, Dire charmable mobs have a -chance- of spawning from the spawn point of most of the &quot;ordinary&quot; mobs.  Examples of dire charm mobs are the young bats in PoN, the Lesser Elementals in BoT, and the Small Blood Ravens in Torment.  Needless to say, these mobs aren't always available when you want one.<br />
<br />
Command of Druzzil on the other hand is everything Dire Charm is not.  High in mana cost, reasonably short in duration (even without factoring in the random component) and posessed of a very high level cap.  In general, due to the mana cost (both of the spell and of refreshing Rune, etc when charm breaks) a CoD pet is not infinitely sustainable for the &quot;average&quot; 64th or 65th level enchanter if he is being called upon to do much of anything else.  High end mana preservation items, Flowing Thought, etc can change this, but in general, this spell is used to transform an add into a pet for the duration of a fight or two, after which it is killed.  It is possible to haste a CoD pet, but due to the already high damage output, this carries some significant risk unless you have a non-summoning pet and plenty of room to run.<br />
<br />
So... in general, when you see enchanters with monstrously powerful pets, they're not using dire charm. They're putting their life on the line for DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would just like to point out the szuul that ports you to the stomach is in the top of the tower, and the killable version is in that little room at the bottom of the tower.<br />
<br />
The first time we went to kill him, somebody must have killed of the horror but failed on szuul.<br />
<br />
He flurries, partially slowable.  I would compare his dmg output to vindicator once slowed.  Our second time killing him we killed him with 2 groups (2 warrior, 2 cleric).  We lost the 1st warrior after defensive ran out and had a few unlucky flurries.<br />
<br />
As to the off subject part of dc pets, my DC rat in CoD does consistant ~150 dps on xp mobs with mage gear (that dps doesn't include the procs from the weapons).  Non dual wielding pets have much lower dps though<br />
