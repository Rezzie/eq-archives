<br />
Here's the situation. Let's say you're in the arena and you're fighting a mage. Unless you can snare him or root him by some means it is basically written in stone that the mage will beat you. All he has to do is set pet on you and run in circles. Even if you catch up the mage and are right behind him you most likely will only get the too far away message. This is because of lag.<br />
<br />
Verant needs to increase the melee range in pvp. I feel it is a bug and it is exploited by many casters in pvp. Maybe there are other ways to fix this problem but it must be fixed soon.<br />
<br />
I wanted to post this in developer's forum on EQ site but i can't log in there for some reason so i'm posting it here and hope that others will post it on the EQ board.</div></div><hr />

its not lag though its the eq engine something like this.<br />
your pc tells the server &quot;I am swinging at this damn caster.<br />
the server say &quot;ok&quot; then says to the casters pc &quot;Hey this guy is swinging at you&quot; <br />
somewhere in there lies the problem. eq has a really crappy pvp engine Diabalein Avidya <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kambic</div><div class="date">04-30-01, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that it must make two checks, rather then one check. Then after those checks are made, rather then one packet being sent, it must send two packets. If you're lagging at 250 milliseconds, and they are lagging at 250 milliseconds, that's .5 seconds in between your swing and the true check being made, then the packet must be sent (I believe that if the packet is sent, and it is no longer valid, then another is sent back saying so) telling both computers and the server to disregard the original packet, and thus your target is out of range. A LOT can happen in a second.<br />

This would be less of a problem if it wasn't so obvious.</div></div><hr />

Land backstab as you would on a jousting melee.  Usually works on circle runners. Majestyk, Rogue, Shanks, Vallon Zek!We as Shanks, have chosen the hard path. In the hardness of it, is where we find the glory.</div></div><hr />

The next few minutes usually consist of me beathing him down best I can or him running since he can't get a spell off.</div></div><hr />
