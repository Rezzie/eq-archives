<br />
I wasn't paying attention last night, and accidentally destroyed Lady Sathrah's spinerets. When I went back to kill her again, I actually got her three times in total, but not quest piece's on her body.<br />
<br />
So the question is...if I abandon the quest, can I go back and pick it up again new? Will this retrigger the drop?<br />

You might need to abandon it, but you'll be able to get it back.</div></div><hr />

I'm probably going to have to report it as a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yes, if you abandon the quest and go back to the person you accepted it from, it should reset it for you (including the spider drop).<br />

When that happens, the NPC will still talk to you, and give you the quest.  Tehy just don't have the ! over their head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chrisania</div><div class="date">12-28-04, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had an issue during the last phase of OB in which a quest in Auberdine (get a rabid thistle bear to follow you back to an NPC via use of an item), in which I used the item, but didn't catch the bear, so abandoned the quest... when I talked to the NPC again, I recieved the quest, but not the item.  I don't know if this issue was resolved or not (I turned in a bug report about it), so as far as whether or not you actually can get quests involving items again (including the item if destroyed, lost, whatever), I'd be interested to know if it works or not.</div></div><hr />

I think your issue was an isolated one. I failed that quest a few times and kept dropping it and re-taking it. They gave me a new trap every time (and then I figured out I was trying to trap the wrong kind of bear)<br />
