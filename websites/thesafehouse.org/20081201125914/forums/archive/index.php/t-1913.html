<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krimzan</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are about 3 stations that are listenable where I go to school. We have at least 3 rap stations, 4 country stations, 2 gospel stations 1 classic rock station, 1 &quot;modern rock&quot; station and one 70s &amp;amp; 80s station. I usually flip between the last 3. The modern rock station is getting on my nerves more and more. I don't listen to the radio a lot, I think it's mostly crap. Rock has degraded to the point where it's not worth keeping up with. Yeah it all sounds the same, but that's almost always been the case. In the 80s we had hair bands and 80s rock sounded the same mostly until Nirvana came along with Smells Like Teen Spirit, and that was where (I put) the end of 80s rock. We had a decent amount of good stuff out of the 90s I think. Recently though, all rock is REALLY sounding the same. Steps to making a rock song:<br />
1. Whiny voice, gotta have the droneing whiny voice or<br />
1a. Screaming angry voice.<br />
<br />
2. Power chords. Everyone has the power chords going on in the background, and I do mean background. Few and far between do you find any kind of guitar work nowadays. What do I mean? Ok, listen to the latest Nickleback song, or some Linkin Park...then listen to Message in a Bottle by the Police and you'll see what I mean. Listen to some Weezer. There is nothing going on in modern rock, it's very one-track. Does it have to be all riffs? Well heck no, but having everything be extentions of the beat is really, really irritating. Look at something inbetween, like Foo Fighters stuff. They don't have a lot going on in their guitar parts (compared with Message in a Bottle) however the seperation between drum beat and guitar is there. <br />
<br />
3. Where's the bass? No not the thub-thub-thub, I mean the thing with 4 strings (or 5 if you're l33t). I can't hear it, do you not have a bassist? Did he quit cuz the bass parts sucked? Good bass parts I think of the Chilli Peppers and The Cure. <br />
<br />
(Note that lyrical ability is not in there.)<br />
Really, though. I am totally willing to admit that I have picky tastes in music, and am skeptical of anything recent coming out. I thought Queens of the Stone Age - No One Knows was decent, I liked the guitar part, I thought the style of the singing was a bit of fresh air. It just seems like the same stuff is showing up, and the only people who are actually rocking the scene have been doing so for a while now. I realize that the best stuff probably doesn't get played on the radio, but there was a time when it was! There was a time when you could be a local band and get your song on your local radio station, is that gone now too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Valrog</div><div class="date">10-15-03, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All 3 Queens of the Stoneage albums rock, their names are Queens of the Stoneage, Rated R and Songs for the Deaf - the newest one - has No One Knows, Go with the Flow, and First it Giveth. All 3 Muse studio albums rock, Showbiz, Origin of Symmatry and Absolution. They're pretty big in Europe but none-existant in the US. The Audioslave album is also amazing, so are all 4 Rage albums. You thought Flea from RHCP was good? You haven't heard Rage's/Audioslave's bassist.<br />
<br />
Point being, you complain about Rock music sucking, then you mention the Q.O.T.S.A... An awesome modern rock band, you said that you heard a song of theirs and it's good, but then you don't go ahead and listen to the rest of their album? I don't wanna sound rude or anything, but either you complain about rock music sucking and actually try to find something you like, or do neither. Know what I mean?

I think the line between rock and alternative started getting blurry with Nirvana, now, if you play a guitar at all, people qualify it as rock of some sort. I gave up rifling through all the music that is out there anymore, so much of it is tripe. I wait for a random song on the radio to catch my intrest, or refferals from people. Popular culture has long since stopped being a good indicator of music I would enjoy.</div></div><hr />

And Apocalyptica. They're like an old, good rock group that added an electric violin. They've got a ton of instrumental covers (metallica stuff, hall of the mountain king, etc.) I've heard one original song by them (with and without lyrics), it was excellent as to be expected.

Read what I posted after the lyrics quotes again. I said it wasn't a recent addition. If you listen to the older stuff, like the albums you mentioned, that extra syllable on the end of every line is there also. It's just exaggerated more in the Turn the Page cover, so I used it to illustrate my point.</div></div><hr />

Second, Metallica sucks. I'm so damned tired of hearing their 'new' songs, that sounds just like their 'old' songs. And by 'old' songs, I mean that their sound hasn't changed since Load. Everything since then has just pissed me off to no end. @#%$ Metallica and their RIAA ball-linking.<br />
<br />
Third, radio sucks. It's also controlled by the RIAA. Listeners have no control over what becomes 'popular'. It's all who pushes their label's demos hardest. It is very rare now on the odd chance I am listening to the radio that I hear something and go, 'Hey, that's pretty good.' It now seems to be a downward spiral of @#%$ that all sounds like System of a Down and/or New Found Glory. Burn it all.<br />

<br />
I think System of a Down gets an unfair label. They are by no means by favorite band, but they can play their instruments skillfully, the lead singer has an amazing voice, and they are original. They usually get lumped in with the rest of the popular &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands today. The fact that they're pulling it off when 99% of other popular acts are absolute crap says even more about their quality.<br />
<br />
The Downward Spiral, now there is a good cd...<br />

<br />
The stations where I live play mostly Led Zepplin, Lynard Skynard, AC-DC, Bad Company, Boston, Jimi Hendrix, Bachman Turner Overdrive and the Eagles.  They throw in an occasional Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd song.  And that's pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me wrong, I like some of those groups.  But they don't play anything else.  Plus they only use a limited selection of songs from the bands they do play.  <br />
<br />
Why aren't the Beatles or Jefferson Airplane classic rock?  Or the Doors and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp;amp; Young?  What happened to the Grateful Dead and the Who?  There are tons of bands out there that I would consider classic rock that are completely ignored.</div></div><hr />

No shame there, Korn's self titled cd and life is peachy were great. Korn is one of those bands that I will always have respect for, but they will continue to get progressively worse with each cd. It's not really their fault, the style of music they created has been copied and watered down so much. Well they have a new cd coming out next month claiming to be back to their roots. We shall see.<br />

It plays nothing but junk like Godsmack, Limp Bizkit, and &amp;lt;insert random band with whiny sounding singer&gt;<br />
<br />
The &quot;alternative rock&quot; station here stinks. Unless you like hearing nothing but Pearl Jam clones, only without the talent all day.<br />
<br />
The &quot;classic rock&quot; station here stinks as well. They mix it up more than a lot of stations do, but they just pick the most godawful crap to play. They also play waaaay too much Led Zeppelin/The Who/Pink Floyd.<br />
<br />
I need an 80's rock station dangit! :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Couldn't have said it better.  I expected SoCal to have alot more selection musically.  Might be from growing up in Seattle, i got spoiled and all.  Guess that's why my radio never leaves ESPN 800 a.m. nowadays.</div></div><hr />

Yes after lies you can pretty much write them off, but you have to admit, appetite and use your illusion rocked.<br />
<br />
Also U2..granted Bono is all full of himself now a days, but Joshua tree was an awesome album.</div></div><hr />
