That being said... I'm like 0 for 10 vs Infiltrators. Shadowblades Im batting about .500, but Infiltrators got my number. Even when I get the jump on  them they STILL win! <br />
<br />
Sheesh thats frustrating when you land a friggin PA and you still bite the dust before they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Caith Caidh</div><div class="date">03-20-02, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup.. Last night I had an orange infi hitting me for 200 (Non-opener) consistantly.. Needless to say I didn't last long.  Not sure if that infi was heavily melee specced, or heavily buffed,... But ouch!  I still have no idea how he was doing that sort of damage to me.. His weaponspeed seemed around the same as mine (which is 2.4 delay)...  Perhaps an Albion Slash or DW style.<br />
Of course, I took down a yellow infi not long before that fairly easily, without even landing my PA. (Was playing bait 'n switch with a caster guildmate... It was amazing, it took maybe a minute for another assassin to go after him each time he went out.  The above one is the only one that got away).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poison Procced, moves worked , I won. <br />
I inflicted;<br />
Melee Damage... 560<br />
Greater Lethal Venom... 355<br />
Greater Enervating... 250 HP (equivelant to Con -45 er so)<br />
<br />
What REALLY steams me is Oi'm L41 and pack 950 HP and put 10 points inta con. <br />
<br />
He's L36-41 and has near 1200 HPS????? <br />
<br />
Hello? In a stand up fight with equal training (he can train every point I can train and then some) he will ALWAYS move barring a buncha evades or some such. And he'll win with 25% or more left and he's Yellow con. <br />

<br />
Granted I'm only 31 but even with styles I do at most 60 per hit. Normally about 40-45 with styles.<br />

I'm wondering if he wasn't a non-CS spec...  He was hitting off hand a lot (Well, he finished me pretty fast, but what I saw...) so may have been using a high DW style.<br />
Going to be raising my own non-CS assassin(Shade, not a shadowzerk), and will see how it goes.</div></div><hr />
