<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Faelisha</div><div class="date">10-04-02, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there everyone. My name is Faelisha Faeryhome and I am an Officer in the guild Family Traditions. I am offering my services as an artist for all of those who would wish to use them. I make signature tags and I like to think that I make them well. If you would like to have one made for you or you would like to see how I make them you can come to the Family Traditions board and take a look (pub7.ezboard.com/bfamilytraditionsarchives)...  They are under the topic Graphics Request and the services are free or for a donation on the Fennin Ro server. I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
<br />
Edit: Aye, the forum rules state that graphical signatures and personal pics combined should be 15k or less.  It was nice though! - Tibis[/i[ [i]Edited by: TibisHatter  at: 10/5/02 4:22:16 am</div></div><hr />
