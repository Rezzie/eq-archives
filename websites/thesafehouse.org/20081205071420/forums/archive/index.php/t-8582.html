<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TinkertotSK</div><div class="date">06-14-03, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I'm getting a 62nd lvl druid to assist me with killing Renux so before I did that I wanted to find out about this &quot;gnome&quot; that supposedly will now assist her? Does anyone have his name or his lvl or where the heck he spawns? I Just want to be able to provide the druid with as much updated info as I can. From all the reports he should have no trouble soloing Renux at his level but I wanted to make sure this &quot;gnome&quot; wouldn't spoil the fun. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Not sure where he spawns, but that's where he kicked my ass. He hits hard and nuked me for ~900. Corpse camps too... I had to pull him away from the corpse to get back at Renux. Oh... btw... Renux did not assist him... he just assisted her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's some other gnome, why not just stay away from any gnome mobs while you kite Renux?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_FaerieFire13</div><div class="date">06-16-03, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did mine less than two weeks ago and had no problems with adds, nor had I heard of any.<br />
<br />
Faction in Steamfont is a little weird, I've found, because it's easy to get bad caster faction without ruining guard faction or merchant faction, and the guards are, like many guards, hostile to those in wolf form. My guess would be that if this happened, it would be because you ended up too close to some of the gnome caster/merchants or merchants who just happened to have bad faction with one of the party members.<br />
<br />
I did my Renux battle in half-elf form to eliminate any KoS DE issues due to a few errant gnome caster kills a long time ago, and we avoided anyone using wolf form as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Do know that even if you die, Renux might be there when you recover. She was for us, and I was astonished, since I hadn't seen that fact mentioned elsewhere. In fact, she wandered between the PoK book and her spawn point, and around to the dragon bones, and regardless of where we went at her again, nothing added.<br />
<br />
Ideally, find a nice open spot to spawn her. Yendar shouldn't interfere. (After all, she's just robbed him as much as you.) And he despawns at some point shortly after she spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Herschy</div><div class="date">06-19-03, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did renux last night, and got no adds.  We did not kite her, though, we went toe to toe.  We had a 65 cleric, 59 warrior, 61 bard, 54 rogue, 55 pally, and 58 enchanter.  She went down pretty easy, with only the chanter dying.  The turn-in guy despawned right after the turn in.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did the turn in and Yendar despawned and Rennux poppped.<br />
MT grabbed agro and after couple heals from the cleric she was dead.<br />
<br />
My team was a 62 Warrior, 60+ Cleric, 52 Rogue (me), 57 Warrior, 2 51 druids.<br />
<br />
Druids snared and nuked a few times for fun, but the fight was a joke and there were no deaths.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Beacon Blackleg</div><div class="date">07-03-03, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Renux today with three. 64 Ranger, 65 Rogue, 58 Rogue. No adds but I also didn't spawn her near anything else. Ranger just snared and ran her in a square pattern about 6 secs before each turn. Let the Ranger snare 4 times before we engaged. No heals needed.<br />

Easy as pie.</div></div><hr />
