<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akenlux</div><div class="date">10-19-07, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, <br />
<br />
I’m a 29 Blood Elf and I haven’t really done much PVP until now when I’m encountering alliance players in the zones I’m questing in a lot (Ashenvale, Hillsbrad) and it’s high time I learnt how to deal with people I’m encountering. <br />
<br />
All my guildies are pretty high level and when I ask them about PVP tactics they just talk about stun locking which I can’t do at this level as I don’t have cheap shot or kidney shot yet. <br />
<br />
I’m going to go to some battle grounds to cut my teeth in PVP before I hit lvl 30. <br />
<br />
Are there any good generic tactics I can use that will give me an edge? <br />
<br />
My play style against mobs involves daggers and  is pretty much:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Gouge – BS – SS until 5 points then eviscerate. <br />
<br />
 If it’s a long fight I’ll build up some points with SS and throw in a slice and dice as I like haste (old habits dies hard – I’m an ex EQ player) and I developed the stun –go round the back – BS habit from playing an assassin in EQ2. <br />
<br />
 If it looks like a really long fight I’ll throw in an armour debuff as well. <br />
<br />
 Obviously if I can open with ambush I will<br />
<br />
 I always have the snare poison and the spell casting slow poison<br />
<br />
 Oh – and I love shooting things in the back when they try and run away :evil <br />
<br />
Also what’s the best way to deal with pet classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">10-19-07, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogues don't get a lot of their best toys until 40, and the good stuff keeps coming all the way to 70. <br />
<br />
What is your spec? <br />
<br />
The best tactic for a low level Rogue in PvP is - do not go toe to toe with people. Wait until someone is wounded, or fighting someone else, than jump in. You don't have a lot of the talents and attacks to go all out with a lot of classes. <br />
<br />
Slice and Dice is always, always, always good to have running as often as possible. <br />
<br />
Sinister strike is nice, but its not great damage for a dagger rogue. The instant damage may seem like the way to go, but you really want the high end damage of backstab over sinister strike. (Since you're using daggers)<br />
<br />
Some people come down on circle strafing but, if you've got backstab hotkeyed to a nearby key, you can circle strafe around someone and get a backstab in before they turn. Its amazing how many people don't use their mouse look to turn, which gives you a lot of time to strafe behind them for a backstab. <br />
<br />
Blind is also great for another backstab, for interrupting spellcasting, or just plain pissing people off.<br />
<br />
Other than that it sounds like you've got the right idea.</div></div><hr />
