<br />
d20 rules.<br />
Norrath as a world is cool.<br />
<br />
Sure, this is &quot;just&quot; another setting for the d20 system, but it's a world I love and that many know. I don't why this should be bad? Guys, Verant/Sony can't screw this up, they are/should only be providing the background and storyline. And THAT is something I am really looking forward to.<br />
<br />
Hell levels? Nonsense.. there won't be hell levels, it's a P&amp;amp;P now.<br />
<br />
I am absolutely going to buy this. <br />

<br />
Quote: But be warned! Played offline, the world of Norrath becomes an even more dangerous place. No longer will there be hundreds of heroes all striking out against evil by battling the ice dragon Lady Vox or delving deep in the bowels of Lower Guk to confront the undead frogloks. Now it is only you and your comrades who stand before such evil might.<br />

I'd love to be the storyteller though. Ok the monsters not up, you have just enough time to go get me a 6 pack and some taco bell before it spawns. As for actually buying this game no thanks, for sword and scorcery I still like good old fashioned D&amp;amp;D. I play Whitewolf but specifically for their twisted real world modern setting and the interesting ways they fit their stories and npc into real world events, locations and history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">03-17-02, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats funniest about that comment SX is that if Vox didn't banish people over level 52 then one gaming group of around 4 people COULD kill her.   <br />
<br />
I don't see why it even needs to be its own game.  They should have just released Norrath as a world setting for D&amp;amp;D 3rd, just like they did for Diablo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tabbran</div><div class="date">03-17-02, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a world setting, granted, there will be unique rules, but it's basically D&amp;amp;D in the world of Norrath.<br />
<br />
You see, Swords &amp;amp; Sorcery Studios is a division of White Wolf that handles and releases their d20 products.  White Wolf itself releases the &quot;Storyteller&quot; series of games (World of Darkness, Aberrent, Exalted).</div></div><hr />

I'd end up playing it exactly like EQ really is just for evil fun. Come on, you all know you want to do that... don't tell me you haven't thought about playing a pen and paper campaign as an MMOG complete with training, idiots, corrupt/incompetent guides/GMs, uberguilds farming zones, calendars for rare spawns and so forth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some things I am really curious about how they implement it into d20 (or if they implement it at all):<br />
<br />
- 60 levels<br />
- Combat (hitting for up to 90 at level 60, having thousands of HP etc ..)<br />
- dragon AE's<br />
- slows (not just the reversed haste spell, but different kinds of slows)<br />
- Mana &amp;amp; Mana regeneration<br />
- sneak &amp;amp; hide<br />
<br />
<br />
And Kintire, I am pretty sure there will be a bunch of people here that will GM NWN. I am one for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kintire</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect that the levels and combat system will be d20 style. I don't know much about dragons in EQ, but standered dragons do have AE breath. Sneak and Hide are sortof in there anyway, but they are not rogue specific of course.<br />
<br />
I'm most interested in how they will do magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess I wasn't clear enough what I meant.  <br />
<br />
I am mostly curious about how close to either the d20 system as used in D&amp;amp;D 3rd or the Everquest system they'll stay.<br />
<br />
Will it be &quot;just&quot; another world for D&amp;amp;D 3rd, or will it be as different as either StarWars or Wheel of Time?<br />
<br />
Both SW and WoT are d20 system too, but there are many noticable differences in game mechanics when compared to D&amp;amp;D 3rd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnmish Gearbinder</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My belief, based upon the fact that a both Player's Handbook and DMG is being released for it, is that it will have it's own unique rule-sets and game mechanics.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I've already done my own version of EQ in D&amp;amp;D 3rd edition rules. Used the same rules and just jacked the world, zones, and races. I personally can't wait to have them flesh out additional rules and race/classes for me. Hell, lets not forget the background info I love so much.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, Freeport is their first city book. That should be very interesting based upon the way White Wolf writes source material. It's bound to make the whole online version of the game more intersting as well as now many people will have access to information to back up what they see in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_LordMaxwell</div><div class="date">03-18-02, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most differences are in both Star Wars and WoT, and I think it's things that Jonathan Tweet is still kicking himself for not including in the basic books. (Like increased defense with level, simple, elegant and it works.)<br />
<br />
Most of the changes are just cosmetic, and some are nonsensical. (Why is Jedi Counselor a separate CLASS from Jedi Knight? By all logic it should be a prestige class.)<br />
<br />
And they worked the Force system beatufully into the D20 system, it's more flexible than it first appears. Off course Wizards themselves have more leeway than others doing d20 worlds.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.  They're not releasing it under the d20 license, but under the OGL license.  That means they can use their own rules for character creation and advancement, and could theoretically take it all the way up to level 60.<br />
<br />
There are some slight differences in what they can and cannot do deondent on which license they use, but that's the big one.<br />
<br />
Overall, the game doesn't fill me with a whole lot of desire to play it, but I think the background could be fascinating to read.  Many people have become slightly jaded about the RP aspect of EQ, there's still a lot of very interesting stories in there.<br />
<br />
Plus it gives us the opportunity to finish all those quests Verant never did.    --</div></div><hr />
