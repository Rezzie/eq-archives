<br />
I can't solo so my indoor missions are not completed unless I can get some group action, but since hitting 21 I have pretty much stopped doing missions.<br />
<br />
Pickgroups are limited to a few zones(DA, IP, TV,BT) and harder to find.<br />
<br />
<br />
With a new patch coming in the next few weeks with new zones, task forces, trials and outdoor instanced missions it would be good to get a semi-regular group or so going.<br />
<br />
Some of the zones have a level limit, so thats why I asked for 20+ but the stuff that we can SK ppl for thats good to.</div></div><hr />

Not quite the 20+ yet, but since heals and buffs never get resisted, I wouldn't have quite the problem that some other Power sets would ahve with grouping way over my head. Of course, if theres a level limit to get in the Zone then I'm out of luck.</div></div><hr />

Good thing you like soloing if you are a Scrapper.  They are about as wanted in most groups as the clap is at a swing party.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
blasters &gt; scrappers<br />
<br />
Why aren't scrappers as good as blasters? They're the closest to a rogue class CoH has. The developers HAD to screw them over somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-27-04, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm looking for team members, I'll take a scrapper over a blaster any day of the week, and twice on sundays.<br />
<br />
With me as Empath Defender, Give me 1 Tank, 1 Controller/Defender and 5 scrappers in a group, and I'm at home. Well, for that matter, I'll take 7 scrappers + me, but that gets a little trickier keeping everyone healed.<br />
<br />
Of course, almost everyone in my Supergroup (All RL friends) insists on playing @#$% Blasters. Ever been in a group with 1 empathy Defender an 7 Blasters? Soemtimes I think my only role is to carry around awakens for everyone else. Cause if they get hit, they are dead before I can heal, and if they aren't hit not much for me to do.</div></div><hr />

a. The blaster is stupid<br />
b. The healer is stupid<br />
<br />
as you have a lot of MMO experience, I'm willing to bet a. is your problem. However, when you get a good, well buffed blaster, they OWN scrappers. Show me a scrapper that can solo a group of 8 whites before buildup goes down.<br />
<br />
I gots nothin against scrappers, I wish they'd get a little buffer. But as it stands, one of my best friends plays a scrapper and I play a blaster. When we're fighting, it's pretty clear who's support and who's main damage dealer. I just hope they don't nerf me! =P</div></div><hr />

4-5 are down with the first bar of endurance, the last 3-4 I either wait some or take 1-2 inspirations. I probably end the fight with 80% health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think just due to game mechanics at this point that yes blasters are worth more to a group then scrappers. Fighting purples scrappers went down just as easily as blasters from my time as a healer. Also if a scrapper wants to solo he has to &quot;usually&quot; slot out his defense or forsake some powers for defensive one. Where as a smart blaster doesn't even bother for defense. He focuses on accuracy and damage. This again gives the blaster the advantage when fighting higher con mobs.<br />
<br />
I would say a group of x blasters will have a group of anything dead faster than a group of x scrappers. With nearly every blaster archetype *besides energy really* they have ae's.  Simply put ae's own this game in the face, thats why blasters shine in groups over scrappers.<br />
<br />
I truly do wish scrappers shoul get some extra love. I am in no way saying i hate scrappers or saying they are gimp in a derrogatory way, i just think the game is a bit unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">05-27-04, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I think blasters are definately the cream of the crop right now.  I love scrappers and would rather play and group with one any time, but just a simple breakdown of the pros and cons seems to give blasters the advantage.  Greater damage, greater range, and less endurance use.  Scrappers have better defense but manytimes at the cost of end (toggle) or offensive (slots), and the defense and hit point bonus is nearly extinguished by the ability to hover out of<br />
<br />
I'm amazed at just how much is in the assault rifle and device pools.  Cone attacks, AE attacks, root, AE slow, stunning, cloaking, accuracy buff, traps, and even a pet.  Seems like a pretty good arsenal of abilities!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argyll</div><div class="date">05-27-04, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I abandoned my scrapper. There's not enough there to make them valuable in a group, as they're pretty much useless against anything above orange con. The vaunted Scrapper &quot;survivability&quot; doesn't much matter when you're grouping against reds and purples, even with four DOs in focused senses (toggle melee def) and two DOs in combat jumping.<br />
<br />
Fun to solo, I guess. I'll probably end up using him for that when my emp defender can't find a group.</div></div><hr />

if i burn hasten,taking down a group of 6-10 yellows/oranges isnt really a problem either.</div></div><hr />

Being able to slice the whole damn lot of them at once helps too. :)<br />
<br />
Gets a little trickier when LTs. and bosses are mixed in, but managable. Sure the blaster might do it quicker, but I'll find it less boring.</div></div><hr />

I've been gone on business and family stuff for a week now. I'll get back to exping after I take care of some stuff today, but if you're ever interested in a 2nd Controller, I'm all for SKing. I really enjoyed any of the time I got to group with people in Redeemed, but they always seem to want to solo all the time and I can't do that very well with no real attack (besides Brawl) or pets. :\ So I'm still playing catch up I guess, bouncing from one PUG to another.<br />

I would take scrappers over blasters any day, on account of lag. However, i would much rather team up with my fellow Redeemed Heroes and Safehousers, regardless of Archetype. Im Shaii-Hulud on Victory, lvl 20 Tanker. <br />

Dizz, we solo cause we dont want to outgrow our story arcs =P.  Nothing is more annoying than having Story Arc clues of story arcs that ill never be able to complete... If you are frustrated with PUGs look me up and we can duo some missions or something =p</div></div><hr />

blasters &gt; scrappers <br />
<br />
I read this over and over at teh CoH main boards, and I continue to disagree.  I've played a blaster to 16 and I think it's pretty freaking annoying to have to run around like an EQ druid (minus the arse-sit) and take pot shots at stuff. <br />
<br />
Blasters may do more damage PER SHOT - but don't forget the time BETWEEN shots, I.E. getting out of range of the thing that is about to take away their meager little life.<br />
<br />
I love my scrapper (lvl 24 right now).  I can hang in the crowd no prob.  I take a beating and dish it out at the same time.  Scrappers are hardly frail damage dealers.  And we have like NO downtime between attacks.  Blasters can't always say that, especially while soloing.  I hardly ever die, and I see blasters bite the dust all the time.<br />

<br />
Actually, the way I get xp is I have 2 defenders follow me around and buff me to tank status... allright, maybe tank status is a little bit too much, but I've transcended paper tank status. I'm at LEAST a cardstock tank now. *checks his 13k xp debt* hmm... maybe we should hire on a scrapper....</div></div><hr />

As for grouping, I love the small group thing.  Anarchist and I tear through stuff pretty easily, and the other night I grouped with Den right after he got the Burn power.  It was the first time I've felt almost useless hehe.  Burn is just disgusting (it'll slaughter a group of dumb mobs in seconds).
