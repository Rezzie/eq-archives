Motego and I popped into one of the Threnal quests once, and were absolutely overwhelmed by spiders and oozes in the very first room.  We need a quest with a continous stream of small numbers of giants...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-07-06, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the arrows... + who knows what you get inside threnal .. I think its the same as the giant cave. Unfortunately I won't be able to make saturday, I have my graduation party I need to attend.. apparently one needs to attend one's own party. *shrug* I'm still very confused by it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">06-07-06, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coin Belt and Brass Beaver ring for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">06-07-06, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something hilarious happened, you know how I was getting horrible packet loss yesterday? Well turns out I was getting 4800 down, which was odd because I normaly get 6000 down. Well this morning when I got up before I called comcast I tried the speed test again.. and I got 17791 down.. my jaw hit the floor and I figured if comcast was competing with the dsl in the area then.... comcast has won. They tripled my speed and I'll be damned if I get anymore issues..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and I remade Trozz Lawful Good.  Lvl 1.2 before I logged due to being tired.  Have a friend visiing this Friday to next Wednesday so right now not sure what days I'll make if any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-08-06, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was that +1 Holy sword of True Law and Pure Good too good to pass up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-08-06, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, also, I now have shot on the run and a +2 Holy Heavy Repeating Crossbow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">06-08-06, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Threnal south requires threnal west and threnal east completed first, both require a level 8 average level party or better, it's tough crap... threnal east 3 is a 15 min onslaught, and if the npc dies you fail. I still have trouble with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">06-08-06, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're... almost there Jae... 'course, you'd know that if you showed up once in a while =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">06-08-06, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we need to work on Delera's.  Only problem is the quest in some parts says &quot;long&quot; when I did it should have said &quot;omg 2 hours for this part&quot;.  Then again the group wasn't as uber as ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">06-08-06, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is ONE good thing about Threnal South, you need to have east and west done to do south... but you don't have to redo east and west each time you do south.<br />
<br />
And sorry about my attendance guys, :( work sucks.</div></div><hr />
