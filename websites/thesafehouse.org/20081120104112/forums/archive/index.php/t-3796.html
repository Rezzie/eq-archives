<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vasik</div><div class="date">10-26-03, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there we were in VP. Just downed the last dragon with a 3 group pickup raid, when I check track and see a blue con Veeshan. &quot;WTF,&quot; I think. &quot;Maybe it's some sort of bug.&quot;<br />
<br />
So anyway, I tell the raid that Veeshan was up on track, so we went to try to find it. After a few mins wandering in the wrong direction, we decide to go back in the direction it was tracking (even though it showed like it was in the wall).<br />
<br />
So we float down in the pit of lava where it was leading me to. Then i see a little cave in the wall that the lava is entering the pit from. Then tada, i find Veeshan at the dead end. Just an invisible mob with the name Veeshan hovering over it.<br />
<br />
So I con it..it's blue, indifferent. I try hailing it...no response. Then I figure why not attack it. Didn't have a lot of hp at all. It barely hit me, for a whopping 3 dmg max. I stopped attack at 6% so my friend could come see. It started to get bugged in the wall, but my DoT proc from the Ornate Greatblade finished it off =P<br />
<br />
I thought it might have triggered a ring event down in the pit, but after it was dead, nothing new was on track, nothing happened, and there was no loot.<br />
<br />
Here's some screenshots.<br />

<br />
If anyone was curious where exactly it spawns.. its in the lower one of the 2 lava waterfall tunnels in hoshkar lair.. we levi'd down from xygoz/druu/nexona area after clearing the named out<br />
<br />
would be interesting if it did anything.. but knowing who designed it even if it was supposed to anyway, its probably broken lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say she wont be added because she's massive.  Her claws caused the 20k cliffs in WW... maybe if they added her as a sky texture</div></div><hr />

These guys made up a moon out of nowhere, Veeshan's size isn't going to stop them.</div></div><hr />

There  seems to be a lot of odd half finished things through out this game.  Some sort of ring type event was visable in Scarlet Desert for about a week once.  It never functioned, just had some placeholder mobs.  It eventually vanished. <br />
<br />
This is probably some half finished thing from the past or some future plans that accidently got activated.</div></div><hr />

I would assume it's something that was planned for when the zone is supposedly revamped since i had never heard of it prior to the gate change.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea, but sometimes mobs do not respond if you do not talk their language?</div></div><hr />

Your chat font size is 2 diffrent sizes in the box.  I'm sure it was a good story, but I smell whopper.<br />

<br />
its been known it pops on track.. was just thought to be inside the wall.. he just found it.. btw I was there and the one that organized the little trip, and the one that said wait don't kill it yet  <br />
<br />
its real</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reading is fundamental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vasik</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could try elder dragon, but I doubt it does anything... maybe it's supposed to be invisible but they screwed up the code (like the voice that shouts the timer of the Luclin portals that you used to be able to give items to).<br />
<br />
No, they aren't doctored screenshots. I have no reason to - that's like being accused of having doctored pics of soloing Carrot Top in PoM or something (not worth the effort). And the fuzziness is what happens when it's converted from bmp to jpeg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Azazelo</div><div class="date">10-28-03, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quote:maybe it's supposed to be invisible but they screwed up the code (like the voice that shouts the timer of the Luclin portals that you used to be able to give items to).<br />
<br />
Exactly. Mobs like that (a la &quot;Pain and suffering&quot;) are used for zone-wide emotes and are not supposed to show up on tracking or have thier names visible.<br />
<br />
There is something that happens in the zone that broadcasts &quot;Veeshan something something whatever&quot; and for it to be automated requires the invisible mob.<br />
<br />
As part of the 4th shawl quest you used to be able to find the hidden dwarf by looking for the invisible mob &quot;You stumble&quot; which created the emote: You stumble across a ..blah blah...   Or if you found the invisible mob &quot;You have&quot; it will trigger: You have summoned a Kromrif Death Squad!<br />
<br />
SOE fixed it so you can no longer find them by trying to initate a trade, but a guarding pet will still face these invisible mobs, so chances are its just a mistake and will be fixed eventually. Edited by: Azazelo  at: 10/28/03 11:07 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_AsturiasAurora</div><div class="date">10-29-03, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I'm wrong, but those 'emote' mobs you talked about usually don't have their names above them like the Veeshan one did.  Pets will face them but you usually can't see any trace of them; name or nothing.<br />
<br />
Developers seem to constantly mess with odler zones to try to keep the interest up in them.  It wouldn't be surprising at all to learn that the 'Veeshan ghost' you saw is part of an upcoming quest for perhaps a revamp of VP like they did with Solusek by adding the Sol C area.</div></div><hr />

I came across this human male standing there with an odd name.

Im sure the mob is real, its been on track for alot of ppl.   Max your faction by killing the King of Kaladim so u can walk around VP with max ring of scale faction, walk down and hail him.   /shrug who knows what might happen when u do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, which is why I said:<br />
<br />
Quote:...not supposed to show up on tracking or have thier names visible.<br />
<br />
Like polkgaiimahn's screenshot shows, when EQ gets buggy all sorts of NPCs can show up that you normally would not see.<br />
<br />
In the first year of EQ it was pretty common to see naked male humans with the name '!'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">11-04-03, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the sleeper is awoken, or back before several zone revamps, Nagafen and Vox begin shouting, there's shouting in skyshrine, and supposedly there was shouting in Veeshan's peak as well. But nobody ever hangs in vp, or did when the sleeper was being awoken. Wonder if the npc did that. But it only seems to spawn after dragons are killed, so it's probably just some stupidly unfinished thing.<br />
<br />
It's been in the zone for a while, and is tracked fairly often these days.</div></div><hr />
