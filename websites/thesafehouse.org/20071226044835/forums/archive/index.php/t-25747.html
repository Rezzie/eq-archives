<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stalk</div><div class="date">08-27-06, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty good. Probably my favorite of the season unless I'm forgetting something else.<br />
<br />
Louise is awesome. Saito's an actual male lead with a penis. So far we've been having genderless humans playing the role of a man. That makes him super cool.<br />
<br />
And there's that scene in episode 8:<br />
<br />
Where he kisses the princess. You don't get more hardcore than that, yo!<br />
<br />
Lots of people like Seista, but Louise wins in my opinion. :) Tabitha is cool like Yuki (Melody of Haruhi) cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for kissing the princess scene. I am totally sure he did it on purpose. If only reprecussion was to get beaten by Louise for the chance of a life time. Many would. ~ ~</div></div><hr />

<br />
So everything's coming out now. That bastard Ward and his devious ways! Good thing Saito completely owned him, as cliche a method it may have been. I mean, who didn't see that coming?!<br />
<br />
I was 99% sure Ward was a bad guy when he came in to begin with. It was pretty evident.<br />
<br />
Two more episodes left, eh? I wonder how they will wrap this up! I was suprised the Prince died so quick, heh.<br />
<br />
Looks like some people are getting together to work on the Zero no Tsukaima novels. I look forward to this!</div></div><hr />
