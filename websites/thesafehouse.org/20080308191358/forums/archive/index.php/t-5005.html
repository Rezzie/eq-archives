<br />
Just starting to build my envenom skill up now that I'm in me 40's, and thinking about what each poison does and how things can stack together.<br />
<br />
My question is - is a &quot;bleed&quot; that you get from a style considered the same damage type as a poison DOT?<br />
<br />
In practical terms - if you hit a target with a DOT'd poison, and then follow with a bleed-style - will you get 2 damages rolling?  Or does the bleed cancel the DOT?<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, assuming the above stacks, we can have:<br />
<br />
1) Direct melee-add buff from RM or Shaman.<br />
2) Melee-add song from Skald.<br />
3) Bleed-style.<br />
4) DOT<br />
<br />
...all going at once.  Am I missing or incorrect about any of that?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
