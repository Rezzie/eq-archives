<br />
Do they do different things for different classes?<br />
<br />
Obviously wis and int are mana pool for casters.<br />
<br />
Charisma has something to do with buy/sell prices at vendors, but what else does it do?<br />
<br />
Dexterity helps you with skill increases, but does it affect proc rates?<br />
<br />
??????<br />
<br />
Can someone just point me to a guide somewhere, my question is very broad and I can't seem to find the information the way I want to.<br />
<br />
No need to speculate here, just point me to the guide if you know of one   Jigsaw - Hierophant<br />

<br />
Int also helps non-combat skills (ie Sense Heading) to go up faster<br />
<br />
Cha also helps enchanters and bards with their charms.  There is rumor that lower cha helps necros with their fears. Delissandra Splitshadow -  Half-Elven Assassin - &quot;Far Seekers&quot; - The Rathe<br />

<br />
Str: carrying capacity, ATK. melee should try to keep this high, especially if they fight high conning mobs. if this is higher than wis and int, it will be used for skillup rates for blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
Sta: how long you can fight before losing small amounts of str, dex and agi from fatigue. Once 100+, that no longer matters. Affects HP, but looking for direct +HP items will usually get you much more HP than looking for stamina. Stamina is overrated in my opinion because of the biases people have toward assuming everyone is in an uberguild.<br />
<br />
Dex: affects how quickly your offensive skills increase, affects proc rate, archery and thrown weapons, chance to get a critical hit, how likely bards are to fizzle a song. In general, not worth looking for. if this is higher than wisdom and int, will be used for skillup rates on a handful of skills (fletching, tailoring i think).<br />
<br />
Agi: affects how quickly your defensive skills increase. gives you AC. You should value this on gear as 1 AC = 5 AGI. So a shissar scale BP at 30ac 15agil will give you the same boost to AC as a 33ac BP with no agil.<br />
<br />
Wis: mana for priests and priest hybrids. chance to fizzle for priests and priest hybrids. if this is higher than int, it will be used for skillup rates for all non-combat skills.<br />
<br />
int: mana for int casters and int caster hybrids. chance to fizzle. if higher than wisdom, skillup rate for non-combat skills.<br />
<br />
charisma: merchant prices. best price can be got at as low as 95 charisma depending on faction and how busy the merchant is. best to be able to get this to 125 or so if you are doing tradeskilling or something else that requires a lot of buying and selling from merchants. Supposed to affect Mez and Charm for enchanters and bards. If so, the effect is very very minor.<br />
<br />
Claims that aren't true:<br />
<br />
dex affects chance to hit. wrong<br />
<br />
cha affects bard chance to fizzle. new claim in POP manual. not proven, believed to be incorrect.<br />
<br />
dex affects haste. new claim in POP manual. the author clearly on crack.<br />
<br />
wisdom and int affect different skills, or wisdom affects success rate and int skillup rate, or some variation on that theme. Wrong. the higher of wis and int is used for all non-combat non-casting skills, unless you have a higher third stat (dex for fletching, str for smithing, etc)<br />
<br />
did i cover it all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_tass the great</div><div class="date">12-05-02, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">farmatyr is exactly correct.  almost.<br />

Quote:Affects HP, but looking for direct +HP items will usually get you much more HP than looking for stamina.<br />
this depends on the sta to hp ratio for that class as well as level.  for example, at level 60 rogues get 4hp per sta, warriors get 6, rangers get 4.3 or so...<br />
<br />
Quote:You should value this on gear as 1 AC = 5 AGI.<br />
this also depends on class as well as current agi.  5 agi will give a warrior with 50 agi more ac then that same war with 150.<br />
<br />
Quote:best price can be got at as low as 95 charisma depending on faction and how busy the merchant is.<br />
i think that prices dont vary on merchant usage, but rather from merchant to merchant.  i also believe that the price cap based on cha is 120, not 95.  even with 120+ cha, your prices will still change with faction.  im sure more can be found on this at www.eqtraders.com i'm just lazy atm :o/<br />
<br />
<br />
i havn't seen any hard facts on fizzle rate and how stats relate, if at all.  i believe that the only thing that matters in that regard is spell catagory skill compared to level.  for instance a lvl 60 ranger with 100 div will fizzle camo quite a bit.  however, if he had 100 div at level 20 he would barely fizzle.<br />
<br />
OH OH OH and /wave Jigsaw!! how ya been man? DISCLAIMER:  <br />
This is my opinion.  As such, it should not be taken as fact even though I believe it to be so.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and as much of a voice to them as is given me.  Please do not judge my words too harshly.  They are only my words and as such, are only as powerful as you make them.</div></div><hr />
