<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sneakster Shenanigans</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I started my Halfling Rogue and really enjoyed the Prelude.  I got level 3, and got some unique items.  Then I left the Halls of Justice, and I am so lost.  I have started 3 quests just by talking to people, and have no idea what to do.  I am only level 3, so I am wary of adventuring somewhere.  I went into the Beggar's area and then ran out screaming because I thought I would get owned.  I am not really looking for a walkthrough, just an idea of where to go from here.  I saw Tomi Undergallows, but didn't hire him because it sounded expensive and I'm already a rogue.  <br />
<br />
Will I only be allowed one mercenary?  Do I have to keep paying them, or is there just a one time fee?  <br />
<br />
What happens when I die ingame?  <br />
<br />
Is my 304 gold a lot of money, or just chump change, hehe?<br />
<br />
Will I EVER get used to the weird camera views?!?!<br />
<br />
Will a level 3 be alright no matter where I go if it connects to the zone outside of the Halls of Justice?<br />
<br />
If I put one level into Ranger, wil i get a penalty-less dual wield?  At what level should i start multiclassing?  My wisdom is 10, so will I be able to cast at all?<br />
<br />
I may think fo more questions later = )<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance, <br />
Sneakster</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Yes, and only a one time fee.<br />
<br />
What happens when I die ingame? <br />
<br />
- Read the manual.   Reload or get ressurected with a 10% gold penalty and 50xcharacter-level charge.<br />
<br />

<br />
- For you level, monty haul. <br />
<br />
Will I EVER get used to the weird camera views?!?!<br />
<br />
- Yes, go into options and then controlls if you want to play with them. Very simple to get used to.<br />
<br />
Will a level 3 be alright no matter where I go if it connects to the zone outside of the Halls of Justice?<br />
<br />
- Go play in the Penninsula district.<br />
<br />
If I put one level into Ranger, wil i get a penalty-less dual wield? At what level should i start multiclassing? My wisdom is 10, so will I be able to cast at all?<br />
<br />
- Hmm... I think there is still some sort of offhand penalty but much less. Your wisdom score = you can speak (serious, read it in the manual). You can cast, but will suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Acinonyx SW</div><div class="date">07-10-02, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No idea what to do!<br />
Talk to the girl outside the HoJ if you hadn't already.  That will lead you to an area designed specifically for people just starting off.  (Why would they put her right there otherwise?)<br />
<br />
 What henchmen do I need?<br />
Since you are a rogue, you are correct, Tomi is not for you unless you want to dual-box   .  I still recommend getting Tomi sometime before you finish chapter one (as well as ALL the henchmen) because he has a really nice rogue only item he gives you for helping him in his quest.<br />
<br />
 Where can I find these hirelings?<br />
Trade of Blades is where you can find some other people to help you.  Eventually, you will find certain henchmen can help you in areas where others would not be as effective.  A cleric is nice if you are going against undead.  A Fighter is nice if you are heading into areas with hard hitting critters.<br />
<br />
 Is this the right henchman for me?<br />
You just have to get the feel for what type of henchman is needed at the moment.  Everytime I hired one, I'd drop him off in the Halls of Justice near the recall portal for easy access.<br />
<br />
 I can't afford all these contracts!<br />
Once you purchase a henchmans contract he gives you a token so you do not have to pay for him again if you decide to re-hire him.  I always felt bad firing my henchmen for some reason.  <br />
<br />
 What happens when I die?<br />
When you die, you will be ported to those funky light thingers in the HoJ.  The old guy will explain the details.<br />
<br />
 I have MAD L3WT!<br />
304 gold is pretty much what everyone leaves the Academy with.  Enough to purchase a henchman and a potion/item or two.  Don't worry about spending cash because you'll end up with tons of it eventually.  Find an item you really like on a merchant and save for it.  Other than that spend it freely.<br />
<br />
 Wierd camera views are TEH SUCK SIRS!<br />
I will never get used to it.  I'm still hitting F9 to switch back to 1st person view.  As a result I end up porting back to the HoJ at the worst times    (My Stone of recall is(was) hotkeyed F9.<br />
<br />
 Is this zone going to pimp me?<br />
The zone the HoJ is in is the central area you will venture forth from initially in the game.  The other zones all have their *boss* critters and so you may want to pay attention to where you are and what types of enemies you are liable to confront.  Talk to the people in and around the zones you want to go to and get some idea what is in store for you.<br />
<br />
 Rangers and stuff.<br />
Rangers get dual-wield and ambidexterity for free which only gives you a penaly of -4 Primary/ -4 Secondary.  However, if the off-hand weapon is light the penalty is reduced to -2 / -2.  Neat huh?  With STR/Level bonuses and specialization the penalties are rather easy to overcome.<br />
<br />
Also, if you take the exotic weapon proficiency you can use those double weapons that automatically count as a light weapon in your off-hand.<br />
<br />
 I want to be a RANGA-ROGUE but my WIS sucks!<br />
You can multi-class at whatever level you want once you reach level 2.  You may only have maximum of 3 classes at a time, however.<br />
<br />
Your XP is put into a pool as you adventure.  When you get enough to level up, you choose which class to level in.<br />
<br />
As far as your Wisdom is concerned, no, you cannot cast spells with a 10 Wisdom.  But... at level 4, 8, 16, and 20 you get stat bonuses.  Pop them into wisdom and you'll be ok.<br />
<br />
11 Wis - 1st Level Spells<br />
12 Wis - 2nd Level Spells<br />
13 Wis - 3rd Level Spells<br />
14 Wis - 4th Level Spells(Max)<br />
<br />
Level 6 - 1st Level Spells<br />
Level 10 - 2nd Level Spells<br />
Level 12 - 3rd Level Spells<br />
Level 15 - 4th Level Spells<br />
<br />
So the maximum Rogue/Ranger Levels for you will be as follows:<br />
<br />
14 Rogue/6 Ranger - 1st Level Spells (11 Wis)<br />
10 Rogue/10 Ranger - 2nd Level Spells(12 Wis)<br />
8 Rogue/12 Ranger - 3rd Level Spells(13 Wis)<br />
5 Rogue/15 Ranger - 4th Level Spells(14 Wis)<br />

<br />
Thanks again, and feel free to add anything else, hehe = )<br />
