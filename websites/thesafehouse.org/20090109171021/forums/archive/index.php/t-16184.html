Anyone can see stealthed or invis characters who are in their party.  (Thanks for that, SOE!)  Predators get the ability to see out-of-party stealthed characters as part of their Hunt skill - an upgrade to Sneak.  (So a predator has to be sneaking to see other sneaking folks.)  I'm not sure if other scouts get any such ability.  Mages get a see invis spell at 9, but I'm not sure if that works on sneaking.  (Beta spell lists included a separate &quot;see hidden&quot; spell as well, but I can't find anything like that any more.)<br />
<br />
My guess is that this skill isn't meaningful for players at all, but *is* for NPCs.  The determination of whether a mob can see you while sneaking is probably a contest between the mob's Detect Hidden skill and your Reconnesence / Stalking / whatever skill.</div></div><hr />

The undead deer in the firemyst gully: Foul wind instance are a good example of what I'm talkin 'bout.</div></div><hr />
