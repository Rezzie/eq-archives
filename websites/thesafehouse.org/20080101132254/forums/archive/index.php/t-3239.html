No, I didn't play a rogue. Why? Because you don't have control over your henchmen which means you can't control when/what spells get cast. This matters most on buff spells. Instead, I played a sorcerer and took the rogue as my henchman. This way we walk around constantly with:<br />
<br />
protection from evil<br />
cat's grace<br />
bull strength<br />
endurance<br />
stone skin<br />
<br />
My summoned monster and/or familiar have:<br />
stone skin<br />
protection from evil<br />
and one of them get's cat's grace.<br />
<br />
I also have eagle's splendor and premonition instead of stone skin. These spells, coupled with the boots of speed (i used haste before i got these,) let's me melee most of the fodder and get through most small-medium dungeons without even having to rest. Plus there is something belittling about the fact that a sorcerer with nearly 100 hit points can beat people down. Spellcasters? please, I toast them for breakfast.<br />
<br />
But, goddammit sometimes i want to strangle that little $(&amp;amp;%ing piece of *#&amp;amp;@ halfling till his larynx collapses in on itself rendering him permanently devoid of the (#$&amp;amp;ING PRIVELEDGE OF EVER SPEAKING ANOTHER $()#*ING WORD!!!!<br />
<br />
And another thing, if I run across one more @#%$ quest that isn't completable, I am going to join the dark army and kill every MOTHERFARKING MAN, WOMAN, CHILD, CHICKEN AND COW WITHIN 100 $($*ING MILES OF NEVERWINTER!<br />

My pixie familiar was worse, because it doesn't say anything, making it extremly hard to open things :P<br />
And what uncompletable quests?<br />
I never ran across any. &quot;Age and wisdom don't always go together, I've found. ... Some people just become stupid with more authority.&quot; -- Terry Pratchett</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jem</div><div class="date">07-07-02, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Were you able to find all three druids in Neverwinter Wood? This one isn't uncompleted in my book, i just had no freaking idea where to find the 3rd druid.<br />
<br />
Uncompletable quests:<br />
<br />
Getting the baby back for the harlot in Luskan. I went and killed the guy cause he didn't have any script that let me barter for the baby. He dropped the baby and I took it back to her, she didn't have any script to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
The halfling/gnome's (i can't remember which) ring quest, also in the brothel, which you were to get the ring back from the noblewoman so her husband didn't find out. She didn't have any script about bartering for the ring, so again I had to kill her. And he didn't have any script to give the ring back to him.<br />
<br />
There were a couple of others too, but I am at work and these are the only ones I can remember at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And another thing, I actually did the quest to join the wizards guild (starcloaked whatever, again I can't remember the name) in chapter 1 in Neverwinter. Then I get to chapter 3 and I get the generic script that she will sell me magic items even though I am not a member. WTF?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I also can't express how much joy I felt when I get to chapter 3 and I finally have something to spent my 500,000+ gold on. I had most of those magic items crafted and took martial weapon proficiency at 18th level just so I could use them. I kept them all and switch out depending on what I am fighting. Prior to this, I was thinking to myself, &quot;What good is all this gold if there is nothing worth buying?&quot; Edited by: Wraine at: 7/7/02 11:32:14 pm</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_VariaVespasa</div><div class="date">07-07-02, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had no problem doing the gnome quest and baby quest that you mentioned.  You can pursuade the woman to return the ring so as to not endanger the gnome, and you can bribe the guy for the baby.  Its likely just some wierd bug with your game, which I understand from the boards happens sometimes.   The  only quest I've found that I couldnt complete (besides the obvious mutually exclusive ones like &quot;do you give the neverwinter artifacts to the good side or the evil side?&quot;) was giving the fort seige subchiefs head to the fort boss.  This was likely a bug similar to the ones that hit you since I killed an unnamed subchief who dropped nothing before I got the quest.  But apart from that I have completed all the quests in chapters 1 and 2, and no problems with the ones in chapter 3 so far.<br />

<br />
I was able to do the Ring quest in Luskan fine too.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I do hate about NWN is the fact that once you miss one little chest/box/cocoon/whatever somewhere you are so screwed if that one was the one you needed to complete a certain quest... unless you are masochistic enough to re-check ALL boxes/chests/cocoons of that chapter.

<br />
I've tried getting Tomi to go into Stealth Mode - but it's greyed out, so I can't.  I click on a chest, it's locked, so he goes and disarms a trap somewhere nearby and then rushes off to attack some creature he happens to spot.  Despite my best efforts with the right-click wheel menu, I can't get him to stick close to me so I can do my meat-shield role (10 ftr, 2 rog; about quarter of the way through chapter 2).<br />
<br />
I loathe only being able to have one henchman.  Absolutely no way to get a good balance of abilities in the party, and if you don't have a rogue, you're out of luck.  I've had to trigger some chests that Tomi couldn't disarm, and generally came close to killing myself (or killing myself two or three times), and trying to bash the chests tend to result in &quot;Weapon ineffective&quot; messages - I've tried magic blunt as well as my usual +2 Bastard Sword. <br />

Its a chest in a building at the docks.  Its armed with a fireball trap.  He will unlock the chest but not disarm it..how can i direct him to do that?<br />

Anyway. If you are having problems not getting Tomi to disarm traps behind you, talk to him and do the &quot;readjust our strategy&quot; option. You can tell him to assist you if you are unable to disarm the traps. One good thing about being a mage/sorcerer: If Tomi can't beat the DC, Fireball can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">never needed a rogue yet - that barbarian half-orc seems to do just fine destroying chests with his axe. even if you get the &quot;weapon ineffective&quot; message, keep going until you get a crit, and you'll damage the chest.<br />
<br />
nothing like spending literally 4 minutes beating on a &quot;weapon ineffective&quot; chest, only to get 30gp out of it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solution with the difficulty. I remember reading they said that the default setting for difficulty was for players who play solo with only a pet/or summoned creature. You'll have to adjust the difficulty slider under option to make the game more challenging with a henchmen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShadowCross</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the game often told me that &quot;default difficulty&quot; expected you to play with a henchmen, otherwise it might be too hard to solve it solo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Syllestrae FV</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a helpful hint, but power attack and improved power attack are both good to activate when trying to bust down doors or smash open chests.  The things are easy enough to hit even with the attack penalty, and the +5 (or +10) damage will go a long ways towards overcoming the damage resistance.  Likewise, a weapon with a hard-hitting crit ratio (like the x3 on axes) will really help when you get that inevitable crit.<br />

I couldn't afford a henchman when I first ran across them so never bothered.  I've been playing it pure rogue all the way.  This has pretty much consisted of never taking on more than 4 weak enemies at a time.  If more join in I pretty much have to run away or I'm dead.  Needless to say this means I save after every single skirmish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">07-09-02, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played the whole game through as a rogue with Daelan Red Tiger as my henchman.<br />
<br />
Wasn't *too* bad.  But I had to spend ALOT of time resting.<br />
<br />
Only one fight was so bad I actually had to keep porting back to the temple of tyr in the middle of the fight to heal and pick up daelan when he died over and over again.  And that was the 2 corrupted dragons at once you fight in the source stone.</div></div><hr />
