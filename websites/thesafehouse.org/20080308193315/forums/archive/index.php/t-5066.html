Thank you,<br />

No idea exactly how much difference it makes, but I do know that when dex/quick buffed I get far more evades than I do otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Styran Psalmsinger</div><div class="date">05-10-02, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick does too? Hmmm have you noticed any difference when only your quick was improved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Landril77</div><div class="date">05-10-02, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, after Mythic anounced that both dex and quickness had an effect I played around with a cleric guildmate of mine using just the baseline quick buffs and it did seem to help.</div></div><hr />

Ignore one side of equation at your peril...<br />
<br />
Now this is weird, and I still need a lot more data to confirm... <br />
But I equip with Fast (2.2) medium (2.7) and slow (3.2) weps as a Nightshade...<br />
<br />
It FEELS like I evade more often with the fast weapons... yet Mythic doesn't say weapon speed has anything to do with it. I do know that Evades rock the house and plan on training my Thrust Inf to 50 to get the best Evade move in the game...<br />

I am hoping with this template and good envenom (Skill 39 or 40 +10 items)  to be able to solo melee even a tank down, <br />
<br />
That means either CS or Stealth will have to rest at level 39. And I can forget DW/CD. Still I hope this will be very effective in ways my L43 Nightshade can only dream of. <br />

I'm not saying this to argue or be contrary. and I do appreciate your comments. I really am looking for some hard data on the effects of dex (and or quick) on evades though.<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

Which is, I'd like to see hard data rather than jus accept what mythic says.</div></div><hr />

SS You can't land another stun after CD. Remember that any stun will start the 1 min 'no stun' timer. Edited by: Thormael  at: 5/16/02 6:11:51 am</div></div><hr />

If this is the case, you would evade less when using a slow weapon.  I cannot confirm this or deny it.</div></div><hr />
