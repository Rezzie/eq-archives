<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_dugannw</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its 4 group maximum, but you can do with less groups/people.  The event is a little bugged too, in that if previous groups have come (with less than 4) your groups may end up being ported to two different Mujaki areas.<br />
<br />
We were able to find a way to levitate up the sides of the buildings and run to the walls of the next Mujaki event to get groups back together.  Once you finish one, you can also run this way to the next one to start it up (if you fall off the wall into nowhere land you can run up one of the gravestones where the mobs spawn to get back up).  Makes it quicker than leaving and coming back if you want to do all 3 Mujakis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_kaladornus</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great I hope it gets re-set. I couldnt get confirmation and only brought 3 groups.<br />
<br />
We were doing ok, but then finally the tidal wave came and we ended up with 7 horsies on the platform.<br />
<br />
We just couldnt get Mujaki solo and ended up bailing the encounter  <br />
<br />
Next time 6 more people+proper positioning = win<br />
<br />
<br />
And I agree, what a freaking fun encounter!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_kaladornus</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ps he is completely immune to snare now. A lot of people said to snare him and have him walk back slowly.<br />
<br />
So that is out  <br />
<br />
We did have a ranger kite the whole set of horses for like 10 hours until fear hit him though, so you can always try that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_dugannw</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snare isnt what I was talking about, he does however move faster than his horse buddies when he's not casting fear.  He is actually a fairly easy split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_kaladornus</div><div class="date">10-31-03, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night the monk and SK tried to split him out and the Monk got Feared right into the group.<br />
<br />
It was like DEATH himself was coming for us with his horsemen of the apocalypes ha ha.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_dugannw</div><div class="date">11-03-03, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds pretty funny hehe.  May want to set up your camp/pull spot in a different place as well (hint: like where there are no spawns and puller cant be feared into, take a look around before he is pulled).<br />
<br />
You dont even have to use a feign death class to pull him, though some fd classes have this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_BonlainyT</div><div class="date">11-04-03, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy encounter, but we always use 4 groups to get the maximum number of people there for the fun.<br />
<br />
It's really easy to avoid all the horsemen by killing the servents.  Put a group at each headstone and a roving group for when 2 or 3 pop at once and you can easily kill all 36 before they get up to him.  Once Mujaki can be targeted just have someone with fearless tank him and you are golden.  Very fun event and he drops very nice loot to go along with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Spyrit123</div><div class="date">11-04-03, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We normally use 4 groups for this event, but now its sending 3 groups to the right area, and a 4th group to the wrong area. the 4th group that was in the other area got lev and hopped the side, came up through a gravestone.<br />
<br />
Anyways, best way to do this if you have multiple FD'ers let all the servants build up in the center, only guard one gravestone... mujaki outruns his calvary, put a fd'er on each side of the calvary and just ping pong till he's taggable.<br />

Using harmshield/divine aura should give the puller in most situations enough time to separate him from his cavalry since they wont be fearable till it wears off.</div></div><hr />
