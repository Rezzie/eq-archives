 Grummus seems to be the most accessible by members of the general EQ public, hence I am looking to try to form a pickup raid. I would like ask some questions about this guy:<br />
<br />
1. What is the recommended no. of people to do him?<br />
in a pickup grp kind of way.<br />
2. How hard does he hit? Any proc? How should I deal with it(How many second CCH) and how much HP should the tank be recommended to have.<br />
3. Does he rampage or flurry or AE?<br />
<br />
Any extra info/tactics/strategy will be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Fritzal Kittykat</div><div class="date">12-21-03, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(**OLD** Guide I made for out guild earlier this year)<br />
<br />
Grummus, boss of Plane of Disease. Killing him flags you for the Crypt of Decay. CoD is a tier two zone which houses Bertox, along with several other minibosses<br />
<br />
He is located inside the castle of PoD. Access to him requires killing Gryme the Cryptmaster. Gryme drops a no-rent key that lets you move past a locked door where Grummus is found. <br />
He is unslowable and used the Stench of Decay AE descibed below. Paladin nife procs and nukes land on him. Quads for 700 and has around 100k hp.<br />
Gryme is a one day respawn<br />
<br />
After killing Gryme, you need to kill the Aramin the Spider Guardian. Aramin is level 68, perma rooted and maxes for 785, slowable. Has aprox 150k hp. After Aramin dies, 8 mini spiders spawn that hit for 300ish, and are slowable, but not mezzable. Suggested to camp a rezzer in case the minispiders wipe raid. They despawn faster then the corpse rots. Aramin drops a some decent items<br />
<br />
You cannot pull Grummus out of the castle anymore. He has 4-6 level 61 guards that are not mezzable. They can be charmed and used as RT's if needed.<br />
<br />
Grummus Level: 66<br />
<br />
Max melee damage: 1179 quad + RAMPAGE<br />
<br />
Not Slowable.<br />
<br />
Could not find his HP, but a medium sized guild can kill him in under 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Grummus is on a leash. He cannot be pulled past the top of the ramp. Once he reaches the top, he poofs back to spawn point and loses all agro.<br />
<br />
Area effects used:<br />
<br />
Stench of Decay (36 disease counters)<br />
radius: 100 <br />
resist: disease -300 <br />
dot: 200hp a tick for 1.8mins (3600 total)<br />
Also has a slow affect with it (not sure on percent)<br />
<br />
Plasma Decay (9 curse counters)<br />
radius: 100<br />
resist: disease -1000<br />
dot: 1600 damage over 3.3mins (not sure)<br />
<br />
Radiant cure will cure stench. <br />
<br />
Shamans (49) and Beastlords (63) Abolish disease will remove stench in one cast.<br />
Disinfecting aura will remove in two casts.<br />
Counteract disease in five casts.<br />
<br />
Plasma decay is only casted once every 4 mins.<br />
<br />
Bard song + Shaman/Druid regen + AE healer in each group will overcome DOT damage.<br />
<br />
Battle strategy:<br />
<br />
Clear castle until we reach the room before the ramp down to Grummus. Finish all buffing and be prepared for Grummus engagement. A bard DA puller will pull his guards to the raid to be dealt with / charmed. It's ok if Grummus is agro'd while pulling guards, he will leash at the top of the stairs and poof to his spawn point with all agro lost.<br />
<br />
Once guards are down, ranger WS or someone DA on Grummus to take the first plasma decay AE (4 min refresh).<br />
<br />
After AE, the MT, RTs, and CoD pets are sent in, closely followed by the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
Rampage quad 1k is brutal, especially for non-planar guilds, so it is essential that agro is on the proper people.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
We have 7 radiant cures so far (at least), and hopefully more soon. This is an encounter we can complete with our normal full raid force (50ish people). We've beaten AoW finally, and this guy has less damage output to the MT. As long as we are smart about dealing with the AE dot damage we can do this. Healers keep your groups alive, melees &amp;amp; nukers burn him down hard and fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Dalien</div><div class="date">12-22-03, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bring clerics and druids with AE (MGB) heals and coordinate them, that will negate any dot damage you'd normally have to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ProphetOmniz</div><div class="date">12-22-03, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did him with just over 30 pre VT geared people, he's not as hard as everyone makes him out to be.  Get snare glands for the MT, have one cleric with MGB + SCRM + Celes Regen2, and have a priest with RC1 in every group that uses it every time plasma decay lands and he's a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Phalsa</div><div class="date">12-24-03, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You left out THE &quot;best&quot; spell for Grummus encounter. Shaman spell &quot;Blood of Nadox&quot; will cure dot on entire group in 2 casts.<br />
Compare BoN (7.5 sec cast) x 2 (15sec) vs Abolish (6 sec cast) x 6 (36 sec). You can cure an entire group in less than half the time of the next best alternative. BoN + AE healing = done deal. BTW, RC is close to useless for encounters like this.<br />
Refresh on RC is 3 min., win or lose the encounter will be over in 3 min. and Grumus AE's MORE than once every 3 min. RC will cure &quot;1&quot; AE, after that you will be standing there **** in hand dieing to the DoT waiting 2.5 min for RC to refresh.<br />
<br />
Good Luck, hope this helps. Edited by: Phalsa at: 12/24/03 12:52 pm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_ProphetOmniz</div><div class="date">12-24-03, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Grummus has 2 AE's.  One is plasma decay, and is the bad one, and is cured by one cast of radiant cure, and grummus only AE's it every 4 mins.  The other one is stench decay, and barely does any damage.<br />
<br />
If your guild doesnt use radiant on grummus you're making it way harder on yourselves.<br />
<br />
Plasma Decay:  lucy.allakhazam.com/spell...ource=Test<br />
<br />
Recast 240, 9 curse counters, doesnt list dmg per tick but its definitely worse than the other one.<br />
<br />
Stench of Decay: lucy.allakhazam.com/spell...ource=Test<br />
<br />
Recast 42 seconds, 36 disease counters, only 200hp/tick<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 1: lucy.allakhazam.com/spell...ource=Test<br />
<br />
Cures 9 curse counters, recast is 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />
