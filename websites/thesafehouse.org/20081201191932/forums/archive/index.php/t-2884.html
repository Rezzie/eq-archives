<br />
3rd edition is pretty big right now, but those crazy non dice games are pretty popular too.<br />
<br />
No dice... its unnatural! Glip the Gnome<br />

This goes for no dice and cards too. =)<br />

<br />
it's basically a cinematic swashbuckler game based on renn-era earth, with lots of neat stuff thrown in. if you've seen brotherhood of the wolf, the italian chick would easily be a fate witch. one of the guys has a puzzle sword, which is a &quot;special&quot; sword from montaigne, the french country. avalon (england/ireland/scotland) is actually running off of the arthur mythos, with a female queen as arthur instead. it's a simply kickass game, with an awesome system.<br />

I love the system, the world, the character creation and balance are all done well.  And as for rogues, its got that.  Its a point based skills system.  Attributes are a little overpowered but expensive enough to get that it doesn't interfere too much.  The system rewards cinematic and dramatic scenes!  Chandelier swinging is practically a skill, and intrigue fits in perfectly.  The entire world is based on Renaissance Europe, but with sorcery and quirks.  My personal favorite is a Vodacce Swordsman that for all intents and purposes is a rogue.  Vodacce is Italy, where the power structure is from 7 princes all competing against each other for power.  Assassinations and poisoning is fairly common and every shadow has someone hiding in it.  If you are looking for a new system and world I would highly recommend it. <br />
