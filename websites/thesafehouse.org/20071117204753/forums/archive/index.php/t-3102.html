<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always loved the OA, and really, really loved L5R and it's story lines.  Ran across these a few months back, and found that they had licensed AEG to take over the OA setting and use their Rokugan setting.  Seems like it has a lot of promise, and from a rogue standpoint, what could be better than a world with hidden cultists, ninjas (L5R is one of the few games I have ever seen that made players afraid to be a ninja), secret Scorpion clan spies, and the world domination bent Kolats?  And all the epic storylines as well.</div></div><hr />

I've had plenty of seeing games I enjoy get stupidified to generate profit. I think it's kind of funny, I think it's kind of sad, that the dreams in which I'm dyin' are the best I've ever had.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The great thing though, is they are doing the supplements so that they support both the d20 and their system.  90 percent of the supplement is updated storyline material ect.  I had missed the last couple years of tournament storyline, and it looks like they really shook things up when AEG got the rights back from WOTC.  Good stuff, even if my old favorites die, were killed, murdered, old age, ect.  I do so love seeing that Bayushi Tangen has a successor.  All hail the Scorpion Clan Martyr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just make sure you get the Rokugan d20 book, and not the Oriental Adventures book. they are two different things :P<br />
<br />
personally, I'm kinda with nenjin on it. I loved the l5r setting &amp;amp; system and don't at all like the d20 version of it, and don't see a point beyond pandering for cash. but, seeing as how my friends for the most part disliked l5r because of all the Honor stuff, the d20 version is a lot easier to run with them (if I ever wanted to) than the l5r system itself.<br />

The #k# system makes a lot of sense to me, although I don't like how easy it is to get obliterated, because people wound levels &amp;lt; everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved that system, was probably my favorite game. I was just unfortunate in that my friends (aside from one who was the first to move away) didn't really care for asian/japanese inspired stuff, and really hated trying to follow the whole Honor system.<br />
<br />
and yeah, people can be dropped really quick, though supposedly second edition (which I never got to play) was a little less brutal. <br />
<br />
the thing I always hated was that in to-the-death (or unconscious) duels, crabs seemed to come out king early on. even kakita duelists, with their school based around dueling, just couldn't do the damage that a crab could. if you were in a first-blood duel, then a kakita had a chance. but in anything else, it's good to be the crab :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when people remarked how deadly a katana was, and John Wick replied, &quot;Well ya!&quot;.  How many people you know that would take more than one good slash to put down?  <br />
<br />
  I loved the setting, especially when Wick, then Ree were doing it.  So far it seems like it was handed off to good people, but just catching up on the thing.  Have read the Scorpion (my fav) and Crab (the deck I used to play when LSD and UniPony decks were hot) books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The flavor for those books was absolutely fantastic. I've only poured over the Scorpion book completely, but it could be the master guide to playing Devious mothers in ANY game. My aunt and a friend happened to look over while I was on vacation and read the &quot;if you truly want to bring your enemy to you, don't directly confront him and challenge him, kill his wife. Then he will be blinded by rage and revenge, making him an easy foe&quot; part, and looked at me sideways for the rest of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the scorpion sourcebook completely accomplished what it was meant to do. I went from being a crane/phoenix lover, and complete scorpion hater, to having scorpion as my favored clan. I love that book, it's utterly brilliant, and playing that clan (would be) so damned cool. <br />
<br />
the only clans I really don't like are the crab and the unicorn, maybe because they're the &quot;least japanese (or rokuganese)&quot; of all the clans. they also just had no hooks I was into; the crab were all about glory and gruffness, and the unicorns were basically about horses. neither of which I was that interested in :P <br />
<br />
of course, they're probably the easiest to play for folks who aren't into the setting very much, or just don't know how a character should act &amp;amp; react in the world. the crabs don't care about manners and etiquette, and the unicorn just don't know it very well.<br />
<br />
now that I have a new group, when we get tired of shadowrun I may see if we can do some l5r.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Crab are about loyalty and martyrdom.  You serve on the wall, you live on the wall, you die on the wall.  You see unspeakable evils, friends turned to jelly, the dead haunted eyes of your children set in a zombies  skull as he clings to your arm and crushes your throat.  I loved the Crab for many reasons, but Scorpions are my roguely love of loves.  <br />
<br />
   The retelling of the scorpion and the river sums it up for me.  For those of you reading this thread with no clue what we are talking about, imagine the normal faerie tale where the scorpion and frog are swimming across river, scorpion stings him, and as they go down, frog says now we both die, and the scorpion says &quot;I couldn't help it, it was my natuere.&quot;  Well in the L5R version, the Scorpion leans down and whispers, &quot;But I can swim&quot;, and the by by piggyback (think it was the crab in that book, been a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh those scorpion tales were great. I also liked all the passages from &quot;Lies&quot;. <br />
<br />
for flavor, I think the scorpion, phoenix, and lion books were the best. dragon and unicorn were pretty bland, crane I didn't care about one way or another, and crab I never really bothered to read much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dragon was a hard one to do at the time.  Togashi Yokuni was still in charge, and he is one of the all time mystery figures.  Nobody knew a thing about him.  I might get the new version soon, because I want to know the latest skinny on the ise zame, Hitomi version, the Lord Moon fight, ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Unicorn are the representation of western culture in Rokugan, the Rokugani samurai that have 'gone west' and come back changed, with different perceptions of Bushido and Honor. They are AEG's attempt to bring more people in who don't go in for the hardcore idea of Samurai and Bushido, or who can't get their minds around the Rokugani mindset. I find the Unicorn very boring, I find the Crab superficial. I think the Lion are fun to play because you can actually be that bull headed samurai. Phoenix rule just because they do. I haven't read the Dragon book, but they don't do enough to intrest me. I like the Crane, because they are like the 'honest' version of the Scorpion. That and I love Iajitsu duels. <br />
<br />
But Scorpion definetly have the most flavor, depth, and really flexibility in my mind. Scorpion can go the typical way, deceitful, sneaky, or you can go the atypical scorpion, I forget what the Trait is called. And yes, &quot;Lies&quot; was a great piece of text.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND NOW PREPARE TO FACE THE DARK SWORD OF BITTER LIES!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Junshin&quot; is the name of the disadvantage you take to be an honest scorpion, which also makes you a black sheep. I played one once, and killed myself in the first adventure :P but I really screwed him up, and played more of a &quot;good, honest, moral samurai&quot; instead of an *honorable* samurai. I wish I would've done better with that character, could have turned out very cool.<br />
<br />
when we did city of lies, two of us made scorpions. I made a bayushi courtier that was rank 2, and then a friend made my &quot;brother&quot; that was my guardian. and because I was the highest ranking one in the group, and the only court-affiliated person, I ended up being the lead magistrate.<br />
<br />
unfortunately, though the adventure was great fun for me with all of the intrigue, the rest of the group was rather bored by it, since it was lacking in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scorpion Book really made me want to play a courtier/socialite for the first time. Sadly, most of my players are &quot;western style Samurai&quot; which basically means they don't care about Bushido(although they know how to avoid being penalized for it), Honor is a number not a ethos, and killing stuff is always the best solution. Not exactly the kind of group that goes goo-goo over Court settings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, was basically the same with mine. one guy always played a dragon (only for the dual style) but acted more like a unicorn-crab crossbreed. another played an isawa shugenja that was as violent as any lion. then we had a crab that was actually a crab - drunken, prideful, straightforward. <br />
<br />
but all were based around action, and in a game that can kill you very quickly, that doesn't make for long adventures or campaigns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">God, it's like you can buy our groups as a boxed set or something.....There is always at least 1 Dragon, 1 Tatooed Man, usually 1 Crab, one unaffliated Ronin who of course, loves his Shadowlands Taint and Maho Lore. Every once in awhile, a Scorpion Samurai or wannabee Pajama Stalker will poke their head out, and then decided based on everyone else's max damage, that the Clan and Professions are gimped(Our GM HATES Ninjas, and gleefully makes your life a living hell), and goes on to make a Dragon or a Phoenix Samurai/Shugenja. I'm the guy that plays all the other Clans no one does, Scorpioin Crane Lion, and Phoenix to an extent. Only clan I refuse to touch is Unicorn, they just don't have any soul, not compared to the Scorpion at least.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phoenix Bushi miss out on some of the real perks that Bushi enjoy, super beefy defense/damage/speed/agility, they have a goofy school bonus of +1 int I believe, but OH MY @#%$ GOD, a 3rd rank Bushi that has developed his void can just dump it all in one attack and slam somebody. The damage bonus from your void rank is like a little perk, but it builds up after a while and becomes a nice 4 or 5 extra wounds per attack. If they could adjust damage die with those void points, they would be completely unstoppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-04-03, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really need to get my own copy of the phoenix book. guy that bought it went into the marines and it's been sitting in his storage for four years.<br />
<br />
I was looking through the first winter court book, and there's a pretty nice shiba ancestor in there that costs 9 points. basically, anyone who's attacking you in combat, you take 5 off the tn to hit them. you also declare your action last in initiative, so you can react better to people going before you.<br />
<br />
the downside is that you can never gain more than one extra die for full attacks, but I'm not sure I ever used that anyways. the main hurt comes from losing 9 points in character creation, which is a lot for anyone but a true ronin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what are the core books for this, in both the original and the D20 (im not much on d20, but my gaming group adores it), and the clan books/supplements. really sounds like my sort of game.<br />
<br />
My group is all about playing Silver Age Super Heroes at the moment, and i absolutely abhor the powergaming that playing a super hero generates.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've seen any mods played online however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nenjin</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">l5r.alderac.com/rpg/<br />
<br />
The link for d20 L5R supplements(I'm a d20 hater, so I don't advise it, but to be fair, I haven't read over the supplements and played under the new system).<br />
<br />
Can't find a link to any older L5R books or source pages, the game was produced by AEG before Wizards of the Coast bought it out. Most gaming stores will probably have a few old clan books and the Main Book, which is all you really need to play. The clan books give TONS of clan history, ideas, methods, attitudes, some advantages and disadvantages, new skills, speciality professions, new spells per clan, and some minor adjustment to school abilities, but the main rule book carries rules for both Shugenja and Bushi of all clans, and enough back history you will know what to do and what to expect.<br />
<br />
All the clan books are:<br />
<br />
Way of the Dragon<br />
&quot;             &quot; Lion<br />
&quot;             &quot; Scorpion<br />
&quot;             &quot; Crane<br />
&quot;             &quot; Crab<br />
ect....<br />
<br />
Way of the Wolf is a guide to Ronin and minor clans. There are 2 books that deal with the Shadowlands and all the dark, evil stuff in the world of Rokugan like Fu Leng the Dark One ect...<br />
<br />
Don't remember the name of the main book off hand, but it's black, and has a Dragon Samurai surrounded by undead about to whoop a tune with his katana. And that is really the only supplement you need to get started. Edited by: Nenjin Darkeyes at: 8/5/03 11:10 am</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llabak Tharr</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and Paradigm Concepts, the people who wrote the Codex Arcanis that I love so dearly, are writing a L5R book on the Bloodspeakers.  I think it was supposed to be out in June, and wasn't released in time, so I don't know what the scoop on it is.<br />
<br />
Expect a good story (if woeful editing, LOL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The newer clan books basically bring you up to date on events, and give stats for both d20 and old L5R rules.  Good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Diem Erus</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the L5R system.  I'm stuck as GM for our games, since I know the game best, but I always played Dragon before, although I've made NPCs from every clan that I would love to play in a campaign.<br />
<br />
And MARBH, how does that Lion Historian work out?  The rank abilities always seemed pretty useless to me, and that it was basically just a RP thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marbh</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, thats what he did.  Portrayed himself as a military expert and would advise the crabs on tactics (that they promptly ignored).  Had good social skills, and was almost as good a schemer as me.  He sadly died in the middle of the night in the geisha house we were in when his candle caught his room on fire and he didn't wake up.  I was very suprised, as he hadn't drank anything other than a couple sakes, and some special stock I ordered from the hostess for the party.  Oh well, a sad day for us all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the books I recommend (mind you, the older books I have are first edition, but I own the second edition rulebooks. there weren't too many changes, so it's not a big deal):<br />
<br />
legend of the five rings core book (second edition has a samurai with an eyepatch). might be called player's guide.<br />
<br />
legend of the five rings dm guide (good cultural and background info)<br />
<br />
winter court books (kyuden kakita, kyuden asako, not sure what the third is)<br />
<br />
those're good books for a general feel of rokugan, politics, culture, etc. <br />
<br />
all of the d20/original system mix books are based off of second edition, and I don't own any of them so can't say how they are. the OLD clan books are:<br />
<br />
way of the crab/crane/dragon/lion/phoenix/scorpion/unicorn<br />
those books take place in the older timeline, which is about 10 years previous to the current one. the new books are called &quot;secrets of..&quot; and take place in the current one.<br />
<br />
so basically, if you're going to play the original l5r system, which I recommend, just go with the second edition core book, and maybe the gm guide and the first winter court: kyuden kakita. then if your players like the system and gain more interest in specific clans, find some old &quot;way of&quot; or newer &quot;secrets of&quot; books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Diem Erus</div><div class="date">08-05-03, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the d20 are more of a third edition taking place after 2nd.<br />
<br />
First edition (d10) was before the Scorpion Clan Coup and clanwars.<br />
Second (d10) is after the coup and during the clan wars.<br />
Third (d20) is after the wars with Toturi being Emperor, I believe.<br />
<br />
All in all, there's probably 30 years or more between First edition and the D20 system.<br />
I would recommend like everyone else, getting the 2nd edition players guide/GM books, and the first edition Way of the Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, Unicorn, Minor Clans, Wolf, Naga, Ratling, and Shadow I think was ninjas (and the only one I don't have).  The d20 stuff does have conversions to the d10 system, so it's not all bad, but it can be a bit annoying.</div></div><hr />

By far my most favorite setting.  We play with a rather large group for about 12 hours on sundays.  We played over the course of a couple months and actually got to epic levels (boy was that sick).<br />
<br />
Our party was:<br />
<br />
Crane Shugenja/Rebei (i went a little insane from some taint)<br />
Scorpion Courtier/Master Spy (one sneaky little bastard)<br />
Crab Shaman (serious butt-kicker)<br />
Unicorn Samurai (NPC)<br />
Phoenix Shugenja (liked to burn too much)<br />
Dragon Samurai (moron of a player)<br />
Crane Samurai (was insanely quick on attacks)<br />
Ronin Samurai/monk/10 other class (why the dm let him powergame no one knew)<br />
Hare Samurai/BladeDancer (holy crapola could he jump/tumble/run)<br />
Ratling Archer (never saw a better bowsman)<br />
Ratling Shaman (me again)<br />
Shapechanger Wujen (nasty with the spells)<br />
<br />
As you can see we had one of every clan (I somehow missed one though,....).  Quite the strife too between the factions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's particularly irritating in a mechanics-heavy game like shadowrun, where you *have* to pay attention, and where if you haven't played for a long time you're really rusty on rules and everything takes a while to do as-is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3) Sudden death situations where you have to make a split decision or end up kibble.<br />

Sure you'll make some people mad but most will appreciate you keeping them on track.  Gamers who have ADD type playing styles can break the mood with off topic asides and ruin the experience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">08-13-03, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current gaming group has 12 people in it on nights when everyone shows up, but most weeks not everyone does and we usually average around 9 people a week.<br />
<br />
Joy of Joys, I start GMing for them this week.  Pirate era World of Darkness!<br />
<br />
All evil characters too.  I don't have a thing planned for the whole first session because they are gonna spend the whole night killing each other to establish leadership I just know it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Tweil</div><div class="date">08-14-03, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our group hasn been about 13people counting the DM for the last 3 campaigns (year and a half).  The side chatter is annoying same with those people that keep their nose in the book the whole time.  We have one person who always asks &quot;What just happened? Who got hit?  What did he cast?&quot; every single time.  But that campaign was extremely well done and the whole idea of The Thunders reborn was excellent.  Too bad my Ratling Shaman destroyed them all and took over the world =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">08-14-03, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my group, basically we have 2 different types of players.  The hack and slashers, and the intrigue players.  Usually, the hack and slashers just go in the other room and play Street Fighter or something till its time for action while the intriguers do their roleplaying thing that eventually results in a battle being required.<br />
<br />
We've really adapted to the thing.  In fact, its less like roleplaying session and more like just 12 guys getting together and hanging out and having fun.  The game just gives us a reason to all get together every week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_mikebridge</div><div class="date">10-14-03, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm gonna chime in and suggest anything that greg stolze wrote. i betatested the L5R paper game with him as a GM (ironically enough, he goes to my fathers church every sunday, and just finished writing a trilogy of 'demon' books for white wolf), all of his work i've always found to be excellent. my favorite quote from him, when we were escorting a usagi clan member to the shadowlands to reclaim his family sword, when we were entering the crab lands, we were stopped and asked our business, while the PCs conferred, the usagi got impatient and blurted out his 'sacred quest to reclaim his familys sword and honor from the foul monsters of the shadowlands', and the crab guard nodded, signed our papers, and sent us on our way. what he wrote on our papers? reason for entering crab lands: &quot;foolishly heroic&quot;. Brother Talynn Raijinken - Transcendant of the Celestial Fists (65) - Prexus<br />
Iuchiban - Necromancer of Neriak (10) - Prexus<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_TribalGeek</div><div class="date">10-19-03, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't played read one of the actuale books though. Love the setting have the new oriental adventures book. I need to get the one for the actual setting though. No one around here plays dnd so it sucks. I am in love with the cran clan though espiclly their duel style. American by birth.<br />
Southerner by the grace of God.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">10-19-03, 10:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crane were my starting favorite too. I didn't like the clan as much as I did the Kakita dueling school, but my favorite clan now is probably Scorpion   then again, I haven't played l5r in two or three years heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Kanaellars</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The very first time I ever got to play a OA/Lt5R character was, belive it or not, NOT in a OA/Lot5R game.<br />
<br />
I had just recently gotten the books, and I had convinced our current DM to allow me to add an OA character to the existing standard DnD 3e game.<br />
<br />
I played a Dragon Samuri. Litteraly the group walked into an inn one day and when they went to leave I followed them out. Going with the mystery and silence that some of the dragon are so well known for, I never spoke a word. I followed them for about 2 WEEKS and never spoke.<br />
<br />
They tried everything they could to figure out who I was and why I wasnt talking. They tried about 20 languages... etc.<br />
<br />
Finally they got attacked, I stepped in and helped them win, and then shocked them all by speaking. &quot;Well met.&quot; (in Rokuganesse of course).<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
The character was GREAT fun. Later they came to find out that one of them had an item that had once belonged to the founder of the Dragon clan, and I had been sent to protect it until the clan called for it.<br />
<br />
So far, almost two years later (in game time), it has not been called for.<br />
<br />
Our group btw, at current level as of last Saturday:<br />
<br />
20 Human Paladin of Pelor<br />
19 Dragon clan (human) Samuri (ME)<br />
19 Dwarf Fighter<br />
19 Moon Elf Wizardess<br />
19 Gnome Ranger<br />
18 Human Cleric of Elhonna<br />
18 Sun Elf Druid<br />
17 Half-orc Barbarian<br />
16 Half-Elf Bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Matheren</div><div class="date">10-20-03, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">man I'd never be able to play in a group that big :P I remember when ours got up to 9 people a few times, and I hated it.<br />
<br />
I actually had a Phoenix Shugenja (well, he was a fox shifter as well heh) in an adventure, but I was running it so he didn't really count as a character. the next time someone DM's something, assuming it's not Arcana Unearthed, I want to play an &quot;eastern&quot; swordsman that'll take the Iaijutsu Master prestige class.<br />
<br />
If my group that I just started up with about two months ago hadn't recently split up because of lame drama, I might've actually picked up some of the newer l5r/rokugan d20 books, to read if nothing else. but it's a waste of money now that I'm apparently back to no gaming at all.</div></div><hr />
