<br />
- Being kited by a ranged class like bard or ranger? Spam Deter (parry) You'll be able to parry most ranged attacks, and at least buy some time till you catch up, or watch them run into some mobs.<br />
<br />
- Prior to jumping someone with Ravage, i usually do mez dart, get out of combat, heal debuff dart if its a healer, out of combat, quickblade -&gt; vile strike -&gt; ravage, and Knee break as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
- Don't forget Blinding Flash is a good way to regen some endurance on, with the new Clout change it can be nice going Blinding flash -&gt; full end -&gt; clout and crit chain.<br />
<br />
- Casters need to be facing your way when casting a spell, make sure you're as squirmy and annoying as you can be, going out of LoS when they're casting. Also, spamming smoke trick is annoying.<br />
<br />
- WoL might seem like crap, but everything adds up in PvP.<br />
<br />
I've prolly forgotten alot, but this is just a quick compilation to see if we can get some more tips rolling in, remember, knowledge is power :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn, thats a nice one :)<br />
<br />
- Also just to annoy casters, i pop Relentless and spam Smoke trick + Wicked strike, really hard to hit with spells :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinysadrobots</div><div class="date">02-29-08, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">-Make a pvp-specific tool bar, macro explosive flechette onto all your attacks (advanced flechettes work better).  They don't trigger the global cooldown, free 1k dmg per attack.<br />
<br />
-Always have shadowy flechettes up.  Its an extra 7 levels of stealth.<br />
<br />
-Macro snaring flechette on your debuff key (flechette, knee break, ruin, ploy is mine)<br />
<br />
-Macro smoke trick onto your primary button and mash it--often.  Casters don't land spells on me.<br />
<br />
-Spec INT! -- my build is 5/5/4 str/dex/int -- int raises the damage for all your procs and flechettes and can really make a difference.<br />
<br />
-Go spend a few days in Xennu and make yourself a pair of the jump boots. Macro a key that equips them, uses them and then re-equips your normal boots.  (I also have Escape macro'd on to my key so i can use it in PvP).  This is excellent vs some of the more difficult heavy classes (DK's) because when the fight goes long I can often jump on top of something tall and spam ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
-Get a bow +soulsip<br />
<br />
-Get the feral warrior mask and lint bandages, spamable 1k heal in combat is nice</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't know this! How much of a difference are we talking? I have con instead of int now and kind of like the hp but if the int is really worth it...<br />
<br />
Nice tips. Some I didn't know, I'll have to try these :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stolencoins</div><div class="date">03-10-08, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes int helps alot, also make a macro with Exp fletchette at the bottom.. right now my exp fletchette hits for 500 in pvp, i have int gear on though.<br />
 <br />
Wonders<br />
 <br />
It simulates the monks Secret of flames (which casts extra fire dmg on every attack even ranged) But u do go through the exp fletchettes quicly about 8 a fight for me.</div></div><hr />
