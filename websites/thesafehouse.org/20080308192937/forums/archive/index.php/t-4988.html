Looks to me like have a 4-move chain off of evasion (which you do a lot) would be an awesome thing, but damn that's expensive!<br />
<br />
Any thoughts appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I'm currently 46th level, and soloing for xp is only for those who enjoy pain and monotony.  I have taken CS up so far because of the damage increase on PA and CS styles, not really for the actual Evade chain itself.<br />
<br />
It isn't uncommon at all for me to not take any damage on yellow mobs very near my level, but if the dice don't roll my way, I'm dead meat, and I am specced very high in both CS and Weapon. Dither Disgustipated<br />

This is just an educated assumption tho.</div></div><hr />
