<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after tooling around for a while I finally have a character at level 6 (big deal for me) on Victory.  He's a defender with both 'dark' powers.  Anybody know anything about these?  Are they any good for the long haul?  I also messed around with an illusionist and a SS/invulnerable tanker (anyone else think the selection of tanker powers sucks?  They need a 'colossus' metal option and some more non-element options, in my opinion).<br />
<br />
Anyway, before I get too into a guy, I was just curious of what the general makeup of classes is in the game.  I'm guessing there are loads of blasters and scrappers, but I also see alot of controllers.  I haven't grouped with anyone yet so I don't know how the classes work together yet.  What do people need?  I have no interest in a plain old 'healer' kind of class and my dark defender doesn't seem like that so far, but will he eventually get relegated to that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahne</div><div class="date">05-19-04, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The beautiful thing is, just about any combination of characters works well together.  Sure, sometimes you'll have your team say &quot;a healer would be nice&quot;, or &quot;we could use a bit of crows control&quot;, but I've yet to find a group makeup that didn't at least in some way work.  Healers are not nearly as indispensible as they are in DAoC or EQ, at least at the level I've gotten to (16).  They're damn nice, but if you don't have one, you don't have to wait until you can find one before killing anything.<br />
<br />
They've done a really good job on balance.  You can play whatever you like, and you'll be good at something.  t just changes what you're good at and how you go about it.  <br />
<br />
As far as I've heard, the only pure healers are Empathy Defenders, so you don't have to worry about doing nothing but healing at higher levels with the character you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few people out there who do think Defender = Healer, and anything but an Emapthy Defender is worthless.<br />
<br />
These people may not invite you to a pickup group.<br />
<br />
Consider yourself thankful, because they are Morons. Unfortunately as an Empath Defender, I have no such Way to sort the morons out befoe I group with them.<br />
<br />
True Story... I joined a group, and the Leader said &quot;Now that we have a real healer, we don't need these other wannabe healers.&quot; He then kicked out the two defenders that were there before me.<br />
<br />
I Left, Joined with those two and a scrapper from the original group who didn't like that, and we started their own. Saw the first group get wiped out a few mins. later.  :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiden</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on your playstyle they can be very good.<br />
<br />
I messed around with one,and got it to level 8 or 9, before starting over. Did not suit my style, i prefer melee charecter's/rogues.<br />
<br />
here is a link to a thread i found on the coh forums.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info!<br />
<br />
Yeah, whenever I start a new MMORPG it usually takes me forever to decide on a class.  So far the strength of my dark guy seems to be in debuffing.  Once I hit them with some dark powers it's pretty amazing how low their accuracy goes (i can beat large groups of creatures with the debuff who would kick my butt without it).<br />
<br />
Nice story Meddik, I have yet to group with anyone so I haven't really encountered the morons yet.  This game reminds me a LOT of anarchy online so far.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the link Aiden.  Am I right in assuming you have to give up basic and/or primary powers for power pool powers in the end?  I was thinking of going with teleport (fits my character best) but I'm not quite sure.<br />
<br />
The people in that thread don't seem to big on 'darkest night', but in my experience it severly weakens bad guys and makes them much much easier to defeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morvran</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what?  Don't worry as much about what other people think is important or valuable.  Take their advice and ideas about certain powers into consideration, and then make a decision based on your play style or character style.  I have a delema every other level figuring out which power I'm going to choose, and so far I've chosen purely on which power I felt fit my character the best.  No complaints so far.  I think it would be very hard to mess up a character in this game, unless you made something that just completely disagrees with your style of play (ie you solo alot and yet you make a hero that can't hold his own in a fight).<br />
<br />
As for the powers, yeah in the end you sacrifice powers.  I think you'll eventually have 20 powers out of 34 or something like that.  The more power pool stuff you take, the fewer regular attack and defense skills you'll have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you take all your primary and secondary powers you will have room for two pool powers, a travel power and its prereq.<br />
<br />
If you want to take any non-travel pools you will have to give up AT powers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still wonder what will happen when they open the lvl cap up to 50.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that most of us will be able to get the powers we ahd to skip over in 1-40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayan</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah but some powers just suck or you get a better version of it later down the line.  So look ahead and plana bit I always see 1 or 2 that kinda duplicate or just arent worthwhile to me.<br />
<br />
That opens you up to take some power pool things you may have your eye on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still wonder what will happen when they open the lvl cap up to 50.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that most of us will be able to get the powers we ahd to skip over in 1-40.<br />
<br />
Think it gets us 3 more powers.  I'd assume they'd add either a 10th power or else open up a 5th power pool for us to pick from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peebs</div><div class="date">05-20-04, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips all.  For the moment I think I'll mostly be messing around with my dark/dark defender and inv/super strength tanker.  Maybe I'll also start a gravity or illusion controller as well because that sounds pretty fun.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you happen to see Miasmar or Major Muscle, say hello.   :D</div></div><hr />
