There is two versions of this quest, one in freeport and one in neriak. Beeing a dark elf, i can do the one in neriak and get the ring, fleshweavers mark.<br />
I would also like to do the quest that is given in freeport from &quot;Taxonomist Darwin Grisk&quot;. But he wont give it to me, since im dark elf.  My faction is dubiousley with him.  he wont give it to me using illusion halflin either.<br />
<br />
So my question is if anyone have managed to get both the quests? and if so, then how?<br />

<br />
You might want to try an ilusion froglok potion (if they exist) see if that works. Are frogloks considered a good race? What races can you start off with and wander around in their city. I'd try one of those if you can't find a froglok one. <br />
<br />
You might want to try charming him and see if that works as well. hand him the dulak flesh so it's not a big deal if you lose it.<br />

Woulda used illusion dark elf but no one was selling any~</div></div><hr />
