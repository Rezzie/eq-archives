<br />
Viz drew out quite a crowd to all of their panels, and they announced plenty of news to match. For starters, the dub cast of Bleach is as follows:<br />
<br />
Ichigo - Johnny Yong Bosch (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=1283)<br />
Rukia - Michelle Ruff (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=7125)<br />
Isshin - Patrick Seitz (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=7108)<br />
Karin - Kate Higgins (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=20166)<br />
Orihime - Stephanie Sheh (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=3419)<br />
Tatsuki - Wendee Lee (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=1184)<br />
Ishida - Derek Stephen Prince (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=4036)<br />
<br />
Additionally, at their main panel they announced Shokugan No Shana (both the original novel by Yashichiro Takahashi and the manga by Ayato Sasakura), The Cain Saga by Kaori Yuki and the Dragon Drive manga by Ken-ichi Sakura. At their Shojo Beat panel they announced the manga Love Com (aka Lovely Complex) by Aya Nakahara, and they stated that the color printing used on their 1st anniversary issue is a permanent addition to the magazine. Last but not least, at their Shonen Jump panel they announced the Houshin Engi manga by Ryu Fujisaki, and they confirmed that Gintama by Hideaki Sorachi will be serialized in the Shonen Jump magazine. During the main panel's Q&amp;A, it was mentioned that by giving retailers advance information about their mature titles, Viz has had no complaints about content, even in the case of very mature titles like Saikano.<br />

Toon Zone's coverage live from the San Diego Comic-Con will continue throughout the weekend.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Viz really got their **** together when looking for the right VA's. I have hope for this one.</div></div><hr />

Did this start last sat? This is the first time i seen it on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xynn</div><div class="date">09-09-06, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It started last night at 12:30am on CN. You can find the first episode in english split in to 3 parts on a *wink wink nudge nudge* very popular video website.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah ok I didn't think they showed anything on fridays. But its on again tonight so i can catch it that way in better quality :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollon Darkmoon</div><div class="date">09-09-06, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well voice wise...its decent i guess. Altho not the voice I pictured for Ichigo.<br />
<br />
Rukia's voice I can accept.<br />
<br />
Oh Im VERY happy they kept the original OP and ED.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xynn</div><div class="date">09-09-06, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rukia's is the one that both me and my roommate have agreed doesnt fit. We both feel that its too soft. I think Ichigo's works, the translation just isnt that great so it seems kinda wonky at times. I agree on the OP and ED, though I got mad that CN cut in with a stupid GI JOE commerical during the ending.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno...if we base it off the japanese voice of Rukia then ya they needed a stronger voiced type person. But really she is kinda a weak and girly type char...so a soft voice might make sense i dunno.<br />
<br />
I guess thats true about Ichigo's voice i guess the translation just kinda made it odd sounding.<br />
<br />
And ya that little commerical at the end ruined it =/.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruccus</div><div class="date">09-09-06, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recorded it on my computer yesterday;  Checking the time of the opening credits it clocks in at the normal buck and a half of most animes, so unless they added more song I don't think it's any faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah song is the full length it should be. Oh well has been awhile since I seen the old OP/ED.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarthEnder</div><div class="date">09-10-06, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ED is definatly run faster.  Not the song, but I think the video.  The song is simply cut short.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I loved it.  They actually used Zanpaktou.<br />
<br />
It's funny, when the opening before last first came on, I was wondering what the significance of the black butterfly was gonna be.  It had been so long since any souls actually got sent to SS I had completely forgotten that it was already in the show, back in the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tabbran</div><div class="date">09-10-06, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I fell asleep halfway through, but my last thought before unconsciousness was that I was surprised that I didn't completely hate all the voices or the translation.  Unlike when I watched the first episode of Naruto :P</div></div><hr />
