<br />
Here's the one I'm planning for, though its still pretty tentative.  It focuses on using cheapshot, backstab, and cold blood evic (two from prep. if necessary).  <br />

<br />
If your going with sword or mace, open with cheapshot and pound away with ss and quickly generated 5 pt Evis.<br />
<br />
If your going with daggers, open with ambush and pray you dont miss.<br />
<br />
Really if you want to go with a definative pvp I would suggest a 21/4/26 or a 23/2/26 build so that you can get some of those keys like cold blood as well as preperation. <br />
<br />
I personally go with a 23/2/26 build and live on a pvp server (during cb tested it at 60, works great) and am working my way back up to 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh yeah, in pvp speed is more imporatant than MoD so switch your points in camo to 5 and mod to 2....or be like me and put 5 in both.<br />

I'd hardly think so.  Cheapshot, backstab, gouge, backstab, kidney shot, backstab sounds perfectly fine in my book.</div></div><hr />

Actually the VAST majority of rogues do just this...its very intelligent and not inappropriate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reworked and tweaked my build a bit.  Took a point out of Improved Backstab to put in CS to make it 40 energy.  I think it works out pretty well, but feel free to correct me or make suggestions.  <br />
<br />
Also, Tavr, if I use daggers then why should I open with Ambush?  Cheap shot seems like its better than Ambush no matter what kind of weapon I'm using.  I believe I could do more damage in 4 seconds with backstab than with sinister strikes.  Not too sure, but that just what it seems like to me from looking at how people talk of the skills on most forums. <br />
<br />
My technique:<br />
CS -40 energy, 2-3 combo points<br />
BS -60 Energy, 3-4 combo points<br />
Thistle tea back to 100 energy<br />
Gouge -45 energy 4-5 combo points<br />
Wait for 100 energy again<br />
BS -60 energy, 5 combo points definite<br />
Cold Blood, Evis-35<br />
<br />
If they're still pretty healthy at this point then I guess I could blind, vanish, prep and start all over with the combo.  Not sure if the thistle tea would be ready for another use, but I'd imagine that they're pretty low on health by now and that I do without it.<br />
<br />
On another note, I'm actually pretty impressed with how people speak of their PVP experiences with the 23/2/26 build that you use.  I really like how efficient the energy use can be and it sounds like it can score some very decisive kills with the lockdown.  However, I feel like it just takes too much away from your group DPS and the lack of daggers just turns me to it =/ *shrug*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tavr</div><div class="date">12-04-04, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to give you an idea of what I use I figured I would post mine. I like your second build better but I still say, in pvp you want to be moving faster torwards your target. Camo is a must and will be of greater benifit to you at 5 points than Master of Deception will be. Because they are players they will see you the same way with MoD 5 as MoD 2 but with Camo 5 you can get to them before they can do anything about it. <br />
<br />
Thistle tea has a longish cool down timer just remember, as well as its something you have to craft.  If you have  a good build you should not have to depend on it honestly.<br />
<br />
As well as with ambush &amp;lt; cheapshot I agree, but if you cheapshot and then try to bs you have to remember that there is a longer cool down on BS than say Sinister Strike. Thats why using swords or maces comes into play, you get the higher damage on those 5 pt Evis that you will be laying down.<br />
<br />
Usually just Cheapshot, SS, SS, Evis, Coldblood, Evis and if they arnt done by then which is rare, vanish and cheapshot them and lay the smack down again.<br />
<br />
Doing it this way I can 1v1 elites of my same level. <br />
<br />
If you want to see a very good discussion on builds, and one very simpilar to my own look up Yojacks build on the wow forums or the IGN forums. Very good stuff, I've talked with him a bit and while dissagree on small points we have the overall idea the same.<br />
<br />
But anyways, here is my build. Not everyone will agree with it, and that is fine. I am happy with it and I know how to play with it as it fits my style. Just figured I'd show you.<br />

Hem is an instant attack with a debuff; the debuff is nice but the big advantage is that it adds a combo point for 35 Energy.  Hemorrhage, IMO, is not worth using just for the debuff; its primary use is to replace Improved Sinister Strike as your primary damage and CP generator.</div></div><hr />

Open w/ CS.  BS after CS.  At this point it is very possible to have 5 CP before the CS stun fades.  Once they are out, Kidney Shot.  Thistle Tea. BS, BS, Cold Blood.  Evis.<br />
<br />
This was my dueling combo at lvl 50.  Seemed to work well.  This is also a similar variant of the bread and butter Dagger/Assassination build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brogarn</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With that build, ClefairyTorii, I'd drop Initiative, put 1 point into Vigor (you're already at 30 points in assassination, you may as well get it), put 5 points into Camouflage, and the last 2 points into MoD. You'll move at 85% speed while stealthed (which is often more important) and still have an effective stealth level of 61 (each point of MoD gives you 3 points of stealth skill, basically. So 2 points into MoD gives you 6, which makes you level 61 as far as stealth goes. Since this is about fighting other players, that's all you need..).<br />
<br />
Only 3 points into Initiative is going to make that extra CP so rare that it won't be worth it, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClefairyTorii</div><div class="date">12-09-04, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With that build, ClefairyTorii, I'd drop Initiative, put 1 point into Vigor (you're already at 30 points in assassination, you may as well get it), put 5 points into Camouflage, and the last 2 points into MoD.<br />
<br />
3 points in Initiative is a 45% chance to get that extra cp.  I found playing in CB, that 3 points, was just enough to get that extra cp relatively consistantly.  I did however play on the Beta Server, and now on a PvE server so all my pvp experience were only duels.  <br />
<br />
That being said, switching around the Camoflage and the MoD actually sounds like a good idea for PvP environment.<br />
<br />
Lastly, i found Vigor it be lackluster at best, and not worth the point.<br />
Since our energy fills at increments of 20, and nearly all the skills i use cost 60, it doesn't actually help that much.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
110-60 (Cheap Shot)=50<br />
50+20=70 (First Tick)<br />
70-60 (Backstab)=10<br />
10+20 (Second Tick)=30 (Note, still too low for Evis even)<br />
30+20(Third Tick)=50<br />
50-35 (Evis)=15<br />
15+20(Fourth Tick)=35<br />
35+20(Fifth Tick)=55 (And still too low for another BS) <br />
55+20(Sixth Tick)=75<br />
75-60 (Backstab)=15<br />
15+20(7th Tick)=35<br />
35-35 (Evis)=0 (Ching!)<br />
<br />
Basically, due to the skills i find myself using, the extra 10 finally caught up to me at the 7th tick of energy (and only if i got consistant crits on BS, or i would have to wait even longer due to not having the cp for the 2nd Evis), or roughly 14 seconds of combat.  Considering that Thistle Teas reset the whole thing also, i never really found Vigor that helpful.<br />
<br />
Note: While this example is theorycraft i have had extensive use of Vigor in CB. (Up to level 50 at least)  In addition, my math might be wrong, and if it is, any corrections will be greatly appreciated.  Personally, i wouldn't mind adding Vigor to my talent tree if i found out it was crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brogarn</div><div class="date">12-10-04, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair enough. I never tried Vigor so really don't know any better. Just seeing that many points into a line without taking the end of it, seemed wrong. But I've been toying around with different builds and I can see where having that 1 point elsewhere would give you better results than taking the last skill of a tree simply because you can.<br />

<br />
35+20(Fifth Tick)=55 (And still too low for another BS)  &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Big deal, by this time the mob is unstunned.  You have imp gouge, use it.  You can regen enough for a backstab while the mobe is gouged.<br />

55+20(Sixth Tick)=75<br />
<br />

Was a great build to PvE and good in PvP till 55+. <br />
<br />
I play horde and paladins suck PvP no real threat to kill me just had to kill them 3 times, Always took so long someone would walk by and jump in. Fast building CP builds sounded nice but really lack later on with potions, item heals, and natural damage reduction of paladins and warriors. Can't kill people so fast when your 5CP finisher flops and hits for 300 damage. cause they absorb it all. I came across some fast daggers.<br />

At first sight they look weak and fairly low end. I rerolled to a pure assassin build while it lacks in stealth, at 60 it's no matter PvP against other 60s. I had a hard time letting MoD go but I now realize I LIVE without it ya know. Eviscerate is overrated IMHO so I dropped it all and went speed.<br />

Pure melee now open with garrote and hit SS, SS wait for a recharge then rupture most times 4CP sometimes 5cp. (I don't count on getting 25 energy and 1 combo point but if I do it will be used on slice and dice before I vanish.) <br />
<br />
By now they have woken and trying to turn around. I back peddle a bit and vanish if it's a 60 paladin a stun on me and I'm in big trouble. <br />
<br />
no one ever expects it as most all rogue use it as a near death escape. Paladins are below half life at this point. 15+ or so 190+ instant poison have done there work. There is no shield block or damage reducing shield potions for pure poisons. I circle back vanished for 3 charges of energy and rush them with cheapshot. They will likely be trying to cast a heal. blade furry and there near death like 10 - 20% life. If I was full energy when I hit cheapshot, I can get a 5 point Kidney punch on them just .001 seconds before CS wears off and they immune shield. 6 second knock out<br />
is 5.5 seconds more than I need to kill them. slice and dice with the freebie point %50 haste is ownage.<br />
<br />
any other class requires no real tactics garrote, rupture and chase em down it's over. <br />
<br />
Build lacks in dungeons when your required to sap targets and they see ya without MoD but all well I got my dungeon loots already, pure PvP =)<br />
<br />
I also have quite a bit chance to crit armor like 11% or so.<br />
<br />

Was a great build to PvE and good in PvP till 55+. <br />
<br />
I play horde and paladins suck PvP no real threat to kill me just had to kill them 3 times, Always took so long someone would walk by and jump in. Fast building CP builds sounded nice but really lack later on with potions, item heals, and natural damage reduction of paladins and warriors. Can't kill people so fast when your 5CP finisher flops and hits for 300 damage. cause they absorb it all. I came across some fast daggers.<br />

Personally i get coldblood, preperation, and serrated blades, then go high as i can in combat, (of course you also need improved sap, very good, actually lessens the chance the target will dodge yoru you will miss because they're stunned, if they dodge or you miss, dunno if they CAN dodge when stunned, then they stil can't go anywhere for like 35 seconds so no worries.). oh and cus of prep you can use vanish to get in 2 ambushes with 2 cold bloods, not a nice combo to be on the recieving end of, but wait theres more! wow a gouge and backstab too! (keep thistle tea on hand lol)</div></div><hr />
