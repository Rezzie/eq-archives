<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-02-06, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to get a regular group (or two, or five) going for us, basically characters dedicated to being played once or twice a week for Safehouser's to tackle the game's dungeons with, so I'm gonna start off by trying to get a good day of the week that we can get together on. If we get enough interest in this, we can have several nights a week doing this, like with different groups or something.<br />
<br />
So pick a day (or days, go go multiple choice option!) that works best for you, and we can work from there. Since we'll be creating new characters for this, also make a post as to what classes you would want to play, so we can organize somewhat balanced groups.<br />
<br />
Personally, Tuesday nights work best for me, and I'll fill in whatever hole needs filled in the group with my character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you wait until after I vote to tell me this? :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urusai</div><div class="date">03-03-06, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess it depends on what server.  I dont think id want to play on a different server just because im really getting tired of harbor quests.<br />
The guys I typically play with on the weekend either remake their character as soon as they finish waterworks or just want to do harbor quests over and over and over because they are easy.<br />
They think waterworks rewards are so good they want to collect them all.  Its insane.  I ended up just questing with other guildies in the marketplace and such and getting better loot + experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-03-06, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The goal of this is to create characters we use exclusively for this particular night, so no matter what servers all of us picked for our mains, we can still play together =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">03-03-06, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dibs on wizard.  Umm, probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-03-06, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rogue FTW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effsee</div><div class="date">03-05-06, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want wizard, or ranger.. or rogue. Oh who am I kidding I would have to beat 10 people at rock paper scissors to be a rogue. :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-05-06, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as you're not thinking of the Warforged, &quot;I have 800 hit points and am super strong but have no dex, int, or wis.&quot; walks into traps, &quot;there's a trap here... it's disarmed now.&quot; rogue... I might trust you as the rogue, Effsee =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaesin</div><div class="date">03-06-06, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll probably play my barbarian for group night, working on a rogue on the side. :D<br />
<br />
Maybe even my sorcereress...<br />
<br />
Rogue - Jaesin<br />
Sorcereress - Julia<br />
Barbarian - Thalos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalum</div><div class="date">03-06-06, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I could take the pressure of being the rogue in this group.  I feel bad enough when I blow a trap disarm with Coop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-06-06, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Protip on being a trap-rogue: Int and Wis minimum 14, maybe even bump the int up to 16 by sacrificing some points in str con or dex (because cha is already 8 or lower, right? =P). Feat Skill focus: Disable device, and take whatever enhancements will raise your DD skill, and as many of them as you can. Throw in a dash of Rogue Power Boost and use the skill boost for traps you absolutely do not want to crit fail on, and you shouldn't crit fail much, if ever... *cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-06-06, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aaaaand peeking into who voted for what days... Aidden, when did you decide to pick this game up?! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragweed</div><div class="date">03-06-06, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zee goggles, zey do something!   +3 to disable!<br />
<br />
Yay for my goggles!  (I'm up to a +18 mod weeee!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeanninBramblefeet</div><div class="date">03-09-06, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going to leave this poll running for another week, and then hopefully the week following that we will have our first official group night. Starting another thread for classes...</div></div><hr />
