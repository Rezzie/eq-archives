<br />
I have 10 levels to play with and cant decide if I want to make him a ranger or a rogue, as both have pros and cons. The character will most likely start out evil and slowly turn to good. Making the character its self wont be too bad, but I had an idea for a curse and need some help fleshing it out.<br />
<br />
What I want to do is anytime he deals damage to a humanoid creature I'll have to keep track of the amount. Then the next morning he'll wake up with that amount of damage done to himself. The only way to keep this from happening or to heal the damage is to drink ocean water from his home region. I also want him to be magically held from stepping foot on a boat or being in the ocean for more than five minutes at a time. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Baron Zibik Quickfingers<br />

I have served Death for many years. When it finally comes to my turn to meet him, I will hand him my dagger kick him in the jimmy and run like a bat outta hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Swipey</div><div class="date">06-23-03, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The second part, where he is magically held from stepping on a boat or being in the ocean for more than 5 minutes...<br />
<br />
Does that mean that he CAN step on a boat or into the ocean, and only after 5 minutes comes under the effects of a Hold Person type spell?  If so, thats doable.   Having the curse make him deathly afraid of large bodies of water, to the point that he needs to make a will save or go catatonic (or berzerk, or act as if he is under the effects of a confusion type spell) might be more fun, though. <br />
<br />
Or does it mean that, after 5 minutes in one of those conditions, that he is forcibly ejected from it my the power of the curse?  That would be problematic for the GM, as it would basically prevent the character from ever travelling by sea.<br />
<br />
The trick on curses is to have them be inconvenient to the character, but not so much to the GM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think if he tried to step foot on a boat, it be as though a invisible wall kept him from getting on the boat. For the water...yeah either forcibly ejecting him or start taking dmg like an undead takes dmg from holy water. /rubs chin<br />
<br />
Yes part of this was to inconvience the player by not being able to travel by sea (his first love as a pirate was the sea)</div></div><hr />
