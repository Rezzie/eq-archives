<br />
I have both a mid twenties shade and ranger but now I'd like to try out a shadowblade. I've looked over quiet a few posts but I want to know if Left Axe damage is based off of Axe. Reason is Axe has a lot of wasted styles based off parry. If I went Sword / Left Axe would I be a gimp in the LA department?<br />
<br />
I'm looking to create a shadowblade w/ some PvE soloing potential but I'd like to be a major threat in RvR as well. I was thinking of taking CS to 39 to get the PA  -&gt; CD chain and take my LA to 44. I think 44 is what I wanted, can't get catacombs to come up  .<br />
<br />
But back to my main question: Does LA work off of Axe? Would it be worth it to just use Axe and LA and just use the LA styles and use Axe for the base damage increase?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Dragmal</div></div><hr />

Reason being is yer offhand axe will almost always give a + to axe...and if you have a swd as yer main weap, j00 n0 geet da beeneefeets....<br />

  As far as Axe&amp;amp;LA go, the both are geared more towards the Berzerker class... No not the Shadowblade hybrid, the base Berzerker class.  Higher LA has nice dmg but both skills have (alot) of styles that require Parry, Block and other such abilities that we lack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sword determines right hand weapon solely.<br />
<br />
BTW:<br />
<br />
Stealth 35<br />
Sword 40<br />
Left Axe 41<br />
Envenom 29<br />
Critical 21<br />
<br />
Works nicely.</div></div><hr />

Then why are the SZ's training it? I mean if you don't have cs, and the LA styles are better. What beneft would you get other than the detaunt axe style Hoarfrost (no opener)?<br />

And your left axe styles affect only your primary hand damage--not your left axe. Edited by: Lisboa at: 2/20/02 6:23:50 pm</div></div><hr />

<br />
The LEFT axe will give you its + bonus to AXE skill, thus raising your MAIN dmg and dmg done over all. Adding to axe DOES increase the damage done by left axe because it gives it a higher number of base dmg to % by 2. <br />
<br />
Ok, think I nailed it that time.</div></div><hr />

Left axe styles do damage onto your right hand weapon, but if its (+29) to that weapon its +29 whether its a axe or a sword, does not matter.<br />
<br />
Only thing that does seem to matter, is that there seem to be more sweet ass axes in the game at higher levels then there are swords.</div></div><hr />

Hrm, I would say generally the Zerker boards, rogue boards personal experience off whacking greys. where are you seeing the misline in my logic? Or can you only post more nice things like that without backing it up? FYI incase you are perhaps just a tad slow, I am discussing the physical axe in your left hand itself, not the skill. The AXE ITSELF gives a bonus to the axe skill (or in my case, also a +1 to LA) and since all the dmg is divided in half (including axe) the overall dmg is increased.<br />
<br />
You say Toh-MAY-to, <br />
I say yer wrong. Edited by: CroverDaRogue at: 2/23/02 12:02:40 pm</div></div><hr />

They really should make all left axes that give a bonus to a weapon other than axe give it to each weapon type a berseker or shadowblade can wield in their main hand.  It woulnd't overpower anything, but it would give the guys that chose to go sword axe or hammer axe not such a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />
