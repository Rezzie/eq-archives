<br />
For the last week my neck has been really sore. I have slight neck problems but last week they actually got bad. My doctor told me to take my anit inflamtory twice a day instead of as needed. So I try it. It makes me sick. He puts me on a muscle relaxer and steriods. They don't work. Strecthing and massaging dosen't work either. I get an xray today and more meds so I can work. The meds were the ones that didnt work plus the one that made me sick. Needless to say I had to leave early. I will probably have to do physical thearapy to help my neck which I'm not to thrilled with.<br />
<br />
My love life has had it's ups and downs the past year or so. I found my current girlfriend off of bmezine.com. The bad part is she is in north carolina. We connected like immediatly so we are trying the long distance thing with plans to meet this summer. I love her to death and I really do want to see her. Problems? Distance and telling my parents that I am going out with a girl who lives in north carolina and met off a body modification site.<br />
<br />
My brothers  have been themselves through this whole thing. Not real supportive but there if I really needed them. My bro is going out with a girl and tottally wrapped up in her. My youngest is his popular self. I am left with the two things that seem to make them so sucessfull and well liked. They have confidince and an extreem lack of tact. For some reason it works. I have tact and I don't have confidence except for online then I am able to say what I mean. It sucks and everytime I am arround them I am worried that my friends will start likeing them more than me.<br />
<br />
My parents are my parents. My dad is an @#%$, racist, and sexist. I have an extreem lack of respect for him for all the @#%$ I have had to go through and still go through. He constantly says he dosent favor my brothers over me. @#%$ he bought my brother a 98 toyota tacoma while buying me a 94 with power nothing that is a pretty worthless truck. My other brother got a 87 blazer which he loves and is a good truck for it's age. Him and my mom have had marrige problems and are seeing a marggie counciler. It is looking like they may end up divorced which will suck badly. My mom is probably the only stable thing in my life. She is always there for me even if she can't help she is willing to talk to me about anything. I have a 3 year old sister and I know this is going to be the hardest for her. I just don't know what I am gonna do anymore.<br />
<br />
My health is failing me, my job sucks, and my parents may be divorced soon. Nothing is going right but for some reason I am able to keep going.<br />

Chiropractor. Find one in your area, I recomend one from Palmer. It's one of the best schools in the country. They should have a link on there to find one in your area.</div></div><hr />

I hated when I had to go (3 times a week for months) after a rotator cuff injury in an accident. But.. I don't know if you'll have anywhere near the same exp, but I had always had occasional problems with the left side of my neck. Every so often, it would get all tight and hurt for a few days at a time, and be incredibly hard to move my head. After PT (for that shoulder), It's been great. Only once has the pain recurred since being released, and even then it was nowhere near the intensity. I never would have thought to seek treatment if I wasn't forced into it by additional injury, but I'm oh so glad it happened.<br />

BMEZine: You don't have to elaborate as to where online you met. I mean, I know there's a stigma in explaining to that generation that you met online at all, but if that element makes it more uncomfortable for you, you don't have to go into that much detail. Not to claim the status of a &quot;real professional&quot; in any one endeavor has been a small price to pay for the many benefits and pleasures of trespassing. ~Leo Lionni</div></div><hr />

You didn't say where you lived, but I'm presuming it's at least in the south  <br />
<br />
Long distance relationships typically don't work until you are on your own, and have a good enough job to be able to make frequent visits. Which sucks. There have been several potential relationships I would have explored if people were closer, but spending years in an online only relationship isn't realistic. And it hurts brutally bad to be madly in love with someone you can't touch. And cybersex is messy and gets old quickly.<br />

Parts of the body don't just randomly stop working. I mean, they do, but there's a better definition for it than &quot;just crapped out on you.&quot; What's with the neck? Pulled muscle? Spinal/neck deformation? Dislocated rib or shoulder? Dislocated skull (it happens and @#%$ hurts)? Do they even know?<br />
<br />
Your dad sucks, agreed. Your mom has managed to stick it out through 3 grown/soon to be grown boys and given birth to another child. That's pretty rough. If your father is especially favoritist and sexist, your sister might even be better off without him. Sensei Pren{Dragon Army}[Tribunal Server]<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Prenn</div><div class="date">10-21-03, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it's an old injury seriously acting up? That's most unfortunate, sorry to hear it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are pros and cons to meeting people on the internet. It's easy to intentionally mislead, and some people do it through unintentional vagueness. But it's not like people don't become insanely infatuated with people at first sight in real life, and that easy sex and empty words don't cause people to do weird things as well. And while the whole physical thing is utterly vital to a relationship, sometimes it's best to get through the awkward opening phase with clear-cut words.<br />
<br />
You just have to know what you're doing, like any situation. I spoke negatively in my first post, just because of the age group I presume Tribal to be in (Mine, I am 17, soon to be 18.) There's entirely too much to worry about around this age without worrying about supporting a serious relationship (long distance relationships must be serious, or there's no point), a long distance one at that.<br />
<br />
I've spent the last 6 years listening to and watching people involved in net relationships and those that crossed to real life. Some have gone beautifully. Some lasted 5+ years, though ended poorly (that's better than most rl originating relationships, though.) Several ended in marriage. Several broke up marriages. A great many are pipedreams of lonely souls. But then, it's not like the vast majority of any romantic relationships work out.<br />
<br />
I wish Tribal the best, and hope that she's everything he wants her to be. I've been close to his shoes before. Just wanting to remind him to keep a clear head of things.<br />

As for the rest. <br />
You have a job, be glad.<br />
You have a car that you didn't have to pay for, aww gee that sucks.<br />
You have a relationship with someone you like.<br />
You have good health except for the neck(which is only painful for now and seems tempoary if PT works out), you can use all of your body like a normal human being.<br />

<br />
Not to flame or piss off or anything but how can you call that 'going out'? I have a girlfriend who I see a few times a week and all we do is maybe watch a movie and have sex. We tell people we're going out but I don't really consider us going out because we don't go out. I'm 19 so there's no generation gap here; I understand the whole internet thing. How you can be in love with someone you've never met?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Vorax S</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious but you seem to think that people have to meet in person to get to know each other. I'm not sure why you think that. I mean yeah sure some people act differnt face to face but not always. I mean when most people fall in love it's not because of any physical. It is usually a persons personality, interests, goals, and stuff like that that people fall in love with. Now there are some people who claim to fall in love with the physical side but anyone with a brain calls that lust not love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragynphyre</div><div class="date">10-22-03, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tribal, you state that you have trouble being confident in yourself except over the internet.  That's common.  However, it gives the person on the other end a false sense of who YOU are.  <br />
<br />
There were many times in college that I'd be chatting in the computer lab late night (mind you, this is in '93, before AIM and ) with someone in one of the other computer labs, and there'd be some interest between us.  So... we'd go meet at the student center or something, and the guy would wind up being so shy and quiet (which is totally the opposite from me, can you tell??) but they were very outgoing over the internet... which is what I was attracted to initially.  Needless to state, I didn't go on any 2nd dates with these guys.<br />
<br />
I did wind up meeting my significant other via the internet (via EQ to be precise), but I didn't really consider him my boyfriend until the second time we got together RL, 2 weeks after we first met RL.  (We've been together a year and a half now, incidentally.)  First time could have been a fluke, a one night stand.  Once we met the second time, we knew we wanted to be together for a long time.<br />
<br />
Our case is a bit different than yours though Tribal, because we probably wouldn't have gotten as friendly with each other in-game or on the phone if it hadn't been for the incredible luck that we found out early on that we live only an hour away from each other in the same state.

One of the probelms I have had with my dad for the longest time is that he has always liked my other two brothers more. He does stuff with them. Gives them money all the time. Buys em better stuff. I waited a year to get that truck. I didn't even pick it out. Both of my brothers had their trucks by the time they turned 16 and both picked theirs out. It really does seem like something stupid to get upset over it just keeps proving everything that I have problems with my dad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the girlfriend thing. Yeah we may not have met but I know I didn't just talk to her because of the way she looks. I talk toher on the phone all the time. Atleast once a night if not more. We cnsider ourselves going out but we won't know for sure if things are gonna work out for sure untill we meet. That's the big step. American by birth.<br />

<br />
You're also pretty much the middle child, as your sister is so much younger.  Your older brother gets status just for being the firstborn, and your younger brother gets status for being 'the baby'.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I wouldn't go through life looking for this man's approval. I think it would mean pretending to be someone you're not to get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your dad might like spending time/buying stuff for your other brother because they jump in those conversations with him, while you prolly look down about it. <br />

It wasn't given to me or bought for me. And the father caring more about your brothers, well it may be true but worrying about it and stuff isn't going to change things. Sounds like your having a hard time dealing with it. I mean you say on one hand that you have no respect for him because of his views on certin subjects (which is understandable) but on the other hand you are worrying about him &quot;loving&quot; your other siblings more then you. If you truely have no respect for him why do you care how much he &quot;loves&quot; you? I don't know but it may be weird but usually if I don't respect someone I defiently don't care how they feel about me.</div></div><hr />
