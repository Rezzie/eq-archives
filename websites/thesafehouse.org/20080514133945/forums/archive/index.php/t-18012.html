<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shmoozneak</div><div class="date">03-25-05, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using one called YALP which evidently stands for &quot;Yet Another Log Parser.&quot;  I don't know if it is one of the better ones or not, but I gather some of the other folks here use it because I found it when some of them suggested it in one of the previous threads on this subject. <br />

Eqcompanion is good for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you want to parse one single mob for a raid then use yalp.<br />
<br />
if you want to parse xp groups consisting of 100+ mobs use eq companion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Total Damage / Total time actually fighting (from the first time attack on is hit til the mob is dead.)<br />
<br />
Anyway -- as has been stated, YALP is fairly good for raids. It accounts (or does it's best to) for caster damage, which has always been a problem for parsers. EQCompanion is definately better if you want an overall DPS average over a long period of time. Why? It's easier to setup long term comparisons -- YALP only allows it done by-mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solesk</div><div class="date">04-02-05, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've noticed a couple bugs with yalp. the first can cause incorrect numbers.<br />
<br />
if you parse a fight in real time using yalp using the monitor feature on a fight with adds yalp will total only the boss numbers, and ignore the adds.  however if you then load that same log from a file to parse after the fact it will include the damage from the adds into the boss fight parse.  eq companion does this every fight regardless. that's why i always parse yalp in real time and post the results from there. as doing it after the fact will not give the damage totals i'm looking for.<br />
<br />
also with yalp, odd little bug. if you parse in real time the fight time starts when you, the parser, attacks, however it still records and calculates the damage from others before you start attacking.  you'd think this would skew the results as they'd have higher damage than actual fight time. but it doesnt. reloading the parse after the fight shows the correct times but still has the same dps and total damage numbers.  the only number that changes is the parser's adjusted dps.  but seeing as most dont post that number it hardly matters.</div></div><hr />

I dont know for sure, but I'd guess it just counts the number of swings within the same second, might be more info on that on the websites.</div></div><hr />

I notized some Errors, but cant really point where they come from.<br />
For example Damage going to the wrong Player.  I love doing a Wizard Crit, but the difference to my usal Damage is quite obvious.<br />
Then there is at least a Bardsong Funeral something wich produces different Numbers between the crit Message and the xyz hit mob for n Damage.<br />

Sadly those parsers arent updated.</div></div><hr />

I believe with with self parses they're identical. It's when you're parsing everyone that the difference comes in. <br />
<br />
With Yalp, the parsing doesn't start till you hit the mob. EQ companion starts when the first person hits the mob (I think).<br />
<br />
I like both but when using Yalp I always try to attack early cause I don't want to miss rogues opening damage. Would suck to miss a 7k+ opening BS just cause I didn't atk before, especially on burn fights when you try to accumulate ever bit of DPS possible.</div></div><hr />

EQC seems best after turning time of inactivity to like 120 sec</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are incorrect. If I understand Yalp correctly when I look at the parses, fight duration can often be displayed as different for each individual. That would indicate to me that the parser is picking each person's first hit regardless of when you hit or even if you hit the mob. Furthermore, I can get the same numbers for Facundo from my bot's log when I duo and then parse on Yalp.<br />

<br />
EQC will show different fight durations for each person, but will start logging the fight under the mob name after the first person hits it.  <br />
<br />
The DPS calculation for each person is based on their active combat duration, not the overall event time.<br />
<br />
So yes, it starts a timer when the first person hits, but it will use each person's timer to calculate their DPS.</div></div><hr />

If you tweak it some, it works real well. (ommit &quot;parsing&quot; of everything except the FIGHTs themself)<br />
<br />
Although it (EQC) is a pig (memory/cpu wise) on raid mobs with MANY people dpsing..and I've actually had it crash..</div></div><hr />

By far the easiest to use. just turn on log and load parser and boom it does everything for you. Oh and make sure you have sound on cause it tells you your dps by voice so there is no looking at a parser screen. just go to www.eqwatcher.com</div></div><hr />
