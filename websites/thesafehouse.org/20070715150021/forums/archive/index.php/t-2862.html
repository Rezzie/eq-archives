1. What you should know before starting.<br />
For good maps of both Upper and Lower Guk, EQAtlas.com is a good place to start.   Specifically, Upper Guk and Lower Guk are handy to have printed out.  I suggest you get these maps, print them out and follow the guide through with them, marking your path so you can easily find your way.  The maps look pretty good even when printed in Black and White (Greyscale).  The spawn you are looking for is 'a ghoul assassin' that spawns in the Supply Room, also called the ass/supp spawn, on the maps the area is marked as '19'.  The mask you are looking for is his common drop, the Serrated Bone Dirk (8dmg/27dly Pierce, Effect:Engulfing Darkness(Snare/DOT), Rog Only) is his rare.  He has place holders, so it can take a while to spawn.  Before going you should maybe put all your stuff in the bank, if you die down here you may not get your body back.  At anywhere less then 25 be very careful as if you are trained you have very little chance of making it out alive.  If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask.<br />
<br />
PART I<br />
2. Getting to Lower Guk Dead Side<br />
You should enter lower guk by the dead side entrance, this can be found if you follow the right wall all the way from the innothule zone to a lower guk zone.  This is generally right as there are a few spots you can skip and will want to.  The only thing on the way you should run into that can see through your hide/sneak is the large and giant heart spiders.  These are rare spawns and while going thru the spider rooms (you will know them when you see them) you can stick to the left wall to aviod them (even thou these spawns are likely camped or dead)  Normal heart spiders can be snuck upon.  After the spider room stick back to the right wall you will enter the scryre room, just stay on the lower level and take an exit behind the left water pillar, head down the ramp here and you will enter a room with stone walls and pillars, head to straight away from the ramp to the second section and along it to the left (you can continue to follow the right wall but you will hit a secret wall, just follow this secret wall as thou it were solid)  Continue allong the right wall, you will pass a turn off to the left, keep going straight, you will slide down a slippery section, and at the end it will open into high bluffs over a watery area, carefully go over this area following the right edge.  Continue following the right wall until you turn into a hall off from the main one you were just following, there should be a stone just before the turn and a flaming pot in the hall, this flaming pot is just opposite the dead side zone to lower guk.<br />
<br />
3. Preparations in Lower Guk<br />
When you get into lower guk ask immediately if the bedroom is camped as well as the assassin spawn, if the bedroom isn't you might have to go out and get a SoW, or get an invis to undead before proceeding.  The reason is that you will run into some water and unless you swim fast you won't make it under the water sneaking (You will need a swimming skill of 85+ to sneak swim through the water without drowning.).  Ok, now be careful, there are both undead and living things near the zone.  More often then not they will be cleared out.<br />
<br />
4. Getting to the Bed Room (BR)<br />
Now proceed down the dead side ramp and when you come to the end turn to your right, proceed down another ramp (if you go left it will be a slippery ramp and you will want to go back)  You will turn a gentle corner and come to a river, swim under it and head to the right, you will agian turn a gentle corner then a sharp corner (this will be a 180 degree turn) before you come up, to the left will be the area called the Bed Room(BR), if it isn't camped or cleared there will be ghouls here, so don't jump out of the water unless you have a way by them (itu or sneak/hide).<br />
<br />
5. Going through the BR, Spider Room, and getting by the GIBs.<br />
Once in the room there will be two halls leading over the underwater passage you just came though.  It is best to hide here but if you try while ghouls are in the room and only have itu you will become visible.  Once you are hidden (or if you wanna try going with itu) go thru the left hall, that is the one nearest the water.  At the end of this hall is the spider/bat room.  The spiders and bats can't see thru my invis but it is unknown to me if it is level based, if you hug the left wall and move quick thou they won't see you.  Now you are in another hall, head down it aways and once you start turning hug the right wall.  To your left you will see a room full of about 5 greater ice boned skeletons.  Hugging the right wall they won't see you but they don't see my sneak/hide.  Just move quick.<br />
<br />
6. The Bridge and Dead Tower<br />
Now you will come to a left turn that will mount some stairs and open  into a bridge with a large tower in front of you, to your right are gargoyles, they see everything but magic invis.  On the other side of the chasm to the left is a ledge where the ghoul ritualist spawns, head straight across this area (careful not to fall, i would not suggest drinking before starting this endevor) and into that tower you see (this should not be confused with the live tower and it is more commonly refered to as the bridge area or dead tower)  Once you enter the tower head through it into a room behind it and turn left, follow a hall way straight to a ladder, this ladder leads into the Store Room (SR, somtimes called the ass(assin), supp(lier) or ass/supp)<br />
<br />
7. Inside the Store Room (SR,ass/supp)<br />
This is where the ghoul assassin spawns along with the ghoul supplier.  Now be very careful, if there isn't a group at the camp because the assassin can see thru rogue hide (although sneak will work on him as long as you are behind him of course).  Now ask the group there if you can loot the next Mask of Deception,  If there is already someone in the group or one that got there before you waiting then graciously allow them the first loot and they will allow you a subsequent mask loot.  At this point you have two options, you can wait until you mask drops or you can ask a member of the group there if they will tell your alternate when one drops and you can go play him until the call, with the latter way thou you may get in trouble if the group evac's, leaves or you take to long and someone else gets the mask.  It can take several hours for the assassin to spawn and drop a mask, so patience is a virtue here.<br />
<br />
8. Getting Out<br />
Getting out can be just as dangerous as getting in, if someone in the group at the ass spawn is nice they might evac you to SRo or NRo/WC but don't think they have to.  If not you will have to reverse the aformentioned process and go back the same way you came.  If you are leaving via the dead side you can take the water exit, but if your swimming is bad it will be a long and hard swim, at least you will get practice.  I am not going to detail this way as it is longer and generally striaght forward.  If you look at the maps you should figure it out.<br />
<br />
PART II<br />
2. Getting to Lower Guk Live Side<br />
This part is only really effective if you are non-KoS to frogs, If you are  KoS I suggest you do the dead side method instead as this is basically just a little safer and slightly faster to duplicate.<br />
Follow the same directions as in Part I, Step 2 to get to the lower guk dead side zone, but instead of taking the side hall to dead zone continue straight down the hall Into a room, take the other exit out of this room and take your &lt;U&gt;second&lt;/U&gt; right, you will turn into a resevior area, take the wood bridge and then take the next plank directly right of you.  Follow the right wall until you come to a large open area.  Now follow the shore line to the wall and follow the wall to another plank room, take the double plank across and then take your left this time.  This will lead to the live side zone.<br />
<br />
3. Getting to the Patriarch spawn<br />
Note that if you are KoS by living frogloks then STOP right now and go back to the dead side zone and go that method, this ways is &lt;U&gt;only&lt;/U&gt; safe of you are non-KoS.  I can't stress this enough.<br />
The patriarch is one of the mobs in live side that sees invisible, and if you are taking this route you won't need to sneak, just start running on in, the only thing that would be trained that might attack you is the evil eye, anything else would go to the dead side zone or the king's back door zone.  Now head straight down the ramp, straight down the hall, across a bridge and follow the hall straight (stick to the right side, you will hit a false wall but it has a solid wall right behind it).  Now you will pass one turnoff to the left, then will make a sharp left turn into room with three exits, This is where the minotuar patriarch spawns, he casts see invis and wanders.<br />
<br />
4. Getting to the Elder spawn<br />
Continue to follow the right wall out the right exit of the three way exit room.  You very shortly come to another intersenction, one path goes left, one right and another does a U-turn back on the other side of a wall.  Take the &lt;U&gt;left&lt;/U&gt;.  Once you have taken the left follow the right wall again past two left turns and follow it through another for exit room, you will take a dip under upper cave that you can see a bit of through a crack and after that take your first left.  Once you take the left take a right and follow the hall past a right turn and into a room, this room has a pit over on the other side of it where the minotuar elder spawns, it also cast's see invis.<br />
<br />
5. Getting to the Bridge<br />
Follow the right wall though this room and stop before going down the hall, now read this first until i tell you to continue.  There is a pit trap down this hall, if you are to young to have safe fall it might do you some nasty damage as well as annoy you.  If you are KoS and haven't yet been seen and you fall down this you might die here, you won't be able to make it up the ladder with sneak on, it has to be removed.  Now to see this pit trap look for a red mark on the left wall, this mark indicates where the hole is, take a run at it and jump, you should make it easily, if not climb up the pit into the room behind you and try, try again.  Ok continue down the hall, through a small room and to the left up some ramps to a ladder, climb the ladder into a small round room.  Now just outside this room is where it gets deadly, there are gargoyles out there and they won't like you regardless of faction, race, or religion.  They are living and see invis to undead and they also see hide/sneak, I think thou that regular invis will get you by them.  Otherwise you will have to call on someone to pull the gargoyles (many like to since they aren't to tough and drop eyes that sell for 9pp).<br />
<br />
6. The Bridge and Dead Tower<br />
Once they are pulled put on sneak/hide and head out, go to the right and you will come to the bridge/undead tower, From here on out you can follow the dead side directions from the same number, just be aware you are entering the tower from a different way and will have to turn to your right on the bridge.  It should be easy to understand when you get there.<br />
<br />
Good Luck getting your mask.<br />
