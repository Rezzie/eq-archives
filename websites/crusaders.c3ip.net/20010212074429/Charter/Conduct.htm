<h2 align="center"><b><font color="#FF0000">Code of Conduct</font></b></h2>
<p><br>
<br>
<font size="3">
 Members will treat others as they would wish others to treat them.&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 Guild members will offer aid to other adventurers who may need it, and will provide aid if it is
requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 The helping of new players will be left to the discretion of the members involved. This will be encouraged but not
required. Guild members are encouraged to give aid to younger guild members, but not at the expense of learning
and normal progression on the part of the younger member.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Members will be obliged to uphold the basic goodness on this server. If a PC is picking on or disrupting
a PC character, regardless of alignment, every effort should be made to protect the offended party. The reasoning is
that every criminal deserves a trial before punishment.&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 Obey the rules of the game - Play the game by its rules. Do not exploit bugs, do not use
cheats.<br>
 <br>
                              Use proper etiquette - We want people to role-play, we want people                              to have fun. Things like
kill-stealing do not increase the fun of the                              game. Please use good judgement and follow the
etiquette of the                              game.&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 Protect guild information - Do not distribute information gained from                              the guild to non-guild members unless given permission. This includes                              information about the game and information about other people in the                              guild.&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
 Protect your guildmates - If you see someone bearing the name of                              our guild and that person is in trouble, please lend a hand and save                              their life.<br>
 <br>
                              Free binding - For those guild members who have achieved the ability                              to bind people, please bind guild members for free. You can expect the                              same in return.&nbsp;<br>
 <br>
Prices -&nbsp; We ask that you sell your goods to other guild members at cost
plus a reasonable percentage. We would also ask                              you
 try not to compete directly with other guild members when selling                              wares. We want the world to feel that buying from a guild member                              ensures quality and a fair price. Remember that you represent the guild                              in these matters.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p><font size="3">Whining - Everyone has a bad time or experience now and then.&nbsp;
This is to be expected due to the nature of the game.&nbsp; Letting other's know about your experience is normal.
However, constant abuse of /guildsay about every little thing that is bothering you,
may be considered abuse of /guildsay.&nbsp; Please be considerate of others and
realize that constant complaining is not enjoyable to others.&nbsp; If you are
asked to stop complaining so much, realize that people have complained about
your behavior.&nbsp; We will take actions to help correct poor /guildsay
behavior before punishment or banishment is discussed.<br>
<br>
The Flaming Blade of Truth&nbsp; requires that its members' reputations be beyond reproach.&nbsp;
We do not tolerate kill stealing, the use of profanity, or the intentional                             harassment of others. All members must
recognize that everything they do                              reflects either positively or negatively on
everyone else in the guild.<br>
<br>
We want to encourage grouping with other members of the guild as much as possible.
When camping for specific items, try to have a pre-planed loot order or agreement on how it will be shared and divided.&nbsp;
This will avoid arguments and confusion later on when that rare item finally drops.<br>
<br>
Above all, HAVE FUN. Try to remember that it is just a game and have a good time with the friends that you make online.
