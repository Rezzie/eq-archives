<p>New Guild Raid Idea !<br>
<br>
We will still have 'normal' guild raids on a dungeon like we have had in the past.  They can be fun for
those that can make it...<br>
<br>
but what about those that can't ?<br>
<br>
This idea might help solve that problem. Everybody likes to have fun in the game, and along that point,
it is very satisfying to get that long sought after item.  Many folks want the same item, and some folks want items to either finish quests, or
just do a quest for an item. What we want to do is give everyone a shot at getting the item(s) that they want to have, or help with a quest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There will be several steps, but they are painless.<br>
<br>
(1)  We need everyone to post on the message board what they want.<br>
<br>
(2)  Once we get people responding to this, people will be chosen at random and we will devote a day/time when we can get a party
together and help get this item / quest.  This will be for primary characters only getting
an item / quest within their level / abilities.  We do not want this to turn into TWINKQUEST.  If someone asks for something that they think is fair, but
we do not, they will be approached and we can talk about it.  Every request will be handled on a case by case basis.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(3) It will usually be up to the person involved to do most of the leg work for the quest / item stuff.
This will involve doing some research on the zone that it is in, maps for the
zone, the baddie(s) involved, how RARE they may be, and any other information that
might be important (Faction hits??).&nbsp; Once this is submitted, it will be reviewed and a time and day will be set.<br>
<br>
(4) The time and day will be announced.  If possible, everyone will be invited to attend.  Some things it
might not be practical or possible to bring along certain levels or a lot of people.  Common sense should be used. Also, keep in mind that
someone may be camping an item so we may need to reschedule if needed.<br>
<br>
(5) If more that one person picks something (maybe golden efrettie boots for example) we will try to
get everyone who wants that item together at the same time for the same raid.<br>
<br>
* Once a person is chosen and we successfully finish what they set out to accomplish, they will have to
wait at least a month before another request will be considered, BUT they are welcome to come along on other raids and help out.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
That's about it on this.  Below are some examples of what might and might not be considered.<br>
<br>
Good - Raid on efrettie boots.  Many folks would like a shot at this item. While it is a difficult break in, it can be done.<br>
<br>
Bad - FBSS.  This camp always has a list that takes several hours to get on.<br>
<br>
Good - Haste Item.    There is a haste belt that is NO DROP that drops over in ROK.  With more information, several people or the entire
guild could pop over and kick a lot of butt and get several !<br>
<br>
Bad - Power level me to XX.  Sorry, requests of this nature will not be considered at all.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I hope that this will be a good idea and we get some good turnouts.   Please pop on to the message board and let us know what you think!<br>
