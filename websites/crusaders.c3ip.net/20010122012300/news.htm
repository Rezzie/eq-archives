<p><img border="0" src="images/pulsar2.gif" width="36" height="36">The Flaming
Blade of Truth guild has merged with the Healers of Norrath guild to form one
larger and more versatile guild.&nbsp; You can access their web site by using
this link: <a href="http://hon.museek.com" target="_top">Healers of Norrath</a>.&nbsp;
We are still working on details on their website and hope that it will be
updated in the near future.&nbsp; This site will have very few if any updates
from now on.&nbsp; The message board will remain up for those that wish to use
it or please have a look at the <a href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/bhealersofnorrath" target="_top">Healers
of Norrath Message Board</a>.

<p>I am having
some rather serious issues with the At Home Cable Modem service that I
have.&nbsp; Due to this I may not be able to keep this page updated as much I as
want, until I can get my new DSL service up and running.&nbsp; I have updated
the Members page with the latest updates that I have received so please check
them out and don't forget to collect those great screen captures while we are in
the game.&nbsp; Hope to see you soon.

<p><b><i>10.01.2000</i></b>

<p>I am finally
back and have made a few updates to the web site.&nbsp; I have added a new
banner up top that was sent to me as well as a few new screen shots in the <a href="gallery/gallery.htm" target="Main">Photo Gallery</a>.&nbsp;
I have also made an update or two to the Members pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;
