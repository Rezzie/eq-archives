*Important System Configuration Announcement*<br>
<br>
As many of you know, over the past couple of months we've made numerous enhancements to the EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and other changes of that nature, we've enhanced the UI itself to allow moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time we've been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the EverQuest client.<br>
<br>
For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 5.2.<br>
<br>
This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:<br>
<br>
- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)<br>
- Gamma Correction working in D3D&nbsp;<br>
- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D&nbsp;<br>
- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and look pretty bad)&nbsp;<br>
- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to look better.<br>
<br>
Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of DirectX outweigh the potential problems.<br>
<br>
We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX from http://www.microsoft.com/directx if it is needed.<br>
<br>
Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information regarding the planned implementation of DX7.<br>

<br>
*Epic Quests*<br>
<br>
Due to some difficulties regarding the Epic Quests implemented two patches ago, the epic quests for the Monk, Wizard, and Druid will not be completable until the next patch.  While we would like to have implemented updates right away for these issues, we are mid-way in our conversion to support the DirectX changes that have been announced.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience.<br>

*Today's Patch*<br>
<br>
Today's patch consisted mostly of server-side changes, additions, and fixes regarding NPCs and quests. The only item of public note is that the Ragebringer can no longer be equipped in the ranged slot.  A data entry error caused it to be initially allowed it to be equipped in that slot.<br>

*Server Split to Drinal*<br>
<br>
Accounts on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare will be moved to the Drinal server following the patch tomorrow.  The source-servers, along with Drinal, will remain down for a period of time following the completion of the patch in order to allow the split to take place.<br>
<br>
Players should be sure to recover their corpses prior to logging off tonight, as corpses will not be duplicated on Drinal.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
***Patch Day***<br>
<br>
As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions to the game.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
*New Epic Quests*<br>
<br>
We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" style quests for every class in the game (including paladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br>
<br>
Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br>
<br>
*Class Issues*<br>
<br>
Rangers:<br>
<br>
Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all melee-centric classes.  In the course of these tests we determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the following changes:<br>
<br>
- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>
- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br>
<br>
Monks:<br>
<br>
High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty.  The additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br>
<br>
Cleric:<br>
<br>
Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration.  We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br>
<br>
After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
*Fungal Regrowth*<br>
<br>
"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell.  It was being used as an offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target.  Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern.  The spell was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Attack Speed Buffs*<br>
<br>
In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual component.  This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" equipment and spells.  The downside to this is that those who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br>
<br>
<br>
*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<br>
<br>
Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address disparities in risk and reward.  For the most part, the quality of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the "rares" from Sebilis.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<br>
<br>
In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand.  Included in this change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip.  The delay on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br>
<br>
In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified.  The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Server Selection Screen*<br>
<br>
It has come to our attention that new players often think that the high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else is there, it must be a good server.  However, in Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay.  Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in "green" in the server selection window.  The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Custom Emotes and AFK*<br>
<br>
Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. For instance:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK.  Type "/AFK &lt;message>" (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message.  For instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with "Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Skill Gain*<br>
<br>
The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats.  This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Trade Skills Enhanced*<br>
<br>
Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things to be discovered once in game.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented.  Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Baking<br>
- Blacksmithing<br>
- Brewing<br>
- Jewelcraft<br>
- Tailoring<br>
- Fletching<br>
- Pottery&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200.  Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering.  Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project.  Further enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br>

*Velious Launch Party and Real-Life Events*<br>
<br>
There are two real life events coming up for EQ fans!<br>
<br>
First, on November 4-5, you are invited to attend the Velious Launch Party in Las Vegas! There, you can meet other players, the Velious Development Team, and have a chance to play on the new Velious continent before it is released! You can also win great prizes, including signed copies of the expansion pack (to be shipped when it is shipped to the retailers).<br>
<br>
Also announced is the next Real Life event. The EQ Fan Faire will be held in February in a yet to be determined East Coast city. Check out the site to cast your vote for our destination!&nbsp;<br>

*Guild Maintenance*<br>
<br>
We are in the process of preparing to do maintenance on the guild database.  To that end, guild creation and activation will be on hold for the next three weeks.  After that time, we may be running a process to remove inactive or under-subscribed guilds from the system.  We would ask and recommend that those in guilds with under 10 separate members (on separate accounts) consider merging and deleting the under-subscribed guild.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In addition, it's apparently become common practice for people wishing to register a guild to enter the chat server and advertise there for help creating the guild.  This will no longer be permitted.  People wishing to submit a guild must organize prior to entering the chat server.  Advertising for assistance within the chat server could result in a short-term (24 hour) suspension for the account.<br>

<br>
*Level 1 Character Purge*<br>
<br>
We've decided to postpone the previously announced purging of level 1 characters that had not been played in the past 30 days.  Should we reschedule this process in the future, we will again give fair warning prior to implementing the purge.<br>
<br>
*Today's Changes*<br>
<br>
Today's patch consists mostly of content changes within EverQuest, such as new quests, corrections to existing NPC texts, and adjustments to spawn times associated with quest NPCs and other NPCs in general.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
- /help will now display emotes, guild commands, and normal commands separately.<br>
- /sit will cause your character to sit.  "/sit off" will cause your character to stand.<br>
- "/cast #" (where # is 1 to 8) will cast the spell memorized in the corresponding slot.<br>
- "/book #" (where # is the even displayed page number divided by 2) will take you to the corresponding page of your spell book. For instance, to flip to page 27/28, type "/book 14".<br>
- "/doability #" (where # is 1 to 10) will fire the specified ability.  Abilities 1-6 are those that are set on the "Abilities" page; Numbers 7-10 represent those that are set on the "Combat Skills" page.<br>
- /whotarget can be typed to do a /who on the targeted PC.<br>
- "/language #" (where # is a number corresponding to the desired language) selects the chat language to use in general communication.<br>
- "/language help" displays a list of available languages and their corresponding number.  "/language" alone displays the current language.<br>
- /meditate causes you to sit down, open your spellbook, and begin meditation.<br>
- In "HUD" mode, the Chat Box will now take advantage of higher resolutions to display more text before wrapping down to the next line.<br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed users to /quit out of the game immediately without penalty.  Normal operation is supposed to cause /quit to leave the character in-game and linkdead for a period of time to discourage this action.<br>
- Again changed the functionality of the "U" ("use") key.  It will no longer inspect players or loot corpses.  All other changes implemented in the last patch stand.<br>
- Added new customizable color options to the EQCLIENT.INI.  The working documentation for this is below.<br>
- Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges to "disappear" when the last charge was used.  The item never really disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging.  It no longer appears to disappear.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br>
<br>
If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br>

***Character Purge***<br>
<br>
Time has come to do some cleanup on character data across the servers.  On August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of level 1 characters.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within 30 days from the date of the purge wil<br>

August 17th, 2:00pm<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>
*Updated Patch Message*<br>
<br>
Some additional changes were included in today's patch that were not listed in the patch&nbsp;<br>
message earlier today.  This patch message is a replacement for the one posted earlier:<br>
<br>
*Miscellaneous Changes*<br>
<br>
- /trackplayers now supports a "GROUP" option, allowing trackers to exclude all player&nbsp;<br>
characters, except ones in their current group.<br>
- The EQCLIENT.INI has some new features, including one allowing logging (/log) to be on by&nbsp;<br>
default.  Updated documentation for the EQCLIENT.INI file is at the end of this patch&nbsp;<br>
message.<br>
- Activatable items, such as Journeyman's Boots, can now be activated by the corresponding&nbsp;<br>
number-key if placed in a hotbox.<br>
- Items that are "out of charges" now display "Charges: None" when inspecting the item.<br>
- Attack-speed buffs and debuffs will now stack correctly.  In other words, lower level&nbsp;<br>
spells will no longer overwrite higher level spells of the same type.<br>
- The "U" key (short for "use") has had its functionality enhanced.  It now does the&nbsp;<br>
equivalent of a single left-click and single right-click at the center of the screen.  In&nbsp;<br>
addition to opening doors, it will now consider and inspect PCs, consider NPCs, and use&nbsp;<br>
bankers, merchants, and guildmasters.<br>
- Fixed the way that spell-effect icons are displayed on the UI.  Previously, after adding&nbsp;<br>
several "buffs" to a character, one of the icons would be placed down in the chat window.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
*Chat/Login Server*<br>
<br>
This patch contains eqmain.dll, which is used by the EverQuest login/chat frontend.  The&nbsp;<br>
following changes have been implemented:<br>
<br>
- #help now accepts arguments.  #help #command will return help for the requested command.<br>
- Errors issued within the chat/login server frontend now display an "Error Number".  Please&nbsp;<br>
have this error number ready when requesting technical assistance.<br>
<br>
*Looking for Group Flag*<br>
<br>
Players can now indicate that they are "looking for a group" by typing /LFG.  This command&nbsp;<br>
will flag your character in both zone-specific /who lists, and the server-wide "/who all"&nbsp;<br>
list with "LFG".  The LFG flag will remain active until you either enter a group or log out.&nbsp;<br>
Players can search for other players who are LFG by using filters in the /who command.  For&nbsp;<br>
instance, to find rangers between level 40 and 50 who are looking for a group across the&nbsp;<br>
server, type "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg".&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It is our hope that this flag will make it easier for players to seek out group members,&nbsp;<br>
allowing for more adventuring with less preparation time.<br>
<br>
*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br>
<br>
If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an&nbsp;<br>
entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br>
<br>
The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors&nbsp;<br>

A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of today's patch.  This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br>
<br>
*Patch Day*<br>
<br>
Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
*General Enhancements*<br>
<br>
- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br>
- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels transposed accidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate.<br>
- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br>
- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br>
- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<br>
- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a "NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.<br>
- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.<br>
<br>
*Changes/Fixes*<br>
<br>
- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br>
- Scaler recipe now works<br>
- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br>
- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br>
- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br>
- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br>
- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br>
- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<br>
- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br>
- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br>
- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br>
- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br>
- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.<br>
<br>
*Dragons?*<br>
<br>
Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.  Enjoy :)<br>
<br>
<br>
*New Command For Tracking*<br>
<br>
New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work for all players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<br>
<br>
- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the tracking window.<br>
- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br>
<br>
*Client Customizations*<br>
<br>
Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your EverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<br>
<br>
- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br>
- Default screen viewing mode<br>
- Default travel speed (run or walk)<br>
<br>
The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the working document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're in the process of building them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Modifying this file is optional.<br>
<br>
*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<br>
<br>
The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
1 - Say<br>
2 - Tell<br>
3 - Group<br>
4 - Guild<br>
5 - OOC<br>
6 - Auction<br>
7 - Shout<br>
8 - Emote<br>
9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>
10 - You hit other<br>
11 - Other hits you<br>
12 - You miss other<br>
13 - Other misses you<br>
14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>
15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>
18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>
20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>
21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>
22 - Your death message<br>
23 - Others death message<br>
24 - Other damage other<br>
25 - Other miss other<br>
26 - /who command<br>
<br>
The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>
ScreenMode - NORMAL for the default window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br>

**Patch Day**<br>
<br>
Greetings everyone!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy:<br>
<br>
- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs.  In addition, the range for canned emotes has been increased.<br>
- /who all "guildname" should now work for players who have /roleplay turned on.<br>
- Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file.  Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once more.<br>
- The "Chat Filter" tab in "Options" now has an option to filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.<br>
<br>
*Fast Drop*<br>
<br>
Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground.  The new client allows players to set "Item Dropping" preferences on the "General" options tab.  The three options that can be set are:<br>
<br>
- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.<br>
- CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to drop an item.<br>
- NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command.  The arguments are:<br>
<br>
- ON: Same as option "Fast Drop" on the General Tab.<br>
- OFF: Same as option "Confirm" on the General Tab.<br>
- NEVER: Same as above.<br>
<br>
Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation.  Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground.  Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of your FastDrop setting.<br>
<br>
It is highly recommended that you use option "CONFIRM", as GMs will not reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.<br>

*EMERGENCY PATCH*<br>
<br>
Due to problems encountered in the most recent patch, you may temporarily see problems with spell icons displaying for certain stackable spells.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  This issue will be addressed in the next patch.<br>

<br>
*Chat and Login*<br>
<br>
Today's patch contains some new features for the EverQuest chat and login servers.  In addition, it enables support for some international keyboard layouts.<br>
<br>
- Tab again switches between fields in login and registration.<br>
- #time will display a time/date stamp.<br>
- #reply will send a private message to the last person to message you.<br>
- Tab will cycle through the last few people to send you a private message.<br>
- Rooms may now be closed by staff members. These rooms are in gray, and no one will be able to enter them until a staff member opens them. Attempting to enter a closed room will display a message.<br>
- EverQuest, including Chat and Login, now supports some international keyboard layouts. Information can be found at http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_keyboard.html.<br>

*Emergency Patch*<br>
<br>
Due to the problems encountered in yesterday's patch, some additional data has been moved to the live servers today.  As part of this patch, three new changes are included:<br>
<br>
- /Consent no longer gives other players permission to loot your corpse.  Instead, it only gives them the ability to drag your corpse using the /corpse command.  This change is due to player request stemming from number of customer service issues raised by some players who were using /consent as a way to steal the belongings of other players.  The change will eliminate those concerns and make the game more enjoyable for all of those involved.<br>
- Yesterday's patch changed the way spell-damage messages are reported to the caster.  The new text was dark blue, making it hard to distinguish from the background when in HUD mode.  The text color has been changed to "yellow" due to player request.<br>
- Duel messages will no longer be broadcast to the world unless the winner of the duel is over 10th level.  This should greatly reduce the number of duels with inappropriate names that have been occurring in the game.<br>
<br>
We would like to apologize to everyone for the problems stemming from yesterday's patch, and let you know that we have taken steps to greatly reduce the possibility that something of that nature could happen in the future.<br>

***Patch Day***<br>
<br>
*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*<br>
<br>
- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to someplace "safer".<br>
- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.<br>
- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity filter.<br>
- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked doors.<br>
- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against non-moving, non-rooted targets.  These restrictions allowed us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>
- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>
- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".<br>
- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history.  The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that the old one was.<br>
- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>
- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.<br>
- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons.  Take care to take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br>
<br>
*Poison*<br>
<br>
- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>
- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.<br>
- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".<br>
- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>
- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br>
<br>
*General Crafts*<br>
<br>
- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>
- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>
- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be crafted.<br>
- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>
- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>
- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>
- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item".<br>
<br>
*Items*<br>
<br>
- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>
- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br>
- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>
- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around in the world.  Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".<br>
- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a bit more useful.<br>
- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time.  The function of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br>
<br>
<br>
*/consent*<br>
<br>
Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds.  Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report.  Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can undo it.<br>
<br>
*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*<br>
<br>
There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule.  Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you alone.  The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their faction.<br>
<br>
*Regen Effects*<br>
<br>
This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while under the affect of regen.<br>
<br>
*Keyed Dungeons*<br>
<br>
The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago.  Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point.  We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br>
<br>
*Barbed Scale Whip*<br>
<br>
In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already in-game.  It has been changed back to its original stats.<br>
<br>
*Hiding Corpses*<br>
<br>
A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client.  This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen.  This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay.  It will be particularly useful in the planes.  The command supports the following arguments:<br>
<br>
- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>
- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your group.<br>
- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br>
<br>
For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone.  You can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it.<br>
<br>
*Resurrection*<br>
<br>
The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting.  Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES.  Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br>
