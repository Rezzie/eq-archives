    <p align="center" class="spellltext">We are on the move again! I'm proud to say The Runes has tripled it's daily visitors since Sept! Unfortunately a bit too big for Complete-Host :( I've secured us a new hosting company, and I hope that Micfo.com lives up to the mighty big shoes Complete-Host has created. After speaking with Micfo I think they will. While I'm very sad to have to leave our home, at the same time I'm very excited. I'd like to take a second to publically thank Stuart from <a href="http://complete-host.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Complete-Host</a>, so bare with me a minute.</p>
    <p align="center" class="spellltext">Not so long ago myself, and several other people were left to the wolves by our previous hosting company. Well by one of the owners at least. Stuart came to the rescue and offered us a home as long as we wanted. He did this without further cost, he honored a contract he wasn't even a part of. When The Runes continued to grow at an amazing speed, he doubled our bandwidth without even having to ask. He has always bent over backwards to offer us the best hosting around. So leaving them is like leaving my nice secure home. To Stuart, Eric and the rest of the folks at Complete-Host, once again I thank you for all you have done. /salute If any of you aspire to create your own little place on the web, you would be foolish not to check out <a href="http://complete-host.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Complete-Host.com</a> VERY affordable, and service that is 2nd to none. We will miss you guys! </p>
    <p align="center" class="spellltext">*ahem* OK.. now we are currently moving things over to our new host. I have just finished uploading the site, and Riart is moving our boards as we speak. In order to have things run as smoothly as possible, we've disabled the boards until they are finished. Please check back, I only expect them to be down for a couple of days. Course we can always catch up on the serverwide.enchanter channel in the meantime! Hope to see you all there WOOT! </p>

Here's a few pictures she brought back for us :) The images are quite large, so they make time to load. /hugs THANK YOU! </span></p>
    <p class="spellltext">Nanyea added some additional information she recieved at FanFaire and posted it on the boards. WHOOHOO! </p>

    <p class="spellltext">The FanFaire in Vegas should be wrapping up. I hope all of you had a great time! Pictures should be coming soon, I can't wait to see them! Lelaa planned a get together on Sat night for Runes people, hope they took LOTS Of pictures! With any luck the next one will be closer to the midwest area *coughhintcough*</p>
    <p class="spellltext">I'm planning quite an update for this week, so keep an eye out for all of the Gates of Discord zones to be added. </p>
    <p class="spellltext">Next week our host complete-host.com is upgrading our server, so if there is a bit of time while the Web is catching up to us, no worries. The site isn't going anywhere. Just give it a bit of time and try again later. Do try to avoid posting important threads, or guides during that time since we may lose a few hours of postings during the move. </p>

    <p class="spellltext">This week marks the 5th anniversary of Everquest. SOE is doing lots of ingame events serverwide. There's a scavenger hunt that rewards you with a indefinate firework staff. The longer you've been playing, the nicer the firework! You can find out more details on the scavenger hunt <a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2657" target="_blank" class="links">here. </a>For those who have accounts that were no longer active, SOE has reinstated all accounts (except those banned by SOE) and you have an opportunity to come enjoy the celebrations free of charge until April 15th. </p>
    <p class="spellltext">In addition to the Scavenger Hunt, for the next two weeks those old uber items from way back have been recreated and made better. There is a list at Lucy of all of these &quot;Fabled&quot; items. You can find the Lucy list <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=Fabled" target="_blank" class="links">here </a>and there is a thread going on our boards<a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2670" class="links"> here</a>. These are only going to be ingame for about 2 weeks! So head over to those old world zones, course expect them to be camped just like the old days!</p>
