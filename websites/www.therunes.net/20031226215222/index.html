          <p class="spellltext">&nbsp; Since tomorrow is Christmas and I won't
            be doing any updates, I wanted to take this opportunity to make a
            couple of personal comments. For me, the holidays are a time to look
            back over the year and reflect on all the positive things around
            me. My family, my work, and of course this site and all of you who
            visit here.  </p>
          <p class="spellltext">&nbsp; The Runes
              has brought me immense satisfaction and wonderful friendships that
              are as real as my &quot;Real Life&quot; friends. I want to thank each and
            every one of you for visiting, sharing your stories, making me laugh,
            and making the site a warm friendly place for other Enchanters.</p>
          <p class="spellltext">&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank
              you to the donators who reached into their very real pockets and
              sent off a little to help the site out. Your graciousness was appreciated
            more than I can express. </p>
          <p class="spellltext">&nbsp;I can't forget to thank those who have
            written guides included in the site, and the moderators 


 Veneficus,

 
            Vynadie and Riart who
            donate their time to help me out on the boards. Riart has been my
            rock since we moved over to the &quot;big kids&quot; hosting. Without him our
            boards would be on the brink of disaster constantly, if they were
            there at all. THANK YOU RIART!! </p>
          <p><span class="spellltext">&nbsp; A
                HUGE thank you to Stuart at <a href="http://complete-host.com/" target="_blank" class="links">Complete-Host</a>!&nbsp; We
                were getting close to going over our very generous bandwidth
                limit. He 


 kindly

 offered to double it for us, no strings
                attached. Now that's a wonderful Christmas present! They have
                been amazing, and that's putting it mildly. Since we have been
                with <a href="http://complete-host.com/" class="links">Complete-Host</a> we
                have had ZERO downtime, ZERO problems. Now an already perfect
              host just got better.&nbsp; If
                any of you aspire to have your own sites, please be sure to check
            them out, it just doesn't get any better. </span></p>
          <p class="spellltext">&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all of you have a wonderful
            holiday! Try not to be so busy that you forget to reflect back on
            the things/people who have made your life good this year, and thank
            them!! It will mean a lot to them :) </p>

                  We want to wish everyone a happy holiday season and thank
                    you for continuing to be a part of EverQuest. We have some
                    exciting times ahead with our 7 nth expansion in the works, <a href="http://www.gatesofdiscord.com/" target="_blank" class="links">www.gatesofdiscord.com </a>,
                    and there are many more exciting things to come. Here are
                    a few of the new features on the EQ team's large and busy
                    schedule. </p>
                  <p><strong>Melee Enhancement, part 2 </strong></p>
                  <p>Melee classes are currently enjoying the first part of the
                    improved Melee system and the feedback we are receiving has
                    been great. Early in 2004 we plan to move forward with the
                    rest of the melee enhancement, the reaction abilities. The
                    enhancement gives Monks, Rogues and Warriors the ability to
                    use special skills in response to a mistake made by their opponent
                    or an exceptional move of their own. This enhancement will
                    be in addition to the existing system, allowing players to
                    use the skills for more involved game-play and to improve the
                    abilities of their characters. </p>
                  <p>A more detailed explanation and the transcript of a chat with
                    the EQ Live team about the system can be found on the Developers
                    Corner. </p>
                  <p><strong>Graveyard Zone </strong></p>
                  <p>Tired of losing your corpse? The current EQ system removes
                    corpses from the game after a week to reduce clutter and potential
                    video lag. But we know there are times when your character
                    dies and you just can't get it right away. Next thing you know
                    a day turns into a week and BAM! Your corpse is gone. Since
                    we can't leave the corpses sitting in game indefinitely, some
                    inventive folks here have come up with another option. </p>
                  <p>We plan to create a "graveyard" zone that will only work if
                    your corpse has decayed and disappeared. If you have lost your
                    corpse due to decay in other parts of Norrath, you will be
                    allowed to enter this zone and reclaim it. </p>
                  <p><strong>Tradeskill Interface Upgrade </strong></p>
                  <p>Tired of all the clicking and dragging needed just to make
                    a type 1 wood arrow? We know that the current tradeskill interface
                    is cumbersome, so the UI guys have come up with some new ideas. </p>
                  <p>Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface.&nbsp; In
                    the window you will find an area that has all recipes that
                    are currently available to you.&nbsp; This includes recipes
                    that are at your skill level as well as some above it.&nbsp; Clicking
                    on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion.
                    Clicking the "combine" button will extract those required items
                    from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine,
                    placing the results on the player's cursor. The new system
                    is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you
                    want to&nbsp;try a combine that is way out of your league,
                    which uses the old style of combination. </p>
                  <p>These are just a few of the things slated to come out of the
                    EQ Live laboratory. Watch for other exciting announcements
                  in the weeks ahead.<br>

              been fixed. One, the popularity of the casino brought Shadowhaven
              to its knees on several servers. Two, it seems that you could use
              either tokens or batwings to gamble.</p>

              <span class="spellbold">Small Unannounced Change Ingame</span><br>As you know, if you went LD during a fight your character would
              defend itself using weapons or spells until you either died, or your
              character finally left the server. During the last patch, changes
              were made. Now upon LD, your character will no longer defend itself
              in any form. A poster on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/049728.html" target="_blank" class="links">Official

  <strong>Headlines! <br>
  <br>
  Melee Enhancements Part 1 <br>
  New Spell Effects Live <br>
  Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven </strong><br>
  HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your hometown
  paper! <br>
  <br>
  <strong>*** AA REFUND ***</strong> <br>
  <br>
  - Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More details
  below). If you had these bard AA's and were close to 30 AA points stored, make
  certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before
  you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. <br>
  <br>
  - Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes with
  the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If you have this
  Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend
  enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points
  over 30 are removed when you zone. <br>
  <strong><br>
  ** Melee enhancements ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first part
  of it is now Live. <br>
  <br>
  The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina. <br>
  <br>
  All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use. They still have
  a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the timer allows. <br>
  <br>
  Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers. <br>
  <br>
  We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game. These are the skills
  that do not use the new "opening" system, but can be used without an opening
  present. The "reactionary" skills and the opening system will remain on Test
  for further tuning. <br>
  <br>
  Warriors have been given a mitigation boost. This affects all warriors at all
  levels. <br>
  <br>
  Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind them.
  This affects all monks with the Dodge ability. <br>
  <br>
  All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East Commons or
  the Plane of Knowledge. To learn a discipline, the Tome must be turned into your
  guildmaster. <br>
  <br>
  Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues who are
  above level 60. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  Chandelling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance. To play you
  will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it
  in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will
  be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize.
  This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver,
  Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holograms Elder Beads. Good luck to all that
  play! <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** Items ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  - Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be sold back
  to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro. <br>
  <br>
  - Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will trade
  tokens for containers. This will allow player characters to sell those tokens
  in the Bazaar. Folks that buy the tokens can then take them to the Caerlyna and
  trade them in for the appropriate container. You can exchange most weight reducing
  tradeable containers for a token. <br>
  <br>
  - We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int. Really,
  we have! <br>
  <br>
  - We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction Efficiency I-IV
  and Affliction Haste I-IV foci. <br>
  <br>
  - Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges when it
  procs. If you own one of these swords, you will need to petition a GM and ask
  them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with a new one. <br>
  <br>
  - Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ CLR SHA
  DRU. <br>
  <br>
  - The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters level 35
  and above. <br>
  <br>
  - The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or Ultravision:
  Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the Stoic, Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's
  Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood,
  5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion
  of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc
  Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots,
  Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf Caller's Boots and Camii's
  Bracer of Vigor. <br>
  <br>
  - The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now Worn to
  activate, not procs. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** Spells/Songs ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  - New spell effects! Just about every spell in the game has been given a new
  spell effect. If you have your spell effects turned off, you may want to turn
  them back on. <br>
  <br>
  - Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus. It was allowing 100% recovery from missed
  notes in most instances. We have restored it to the 5%/10%/15% values as documented
  in the AA window. <br>
  <br>
  - Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric hammers, wizard
  flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer dissipate before engaging
  the target NPC. <br>
  <br>
  - Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon the pet,
  95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy. <br>
  <br>
  - Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as if they
  had duration 5. This will reduce the duration of some lull-type spells to their
  proper duration. <br>
  <br>
  - Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing of the
  Nine. <br>
  <br>
  - We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast on an
  NPC by two different druids would not stack. <br>
  <br>
  - Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage. It now only
  reduces melee damage. <br>
  <br>
  - Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if commanded
  to kill the eye. <br>
  <br>
  - Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning. <br>
  <br>
  - The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness. <br>
  <br>
  - Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by Summoner's
  Boon. <br>
  <br>
  - We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells. <br>
  <br>
  - Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could cause them
  to be unable to move if their hit points got too low. This may also address other
  issues with pets using hit-point boosting items. <br>
  <strong><br>
  ** Alternate Advancement ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  - Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded. If you had these
  bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough
  points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over
  30 are removed when you zone. You may, of course, repurchase these AAs. <br>
  <br>
  - Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful area-of-effect
  spells. <br>
  <br>
  - Jamfest has been fixed. It will now affect the bard's group, not just the bard. <br>
  <br>
  - The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the casting
  time for the wizard spell Harvest. It does now. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** Tradeskills ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  - Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the components
  needed to make it. However, they will still sell those products for the same
  amount. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** Zones and Quests **</strong> <br>
  <br>
  - Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long as you
  are flagged for time. It is also now possible to receive any of the earlier progression
  flags, even if you have already earned access to the Plane of Time. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** User Interface ** </strong><br>
  <br>
  - Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log. <br>
  <br>
  - Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window is not
  minimized. <br>
  <br>
  - Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see the /find
  path or the targeting ring. <br>
  <br>
  - We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up to eight
  hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and displays any current
  melee effects. The window can be opened by pressing Alt+C. The keys are accessible
  using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>** Miscellaneous **</strong> <br>
  <br>
  - Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help explain
  how to modify the targeting ring. <br>
