									  <p><strong>Bloodmoon Keep, solo and group tactics </strong><br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Background </strong><br>
                                        <br>
                                        Bloodmoon Keep is an excellent zone for enchanters. Its been a  while since ive had as much fun in EQ as Ive had in this zone.  Bloodmoon is a sign the Sony content designers have finally understood  what players want. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This zone is a classic dungeon crawl. Its filled to the brim with  adds and multi-pulls. And while group can succeed without an enchanter  by having a monk pull sinlges to zone in, the exp rate will be slow due  to how long it takes to split. Also, you wont get very far in before  the 18minute respawn timer goes off. If you want to get to the back,  where the better rares are you simply have to bring an enchanter. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I dont think even a bard could cover it. A couple times I had to  lock and blur the mobs to let my group rez a critical member and  recover mana. If you plan on hunting anwhere other than the zone in, id  reccomend AE mez in your line up. The good news is the resists were on  the low side even at 77. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Charm Strategies</strong> <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The only charmable mobs in the zone are the worgs and theres about  6-8 orcs blocking your way. Some of them See invis, some dont. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The best way ive found to safely get a pet is using this method: <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -Get SoE (not absolutely required but just get it) <br>
                                        -Summon an animation <br>
                                        -Use Eye of Zomm or Bind sight to get the target of a worg in the 1st pen along the south wall. <br>
                                        -If you are having trouble getting the worg targetted type /pet  attack a wild worg, then spam pet back off. Now you can /assist your  pet and get his worg target. <br>
                                        -Once you have the target, stand near the tree in the courtyard and hit /pet attack <br>
                                        -Pet will run off to aggro your worg, start spamming Nightmare Stasis as soon as you send the animation. <br>
                                        -A large number of mobs will be inc, among them your worg, spam cast Night Stasis on it and zone out VERY fast. <br>
                                        -Zone back in and pet will be waiting for you, works just about everytime. <br>
                                        -PS tell other ppl near the zone to clear the area...otherwise they arent going to be happy =/ <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Wing Strategies </strong><br>
                                        <br>
                                        <u>NE wing, aka Jail</u> - Here  you will find Orcs that can no-fail snare you if you aggro them within  its casting range. If you are pulling do so from max distance. Be aware  that there are invisible mobs that dont appear until they are at your  camp beating on something. These are called Bloodmoon Assassins and  presumably they are rogues with the SoS AA. The assassins will also use  rogue mez which can cause chaos if you arent used to it. Also some of  the mobs can AE silence your group, though it has a very small radius. I  cant figure out which ones do this but i think its the Ragers. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Rares include Warden Jaklor, Grawlthin, Vorash and Crawtooth. Any  pat in the first hall if a ph for the Warden or Grawl or Craw. Ive only  seen Vorash in the room just past the jail. If you are crawling this  wing the pitmaster spawns a few places near the back. All in all this  is a challenging wing but very rewarding. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <u>East wing, aka Worg Pens</u> -  Orcs and worgs. None of them snare you but they are packed in tight and  this makes pulling less than 3-4 unrealistic without some fancy  footwork. If you are stuck pulling id recommend pulling with AE tash  and then using pet as a speed bump back at camp while you AE mez the  pile. Pull single mobs out of the pile of mezzed ones with BDB. Then  use the stun &gt; gorilla prod combo to break mez and send pet. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Rares include Horak, Ralfin, Crawtooth and Balkor the Knife. Horak  and Ralfin are most common since they spawn near the zone in the worg  area. Worgs are charmable and make fantastic pets. This is a very hard  wing due to the sheer number of mobs and the fast re spawn. Somewhat  less rewarding than the Jail but its a lot more intense on enchanters.  Good exp as well. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I finally learned how to pull that evil east wing, it basically  REQUIRES you have a charmed pet. I gave up on attempting to split and  instead decided to fall back on our ample ae repertoire. Basically I  learned how to pull the "piles" individually. Then i would pull with ae  tash, the mobs would get hung up on the door way for just a moment,  just long enough to bunch them up perfectly, then I send in pet. All  the mobs will be on pet but that's ok cuz you have ae mez inc which  lands near 100% with tashed mobs. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        For pull junkies who are interested here's the details: <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -The first pull is is a double, wait for the pat to leave and pull the first mob, 2 will come. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -Then you pull the pat single. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -Then you pull the pile due east, straight out of the hall this will be 4, pull with ae tash, send in pet then ae mez. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -Then you pull first southern worg pen. DO NOT linger or you will aggro! Run in tag the pen and run out real fast. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -Then you pull the triplet just north of the doorway, this is the  hardest pull you have to move your ass to get in front of them. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        -After that you have a wide open area to split the rest of the  zone. You can use (abuse) Beguilers for the rest of the mission / group <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <u>North West wing aka Undead</u>  - I have little experience with this wing but I know that the mobs are  immune to stun which made soloing them a pita and basically  unproductive when compared to the orcs. Ive not seen any named undead  near the zone, but i have seen a few way back, Fallstaff the Observer  or something I think it was called. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <em>*Update*</em> as far as I can tell this wing is only good for farming that uber necro dot and doing the spiritvoid earring quest. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        One thing ive noticed about SoF, in this zone at least, is that the  mobs are starting to become more distinct based on their class. Ive  already mentioned that the rogue mobs can SoS and mez, the Warrior mobs  have about 2x the hps of the other mobs and the ragers (berzerkers  presumably) can flurry and snare. The caster mobs are gimps still of  course. I'm not sure if anyone noticed but they made it so caster mobs  don't auto learn dispel a few patches back. Dispell was the only real  annoyance that caster mobs had, dispelling charm and snare at the same  time usually is ouchies. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Regardless of what wing you decide to tackle, I strongly suggest  you charm a worg. The dps will be very welcome since these mobs have a  high number of hps. If you cant find a tank, Charm duoing will probably  be better exp than solo in the long run. You will need heals if you  want to take down the named's because the named's are immune to Stun, Mez  and Root which pretty much makes them unsoloable, also they can  summon... <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Instanced Bloodmoon </strong><br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Another trick my guild has been taking advantage of is the instanced versions of bloodmoon. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On Fennin Bloodmoon has become "The New KC" where trains have  become common place due to the difficulty of the mobs compounded with  the sheer volume of them. Add in the fact that "controlled trains" are  needed to get a worg pet out of the east wing and you have the  ingredients for a lively zone! <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Anyway's we normally exp in the instanced version of this zone, you  can request the instance with no prior factioning from Larquin  Fangbreaker at the quest huts in Loping Plains. The first 2 missions in  his series provided you with a fully spawned "East" or Worg Pens  depending on what your server calls it. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There's no repops but that's np because there are tons of mobs. I  found these instances to be an excellent training ground for myself as  well as some of the more junior members in my guild. The entrance in  that zone seems intentionally designed to kite so we did some of that  since sometimes we don't have a tank on. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        There aren't any rare mobs in the instances but there are some rare  drops. You can get a decent 125mana aug off any mob here rarely, also  trade skill rares can drop as well, which are selling like hotcake's atm. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        All in all, instances are a great place to grind if your favorite camp in the normal Bloodmoon is taken.<br>
