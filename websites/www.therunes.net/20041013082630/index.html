		    <p align="left"><strong>1. Revise Risk vs Reward of Charming in Omens. (NEW)</strong> <BR>
		      <BR>
		      We understand the need for a change for Charm. Having Enchanters running around with 1200 hitting pets creates unbalancing situations. <BR>
<BR>
We appreciate the fact that this change means less immune to charm mobs. <BR>
<BR>
But this change totally kills the risk vs reward aspect of charming. Before if you had a 800 hitting pet it meant that when charm broke you had a 800 hitting mob after you. Now the pet only hits for 200 but when charm breaks it is a 800 hitting angry mob again. Charmed mobs are doing less than 40% of their normal DPS, but when they break they can still wipe a group. <BR>
<BR>
Most Enchanters don't mind that the DPS of the mobs may be lowered when charmed. The problem is that the risk remains the same even though the reward has decreased. Enchanters believe that the risk was fairly equal to the reward pre-Omens and if the reward goes down then so should the risk. <BR>
<BR>
The one thing that might of lowered the risk of charming before was snare, but omens mobs run fast even when snared so this point is negligible. Plus Enchanters can't snare in the first place, snare was part of the team effort of trying to keep a mob charmed. <BR>
<BR>
One possible fix to this is to make the former pet keep the debuff effect for 15 seconds after charm breaks. To avoid exploitation of this just have the debuff wear off when somebody tries to damage the mob. <BR>
<BR>
Another fix would be to keep the DPS of the mob the same as before, except only add a 1% slow and negative 100% to duel wield skill on the omens charm spells. This way Enchanters can't haste their charmed pets and the pets can't duel wield. This change would lower the potential DPS of charmed pets and keep the risk level with the reward. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>2. Reduce npc immunity to spells such as mez, charm, stun and pacify. (partially implemented) </strong><BR>
<BR>
No other class has to deal with the level of content-based usefulness that we do. It's true that healers are good against some mobs, melee DPS is better against others, and caster DPS better against others. But they're all useful to some extent against every mob. EVERY encounter in the game is designed with the idea of someone taking damage, and someone else healing/mitigating the damage that they take. EVERY encounter in the game is based around reducing the mob's hps to zero. <BR>
<BR>
Because of that, classes whose focus is those abilities (taking damage, healing damage, and killing mobs) will always have some degree of usefulness. Even against very special/unusual fights (Coirnav, for instance), you always need someone taking damage, someone healing the damage, and someone doing damage. Most classes fit into these niches. <BR>
<BR>
Enchanters are exactly the opposite. There are VERY few encounters where we really shine, mainly because we can't provide a basic EQ role. Enchanters are crippled in zones/events in which mobs are immune to mezz, charm, stun, and pacify. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>3. General Mezz issues</strong>. <BR>
<BR>
A. Add "unable to be mezzed" message BEFORE the mez attempt. (currently being evaluated) <BR>
<BR>
This would save Enchanters many deaths when trying to mezz too high or immune mobs. This addresses the issue of having mobs that are named the same, con the same, look the same, but some are mezzable and some are not. At present, high end mezzing is a crapshoot and groups/raids solve it by off-tanking. Getting a resist is one thing, casting a spell when you have no idea if it will work or not is entirely another. <BR>
<BR>
B. Have Mezz spells stack even when two different level enchanters cast the spell. (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
If a level 67 Enchanter mezzes a mob using Bliss, than a level 66 Enchanter should be able to re-mezz that mob if he also uses Bliss. But currently this is not the case, right now if that 66 Enchanter tries to re-mezz a mob mezzed by a higher level Enchanter, he will get a "spell did not hold" message. <BR>
<BR>
C. Fix mez gap between levels 55-61. (currently being evaluated) <BR>
<BR>
The Mez gap prevents an enchanter from performing any form of CC during those levels. Rapture at level 59 is severely limited, as it only allows one creature to be mezzed due to cast time limitations. Increase the level cap on Glamour of Kintaz to 59, lower Apathy to level 57, and making Apathy of Nihil vender purchasable would all help in fixing the mez gap <BR>
<BR>
D. Have Omens mezzes be the first spells we get for each level of turn-in runes, or make them vender purchasable. (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
Nukers can still nuke, healers can still heal, and Rangers can still find creative ways to die. Yet Enchanters cannot mez in some of the new zones without the new mezz spells due to level restrictions on mezz. Considering how important mezz is for Enchanters, these spells should be the first ones we get from a rune turn-in. <BR>
<BR>
Alternatively our mezzes could be changed so they scale up to work on higher level mobs, only not as well as before. For each level above the normal cap, the mez could be more resistant and have a smaller duration. That way the new upgrades will still be spells that Enchanters will want, but Enchanters can still do their jobs even without the new spells. <BR>
<BR>
E. Add a resists modifier AA for our Mezzes. (currently being evaluated) <BR>
<BR>
Mezzing is the backbone of the Enchanter class. The whole class is based on crowd control. But as it stands currently, our crowd control ability has been reduced to a crapshoot. In PoP, if a mob resisted our mez attempt, we could take a couple of hits, regain our composure, and at least get through a complete second casting of our mez (regardless of whether it got resisted or not.) With the extreme ramping up of damage being dealt by mobs in GoD, a single resist on an add results almost uniformly in our death. As such, we believe that an addition of a resist modifier to our higher level mezzes would once again make mezzing a possibility. <BR>
<BR>
F. Add resist adjustment to Bliss of the Nihil and Wake of Felicity. (currently being evaluated) <BR>
<BR>
Using AE mezz is extremely dangerous. It is bad enough of having to deal with one mob when single target mez is resisted, but there is very little enchanters can do when multiple mobs resist AE mezz. <BR>
<BR>
G. Design future content to require more mezzing. (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
There is a lack of necessity for CC (and the exceedingly poor performance traditional enchanter CC has compared to pulling CC). Out of camp crowd control where at worst 1 person is at risk, and at best you reduce your pull to a manageable single mob, is currently much better than mezzing in-camp. This creates an environment where Enchanters are less wanted for groups and raids. <br>
<BR>
<strong>4. Replace Apathy of Nihil with an upgraded faster casting slow as the reward for the Yikta Geomancy Stone. (currently being evaluated) </strong><BR>
<BR>
Shaman received an upgrade to their slow spell in GoD because their combo of debuff/slow took too long to cast and wasn't useful in the current content (GoD). Enchanter face the same problem because while their resist debuff casts fast, it's agro makes using it on inc prohibitive, and the enchanter slow has twice the cast time of the shaman slow. With the slows given to Beastlords, and the slow upgrade given to shamans in GoD, we can no longer sufficiently fill one of the main niches for which we were regularly invited for groups. A casting time adjustment, or a resist modifier, or both, would put us back in some form of usefulness as far as slowing is concerned. <BR>
<BR>
Apathy of Nihil is unattainable for a level 57 Enchanter. It happens to be the only non level 65 spell from the expansion. Enchanters that can get it find it useless because it is level capped to mobs below what they normally hunt. <BR>
<strong><BR>
5. Add a questable or LDoN vender purchasable Innoruk's Sarcasm Augment. (currently being evaluated) </strong><BR>
<BR>
A questable Innoruk's Sarcasm augment for Enchanters would help reduce the insane amount of aggro that tash causes for those Enchanters that wish to put in the time/effort to improve their characters. <BR>
<BR>
Currently the Innoruk's Sarcasm augment in game comes from and LDoN raid that many people have reported as being broken. So only a handful of Enchanters have this augment. Likewise, only three items in Norrath exist (or known of) using the Innorruk Focus effect: Sharp Ended Broken Lever, Staff of Swiftness, and Peridious Stone of Wanting. These items are downgrades for many enchanters. That is why an augment is preferred so it can be removed and augmented on new upgrades. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>6. Provide a stacking mana regen advantage to grouping with enchanters. (currently being evaluated) </strong><BR>
<BR>
Currently, everyone in the game above level 45 has KEI on their character at all times, due to the massive duration on it and the ease of traveling to PoK to get it. When players die, if there is not an enchanter in their group, they can easily find one in the zone and run to get it. This has the effect of reducing the effectiveness of grouping with an enchanter; even an enchanter with Clairvoyance. Clairvoyance only increases the group's mana regen by 4 over what it would be with KEI. Groups can regenerate mana faster if you just add a beastlord, shadowknight, or necro to it instead of an enchanter. With KEI having a long duration, groups don't really need an enchanter in the group. <BR>
<BR>
Granting Enchanters an AA or spell that awards the enchanter's current group a rune and mana regen for a few minutes would give people yet another reason to add an enchanter to their group, even if they already have KEI (which they usually do). <BR>
<BR>
A few classes seem to get a paragon-type spell, except enchanters who are supposed to be the mana regen (power of mind) class. Ours should not only provide nice regen, but a unique effect to compliment one of our abilities, namely rune. <br>
<BR>
<strong>7. Add a Word of Morell upgrade. (NEW) </strong><BR>
<BR>
Many Enchanters purchased the Mezz Mastery AA mainly for the extra tick that it gave to WoM. Unfortunately WoM has been phased out. <BR>
<BR>
If the devs do not want to give Enchanters a WoM upgrade, then many Enchanters would like a Mezz Mastery AA refund. Mezz Mastery in its current state without a WoM upgrade does not merit 20 AA's. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>8. Add more utility for when Mezzing is not an option. (currently being evaluated) </strong><BR>
<BR>
Currently most enchanters end up nuking more than they do mezzing mobs, specifically when raiding. This is because most guilds would rather split tank adds than to have the Enchanters keep dying due to a resists on mez. <BR>
<BR>
But Enchanters do not want to be poor Wizards. "Enchanters are the most subtile of spell casters, with little focus on doing damage directly but tremendous impact on the world around them." <BR>
<BR>
There are many ways that the Enchanters utility can be improved. Some Enchanters spells could be made into group spells and Enchanter-only debuffs would be welcomed. <BR>
<BR>
Removing the gem components to our runes including the Alender line will go a long way in giving back some utility to Enchanters. Many Enchanters do not use the high level targetable runes anymore due to the peridot cost being too high for them. One swing from a high level mob can eat the rune up. The Alender line is similar to the Bulwark of Vie line only less useful, yet the Alender line costs a peridot and the BoV line does not. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>9. Self only mana regen - stackable with other mana regen buffs. (currently being evaluated) </strong><BR>
<BR>
The sub par returns from Theft of Thought &amp; Scryers warrants examining our self-only mana regeneration. Both require a spell slot and tappable mobs, but tappable mobs are not always available. Furthermore, the other classes benefit from our clarity series too. Not only do they gain superior self-regen from self-buffs, they also gain +regen from Enchanters. Meanwhile enchanters struggle with ToT / Scryers. <BR>
<BR>
Theft of Thought has been broken since its inception. It taps for less than half of what it should be tapping for on mobs that are level 55+. <BR>
<BR>
<strong>10. 1.5 Epic Issues.</strong> <BR>
<BR>
A. Focus: (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
The focus effect is totally useless. If you are going to make it reduce agro, make it a significant amount. There is a huge disparity between the usefulness of say the cleric epic and ours. A 4% reduction on a 1400ish hate spell equates to about a single melee swing typically w/o a proc. Also when Enchanters are mezzing they normally are the only ones on the mobs hate list, so they will still have 100% of the hate regardless of the 4% adjustment. In order for a mezz hate reduction focus to work, it has to be so large that it reduces the amount of hate mezz causes down to about the same level that root hate causes. <BR>
<BR>
Mez agro should be reduced across the board, this more then anything else gives bards the advantage in mezznig over us <BR>
<BR>
B. Clicky <BR>
<BR>
I. The recourse agros all mobs in range because it is detrimental. Make the recourse beneficial so it does not aggro indifferent NPC's. (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
II. The agro reduction needs to be -1000 to -2000 to get you off the top of the hate list (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
III. Lower recast timer to be on par with the other useful epics ie 6 mins (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
IV. Have it break last (after arcane rune and regular runes, NOT FIRST) (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
V. Increase range on the recourse(NEW) <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C: Slot: (NEW) <BR>
<BR>
Most Time level enchanters would rather use Serpent of Vindication over Epic 1.5, and perhaps even Epic 2.0. The usefulness of the slow-stick is better than any other effect in game for Enchanters right now. It is a shame that the new epics are being bagged. <BR>
<BR>
Many Enchanters would like the new epics to be equipable in the Secondary slot. <BR>
<BR>
Alternatively Serpent of Vindication could be made clickable from inventory, or just give Enchanters a new faster-casting slow spell.<br>
