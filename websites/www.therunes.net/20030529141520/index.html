                            Riart was kind enough to get our new boards up! They 
                            look great. That's the good news... now the bad news.&nbsp; 
                            So far there is nothing to transfer the posts from 
                            our old boards to the new ones. I will have to archive 
                            the old board until I can figure something out. So 
                            be sure to visit both. </span></p>

                            For those who haven't visited the boards&nbsp; I'll 
                            give you a quick explaination. Our previous host fell 
                            far short of my expectations, which was basically 
                            just keep the site accessible. Not only were they 
                            unable to do that, we never got past &quot;I must 
                            be lying 'cause it's not them&quot; I'm thrilled to 
                            say it turned out to be a blessing. I found a fantastic 
                            company, Distanthost. If any of you are in need of 
                            hosting check them out. Features are MUCH better than 
                            what I was getting before, and tech support is amazing.

                            are MANY changes happening on the test server. We've 
                            got a sticky on the boards if your interested. </p>

                          <p class="spellltext">My apologies for not getting the 
                            patch message posted yesterday. The highlights of 
                            the patch were the new and improved Hate Plane, and 
                            the release of Veksar on Stormhammer. There were all 
                            kinds of things patched.. but here's one they didn't 
                            mention. Gravity Flux lost most of it's flux :( It 
                            will now only throw the target 1' in the air as opposed 
                            to 10' prior. /sigh</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">Mentioned in the patch was the 
                            change to Tricksters Augmentation. It's now a group 
                            only spell, so no more casting it on our pets. You 
                            can get the entire patch message <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/recent_updates.jsp" target="_blank" class="links">here</a></p>

                            to be released in the fall and the focus is said to 
                            be on dungeons. </p>

                            test server. The only information I have on it at 
                            this point is that it's an underwater zone off of 
                            Lake of Ill Omen. Level range 50-65. To the best of 
                            my knowledge this is going to be a free zone available 
                            to all servers. I will add more information as I get

                            The patch turned into the usual fiasco, with the now 
                            customary emergency patches. In the case of enchanters, 
                            the changes to charm for the most part have gotten 
                            a negative response. Not for the experience penalty 
                            that charmed pets now have, but because of the MR 
                            changes. Enchanters are reporting that charm is breaking 
                            so often, it's almost useless. Absor showed up on 
                            the CastersRealm enchanter boards /faint, as did Illia 
                            to defend the changes. You can read the thread <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=85120" target="_blank" class="links">here</a><br>

                            There is also a change in Tash and some are saying 
                            our DD's after this patch. Tash is no longer causing 
                            the insane aggro. No idea how long this will last, 
                            enjoy while you can!<br>
                            <br>
                            The changes in Illusion faction are in fact causing 
                            disruption, and has caused as much anger as the Charm 
                            changes. Some are wondering how they will complete 
                            some quests, such as the Qeynos Catacomb for our epic. 
                            Unfortunately SOE didn't fix Night's Dark Terror while 
                            they were at it. So as of right now, no scarecrow 
                            for joo!</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">One of my favorite sites, EQSpoilers, 
                            has been down for the last few days. Hopefully this 
                            does not mean it's gone. I loved that site!! It had 
                            a lot of information that you couldn't find any place 
                            else. If anyone know what happened to it let me know. 
                            /cry</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">Oh last week I also forgot to 
                            mention I added the research info for the new researchable 
                            50-60 spells.</p>
                          <p class="spellltext">OH! I almost forgot, getting flags 
                            for the 2nd and 3rd tier became much easier! When 
                            one person completes a quest, all in the group recieve 
                            the flag. I don't think this applies when you recieve 
                            an actual key, but for quests such as the Diaku medallions 
                            in POS it will work. </p>
