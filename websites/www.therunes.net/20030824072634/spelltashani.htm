                      -Romar Sunto says 'I am Romar Sunto, servant of Solusek 
                      Ro. I am searching for the [coin] of the mighty enchanter 
                      [Tash] - if you are interested in helping me acquire it, 
                      I will [reward] you with a powerful spell. I am also a dispenser 
                      of the Staff of Ro, sometimes also called [darkwood staves].<br>
                      <br>
                      You say, 'What tash'<br>
                      -Romar Sunto says 'Tash was a mighty enchanter and master 
                      jewelcrafter.</p>
                    <p class="spellltext">You say, 'What reward'<br>
                      - Romar Sunto says 'I will reward you with a scroll for 
                      the spell Tashania. For personal use, of course.</p>
                    <p class="spellltext">You say, 'What coin'<br>
                      - Romar Sunto says 'Tash had a collection of ten antique 
                      silver coins that were left in different cities around the 
                      world. If you were to collect all 10 coins, I would give 
                      you a [coin pouch] that would let you combine them into 
                      the maser coin of Tash. If you are interested, I will sell 
                      you a copy of the Tome of Tash, detailing where the coins 
                      were reportedly left, for a mere 50 gold.<br>
                      <br>
                      You say, 'What coin pouch'<br>
                      - Romar Sunto says 'I will lend you this coin pouch - put 
                      all 10 antique silver coins into it and combine them into 
                      the Coin of Tash.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p class="spellltext"> Now go collect the 10 coins. The following

                      the various areas of Neriak there are no guards close by 
                      so you are safe. Cast Illusion Dark Elf, and invis (just 
                      in case) run through the large gate in front of you and 
                      head left. Go through those gates and make a right. You 
                      will see a walkway going into the rock off on towards the 
                      left. Run through it, zone. Now, illusion DE, invis. Follow 
                      the path, past the Priest of Discord and through 2 sets 
                      of gates. After 2nd gate go left, through that gate and 
                      turn left again. Follow path around. The first building 
                      on the left is the one you want. Open the door, head down 
                      the stairs. The Blind Fish will be the first door on the 
                      right. Open it and turn right, go down the stairs. Head 
                      to the window on the LEFT. Through the window you will see 
                      the bag, (as well a rod for a wizzy quest) Pick up the bag
