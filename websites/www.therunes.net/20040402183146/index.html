  <p class="spellltext">This week marks the 5th anniversary of Everquest. SOE is doing lots of ingame events serverwide. There's a scavenger hunt that rewards you with a indefinate firework staff. The longer you've been playing, the nicer the firework! You can find out more details on the scavenger hunt <a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2657" target="_blank" class="links">here. </a>For those who have accounts that were no longer active, SOE has reinstated all accounts (except those banned by SOE) and you have an opportunity to come enjoy the celebrations free of charge until April 15th. </p>
  <p class="spellltext">In addition to the Scavenger Hunt, for the next two weeks those old uber items from way back have been recreated and made better. There is a list at Lucy of all of these &quot;Fabled&quot; items. You can find the Lucy list <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=Fabled" target="_blank" class="links">here </a>and there is a thread going on our boards<a href="http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2670" class="links"> here</a>. These are only going to be ingame for about 2 weeks! So head over to those old world zones, course expect them to be camped just like the old days!</p>
  <p class="spellltext"><SPAN class=topictitle>R.A. Salvatore will produce series of Everquest novels</SPAN><SPAN 
class=gensmall>. While he's not commiting to writing one of the series yet, he's overseeing and editing the project. A long time EQ player himself, he's sure to bring the lore into the books, and many (including myself) are anxious to read the series.</SPAN><SPAN

  <p class="spellltext">Did a rather large item update. You can find that page
    in the Misc Stuff drop down menu. Mostly GOD items,<br>
    but I also added in a few items who origins are unknown. If you happen to
    know where these items came from please drop me an e-mail at Juwel@therunes.net
    so I can update them.</p>
  <p class="spellltext">I'm also getting a really nice guide written by Nanyea
    uploaded. Will let you all know when it's there. </p>
  <p><span class=linedtext>February 11, 2004</span></p>  
  <p class="spellltext">As everyone knows, yesterday Gates of Discord hit the
    shelves. The usual chaos insued on all servers as they were patched, repatched
    etc. This expansion seemed to be plagued with the usual bugs. I know personally
    I started dropping to desktop an hour after being online. /sigh</p>
  <p><span class="spellltext">The tribute system seems quite interesting though
      a bit confusing to understand at first. Here's an excellent link that explains
      how the system works,</span> <a href="http://www.rpgexpert.com/1275.html" target="_blank" class="links">RPGExpert. </a>&nbsp;<span class="spellltext">Lots
      of information can be found on our boards as it relates to enchanters,
      so be sure to stop by for the latest info. </span></p>
  <p><span class=linedtext>January 16, 2004</span> </p>
  <p class=spellltext>Next patch is scheduled for Feb 10th. The casino is scheduled
    to make it's return to Shadow Haven, and the new Tradeskill UI will be moving
    from Test to Live Servers. You can read what others think about this huge
    change on our<a href=http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1717 class=links> boards</a>. </p>
