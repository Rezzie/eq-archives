                      <span class="spellltext">The purpose of this guide is to
                            provide a general introductory through advanced overview
                            of Charm solo'n tactics. While this guide makes references
                            to higher level spells in many cases, the majority of basic
                      tactics can be applied for all levels of charming.</span></p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellbold">Show me the Money!</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">Before you begin trolling through this
                      whole guide and start to nod off before even getting through
                      the &quot;technical stuff&quot;, I'll start off with the
                      tricks/tactics to use when Charm solo'n:</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">When possible (some mobs will be immune),
                      root what your charmed pet is fighting. If/when a charm break
                      occurs you only want to have to worry about dealing with
                      the re-charm, not practice for the &quot;Running of the Bulls&quot; festival.<br>
                      If the time does come when you have to “Run with the Bulls”,
                      make sure you have up Spirit of the Wolf just in case and
                      know whether or not the mob you're fighting runs faster than
                      you.<br> 
                      Slow it. If you're planning on having your pet stick around
                      longer than 2-3 fights, slow the mob its fighting. If mana
                      cost is too intensive, use a lower level slow. Using with
                      the root tactic is a nice combo.<br> 
                      Extended Range and Detrimental Spell Haste items. Extended
                      range items are great for when you're charm solo'n in wide
                      open areas by giving you extra time for re charming by allowing
                      you to cast sooner. Detrimental Spell haste items are great
                      for both close quarters and wide open areas.<br> 
                      When fighting mobs below level 55, Mesmerization is an awesome
                      way of locking a charm broken pet down. It wears off in 30
                      seconds and gives you plenty of time to re tash and charm.<br> 
                      Haste your pet. If you like to live dangerously, hasting
                      your pet will help him finish off mobs a lot faster. Just
                      be wary when you get that charm break.<br>
                      Blur for full experience. When you just don't feel like sharing
                      the experience spoils with your pet, wait till the mob is
                      low. Back your pet off while keeping the mob is rooted. Mem
                      blur till you get the emote (identifiable by an emote or
                      NPC saying text like &quot;Eeeeeeek&quot;), then nuke it
                      dead for full experience.<br> 
                      Use the terrain. Run mobs over canyons, and use the terrain
                      to buy you extra time for that re charm. The mob has to run
                      farther to go up and down the hill when you can just run
                      straight across.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">Now, onto the nitty-gritty details for
                      you in depth readers out there who have nothing better to
                      do for the next 8-15 minutes. </p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">The Charm Line</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">In the high level zones, the PoP
                        spell lineup (lvl 61+) given to chanters is extremely powerful
                        for charm soloing. The key spells being Arcane Rune, Word
                        of Morrell, and our new Charms. The selection in the lower
                        level spells for charming are a little more limited, but
                      still effective.</span></p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">It is important to be aware of the casting
                      time, your level limits, and in special cases the duration,
                      of the Charm spell being used. From the following list you
                      should be able to find the charm spell currently in your
                      range and select the appropriate one for the level of mobs
                      that you will be charming:</p>

                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">Many Enchanters wonder about the why
                      the fixed duration Dictate spell was even added. While the
                      situations for its use are very limited, there are a few
                      places this spell can be useful. The most noteworthy is Kael.
                      The high level giants (55+) there are immune to all forms
                      of Mez, but are still flagged as charmable. Dictate can be
                      used in this situation as a 48 second crowd control spell.
                      However, this spell outlived its usefulness back during Scars
                      of Velious, and with the addition of the newer high level
                      charms it has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Though, “Frozen
                      Moses” and Sirran the Lunatic owned many a mob for the resourceful
                      and daring back in the days of Velious. Ahhhh the memories
                      of solo farming Shields' of the Void! But I digress, back
                      to the guide. /wave Salidor</p>

                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">A general and effective spell lineup
                      I've used all the way from level 16 to 65 when solo'n was
                      as follows:</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellbold">1. Command of Druzzil (Or any Charm)<br> 
                      2. Bliss (Or Level appropriate Mez)<br> 
                      2. Insanity (Or any DD)<br> 
                      4. Word of Morrell (Or Color Stun line)<br> 
                      5. Free Slot (Arcane Rune, Mesmerization, Gate, Pacification,
                      Haste, Fear, etc)<br> 
                      6. Greater Fetter (Or any root)<br> 
                      7. Forlorn Deeds (Or any Slow)<br> 
                      8. Howl of Tashan (Or any Tash)</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">I've tried to keep this spell lineup
                      as generic as possible so that it's pretty self-explanatory.
                      You should be able determine what to plug-and-play depending
                      on the level/spells of your Enchanter. The remaining part
                      of this section gives the reasoning behind each choice in
                      the spell lineup.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">1. <span class="spellbold">Command of
                        Druzzil, or any charm.</span> Typically your highest level
                        charm, but be aware that the casting time of some charms
                        can be extremely slow. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">2.<span class="spellbold"> Bliss, or
                        any mezmerize is always a must</span>. Adds can happen
                        even when we're solo'n, and its best to be prepared with
                        appropriate mez to cover the highest level mobs in that
                        area/zone.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">3. <span class="spellbold">Insanity,
                        or any direct damage spell. </span>With recent changes
                        to charm experience if your pet does the majority of the
                        damage it will receive that much more of the reward. Tossing
                        in a nuke at the beginning and letting the pet do the rest
                        will net you a decent enough reward considering the speed
                        at which the mob will die. Plus you can finish off your
                        pet at the end for full experience once its low enough.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">4. <span class="spellbold">Word of Morrell,
                        or a fast casting Color line stun.</span> When breaks do
                        happen, in close quarter situations a stun is typically
                        the best means of regaining control of your pet. For higher
                        level mobs, Word of Morrell needs to be used as the Color
                        Stun cap is 53. </p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">5. <span class="spellbold">Free slot. </span>This
                      is your flexible slot, that can be filled with whichever
                      spell you feel might be useful. Mesmerization is a great
                      spell to use if the mobs you're charming are &lt; level 55.
                      The reason is because you can Mez your old pet on a break,
                      and have 30 seconds to regain control. Arcane rune is a must
                      for high level zones. Recasting it after a charm break if
                      you were hit. This will give you a 1500 hp buffer on mobs
                      that can take it down in a matter of seconds when your WoM
                      is interrupted.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">6.<span class="spellbold"> Greater Fetter,
                        or any root. </span>This is something many enchanters will
                        want up (faster casting is typically better). In my case
                        I use the Immobilize Ring from VT to give me a free spell
                        slot.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">7.<span class="spellbold"> Forlorn Deeds,
                        or any slow.</span> When you want your pet to “go the distance” against
                        higher level mobs, this is a must. Not only does it prevent
                        your pet from taking damage, but if the mob ever gets lose,
                        your pet dies, or the unexpected happens, you spend less
                        time flinching from hits.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">8.<span class="spellbold"> Howl of Tashan,
                        or any tash.</span> Charm breaks are based off of a check
                        against magic and your level. The lower your Pet's magic
                        resistance is de buffed, generally the longer your charms
                        will last. With recent changes to many mobs this should
                        be the first spell you stick before charming.</p>
                    <p align="left" class="boldtitle">The Solo Artist formerly known as “Elder
                      Phantasamist” </p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">So now onto some key things every Solo
                      Artist should consider when getting ready to start wracking
                      in the ph4t l3wtz and Exp! No, learning l33t speak is not
                      one of them.</p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">Know the Zone Layout</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Learn the terrain you'll be fighting
                        on. Always try to choose an area relatively free of roaming
                        mobs to pull pets back to and set to guard. Use the Z-AXIS
                        to your advantage! Not talking about exploiting, but a mob
                        that has to run down a hill while you levitate across has
                        to cover that much more ground before getting to you, this
                      adds more buffer time for casting spells.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">Choosing the Right Pet</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Knowing what to charm and what to
                        leave alone it critical when dealing with hard hitting high
                        level. This comes from testing (with Gate spell up!). Tash
                        a mob, or dmg it, test to see if it summons. If &quot;You
                        will not evade me Solo Artist!&quot; message comes up, get
                        off a mez ,and gate out. If not, you possibly have a good
                        charm candidate. Further test things out using root/snares.
                        This information is critical when choosing a good high level
                        pet. Also be aware of any proc that the mob may have, this
                      can serve as a great taunt. </span> </p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">Choosing the Right Fight</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Once again, it's important that
                        you know the mob you're fighting. Its possible to take down
                        summoning mobs with a pet, but be aware when charm breaks
                        that you'll be summoned and have to deal with 2 angry NPCs.
                        Time your WoM spell right so that you get a stun on both
                      before attempting to recast on your pet and pray for no resists.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">The Pull</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Usually I lead off with Forlorn
                        Deeds (or equivalent slow). A cool high level trick is to
                        use Boggle on a pull. That will put you at -500 hate, then
                        you can send your pet in, land de buffs without much worry
                        of having aggro on yourself for long. Unless you know a target
                        has higher than normal MR, slow can be a good leadoff spell.
                        After the slow lands or is resisted, root the mob and send
                        in the pet. If you got a resist, keep root on and try to
                      slow again.</span></p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">In some cases if the mobs you're fighting
                      are unsnarable/rootable then you'll defiantly want to lead
                      off with Forlon since the pet will taunt it off you faster
                      than if you Tash + Forlorn. In this case of a resist, wait
                      for your pet to engage for awhile then land a tash and slow.
                      It'll cost your pet some hp but better his than yours.</p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">The Charm Break</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">When that &quot;Your Charm has worn
                        off&quot; message comes up, be ready with your WoM or Color
                        stun spell if you're in close quarters. Wait till the mob
                        is almost in range to begin casting so that right before
                        his first hit lands on you. Move back a little ways and re-charm.
                        Hopefully the mob your pet was on is still rooted and you've
                      been recasting after each &quot;root has worn off&quot; message.</span></p>
                    <p align="left" class="spellltext">If you're in a wide open area, take your
                        time to run out of range and recast your charm. Also, if
                        fighting lower level mobs (&lt; Level 55) using Mesmerization
                        to buy yourself 30 seconds to re tash and charm is a great
                        strategy. </p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">For the Brave and Bold</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Once you become used to dealing
                        with pets and have the timing for charm breaks down, its
                        time to add &quot;enhancements&quot;. Typically I use Epic
                        Haste on my pet since its mana free, in order to speed up
                        his kill time. If you don't have a mana free haste, just
                        use your Free Spell slot to change in and out an appropriate
                      haste.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">After the Fight</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Now that you've gained that little
                        boost to your exp bar from your recent victory, its time
                        to decide what to do with your pet. Typically when it's fighting
                        a slowed mob it will have a considerable amount of hp left
                        and will be able to kill multiple mobs before you want to
                        finish it off Chanter style (make em work for us, then give
                        em the axe for another exp boost). In which case you can
                        go do another pull. Managing pet hp is another thing which
                        takes time, especially when fighting high level mobs that
                        enrage. Watch closely to your pets health, when it gets down
                        to about 20% its time to back him off, wait for enrage to
                        end before sending him back in. Then after that, break charm
                      with a dispel, and then kill with your nukes.</span></p>
                    <p align="left"><span class="spellbold">In Closing</span><br> 
                      <span class="spellltext">Since this not a Zone Strategy but
                        more of a guide rather, I'll leave it up to you to test out
                        which make the best pets. I'm sure information about charm
                        soloing is posted all over the place, and the basics do apply
                        to the more advanced stuff. Hopefully you've picked up some
                      tips you didn't know before!</span></p>
