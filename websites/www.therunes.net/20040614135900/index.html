                        <BR>
                        I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate that. We're also inviting many members of the community to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address. <BR>
                        <BR>
      I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you loud and clear. <BR>
      <BR>
      We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost is by listening to you. <BR>

                        I got the opportunity to speak with Scott Mattson the executive director of<BR>
                customer service, you may remember him fielding questions at fanfaire in this<BR>
                regard, or before that holding a similar position for all of EA games including<BR>
                Ultima Online. Since November hes been running the ship trying to implement new<BR>
                ideas and revamp the customer service care for Everquest.<BR>
                <BR>
                And now, its soon to be here.<BR>
                <BR>
                Lets start with the new Ticket system, very similar in scope to whats in place<BR>
                for SWG; there are several components. The Knowledge Base, is an<BR>
                interactive/hybrid search tool and fix system ranging from the most common<BR>
                player issues (such as being stuck! we will get back to this) to item loss and<BR>
                reinbursement. Beyond that there is now a detailed email style area to<BR>
                communicate with customer service about your issue in depth, and more<BR>
                serverside tools to record information about what caused the event. This new<BR>
                email system will also allow you to recieve in game replies to your issue.<BR>
                Another new tool, is an offline item reinbursement doohickey, that Scott seemed<BR>
                mighty excited about, by itself, it has reduced the time it takes to recovere a<BR>
                lost item several hundred percent.<BR>
                <BR>
                We all know (read the faq on eqlive) that there is a new group of people being<BR>
                trained in India to help assist with customer issues, along with another office<BR>
                in england for non prime time issues. There is a massive amount of people being<BR>
                trained by senior guides and lead GMs to cover the "broken" non emergency<BR>
                issues offline at a much faster rate then was possible with a guide or GM in<BR>
                avatar form. Theres also been some reassignments and management changes taken<BR>
                place to help improve customer service. Each cluster (for the smaller servers)<BR>
                and major server now has a full time GM (paid sony employee) overseeing its day<BR>
                to day operations and the guides under him. This allows for more acute customer<BR>
                service to the individual servers who will know about the background of that<BR>
                server.<BR>
                <BR>
                So where does that leave our guide program? Well Aimee has been promoted to a<BR>
                new position, and Zach Sheffler a former GM has taken over. One of the new<BR>
                things you will see is that SOE is taking applications again, by the truckload<BR>
                for guides! What's the urgent need for all the guides, especially if they won't<BR>
                be handling as much direct (level 1) customer support... Why to handle content<BR>
                and events, more serverside GM events, scripted events, and general tom<BR>
                foolery. As a former guide, I can say that this will make their job, alot more<BR>
                fun and rewarding, and the Live servers are already beginning to see the<BR>
                upswing in events, and not just yer standard find NPC, Kill NPC events, in case<BR>
                you haven't noticed, check out Steamfront some time, it seems Meldrath that<BR>
                rascally gnome has been up to his old tricks and started a full out war.<BR>
                <BR>
                Anyhow, thats all I got for ya atm, but to leave on a positive note, Scott says<BR>
                that petitions regarding zone geometry issues are down 50 perc, and are<BR>
                expected to go down much further with the next DX9 patch already on test. We<BR>
                will also expect to see the new Ticket System live mid July.</span><BR>

                  Overview <BR>                  
                  <BR>
                  Epic Weapons: <BR>
                  Epic weapons are a result of completing an "epic quest." These hand-tailored quests will be available to all classes. The quest themselves will be a combination of solo, group and raid content. However, these weapons are being designed for people at the upper end of the level spectrum. <BR>                  
                  <BR>
The weapons themselves will be unique in design. Additionally, the weapons will have specialized characteristics that set them apart from traditional weapons. <BR>
<BR>
Level Cap Increase: <BR>
The level cap increase is being designed to allow players the ability to reach levels above 65. With the level cap increase, new items, spells and quests will be available. <BR>
<BR>
Guild Tribute System <BR>
This system is extremely similar to the Tribute system that's currently in game. However, the main difference is that Guild Tribute will affect the entire guild, instead of the individual. <BR>
<BR>
Task System: <BR>
The task system allows players to go to various zones and request a task. These tasks are being designed for quick completion and are initially aimed at lower level players. <BR>
<BR>
Custom PC Titles: <BR>
Players will be able to select titles for their characters based on various accomplishments. These titles will be available across all levels. <BR>
<BR>
New Disciplines/AAs/Items/Spells/Quests/Tradeskills : <BR>
New disciplines, AAs, items, spells, quests and tradeskills continue to make EverQuest the most compelling and persistent online world ever created. <BR>
<BR>
Improved Graphics: <BR>
Discover rich new zones, detailed environments with expanded graphical features, improved spell effects and all-new NPC character models to fight.</span><SPAN class=postbody><BR>

  Greetings Norrath! <BR>                  
                  <BR>
                  Gates of Discord is being tuned to rework many of the experience areas to better balance the expansion for all classes. It is our hope that this re-tuning will allow for more group diversity and better use of individual class skills while maintaining the challenge of the new content. We hope to roll out these changes within the next 2 weeks. Here's a quick breakdown of what's changed - <BR>
                  * Experience has been increased in several zones. <BR>
                  * Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges. <BR>
                  * NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank mobs they previously had difficulty with. <BR>
                  * Spell drops have been increased. <BR>
                  * Zone travel has been made easier. <BR>
                  * NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. <BR>
                  * Animals in various zones across Gates have been made non-agro. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Note: Please keep in mind that these changes do not affect every zone. <BR>
                  We would like to thank all of the folks on the Test Server who have been helping with the re-working of the encounters and we hope that you enjoy the changes when they go live in the very near future. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Thanks all! <BR>
