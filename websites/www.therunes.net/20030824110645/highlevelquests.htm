                      discuss it and then leave out the front door. Now kill both 
                      Miller (Lvl 47 WAR) and Arbogast (Lvl 49 CLR) and you will 
                      obtain a Heavy Wrap, 2 No Rent swords, a Clasp, a Shimmering 
                      Mace and some Baleen Plate. Place the Clasp in the Heavy
