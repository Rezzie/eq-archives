<font color="blue">Ack!  Sorry I haven't been around for so long!  *dodges the thrown objects*  But I've been busy with other stuff.  What could be more important then Swordstrike, you say?  Well, EverQuest first of all, Kunark second (although I try to come up every once in a while to post things), and my trip to Hawaii.  Actually, I'd have to say the high point of my trip to Hawaii was when we were just in the bus, about to leave the parking lot and be taken to the actual air port, over the drivers radio-thingy, someone said, "We've got another one for you." He responded saying, "Sorry I have a <i><b>CODE 1</b></i>!", and we took off like a bat outa the PoF.  I've never seen a bus go that fast before, let alone be in one.  Okay, now to the meat of the post.  With Kunark out, there are tons of people hitting 51, so 'grats to all them.  Wonder who hits 52 first?  Anyway, warrior now get new disiples, or 'special moves' as I would call them.  I think they'll be like a monks special moves (tiger claw, roundhouse kick, etc.) Here they are: <blockquote><font color="silver">
<b>EVASIVE</b> <i>(Level 52)</i>:<BR> The warrior is hit by his opponent less often, but also will hit his target less often. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>CHARGE</b> <i>(Level 53)</i>:<BR> When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent. In other words, he will not miss. This discipline lasts for 14 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>MIGHTY STRIKE</b> <i>(Level 54)</i>:<BR> When using this discipline, all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows. This discipline lasts for 10 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>DEFENSIVE</b> <i>(Level 55)</i>:<BR> The warrior takes less melee damage, but also deals less. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>FURIOUS</b> <i>(Level 56)</i>:<BR> When using this discipline, the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on him by the opponent he is facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>PRECISION</b> <i>(Level 57)</i>:<BR> The warrior will have a greater chance to hit his target, but will also have a greater chance of being hit. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>FELL STRIKE</b> <i>(Level 58)</i>:<BR> When using this discipline, all hits landed by the warrior will be for at least four times the base weapons damage. This discipline lasts for 12 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>FORTITUDE</b> <i>(Level 59)</i>:<BR> When using this discipline, the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.
<BR><BR>
<b>AGGRESSIVE</b> <i>(Level 60)</i>:<BR> The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed, but will also take more damage as well. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 27 minutes.

Well, hope you like that, and good luck everyone in Kunark!<BR>

Well its time for a semi-rant.  A little while ago, as all of you know, Verant introduced a new set of guidelines for us players to follow.  The Play Nice Policies.  Now like alot of people i know, i see nothing wrong with their basic consepts, but the general flaw is that since we are playing a game should we also be allowed to know how to treat our fellow players?  These new rules are highly exploitable by most anyone playing EQ, and are, i am sure, used in a small minority of the time to help the underdog and improve gameplay.  Now I thought, "great, they made rules, well these probably wont effect the game any more than it has always been, right?".  I was wrong.  Multiple times already have these rules harmed those whom are my friends in EQ, and helped the item farmers, and would be ksers.  Now if your an item farmer you dont have to wait for the group already there to leave, you can just enforce the pnp's and FORCE OTHER PLAYERS, to bend to your will!  Also you dont have to kill steal anymore, you can just force others to share the spawn, only the rare spawn, and thus make it so they must do all the hard work to keep you safe, only for you to kill the named mob half the time!   Unfortunatly, all i can see from these new guidelines is that it helps all the necromancers and other solo classes, now they can force the majority of players to do their bidding. <BR>
Ady was already done an injustice by these rules, as you can see from his earlier posts.  In essence becasue enchanters cannot control their pets, and his pet fought back (much like those around him)  he was given a warning for not obeying the order a guide had assigned them. <BR>
Like last night i was on and hunting in upper guk.  I had previously grouped with a couple caster types at the AC (Ancient Croc) and they had all gotten what they were there for, and i had been getting decent exp.  As they began to leave, one by one, because like most casters they had no reason to stay with the warrior cause they already had what they needed, i stayed and did a fairly decent job of soloing the spawns.  Along comes someone who is 10 levels below me, and asserts that because i cannot USE the items, (i can, they are ALL/ALL) that i should not be there, or should give him the AC spawn.  Since this doesnt fit in even in the pnp's i declined.  I merely lied and stated that i would give the person the leggings the molment i got em.  Content he left.  Later that evening, several hours after i had left the AC spot a guide came and had a little chat with me about camping spawns solo, and that i should have shared the spawn and yadda yadda...  Turns out next time i try to get exp in this maner i can get a warning?  Wheres the logic in that?  (P.S. i never actually GOT anything from yesterday except exp.)  <BR>
Also i would like to say that neither Verant, nor the player base,  should decide merely from our classes what items we do or dont need.  I mean that if an item is ALL/ALL but only boosts int, or some other useless skill to a warrior, who is to say that i dont want to wear the item anyway?  <BR>
Well theres a big rant for yall to read.... hehe enjoy.<BR><BR>

<font color="silver"><blockquote>
<b>Ooooh... Someone has dared me to comment, thus issuing a challenge! I must respond!</b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI, when are you going to...? 
<BR><BR>
<b>Soon(tm) </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI, what are you going to...? 
<BR><BR>
<b>Nothing planned really. </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI, how can you explain...? 
<BR><BR>
<b>Well I *could* explain it, but does it really matter? </b>
<BR><BR>
Abashi, 4 GM's personally harassed me, forced me to give up a spawn for their favorite players to play, here I have it logged: "A_GM_guy tells you, 'Sorry it's against our policy to do anything' SEE? THE WHOLE THING RIGHT THERE 
<BR><BR>
<b>Oh, ouch. That sounds bad. I see your point. </b>
<BR><BR>
Abashi, you told me that my class was getting an ubertwink...now look, it's been 3 whole seconds since that post, NO TWINKAGE!! How do expect to explain that? 
<BR><BR>
<b>I'm sorry, the ubertwink has been delayed. The dev team found it necessary to blink. </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI, my class must be useless, I was once casting a spell and it fizzled and it costed mana; is Verant aware of these bugs? 
<BR><BR>
<b>Bugs? I assume by bugs you mean "Fire Beetles". </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI, I have been playing for 10 minutes and I haven't been invited to a single dragon raid. My class is useless. 
<BR><BR>
<b>I think you may have forgotten to press the "Play EverQuest" button. </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI, when are you going to give us the gm /kill command? Obviously this is favoritism towards GMs. 
<BR><BR>
<b>It's queued right after the ubertwink which is right after we blink. </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI this is the GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT ok only PRETTY GOOD sister of all wood elf posts!!! 
<BR><BR>
<b>As long as it's not the mother-in-law of all wife posts, I'm interested. </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI!! If you don't reply in 3 days I will cancel my account, wreck my car, and kill my goldfish!!! (that oughtta work) 
<BR><BR>
<b>How do you define "3"? </b>
<BR><BR>
ABASHI this is the GERMAN SHEPHERD of all DOG posts! Why wolves and no dogs?? HUH??? 
<BR><BR>
<b>Have you pet your Druid today? </b>
<BR><BR>
Abashi, once I was walking and I got a LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... message...obviously this indicates serious serverside lag!!! Fix it!!! 
<BR><BR>
<b>Ok sir, please put down the keyboard and slowly back away. </b>
<BR><BR>
Abashi, I always wanted a pony...this is a roleplaying game and there are centaurs but no ponies...wtf is with that?? How can I roleplay an unrealistic environment? 
<BR><BR>
<b>You're right. I want a pony, too. </b>
<BR><BR>
Abashi, I have several issues you need to address.
<BR><BR>
1. Damage. I can barely solo a red when I'm oom 
<BR><BR>
<b>Out of Manacotti? NOOOOO! Say it isn't so!!!! </b>
<BR><BR>
2. Hit points. If I get more than half a dungeon training on me, I have to zone. This is highly inconvenient. 
<BR><BR>
<b>Make use of that /kill command right after the blink-n-twink. </b>
<BR><BR>
3. Items. In the last patch, Verant lowered my classes quest items by almost 30 or 40 points...this 1% decrease is highly unfair to our class. 
<BR><BR>
<b>We haven't nerfed them, those quests just all start now by you /hailing Nagafen. </b>
<BR><BR>
4. Drops. I camped an item for almost 10 minutes and didn't see a single drop, not even a common one. 
<BR><BR>
<b>You might consider killing the critter. It's a bit of a prerequisite to a drop. </b>
<BR><BR>
5. Spells. I keep having to pay money for these things???? Come on, my character should be able to learn them by rote, even make them up...see post 361 appendix A article 2 where I made some suggestions on the kind of spells my monk should be able to invent on the fly... 
<BR><BR>
<b>Please forward me the library of congress catalog number of your post, I'll be happy to take a look. </b>
<BR><BR>
6. Duelling; somebody beat me the other day; obviously his class is supieror to mine. Make mine the better one or I'll cancel my account. 
<BR><BR>
<b>Well I would suggest that you make use of the post-blink-n-twink /kill command, but since he'll have it too, we'll put in a confirmation box. "Are you sure you want to be /killed by [charactername]?" </b>
<BR><BR>
7. Money. What's with this $10 a month bullcrap?? I already paid for the cd and everything cut me some friggan slack 
<BR><BR>
<b>Hey, we all need something to wallpaper our dens with. </b>
<BR><BR>
8. Overcrowding; once someone got to a camp before me, and there were almost 5 people in the zone when I logged in. Can we have a server-wide split like some of those other panzy servers are doing? 
<BR><BR>
<b>The other panzy servers have been sacked. </b>
<BR><BR>
9. PVP. The other day, a guy attacked me while I was OBVIOUSLY not prepared to combat him. We should get a yes/no box asking "Are you ready?" before somebody is allowed to damage us. 
<BR><BR>
<b>See number 6. </b>
<BR><BR>
10. Mana use: It takes me almost 1/4 bubble a mana to cast my "instant-death" spell. Obviously this is a mistake; I can barely solo 4 rooms at a time this way!! 
<BR><BR>
<b>The instant-death spell has been sacked. </b>
<BR><BR>
11. Pets. In the last patch, you nerfed my pet not to go around tracking automatic blue things and kill them for me. how the heck am I supposed to level while I'm at work now? 
<BR><BR>
<b>Work? You've been sacked. </b>
<BR><BR>
12. Spamming; the other day almost 300 people told me 'Welcome to ignore.' How can I stop this harassment?? Also; these other people kept on shouting when I was trying to tell the zone something and auctioning when I was trying to sell something. Others could barely hear me! This is an obvious breach of serious etiquette. 
<BR><BR>
<b>I suggest you make serious and judicious use of /ignore. </b>
<BR><BR>
13. Logging in; it takes me almost 4.89 seconds to enter Everquest, and on top of that, I get disconnected almost once every other month!! My time is valuable; can we fix this? 
<BR><BR>
<b>*blink* </b>
<BR><BR>
<b>Sorry, what was that? </b>
<BR><BR>
14. Patches. THIS THE BIG ONE; Why the HECK do you guys keep turning EQ off for several hours just so some stupid flamers can get their twink upgrade???? COME ON AND PLEASE stop foolin with the selfish kiddies I WANNA PLAY RIGHT NOW!!! 
<BR><BR>
<b>We're just trying to pretend that we do something beyond wallpapering our dens with your $10/month.

<font color="blue">Well, well, well.  I'd have to say that EQ is one of the best games I've ever played.  Its managed to hold my attention for hours on end, which is very hard to do (just ask Sparty! =).  But there is a point where the game becomes less of a game and begins to become a bunch of siblings bickering and a parent trying uselessly to get them to quiet down.  The new Play Nice policy has to be one of the stupidest things that Verant has ever come up with.  No, wait, scratch that, the way the Play Nice policy is ENFORCED is lacking, and makes no sense to me.  I've been playing EverQuest since June of '99.  I know a lot of you have played longer, but I have to hold to the fact that I have played this game and know a lot about it and how it works.  <BR><BR>Today my group decided to take Orcs at High Pass.  The normal way of things on my server, and other servers (as I understand) is that they are a FFA, because too many of them spawn at once in too small of a spot to be regulated.  I guess someone had a problem with the FFA.  After about 10 minutes of decent XP, and no one complaining about it, a GM showed up and decided it was time to put these new "Play Nice" rules into enforcement.  Every group had to roll, and the groups would get one creature, and rotate in and out.  Just as she says this, and orc spawns on me.  Fighting back, as everyone else was (my group didn't even get the XP), I was issued a warning for "Taking the spawn out of rotation."  I'm sorry but that is a crock of bull.  I was simply defending myself.  After contesting the GM for a bit, she me that she would "present the problem at the next meeting".  Sounds to me like I'm guilty until proven innocent, and I'm going to trial without being able to defend myself.  I guess thats the way Verant works.  I wasn't supposed defend myself against the orc that attacked me, and I won't be able to defend myself in a discussion to deside if the warning was fair.  The GM even told me that she was setting me up for a let down because "Verant stands firmly on the new Play Nice policy".  I end this post/rant with a quote from Abashi regarding the Play Nice policy.  Maybe she should check up on what her superiors say more often.  "<font color="silver">The purpose of the Play Nice Policies is to discourage people from being anti-social jerks...</font>".  Who was being the "anti-social jerk" here? You decide.<BR>
<i>-Aderyn</i></font>
<BR><BR>
Hmmm check out what Abashi thinks about warriors in EQ......<BR>
<font color="silver"><blockquote> ---Verants Vision of warriors was to make them the one class that was totally dependant on other classes.
That's a pretty half-empty way to look at the glass, coming from the class that is considered the most valuable in the game by most people I've seen polled. Of course that means "most valuable to the group", which if it is the "group" part of that that you disagree with, I think anyone could have told you in the first days of EverQuest that Warriors weren't exactly designed to be solo.

I changed the quote!  Its from another <i>Forgotten Realms</i> book, so as you can see, I'm a little pressed for quotes.

It was a quote from a book, which I'm quoting... whatever.  You'll live.<BR><BR>
Some ideas on the Dragon Song:  An opening for Kunkark, IE the dragons will freely roam the area.  Another idea, which I think I've already stated, is that its a GM event for the opening of the PoA.  Time will tell, I guess =)<BR><BR>

<font color="blue">Well, I was in Steamfont Mountians today, and I came upon a bard.  A normal occurance, you say?  No, this was no ordinary bard.  Sainy Dragonfriend was her name, and she had a blue drake pet with her.  She went into singing a song, which I got stored into my eqlog.  Heres the song for ya:
<blockquote><font color="silver">
I follow Veeshan...I shall now sing my song<BR><BR>
From the world's core, the rock children rose<BR>
Shielded from wurms eyes by dirt and stone<BR>
With gnarled hands and broken bones<BR>
They carved their place into Veeshan's home<BR>
Soon after, the woodlands and deserts and swamps<BR>
All nurtured life planted, by interloping Gods<BR>
Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her lair<BR>
turned her back on Norrath, and her fellow God's laws<BR>
The Crystallin Dragon content in her lair<BR>
Sealed off the Sky and still slumbers there<BR>
Some dragons went made, apart from their queen<BR>
Others took charge and formed a wurm Ring<BR>
The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks<BR>
To dwell in the lands inhabited by the weak<BR>
One of these rebels, a lady white as snow<BR>
Swept up a shard of a nature unknown<BR>
As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell<BR>
Into a deep slumber from what no one could tell<BR>
Their magic had faded, because of the Shard?<BR>
Or perhaps from the magic they call Veeshan's Veil<BR>
Now a new verse to this legend I'll share<BR>
In regards to Sky and what is happening there<BR>
Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin<BR>
The Wurm Queen's neglect wakes her children again<BR><BR>
My song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of my verse, for they speak the truth.<BR>
And only dragons once dwelled<BR>
but the door to Sky is not a one way portal<BR>
There is much to learn from the great Wurms<BR>
and much to fear<BR><BR>
I must be off...come my drake friend

There ya go. Try to make some sense outa it.  Go ahead and email any ideas.  What I'm thinking is that there's going to be a GM quest similar to the one upon the opening of the PoH, but theres going to be dragons with this one.  Another thing that I'm thinking, is because she said, "There is much to learn from the great Wurms" that there might be a 'hail'able dragon in this gm quest.  Who knows?  Oh yes, I have also uploaded my <a href="GMQuest.txt" target="_blank"><B>eqlog</b></a> so that you can look at what she said.  Of course, I cleared out the clutter.<BR><BR>

<font color="blue">Well, its been getting kind of slow, and I must apoligize for the lack of updates on both Sparty's and my part.  I have, although, been working diligently on the new page, and I'm hoping it'll be up by the end of the month.  It's looking really good, and I'm just putting the finishing touches on now.  When I do finish, we'll open up the new page to a 'beta' testing, so that all you guys can go check it out and make sure its not bugged up or anything :-)  So hold tight, and you'll get some results.  Thanks for your patience, and I really gotta put another poll up there... that one's getting kinda boring, dont you think?

I must appologize for the amount of time its taken me to answer some of the Hotmail msgs...  I have been having modem trouble, (still am... had to answer the msgs from school...) And you dont even want to know how long it took me to transfer this all through my FTP editor...  BUT i answered some E-mails, and updated the other armor section.  Thanks again <font color="grey">LordBob</font> for the Skull Shaped Barbute stats...  I appologize again to him for the amount of time it took me to respond to his email (10 whole days!) But bare with me, i had HD problems and am still recovering from a hard formating....  If i get a cable modem soon then probably i wont have problems anymore *crosses fingers*  So sorry again...<BR>
