<BR><BR><HR><BR>
Shakm Meadowgreen makes:
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Helm</i> - <BR>to get it, give the horse-butt* a Fire Totem [This can be
gotten off of the Fire Goblin High Cleric in Nagafen;s Lair and the
Inferno Goblin Shaman in Solusek's Eye {Sol A and B respectively for you
old-timers :} and a few other fire goblin casters]. Also, he wants TWO
Ruby STONES. These are ONLY found in the shop next to the bank in the
Erudin Palace, to my knowledge, and so evil races may want to make a
mule character. Also beware they cost about 160 plat a pop.
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Gauntlets</i> - <BR>Give Shakm an Aviak Charm [off of those crazy
Avocets flying about SK] and TWO STAR Rubies. Star Rubies are a pain in
the ass, because they've only been seen in (at least when my guild
friend did the quest he only knew of) a female NPC in Felwithe who's
standing near the fishing shop and the jewelry shop in Qeynos.  They are also sold in a little hut in front of the Befallen zone in West Commonlands. They'll
run you about 80 pp each.
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Boots</i> - <BR>Now Shakm wants a Frost Totem [Ice Goblin Patriarchs and
High Shamans in Permafrost] and TWO Sapphires. Sapphires can be snatched
off of the same two shops as listed for the Star Rubies, only they'll
run you about 120 pp. Bleh.
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Vambraces</i> - <BR>Shakm wants an Eye of Griffon [gee, I wonder where
to get one of those] and TWO Fire Emeralds. Fire Emeralds cost a nasty
110pp or so and you'll find them in the Jade Dragon, a shop in North Freeport. Also, they can be found in Qeynos in their Jeweler shop.  Again, screw you, evil
races! : P
<BR><BR>
Next, we have the half-man, half-dog food Ulan who makes:
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Bracers</i> - <BR>One Evil Eye Optic Nerve [Found on evil eyes but I got
them on the first kill with Borxx in Runnyeye] and ONE Sapphire.
Sapphires are about 120 pp and found in Qeynos jewlery shop or a female
elf in Felwithe near the fishing shop. Note that to get two bracers, you
have to do the above twice.
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Greaves</i> - <BR>A Dark Circlet [An NPC named Trazdon in Najena, he
hangs out around the Bonecrusher room] and TWO STAR Rubies. Star Rubies
will run you a nasty 80 pp or so each and you get them from the same
shops as the Sapphires listed above.
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Paldrons</i> - <BR>Three pieces of the Rune of Dwarves [Just smack up
Evil Eyes and Borxx in Runnyeye, random drop] and ONE Fire Emerald. The
Fire Emerald is found in the Jade Dragon shop in North Freeport. Good
luck, inkies, greenies, and fatsos.
<BR><BR>
<i>Crafted Breastplate</i> - <BR>One Talon [Supposedly off werewolves but much more
easily off several named NPCs in Mistmoore, most notably the Gypsy
Musician and Butler Sinclair and Maid Issis], and three good old,
regular, Rubies. Yes, THREE RUBIES. Break the bank, the old fashioned
way! By the way, Rubies are found at most jewelry shops - no crazy
locations. They also run a sinister amount (I had to log before he got
the Breastplate, let me go check some sites and send you an update if I
find the price).
<BR><BR>
<b>MULE CHARACTER TIP:</b><BR> Make an Enchanter with maxxed out CHA and 5 in
whatever stat you want (like Wisdom, since this IS a stupid mule
character). This makes buying easier. Example: in Felwithe, create an
Enchanter with 115 CHA and make your buy. Yay! =)

<b>TIP:</b><BR>
Where to buy gems if you're evil:<BR>
They are all on sale in the shop Shinie Tings (or whatever) in the troll/ogre section of Neriak Foreign Quarter. You can buy them cheapest by making a DE enchanter and pumping up the CHA.
