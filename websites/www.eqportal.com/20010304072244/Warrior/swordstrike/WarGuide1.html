warrior class is rather simple, but when played well it is very fun and
popular. To understand how to play a warrior, one must first choose which race
you wish to be… In popular opinon the large races make the best warriors,
seeing how they have the lowest int and char, and highest str and stamina… The
3 large races are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Ogres are the best
     warriors statistic wise, they have the most base stats. Ogres already have
     such a high str, and stam, they can devote almost all their training
     points for agility and dexterity (see important statistics) Ogres are at a
     disadvantage though because they can only wear LARGE armor, and are an
     evil race and thus limits their bindable cities.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Barbarians are the most
     popular large race warriors, because they are an accepted race, have high
     str and stamina, and have the best newbie area in the world.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Trolls have all right
     stats, but are not better than ogres, but are above barbarians, trolls
     also have a special regeneration ability, which allows them to gain 4hp
     instead of 1 like the other races, this is really the only reason to play
     a troll. This will greatly reduce your downtime after a battle, but then
     again you could just bring a cleric along : P</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The other races will be
     added later…</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
statistics warriors need are often overlooked, and thus can be a major
disadvantage at higher levels. Verant highlights Strength and Stamina as the
primary statistics of a warrior, but Agility and Dexterity are just as, if not
more important than str and stam…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">       </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Many
have argued that warriors are not the most exciting class to play, seeing as
casters get a whole new set of spells every 6 levels, and hybrids (paladins,
sks, rangers) get new abilities and spells, but in contrast, warriors are
always in the front of the battle, and NEVER have to meditate! Warriors also
get the glory of battle, seeing as the cowardly wizard is blasting the monster
while the warrior is doing his/her best to battle the mob and keep it on him,
rather than going off killing the cowardly caster.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>The
downside of warriors is that you won’t be soloing much at later levels.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Warriors will never be able to kill steal,
and you always will have to beg for a teleport from your more privileged
casting friends, who will think of you as a nuisance… On a side note, almost
all the casters you will encounter never have played a melee class, thus they
don’t understand the incredible distances that you have to cover to get from
dungeon to dungeon. Once I was even told to learn how to teleport myself by an
arrogant wizard who wasn’t so arrogant once he didn’t have a tank :-) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>Traditionally warriors are the leaders of a group. They
are the ones who brave the foes first. They are the first ones who take the
damage, and often they are the first to die. A warrior must have faith in his
party members. A warrior needs to have the courage to stand and fight until his
healers get enough mana to throw him a heal. A warrior must have the heart to
stand in there while the wizards get the mana to deal the death blow. As a
result of this a warrior is often the one who makes an impression on the crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Warriors
aquire all the skills of a melee class, and get them around 5 levels before
their hybrid cousins, who also don’t get as many, warriors skills:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Level
1: Kick, this skill will not be important for the larger races because Slam
allows you to bash the monster, and stun them, also interrupting their spell,
but the med and small races will love it, because it does not require a shield <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Level
5: Bind wound, you will most likely only use this skill when your early on,
when warriors are still soloing, lvl 1 – 10, but it is nice to help your
friends heal, when there are no clerics nearby<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Level
6: Dodge, this skill allows you to have a chance to dodge, and increases your
armor class…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Level
6: Bash(if your not a large race), this is another damage dealer, like kick,
and the 2 cannot be used at the same time, bash is superior to kick from its
extra stun and interrupt, but for the smaller races it requires a shield… stick
to kick unless your large<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Level
10: Parry,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>another ac buffer, like
dodge<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Level 13/15 These are the warriors power levels. At level
13/15 you get your two most important skills: Double attack and duel wield.
Level 13 gives dual wield and level 15 double attack. It is wise to save up
most of your training points to pour into these two stats. Double attack allows
you to hit twice per round. Duel wield allows you to have the option of using
two one handed weapons and thus theoretically be able to get up to four attacks
per round. These skills go up slowly and are not overly effective at first, but
once they start gaining in skill you will notice a huge difference in
effectiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>Level
25: Riposte, Another AC increaser, like Dodge and Parry<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Level 35: Disarm, allows you to knock a weapon out of your
opponents hands(although it very rarely works). This can accomplish two things.
First off it can get you a nice weapon if you are lucky. Secondly a monster
with a weapon hits quite a bit harder than a monster without one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Warriors do not make great solo players for several
reasons. The first one to become obvious is the fact that monsters run. At the
first couple levels you will be able to finish these runners off in a swing or
two and it will not be that big of a deal. As the monsters get tougher however
they will require quite a few hits to finish. In a dungeon environment this is
especially dangerous because they will lead you into more monsters, who will
most likely join in, causing a train, which will not only make you rather
unpopular, but also cause your death. In a party you will usually have casters
who can root the monster or finish it off with a direct damage spell.<br>
<br>
The second weakness that becomes apparent around level 5 is that warriors heal
slowly. Warriors have more hit points than any other class yet they heal at the
same rate. At higher levels you can expect to rest for up to 20 minutes if you
are fully damaged. You can invest in bark potions or quest for a Squad Ring
(unless you are an evil race) but these can be expensive or hard to achieve.
This factor probably more than anything else will lead a warrior to team with
some sort of healer. <br>
<br>
The third weakness with a warrior is the amount of time it takes him to kill
monsters at higher levels. A properly equipped warrior may be able to kill the
same monsters as a casting class of the same level but it will usually take the
warrior much longer. This is to be expected. We hit for less damage and can
absorb much more. However in the amount of time it takes you to finish off your
opponent the chance continues to grow that another monster will respawn or walk
accross your path thus spoiling your fun and possibly forcing you to run. This
can be quite frustrating to fight a monster for a couple minutes only to be
forced to run empty handed and then rest for 10-15 minutes as a result of it.<br>
<br>
The fourth glaring weakness of a warrior is the lack of his ability to cure
himself of diseases and poisons. This becomes evident as you begin to gain
levels and more or less makes entire dungeons (such as Befallen, or Unrest)
completely impossible for a warrior to solo in. Some diseases can last for
hours and in the meantime you will be unable to heal (or even worse you will be
losing hit points) until some nice cleric comes along and cures your disease.</p>

<span style='font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA'>All in all, warriors are a GREAT class to play, if
played correctly. So if you like being the group leader, being in the thick of
the fighting, and depending on others to keep you alive, the warrior class is
for you! Warriors are defiantly my favorite class, but we will never have the
quick kills like wizards…</span>
