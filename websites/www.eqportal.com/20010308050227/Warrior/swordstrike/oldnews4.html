<font color="blue">I was cruising around <a href="http://www.eqvault.com" target="_blank">EQVault</a> and I came across this player posted article (unfortunitly, I cant find the name of the orignal poster... if anyone knows, please <a href="mailto:swordstrike@hotmail.com">E-Mail</a> me.)<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="silver">Everytime I hear people complain about nerfing and say that a game should never be nerfed, I think, man... what an idiot. I'm glad they aren't in charge of game development! <BR><BR>
The sad thing is, these people actually think this is a good idea. <BR><BR>
To give some of these people the benefit of the doubt (On the surface, this idea sounds ok) I'm going to walk through an example of game balancing without nerfing. <BR><BR>
For the ease of the example, I will use Ultima Online. Class balancing in Everquest is a bit more complex and I'd rather not be typing for an hour. For those of you not aware of UO, basically your 'adventuring' folks were all of one class: Tank mage. The difference being that, when developing the character, did you develop magic first then add swords, or swords first then add magic. <BR><BR>
In the early days of Ultima Online, certain types of offensive spells had a damage bonus based on the type of armor being cast against. If you cast a Lightning bolt on someone in platemail it would do more damage than someone in leather (etc). <BR><BR>
The problem was, Lightning bolts were killing or almost killing people in one blow. And Mages were running around completely naked (to keep from getting the extra damage) taking people out with one, sometimes two blasts. <BR><BR>
Choice: Do you lower the damage of LBolt or lower/eliminate the armor bonus to spells? <BR><BR>
Well, lets say we can't nerf. <BR><BR>
So, we decide to balance this without nerfing. Bearing in mind that UO had no classes (completely skill based) and we can't just raise a classes hp, we decide to do what sounds logical. When someone wears armor they will get an HP bonus as well as an AC bonus. Sounds great, right? <BR><BR>
Now warriors are able to easily take out monsters because they have these extra hit points. They are sweeping through dungeons. Mages, formerly naked, are now donning armor as well and sweeping through those dungeons. <BR><BR>
Uh oh. Well, easily solved, we'll just give the creatures some extra hp. This will make for a little longer battles but to keep them within reason we'll also increase the creatures damage a little. <BR><BR>
Now, we think we have it solved. Only now people aren't using spells much at all. Since monsters have added hit points, the spells aren't as effective against them. Since monsters hit harder. Spells are primarely used against other characters only, since that's the only time they are truely effective. <BR><BR>
So, of course, we have to start raising the damage of spells.... (And hope we get it right, or we'll be doing the full circle again!). <BR><BR>
END RESULT: We've spent a lot of programming time raising every thing in the game to offset an overpowered spell. Our goal, after this huge development task, is to "on average" make the original spell effect weaker. But since we couldn't just weaken it (nerf it), we had to raise everything about it, cause the game to go through huge imbalances, and get the final result. <BR><BR>
WHAT DO THE PLAYERS GAIN BY THIS: Nothing. By raising everything else but the original overpowered spell (skill, ability, whatever), we have affectively "lowered" the power of that spell. <BR><BR>
WHAT DO THE PLAYERS LOSE BY THIS: They lose a lot of development time that could have been concentrated on other game problems. QUESTION: <BR><BR>
Why do you people think this would be better? Instead of "nerfing" the DoTs, you would prefer they increase the damage of DD spells, and Melee combat by 20% and raise all MoB hit points by 20%? That'd make you happy? <BR><BR>
(And I hear them whine, Just leave them alone! Oh great, now we want a static game. Why didn't we just by Might and Magic VII? You can be sure they won't make changes to that game over and over keeping it new and fresh. No, we'd prefer people to gradually choose Necromancers and Druids over all else so we can kite and life tap everything to death... Personally, I'd prefer that they keep putting new things into the game. And when something is not in balance, I'd prefer if they fix it. If I buy a broken game, I want a patch to fix the game...) <BR><BR>
Anyway, on to the conclusion. Conclusion. People who wine that Verant should never nerf, why aren't you playing AC? <BR><BR>
</font></blockquote>
And then Brad McQuaids response:<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="white">Well said :) <BR><BR>
In summary, we either a. do nothing, b. directly fix the problem, or c. indirectly fix the problem, invariably costing us a lot more time and risking imbalancing other aspects of the game. <BR><BR>
The 'mud wimping' article that's so popularly posted everywhere seems to advocate either a. or c. Your post illustrates the problems associated with c. quite effectively. <BR><BR>

<BR><BR>Merry Christmas everyone!  Just got on today cause I thought that you guyz deserved an explination for why the updates have been so slow lately.  I've been working on a ***NEW*** and ***IMPROVED*** SwordStrike.  It is going to cover Warriors, Shadow Knights, Paladins, Rogues, and Rangers.  Currently one of Sparty friends might help us out (hes a paladin) but other then that I'll be trying to learn as much as I can about the respective classes and trying to make myself a somewhat expert.  Now, I know that I cant really be an expert unless I've played any of the classes through a certian level, so I'm asking you guyz to sendin any Guides or anything that you might want posted on the new site about any of the classes.  Well, Merry Christmas!<BR>

Wow, sorry my sparatic updates...  I posted a new link in our links section, its to EQ CrossFire.  Its hosted on geocities,  but its so he can remain independant.  Although on GeoCities the site DOES load rather fast, and has a wealth of great information!  EQ CrossFire is administrated by a former guide, and a good friend of mine who knows quite alot more than i do.... Hes also a better writer...  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/area51/6248/">EQ CrossFire</a><BR>

I posted a great guide for warriors (specifically trolls, but could work for any evil race) that CAN get you from level 1 to 22 in 3 days, if you start out with an FS 2hander, but thats easy to aquire these days :)  Good reading!

Well, upon seeing that the guise of the deciever has been removed from dropping, and a new BARD AND ROGUE only item put in to fill the void (probably just so that the bards and rogues wouldnt complain too...)  I got pissed and sat down and wrote up a rant about it.. Verant has really gone just a bit too far with this one.  In my rant i proposed some possible solutions to the problem OTHER than the ending of spawning. Follow the hyperlink below, read it and respond via msg board or email.

<BR><BR>Well, sorry bout not updating much lately, just recently got Ultima 9, which is a decent game, but if you dont have a top notch computer then its hardly worth the effort...  (My computer doesnt have glide, so its sooo clippy and slow, and its 400mhz...)  The game has incredable graphics, and decent controls, which if you want CAN be edited inside the game.  <BR>
Ultima 9 
Graphics:: 5 outa 5
Storyline:: 5 outa 5
Controls:: 3 outa 5, hard as heck to learn, but effective after.
The downside of the game is its prone to crashes, and is rather clippy(for me)  but its really really fun, and i love how all the npc's talk!

<font color="blue">Hey, I'm trying out the site with the blue 'fire' on the right.  I think it looks pretty good that way, but I'm not sure if its actually better then both sides red.  I'll just keep the news section like this for a while so that people can look at it.
<BR><BR>
In other news, I'm thinking about updating the weapons and equipment sections so that there are screenshots.  I think it'll help out the site, and it'll help me organize.  Also I'd keep a version in TEXT only so that ppl who only want to spend a little while checking can do so quickly.  The format would be a table, with the name of the armor on the left, and there would be links to the different types on the right... something like:<BR>
<BR><table border="3">
<tr><TD>Leather Armor</td><td><a href="index2.html">Helm</a></td><td><a href="index2.html">Shoulders</a></td><td> . . . </td></tr></table><BR><BR>
So you get the idea.  I'll just work on it whenever the opprutunity arises.  (That makes ETA sometime in June 2032 :-)<BR><i>-Aderyn</i></font>

Well its December now, and we, i havent been updating much lately, cause not much has been going on...  I am awaiting a reply to post a new guide, and I have changed the Conan quote to be more correct.  *blushes* Whoops...  Blundered on this one bigtime :(  Its NOT Conan the Destroyer, but Conan the Barbarian!  Hehe...  Thanx to the guy who sent me the msg, i wont post his name for privacy reasons.  Hehe and if ANY of you have ANY cool ideas for us, or information on warrior related stuff, PLEASE send it to us!  We will post it along with whatever information about yourself that you want our readers to see :P<BR><BR>

If i ever get any Java knowledge then i will attempt to make some mouseover graphics for the menu bar too! (that will be a long time, or until Ady gets enough time to show me how)

I posted a new link.  This site is rather good, kinda slow cause of Angelfire, but has a pretty good beastiary.  His site is kinda sparce graphics wise, but still pretty good.  Information is greater than graphics in a web site anyway.

Well, I managed to get on for a while, and with all my newfound time without the net, I've been watching TV, watching TV, and occasionally doing homework (while watching TV).  So, what my plan is, is to write my own warrior guide, which will be based directly on playing a Barbarian, but should be useful to others.  Also, if I get EXTREMELY bored, I might write some fiction.  <BR>
On other news, it really would be nice if someone would offer to help us out with updates, so if you want to help update the page and everything, what you should do is send us an E-Mail containing:<ul>
<li>E-Mail Address (duh!)
<li>Nick Name
<li>Real Name
<li>What general geographic location you are from
<li>Past expierences or refrences in HTML/Page making
<li>Why you would be a good addition to the Swordstrike team
<li>The catcher:  An essay (I know it sounds bad, but...) on some expierences that you have had in EverQuest.  Make sure its long enough to look good, but short enough so that I don't pass out.
