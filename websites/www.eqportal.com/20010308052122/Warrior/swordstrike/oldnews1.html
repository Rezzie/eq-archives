    Phew... Got through the first week of school, with a total of 6hrs of sleep,
    so i slept today for 13hrs :-)... I have been working on some sorta logo for
    Ady, but already got mine, as those who are visiting the guides section
    know.... It appears that the initial rush of viewers is starting to subside,
    but well i am always bored, and i check on the site often, specially when EQ
    crashes me... PLEASE send us questions, emails, and USE the Msg board!
    PLEASE i beg you! One bored human to another! PLEASE provide me something
    for which i can procrastinate! MUST not do homework early! PLEASE!<BR>

<font color="blue">Phew, school is a lot of work.  Well, I got the J.C. Smith warrior guide up, you can check it out by following the pic in the guide section.  I think that he does a really great job describing what a warrior should do, does, and what to expect.  Rice to him!  Other then that I'm going to work on getting the Quests section up, so if you could send us whatever quests you have (no matter how small, how newbie like) then we will post em, put up credit to ya, and maybe even a link :-P... so anyway, have fun browsing, and dont die in your travels in Norrath!<BR>

    OMG! FIRST DAMN DAY OF SCHOOL AND 3 HRS OF HOMEWORK! GOD I HATE HONORS
    CLASSES! okay good, glad i got that outa my system... Well its true 3 hours
    of homework, and only 2 hrs of sleep today! Ady did a little&nbsp; check,
    and so did i, and everything is fine, when i get the time, IF EVER, THE
    PAIN.... THE STRESS..... AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
    We got permission to add J.C. Smiths Warrior guide, for those who dont know
    who he is, hes the Omnipotent Webmaster at EQ'lizer, and he is my god, i
    worship his work, and the effort he puts into his site. We have also gotten
    E-mails bout some other races warrior guides, possibly this weekend i will
    look into that and get some of them up, if i get permission, and of course
    we are going to give FULL recognition to those whose Guides, and or Quests
    we recive on the site. YOU guys who have done the glorious work, YOU know
    who you are, deserve credit for what ya did, and we applaud it! Well i am
    about to fall asleep already *yawns very loudly, and then holds head and
    grimaces with pain* yes the stress of school is already getting at me (how'd
    ya guess?) hopefully when me and ady settle into our routines we can better
    serve ya, but in the meantime, bare with us, we are as badly stressed as you
    all are out there! Even worse, i am suffering frome EXTREME withdrawl
    syndrome, from EQ, well goodnight, my endless ranting is rather un formed,
    but well thats stress, and sleep, G-Night!<Br>

    Ady and i have worked out that i should answer the Equipment related
    questions, and he will answer the things involving problems with the layout
    etc of our site.... BTW for those who disliked the Intro page, we got rid of
    it, and&nbsp; put the counter in a frame, it looks alot better, we are
    swamped right now to finish the site, gotta do the Equipment section, and
    Quests, FOR the Quests, PLEASE email us with them! I or Ady will promptly
    post it, with a nifty little msg saying who sent it! so please if ya want
    the entire world to know that YOU were cool enough to email Swordstrike with
    a quest send one in!!! ALSO if you dont want ppl knowing your characters

<font color="blue">Okay, I think I've made the page Netscape compatable... it won't look as good as the ppl with IE, but it should work... if you find a page that still only displays the Swordstrike Logo thing at the top, please email me.  Due to the quantity of EMail we recieve, its hard for us to seperate the mail between us, so if you have some mail that you want to go out to a specific person, just put the name in the Subject line... like "Subject:  Your Page Kicks! (Ady)" and I'll open it, and the same thing for Sparty.  Other then that, you guys will be happy to know that I won my soccer game 7-2!!! *CHEERS*  Got a great team this year.  Anyway I'm sure your all interested about my personal life (heh) so I'll just leave you at that.  Thanks for all the positive feedback, people, and we will respond to every email, even if it takes a few days.<BR>

Someone on the msg board expressed concern because he couldn't click the links... so far I've looked into it, but cant find anything wrong.  Im going to, in about 10 mins, to put the counter at the bottom of the page, so got rid of the intro page cause ppl didn't like it, and got rid of the javascript, but remember "<B>This page is best viewed with 65 million colors in a 800x600 resolution.</b>".  Rather long update here, but I'm trying to get all my thoughts down.  Thanks to everyone for coming, and I'm working as fast as I can :P<BR>

and a few emails! I answered them to the best of my knowledge, and hope you all

I ALSO made and put up the Piercing section, if any of our new viewers have any
new items that we haven't posted please email us! I will correct them,
screenshots are nice, for verification, but not required! ALSO try posting some
things on the Msg Board! ANY arguments to my Rants can be posted there, and we
can debate &lt;cracks knuckles&gt;. May i remind everyone that the Equipment
section and some of the Weapons section are still under construction... If you
have anything which we dont have in the Equipment section, feel free to&nbsp;
send us a msg, makes our lives easier! HAHAHAHAHA I AM GREAT!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
ON ONE CAN BEAT MY RANTS HAHAHAHAHAHA! And ady cant get too much done these

procrastination caught up to him this week) Well Cudos to those who have visited
our site, and continue visiting, and ESPECIALLY those who sent emails saying we

Anyway, we've been having some problems w/ the counter, so I think that I might just have a page thats like the "<i>Intro</i>" page that has the counter on it.  I'll do that today, but I might, just MIGHT get Command and Conquer 2 today... so then I'll be playing that a lot.  But anyway, I'll work on that, congrats to sparty on the guide and actually doing work, and cya later all!<BR>

<p>I am on a role, got bored with EQ again, and decided to do WORK, yes work! I
sat down and wrote an entire guide for warriors, complete with my nice little
logo thingy at the top.... I think the guide should answer some questions, but i
still have to put up some sort of group conduct thingy etc, i hope ady finishes
all his summer reading books, and gets to writing his own, newbie warriors guide
:P well you can find my guide at <a href="WarGuide1.html">Spartycus's Warrior Guide</a>
which i am still working on, gotta add the smaller races in there as well, but
well i dont&nbsp; wanna spend ALL that time! As of now i am quite happy with the
Guide, the Rant, and the new Javascript &quot;Welcome to the world of EverQuest,
where Wooly Mammoths can Dodge&quot; hehe have fun exploring, we are still
working on the Equipment, and Weapons, but hey that can be like nothing, right
now most of the site is up and running! Also Ady hasnt been doing much lately
cause he got caught up having to read all 3 rather lengthy summer reading books,
so I dont blame him for his lack of work.... lol the screen is filling up with
RED HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
<p>~<i>Spartycus</i></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Well Ady really didnt like my nice little rant, so i
went and created page in the GUIDE section called :&nbsp;<a href="Weeklyrant.html">Spartycus's Weekly Rant</a> 
And i intend to update it weekly, which is alot easier than updating the news
section, but i will end up doing that.... hehe i will have a ton of extra time
during the school year, when i cant play EQ all the time :P....&nbsp; Well one
thing cool is that i am actually figuring out little bits and pieces of HTML!
like for instance i didnt need adys help to create the guide page, and create
the rant page, or put the image in anymore!!!! course i still cant run the site
without him, and i certainly couldn't have created it without him, but hey i am
learning! something i dont usually do during the summer, lol heck even during
the school year! I am gonna leave ya with that for news (i do have a knack for
writing too much ehh?)</font></p>

<font color="blue">Harumph.  Sparty just saw that the screen was filling with blue so he decided to BS a little... well... a lot so it looks like hes doing work.  Yeah right.  Hes like, "Uh oh.  I only got 4 hours of EQ left.  I gotta go play" so he wont help me.  Well, anyway, I got the cloth armor up.  The msg board looks good.  And thats pretty much it.<br>
<i>-Aderyn</i></font><br>
<BR>Well&nbsp; I am back from my long period of just playing EQ updating things
  here and there, and not giving a damn weather I updated the news section or
  not! :P Schools going to start next week, and since i wont be playing EQ
  nearly as much, i will probably have more time to throw at the Site :) Well I
  have been playing EQ for a while, hehe got tons of screenshots, just I think I
  will upload them and have Ady do all the work :) I also have been doing the
  buttons, and still am wondering how to fix the menu picture so that my cpu&nbsp;
  doesnt load it lookin like some new artists screwed up idea for making an
  abstract, hard as hell to use menu :P hehe Ady said that the news section was
  looking all blue, so that I should update it, I am gonna show him! this is
  gonna be the longest update of all time!!! HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! Well i decided to
  post a Quote from the Summer Reading book I have been forced to read, and am
  only half way through cause I dont have much time for reading, seeing as i&nbsp;
  plat EQ for 14hrs a day :) <font color="#C0C0C0"> &quot;It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a
  society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries,
  should be evenly distributed, while the power remained in he hands of a small
  privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain
  stable.&quot; George Orwell, <u>1984</u>.</font>&nbsp; I posted this quote, not&nbsp;
  because it has absolutely no purpose at all, but because my English teacher
  last year thought that Qrwell was a communist... Well we had an argument, and
  she gave me a C on my paper, cause she disagreed with it! Now as my revenge
  (not final, but goes a long way) i am posting the truth that i was right, and
  she was wrong! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! if she ever reads this, then HA i got my
  revenge you silly limping &lt;bleep&gt;! Now to begin a brief summary of what
  1984 is all about, to further make up for my lack of red on the NEWS
  section:&nbsp; <u>1984</u> is about a society in which the world is
  drastically changed from the way it is now, there are 2 huge super states,
  Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. These three super states are constantly at
  war......... hehe i think my update has gone on long enough :) hehehehe i made
  up for the lack of red on the page!&nbsp;

Alright, I got the message board up! *CHEERS* And I messed around with the view of the news page a little.  Other then that... nothing.  I should get the armor section up, and then I'll make a guide.

  <p>Hmmmmmm... Ady hasnt been updating either... Well i wanna SEE you TRY to
  kill me off, you pathetic little boy! The backround thing WAS my idea, and as
  u can see it looks cool, the midi rox its good quality and has absolutly no
  relevance to anything important, but sounds cool.... IF i had left ady to
  finding a good midi file, we would be listening to the TITANIC soundtrack over
  and over and over and O GOD MAKE IT STOP!!! THE MUSIC AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! (opps,
  was that out loud?) Well i updated my Character Profile, (its REALLY cool,
  check it out, my character is far better than adys, and lol stronger and
  better caster, etc...) I was thinkin bout makin a friends section, that would
  be cool, well i will see into it (hehe another senceless thing to make ady
  spend his life on) and have been debating workin on some more artwork.....

<Font color="blue">*ahem* <u><b>PLAY</u></b> stupid?!?  Sure, whatever you say, Sparty.  Hrumph.  I coulda found the pic's if I had wanted to.  I coulda found the Midi (which, I remind you, isn't that great) if I had wanted to, so um, what use is Sparty to me?  Maybe I should just kill him off... yes, perfect.  My plan for world domination is falling together like... like... oh whatever.  So I got the background so it doesn't move when you scroll (on Sparty's demand, even though I don't see whats so great about it) and I updated the page.

  <p>Well, lol been a long time since I have updated.... Hmmmm I read Ady,s
  updates, if it werent for his incredable use for this page, i would have to
  kill him, and post pictures (God knows how I&nbsp; would figure out how to
  post the pictures) of his lifeless corpse and make a NEW internet human
  anatomy page :-) HEHE, well i will just play dumb more and make him do all the
  hard work :-) well I (not ady) found the MIDI file, and i do all the artwork,
  so well i am not TOTALLY useless, i am just too lazy to update the NEWS

Alright... still making the page look good.  I got the background MIDI up... its not that great, but whatever, it sounds good. We also changed the pic behind the menu, cause I guess Sparty was too lazy to just make the sword bigger.  The new pic kinda doesn't work out now, but I'm sure Sparty'll get to it.  Other then that, theres nothing to update on.  We're accepting comments like always, so just E-Mail us.

Well, as you can see, I put up the 'About Us' section, which has screen shots of both Sparty and Me, and a small description of both of us.  As we change our styles and stuff, we should update it.  Sparty did finish the two handed blunt and I made it look a little mor prettier.  Sparty should make the sword pic longer to account for all the menu.  Well, if he ever gets around to anything.  Oh well, hes getting it done, and what can I say? I haven't done the armor yet.  <BR><BR></font>
<font size="+2" color="white">August 9, 1999</font><BR>
<BR><font color="blue">Well, I'm amazed at the level of laziness that Spartycus is reaching.  I should rip out his jugular for this.  Not only did he not update yesterday, he STILL hasn't finished the Two Handed Blunt.  Looks like I might have to do it.  <sigh>  And, yes I do have a reason for not updating yesterday, I had some RL obligations.  And I had to fight my brothers for computer time.  Sorry.  Ill just annoy Sparty for a while until he finishes.  And I'll work on getting cloth and patchwork and leather armor up.  I guess thats my category cause I'm the lower level.<BR>

  things up.....&nbsp; Still working on that Weapons section and I will get it up
  and running...<br>-<i>Spartycus</i><br><br><Font color="blue">
Well, since we pretty much have finished the weapons (Sparty just has to finish the advanced) except some of the rarer, advanced, non named, ones.  Got any info on those and please E-Mail us.  Actually, E-Mail us anyway.  I got up the Equipment section up... just got to put the armor up... I'll have to get the info from Sparty tho, cause he has more expierence with armor.

  that I the &quot;Newbie&quot; Html programmer DID do something right, and did
  make it work! (with a little help from FrontPage) Well trying to add some neat
  pictures, they look good, but have to be huge to be good quality! Hehe when I
  (if I) learn Dynamic HTML we will see more of the warrior babes! BTW I also
  changed the font to the Date on the news, it looks cooler, its called Morpheus,

Well, I just wanted to let ya know, we got the one handed blunt up and worked some more bugs out (just made it look a little more prettier), and we're thinking about making an 'Essays' section... lotsa work tho, oh well, it'll give me something to do that Sparty can't do.  Later.<br><i>-Aderyn</i><BR><BR></font>
