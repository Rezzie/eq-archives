<a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq" target="_blank">EQ'Lizer</a> <BR>RATING: *****<BR><BR>
EQ'Lizer, possibly the BEST Everquest equipment site, with various other things, VERY well organized, and updated daily. 
<BR>

<a href="http://eq.stratics.com" target="_blank">EQSS</a>
<br>RATING: ****<BR><BR>
EQSS, Good site, has message boards, general information, very poor equipment section(only non-magic) but updated daily, and VERY good bestiary, good staff.

<BR>RATING: *****<BR><BR>
Allakhazam's Magical Realm, If you cant find it at EQ'lizer, its probably here, or doesnt exist! Their Quest section is Unbeatable, although their Equipment section is not well organized, it IS very updated, and informed. VERY worth visiting!

<a href="http://www.pompano.net/~amylynn1/" target="_blank">EQItems</a>
<BR>RATING: ****<BR><BR>
Although this site only contains items, I am tempted to give it five stars.  GREAT site.  Has almost every item in game, and in a nice, searchable database.  Please, go check it out.
<BR><BR><BR>
<a href="http://www.eqlinks.com/" target="_blank">EQLinks</a>
<BR>RATING: ****<BR><BR>
Great site.  It has links to almost anywhere you need to go, and has some orignal information of its own.  Its all organized into an easy to read, and easy to find information, format.
<BR><BR><BR>
<a href="http://members.citynet.net/nest/" target="_blank">The Nest</a>
<BR>RATING: ***<BR><BR>
Nice site, they put us up in thier links returning the favor.  Has a great list of evil NPC's, and where they are and why.  Also a starting guild.  Go there.

<BR>RATING: ***<BR><BR>  
Pretty good site.  GREAT beastiary, but kinda slow (on angelfire).  Doesnt have the pop up window we got stuck with (a plus).  Go there, learn of the Monsters you <b>will</b> encounter.

<A href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/6248/" target="_blank">EQ CrossFire</a>
<BR>RATING: ****<BR><BR>
Administrated by a former Senior guide, and fellow player of EverQuest, this is an excellent site to see how the game REALLY works.  Many boards, REALLY interesting screenshots, and its really easy to navigate. I definatly recomend checking EQ CrossFire out!

<BR>RATING:***<BR><BR>
Nice little page, has lots of usefull links, and I'm considering of just going to this page instead of seperatlly going to EQSS, EQLizer, etc. when I first get on the 'net for news updates.
