Level 22 Troll in 3 days!</font>
<BR><BR><font color="silver">
I would like to provide my input on the warrior class. I am a level 37 Troll warrior on Erolissi Marr server. I feel you underestimate the soloing capabilities of a warrior class. I can still solo at my level, It just is very difficult. You must be in the right area with stable conditions (unlike train city of CT) and the blue monsters will still drop like fly's.  This is not a way to power level for certain though for the simple fact that it just requires killing too many mobs at high levels to get advanced.  Better off to get a full party and kill 100 blue mobs an hour then solo and kill 10.  I trained a young troll in the tactics of tanking from a troll view and was able to guide him to lvl 22 in 3days played. This is a major feat but can be done quite simply. Here is my plan to fame:
	<BR><BR>lvl 1-4: hunt on west side of enterance to Grobb. Stay close to the guards to avoid being overwelmed by rats and snakes. As soon as you can kill a skellie stick to em. They drop weapons.
<BR><BR>
	lvl 4-10: hunt on east side of entrance to Grobb. As you become
more powerful and can kill froggies, you will pick up armor. Wear every
stitch of it you can. AC is your survival as a tank. Some of the frogs will drop weapons also and the coinage only gets better. As you become better and stronger, extend from your guard shelter (excellent spot to rest after battle) and push farther and farther toward the entrance to SRO. Be aware of the frog guards at the entrance to Guk, for they are great xp as soon as you can kill them. Also the frog foragers and kobald hunters are much tougher then the normal froggies and kobalds.
<BR><BR>
	lvl 10-16: start hunting the orc camps. work up to killing the derv camps. If you cannot kill a 3 spawn of orcs, don't bother trying to kill dervs. Once you are kicking derv tail, you will get some bronze weapons and make some better money.
<BR><BR>
	lvl 16-20: go kill them pesky crocks in oasis. The lag in the zone sucks most the time and the danger is getting a lot worse, but hey you're a troll.
<BR><BR>
	lvl 20-24: move your bottom to lake rathe. Start by camping the
one-spawn guard. when you become a real mad man you can take the two spawn solo.
<BR><BR>
	lvl 24-28: move to SK and start workin the elephants and aviaks at the tree house. This is your first respectable loot (avo's that is).
<BR><BR>
	lvl 28-up: if you still need a guide you need give up your tank.
<BR><BR>
Some side notes:<BR>
	*Skills must stay maxed out. Use your sense heading, kick, taunt, slam, bash, etc.<BR>
	*Get a bow as soon as possible. It gives you a way to attack things other then chasing.<BR>
	*You are evil. Everything in Norrath hates you except evil. Get used to it.<BR>
	*Never buy a weapon or armor from vendors. You are throwing your
cash away if you do.<BR>
	 Save your money for when that lvl 37 troll runs thru with a FS
sword and a full set of large bronze that he wants to get out of his bank. At high lvl money is pointless so he will probably take 5pp for the whole deal if you really need it.<BR>
	*Solo sucks. If you can get a good DE cleric to grow up with your life will be wonderful.<BR>
	*If you are solo, always stick to blue mobs. Sure you might kill a yellow mob, but you will be sitting on your butt forever and when you are at 6hp, a moss snake can wonder by and score a kill (very embarassing).<BR>
	*Take time off from time to time. Get a party and go hunt for that nice item you want. If you do not learn party tactics by lvl 20 you will become a waste of Troll. <BR>
	*Maybe go take a screen shot of you hitting a sandgiant for 28 points before the LOADING.... It makes for great stories later in your life :) Plus if you stick strictly to power leveling you will get bored and frustrated.<BR>
