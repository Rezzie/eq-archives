<font color="blue">Plea for help!  I'm still working on the new webpage, and in fact, its almost done.  I've just hit a major glitch.  In an effort to make the items pages as informative as possible, its been taking me literally hours to do one page.  I just cant put that kind of time and effort into it.  So, I was wondering if there's anyone out there thats versed in CGI so that they can help me (or do it on their own :-) design a program to update the pages.  The help would be appriceated.  Please, if you have any CGI skills, and you want to see the best warrior page out there, or you are like me and need a new project every few weeks, please send in an e-mail.  Comon people, I can't do this on my own!<BR><BR>

<font color="blue">Quick update, theres a new ring, called the Azure Ruby Ring.  Submitted by <font color="white">Dreiden</font>.  He's keeping up the good work :-)  Anyway I've updated in the Other Armor section.  Check it out :)
<BR><BR>
<i>-Aderyn</i></font><BR><BR> 
<font color="blue">Alrighty, theres a new weapon out there.  Looking around, its the best damage/delay ratio that I can find anywhere!  But we do have a problem; its a 2h BLUNT.  All you slashers are gonna have to practice blunt again.  Sorry guys :-)  Oh yeah, and thanks to <font color="white">Dreiden</font> for sending it in.  Also, it seems that Crip blow isn't all that bad.  I guess I jumped to a premature conclusion.  A level 40 warrior, <font color="white">Maus</font>, managed to pull off 253 damage.  Thats comparable too a rogues backstab!  Maybe if you get low on health, it can really help to damage the monster enough to give you a chance.  I'm interested in hearing how other people have done with crip blow, so please send it in if you've had a good or bad crip blow, and your level.  Thanks!

<font color="blue">Bah, quit whining Sparty.  On a happier note, its finally February! Finals over! I'm enjoing the semester break now... ahh... nice and relaxing.  Anyway, I relized that we just passed up the six month anniversery of Swordstrike!  *gasp* I dont know how I missed it!  Well to everyone out there, happy 6 month anniversery of Swordstrike :-)<BR><BR>
On another note, I got a submission for the armor section.  Since we dont have a section for other types of armor, I made a new one.  Its the 'other' section in the equipment section.  Enjoy!<BR>

I am deeply hurt that Ady miss-spelled my name in his last update...  I mean come on!  How hard is it to figure out that its 
Spart<font color="yellow">y</font>cus, as in Spart<font color="yellow">y</font>cus, not Spart<font color="yellow">i</font>cus! 
<BR>Well on a happier note i got to play EQ this glorious weekend!  Unfortunatly EQ is not as i had left it earlier.  There are 
WAY too many people online now!  Solusek B, A, and both Upper and Lower Guk were cramed full of people!  Hell even Rallo-Zek was crowded for once! 
From talking to some of my friends even the Planes were crowded...  The general opinion of my higher level friends is that there need to be 2x the 
current number of servers in EQ.  Personally i think they should make it a gateway in all the servers.  <BR>
EX::  Bristlebane A to B.  This portal would cost some money, like say 500 plat but when you moved you could move back for the same price!  Now what this would 
do would be to allow players who viewed lower guk as overcrowded to move to lower guk B and perhaps it would be half as crowded!!!  I am sure theres possible 
exploitation from this idea, but if faction was carried through both servers then perhaps its a viable alternative to just moving to another server and starting
 a new character!  Feedback on the idea please on the message board!<BR>

<font color="blue">Wow!  Got numerous E-Mails about the Crippling Blow.  I've tried to gather all the information, so here is everything I got in no particular order:<ol>
<li>It does more then 2 times the amount of damage (more then critical hits normally do)</li>
<li>It has a snaring effect</li>
<li>It only occurs while the Warrior is in berzerk mode</li>
<li>About the same chance of going off as a crit hit</li>
<li>Its another useless skill</li>
</ol>
Hope that helps somewhat.  Remember that Sparticus and I <b>haven't</b> verified any of this information yet, but all the emails seem to agree on this.<BR><BR>

Well Mid-terms are officially over!!!!! *really relaxes for the first time in the last 3 weeks*
I hope everyone had fun, i actually think i did alright in these tests...  Found out my English grade 
wasnt all so bad, its around a B.. LOL and History had to be the easiest uber test of them all!  So back to EQ...
The Plane of Sky is officially open!  LOL it seems like us warriors kinda got jyped in this zone :(  As i have been
 going over the items it appears that most of them seem to be for our ever beloved caster classes...  You know, the 
ultra powerful, tweaked to hell, item taking/selling caster classes...  Well now they get new toys!  Sure theres a *few* 
nice items for us under appriciated tanks in PoS (Piece Of S*it), but its not special, every class gets something there just the 
same as all others (us alittle less).  On another note i have heard from some friends that a new skill has been added to our arsenal! 
Yes thats right, we now have a new attack called Crippling Blow.  Now keep in mind i am only saying what i have heard, i am stressing HEARD, 
okay?  its HEARSAY, if i am wrong i dont wanna be flamed cause i have not had the time to log on to test this out...  It seems that 
Crippling Blow is a minor snare effect and doesnt allow Mezmorize to be cast on the mob when in effect...  Now
 is there ANY point to that at all?  Tell me if i am wrong but if enchanters cant mez mobs why would they choose a warrior to be 
in their group over a paladin/monk/bard/sk/rogue (okay rogues suck but they still hit fast :P) <BR>
   I want some verification pls on Crippling Blow, and please, any new Warrior item submisions from PoS would be great!<BR>

Woah, been a while since i updated....  I think i have a good excuse though... Mid terms... Havent played EQ for 
2 weeks already, been studying.  I am so burned out on studying i am almost ready to forget studying for history...
Nevermind, I'll study for History, just after i post this and relax a bit (i do want to get a good grade in the class...)
Well of absolutly no relevence to this site at all I think I'll just post my classes and my thoughts on the midterms...<BR>
<font color="silver">Algebra 3-4 :</font> Wish i had Aced it, but i didnt so there goes my chance of an A in the class (unless my extra credit work is good)<BR>
<font color="silver">English Honors 3-4 :</font> Again, wish i had Aced it, but i think i did *alright*  so perhaps when the next unit comes around i WILL have an A already (fat chance, but i am hoping)<BR>
<font color="silver">Japanese 3-4 : </font>Wow, didnt think i would finish this test with a smile, but i did!  Also this is the first time i have seen my teacher smile all year...  Shes a bit of a sadist and got really angry when i was HAPPY about how easy the test was... She checked me for cheating 2 times too... (i dont cheat so she didnt find anything)<BR>
<font color="silver">Bio (yeah so what, i slacked off in the sciences for electives) :</font> HUGE test, but fun :)  Finished 30min early so i got to listen to my new Metalica S&M CD... quite nice<BR>
<font color="silver">Modern World History Honors :</font> As i said earlier i still gotta take it...<BR>
<font color="silver">Athletics :</font> Yeah right.......<BR>
So now you know what kinda hell i have been going through... Forgive me....  <BR>

<font color="blue">A quick update, we had two people, at the same exact time (whoohoo easier for me!) send in updates to the crafted armor.  Thanks to <font color="white">Guliano VanEstrick</font> and <font color="white">Alex Krist, aka Smallbird</font> for the info.  Also got a nice submission, with a few good ideas.  The first, which I agree with, is to make a better sword for Warriors in later levels (to parallel the paladins SoulFire, etc).  The next thing, which I think is a GREAT idea, since hybirds weapon abilities cap at the same level as warriors... <blockquote><font color="silver">The best idea I've heard of is giving warriors weapon specialization for one weapon skill going to 250 and two or one other to 225. <BR><BR>-Davidson of Karana, 47th Barbarian Warrior</font></blockquote> Makes sense, eh?

<font color="blue">Ack!  A WHOLE WEEK!  Sorry its been so long since an update, guyz =(.  But I have an excuse... I've been workin on the new webpage.  So far this is whats happening:  I have it worked out.  All I have left to do is program in the weapons and armor, which is half the job. *sigh* I'm workin on it and playin eq as much as i can, but beware, finals are starting soon.  That means this week im not gonna get much time.  Good thing is next week, i have two days of no school (semester break) and the other days are minimum, so more updates and me working more! How fun!  Anyways, i just wanted to let you guys know what was happening.

*wistles* Got a nice submission!  We got a table of everything a *Dwarf Warrior* can use.  Theres still stuff in there that other class/races can use, but this one is limited to dwarf stuff.  You have to have MicroSoft Excell for it to work.  Dont know if it works on any of the Corel programs, but Ill try it out.  Anyway, thanks, Kronack &lt;Infinity Legion&gt; of the Povar Server!  <a href="DwarfEquip.xls"><B><i><font color="silver">Here</font></i></b></a> it is!

<font color="blue">Okay, we've found the new URL to Allakhazam!  Its been updated, so go ahead and check it out!<BR><i>-Aderyn</i>
<BR><BR>*Is so mad he's shaking in his boots*<BR><BR>Well... I headed over to Allakhazam's Magical Realm a few minutes ago.  Apparently GameStats was displeased with him.  What happened (I was lucky enough to see the news update before GameStats shot it down) was that Allakhazam posted on his page that he would be moving to another page, because he found that the GameStats server was slow, which I agree with.  So, GameStats shut him down.  Even in his news  update (I wish I could quote him, but its no longer in my history file...) he said that he thought the people at GameStats would be kind enough to let him keep up his site for a few days.  Guess he was wrong (which rarely happens).  I just hope that he had all the info saved on his hard drive before they erased it.  And no ill-will towards the site that's taken its place.  I've looked around and found that its an okay site, and if I were offered a spot on GameStats, I dont know what I would do. <BR><BR>
So anyway, my support goes out to ya Allakhazam!!!

Trying to put a neat little picture under our dates, to me it looks a bit more... professional (atleast to me...)  At least it looks nice...  If you cant see the little line then email us..  cause knowing my html skills i probably screwed up....  *crosses fingers*  It should be under ALL news updates now on the page, so it will be pretty obvious if you dont see it. We might put up a poll asking if you liked it the old way or new in the near future, keep looking.
<BR>P.S. Reason my writing is so bad is i am really tired, lol good hunting everyone in Norrath, may the gods watch over you (while i sleep)  *Mutters about sleep not being nessisary, and how he wants to play EQ more*

Happy new year everyone!  Looks nice doesnt it, 2000?  Well i thought it best to archive the news casue it was getting rather long, and doing so at the start of the new year seemed like it fit. Just a bit of trivia, but when they started our calendar, it started as 1AD.  This means that REALLY the new millenium is next year!  Kinda funny actually...  Hope you all enjoy your new years celebrations though :)<BR>
