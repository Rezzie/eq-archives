<font size="5" color="white">December 5 - 11,<BR></font> Item nerfing, and its stupidity!<BR><BR>
First i would like to start off by appologizing for not writing these all the time (its hard to come up with something to complain about all the time :)  Also i would like to say that Verant has REALLY pissed me off this time...<BR><BR>
Friends, I would like to bring to your attention the ever changing, and rather hindering REMOVAL of items from EverQuest.  I remember at one point in time saying, wow, oh how I can't wait to be high enough in level to kill the Avatar of Fear in Cazic Thule, and get myself a rubicrite breastplate.  As we all know the Ruby BP, although not  having as high an armor class as our beloved Crafted casts that rather amazing Rubicrite Aurra which is a regeneration spell.  One day, Brad McQuaid woke up and said to himself "I think that rubicrite causes too much grief, I think I will have my dev team remove it from dropping."  And as it was said, it shall be written, and as it was written it shall become.  Hence rubicrite's prices not only skyrocketed, but the demand for camping was not REMOVED, as Brad was trying to stop, but was  INCREASED for now people all over Norrath are camping various spawns, and now one cannot kill anything without competing with a group to get it!  HURRAY!  Hail our glorious leader! Brad's insight in removing Rubicrite helped really no one except those who already had it, for now they can pretty much trade their ruby for any combination of items in the game!!!!!  (Not to mention many of these ppl were those who should not have been rewarded in this fashion because they now have been rewarded for kill stealing, and group warring. Now for the subject of the Guise of the Deceiver.  As we all know, the wonderful Guise, us "good" races savior, which allowed us to complete quests and travel with ultra vision has been replaced.  This NEW guise, which was put in its spot, only works for Bards, and Rogues.  Thanks again Brad!  I love his incredible talent in searching out the most beloved items in the game and either nerfing them to hell, or halting their drop forever.  Now us good races cannot see in the dark worth a damn, UNLESS we find that ever rare shaman, or magician (both of which are pretty much nerfed to hell, and are sooo hard to play) to give us ultravision.  There WAS, still is if he has ANY common since at all,  another solution to rubicrite and the guise.  <BR>
Rubicrite::
Quite simple really, just keep it dropping, AND add the new class armor, also make it so every named lizard has a chance (rare) to drop any piece of ruby, hence eliminating the one spot camping that used to occur.  Also since ruby would not be as good statistic wise, people would still be going for their class-specific armor, and thus competition would be at an all time low!!!
<BR><BR>The Guise of the Deceiver::
Another simple solution, since evil races don't get the equivalent, why not make a Guise of Human form or something…  Also, again make it so that the guise will drop on the ultra high frogloks in guk, and hence, no one is camping the Assassin anymore, ppl who haven't acquired the guise (like me) aren't enraged to the point of going to Verant HQ, and picketing it (I know if this sort of thing happens AGAIN to me, like they were to get rid of the exe axe just as I am about to camp it, I very well might)
The bottom line is, nerfing classes and items does not establish equilibrium in the game, it just creates more and more and more variables, making it harder and harder and harder to harmonize the game.  Nerfing solves nothing at all.  In my view, the Dev team at Verant is taking the easiest possible way out of solving the problems.  By getting rid of the items they just piss off as many ppl as they can, without coming up with anything new!  I personally don't think a single one of them plays a melee class any further than lvl 10, otherwise they would see the problems they themselves are creating.  And that leads me to another rant which I will write shortly in the future…

<font size="5" color="white">October 3 - 9,<BR></font> My thoughts on Asherons Call vs EQ...<BR>
I have played AC beta, and have been watching its progress for a while now... Asherons Call, will be a mix between EverQuest, and Ultima Online, which could possibly be a very good thing.  I will rate them for 3 things, Graphics, PvP, Combat,and Bugs,because to me these are the most important things.<BR><BR>
<font size="4" color="yellow">Graphics</font><BR>
UO- The Graphics of Ultima Online are very lacking.  It was the first of its kind ever, and the graphics issue can be excused for that, but now it is totally surpased by EQ, and AC.  <BR><BR>
EQ- The Graphics of EverQuest are positivly stupendious!  Top of the line for its time, with the bmp loading, and lag almost solved.  EverQuest is basically BMP's loaded onto polygons, which in turn are vector based, so that the images move rather well.  I like the graphics, the only problem is the clipping view...  A good example of this is the Ocean of Tears, where you know there are just some MASSIVE islands around, and you cannot even see them!<BR><BR>
AC- The Graphics of Asherons Call are damn good too!  I love the landscapes I have seen.  Microsoft has had the resources to solve the cliping view problem too!  They figured that you should be able to see a mountain at a distance, just as you can in RL.  As in RL the mountain's features get better and better the closer in you get.  The one thing is the mobs are drawl better in EQ.  I think they are even.<BR><BR>
Table Rankings...<BR>
Graphics:<BR>
UO - Poor<BR>
EQ - Excellent<BR>
AC - Excellent<BR>
<font size="4" color="yellow">Player Vs. Player Combat</font><BR>
UO- PvP was the highlight of Ultima Online, if all you want to do is get together, and kill someone else, and hurt their feelings then this is the game you should buy!  I will admit, the thrill of fighting another person is really great!  But if thats all you care for, why not take it to the next level, join the local Moffia, or street gang!  Many of the people who play UO are not pkers, for then there would be no PKing.  Also the PKers in UO are the people who are the most fun to talk to and hunt with, but only if you can get them to not kill you.  <BR><BR>
EQ- I found EverQuests player vs player system to be quite lacking.  It only allowed you to kill those who were 4 lvls above or below you, and then only loot one item from their corpse!  This was outragous because it made pvp non viable for experience or loot or anything!  Players would often camp the corpse of their fallen enemy and keep them from looting, all the while the other person was loosing experience.  The PvP experience of EQ's PvP was more exilerating though, because of its realistic 3 dimentions, it really did raise my adreniline(spell?)  It also gave certain races an advantage, because they could see in the dark, and attack poor unsuspecting Humans or other blind races!  Wizards and other spell casters had a huge advantage over warriors, which drove me crazy!  Also Warriors could not be healed by anyone who wasnt pvp, which wasnt a problem on the pvp server, but in normal servers it was hell!<BR><BR>
AC- Asherons Call will have a system similar to EQ's but the main difference is that since there will only be one huge world, there will not be a PvP server, so that you will have to hope that enough people decide to play pvp!  I do think though that this will be a limiting factor in the choice to purchase the game, because if you cannot be healed by non pvp, than whats the point? This discourages grouping, and is really cruel to the warriors, because we take the brunt of the dammage all the time in battle!
<BR><BR>
<font size="4" color="yellow">Combat</font><BR><BR>
UO- The combat system of UO was really lacking.  It was even poor for when the game came out.  Monsters would often get stuck on an object, and would rarely change targets, and if they did so, they could be confused into running in circles.  Also the ranged combat of UO was almost like a cheat, if you could hit the monster, and it wasnt a caster, then you could shoot while runing.  The arrows went straight for their target also.  Although different weapons did different things to the monsters.  A mace could literally break off the armor the monster you were attacking was wearing.  A slashing weapon could do increadable damage, and of course the generic magic weapons added bonus stats to the weapons.  Fame, and Karma are dealed to the person who deals the death blow to the mob.  Skills are raised throughout combat however.<BR><BR>
EQ- The combat system of EQ was both very good, and lacking in many areas.  The  Monsters have a very good AI, and are able to run around rocks, and respond to taunts.  They also sling magic and use their weapons to affect more dammage upon their opponent. They would even switch to their ranged weapons, something UO did not even have.  One thing though, is that EQ does not change the real type of damage you take.  If i slash something, and hit it with a club,(for simplicity pretend the stats are the same)  the monster does not respond differently.  Although i can have a rogue backstab, or a mage blast and the mob will get angry and attack them above all others, or i can get infront of it and taunt it, making it hate me more!  The diversity of special attacks is excellent in EQ, but the range of types of dammage is lacking.  Also the Ranged system is nice, but it is nothing compared to magic.  You CAN shoot while running, which in RL does not happen.  The ranged combat is also lacking.  Experience is earned only by the person who deals the most damage to the mob, and divied out to his group if he is grouped.<BR><BR>
AC- AC has perhaps the most complicated combat system, but probably the best of the 3.  There will be NO TRAINS in AC, because the mobs will not leave their target until they completely loose him, or until he dies.  Weapons will be varied, from fire weapons, to electric, all of which will do a different type of damage to the mob, taking into account its saves.  The ranged combat of AC is also by far the best.  The arrows ARCH through the sky toward their target, and can be doged by moving around, but their speed is so that it is quite hard.  The archer can deal a formitable amount of damage, but he cannot move while shooting, making him an easy target for a rather enraged mob.  Experience is also earnable by damage, rather than who kills the mob, or deals the most amount.  This way anyone can group, and get something for their efforts.<BR><BR>
<font size="4" color="yellow">Bugs</font><BR><BR>
I will be adding the bugs when i have played AC more.

19 - 25,<BR></font><font color="#FF0000">The Problems with PVP, and the pluses<BR>
	
To start this one off, I used to play UO.  The problems in UO were overwhelmingly common, and rampant.  First you could use any program you wanted outside of it, UOE, etc.  The Game Masters were of no help at any time, they were in fact tweaking their own friends, giving them programs, which allowed them to get faster GM service etc.  Also listen to this one, Counselors had to be 21or 24(I forget..) and to be a GM you only had to be 18.  But for a GM you did have to live near a server or something… Well the other real problem was player killing, otherwise known as PKing.  In UO one could barely leave town without getting attacked and all their items looted off their corpse.  This was common in UO, and of course the bank could hold much more, and all your items were rapidly replicable.  Now don’t get me wrong, the people who were pkers had the most fun in UO, and were often the coolest people you could talk to, if you got on their good sides, and stayed there.  Ady and I made a friend who had invented a way of pking which he did not loose faction or karma, and the fact that he was able to do it made many hate him, I did and still do respect him for finding this bug, and exploiting it without the aid of any external programs!  Twas a grand scheme… Well anyway…. Back to EQ, and how it ties into this rant… EQ pvp is very full of problems, the first of which is the lack or roleplaying, much like the rest of the “normal” servers.  Also there is a lack of comrodery, or at least in the Race War servers…EQ should have included a better system for their Pking… See in UO they made a whole Karma, and Reputation system, which was not always reliable, but showed how the Merchants reacted to someone, and you could TELL from just seeing the name of that person as they approached, giving you some time, not much but some time to run, and or fight.  EQ didn’t do that much, considering EVERYONES name is RED, and you cant know their intentions, like they may be approaching you to ask you if you wanted to group, or they may be coming to kill you….Now I know that EQ is a better game, as in less bugs, but I don’t think that the GMS should eliminate things like disarm in pk mode, or in duels, because HEY! They are trying to kill you! And if you loose, then they woulda taken your weapon anyway, or if you win you can always re loot it, or pick it up off the ground fast.<BR> <font color="#FFFFFF">ALSO!

<p><font size="5" color="#FFFFFF">September
5 - 11,<BR></font><font color="#FF0000">Keeping up EQ time with too much HW!<BR>I
have been playing EQ for a while now, and of course most of it during the
summer. During the summer I made some friends, and a usual group, which is
important to most classes, as you grow with the people in your group, and can
trust them.&nbsp; Well now that school started I have about 1 to 2 hrs of EQ
spare time now, and i spend most of it, on the website, or trying to
sleep...(which is another of my problems) Since I cannot play nearly as much as
i used to, and my friends seem to be able to, I have since in the course of 2
weeks, become 7 levels behind ALL my group mates! Since we are all fairly high I
still can group with them and get xp and all but hey, there's very little xp for
the runt of the group! ALSO EQ was made to be a time consuming game, at least for
warriors at higher levels.&nbsp; Some classes like Druids can log on and solo a
few mobs, and get a&nbsp; bar of xp, and log an hr later, warriors on the other
hand have to travel to where their group is, or find a group.&nbsp; This process
often takes on average around 30min to an hr, which if all the time you get is
1hr then you pretty much are logging on for nothing, and saying Hi, Bye!&nbsp;
Which is very annoying to most players, and a real waste for warriors... I got
to thinking of a way they could fix this...</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">They could make a network of &quot;Moon gates&quot;
    teleporters like the ones in UO, and have them randomly teleport to another moon gate
    in the world... This would fix all the old boat problems, as it
    would be as simple as zoning, and also fix warrior travel times down to a
    minimum, and make travel in general a whole lot easier, encouraging more
    people to explore. Brad himself said that most of the world of Norrath had
    not been explored yet, this could be due to the difficulties of travel, and
    death in travel, because being bound to Freeport and dying&nbsp; in Cazic
    Thule is NOT fun...</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Now WHY haven't they done something like this? In my
opinion it would not be to hard, they did it in UO, why not in EQ, maybe they
could make it some great high level quest to create moon gates, and once created
they could have the high level get some unique item or something... It WOULD add
a since of role-playing to a society which could use that kind of stimulation. A
change like this would make it so that once again warriors above 20 could go
out, and spend an hour playing, and not wait till they have like 4thousand hours
to spare so they can have some fun on EQ! I hope i am the only person who this
has afflicted... Or maybe someone could tell me how the heck i could manage my
time so that i could cram all that hiking around, and waiting for spawns into 1
well budgeted and productive hour!<BR></font><font color="#FFFFFF">AS ALWAYS!

- September, 4<BR></font><font color="#FF0000">Anti-spammers, ruiners of fun!<BR>Since
EQ is a massive RPG we have many ppl who come to play the game from many walks
of life, some of them come to play the game to have fun, others, like a certain
Enchanter person I know, and a certain young paladin, come from the life of the
ASSHOLE! They like to shout out in a crowded zone STOP USING SHOUT! Or SHOUTING
IS RUINING MY &quot;WORK&quot;! Now i know for a FACT that there is nothing in
EQ which shouting can interfere with all that greatly, now if your in a battle,
and a shout causes an extra little bit of red to flash across the screen, the
only thing that could possibly do any harm to you would be if you were intricately
studying the damage you do... Now do you know ANYONE who does or WOULD do that?
I certainly dont! (And if i did, i would submit them to a mental asylum) Now me
friend was deep in a dungeon, and was using GuildChat to talk to a friend in the
guild, about what they were gonna do next in the guild, and also asking
questions, they were in NO way being obnoxious, but someone in the guild (who
happened to be suicidal for my friend is 7 levels higher) said &quot;Stop
Spamming the guild chat!&quot; and thus argued with them, until my friend, who
happened to be quick to anger, because it was way to late, and had to get up
early the next day, decided never to use guild chat again, until the &quot;Anti-Spammer&quot;
says ANYTHING on guildchat, so that she can lash out and say &quot;Stop spamming
the guild chat!&quot; and of course, OOPS! sorry bout that massive train which
keeps happening nearby you every time you try to get your corpse :P. My friend
is now currently considering leaveing the guild, because the guildmaster, who
for some reason is angry at her even tho she tried to help him earlier, just had
no others in the turnout, reprimanded her... (may i mention he is also suicidal,
cause she is 3 levels higher, and has a very high magic resistance :P)... Now
what is the problem with spamming? Even tho they weren't spaming, until they
were told they were... There is nothing wrong with spaming, except if you decide
that you have a grudge against someone, or are just an ass... I like to talk!
hehe and so does my friend! hey look if i didn't like to talk would i be writing
these rants? NO! MANY others like to talk, like my friend! BUT of course there
are always the jerks out there who like to be jerks, and step on others fun, for
their own amusement.... (i think that &quot;backstabbing&quot; others&nbsp; is
only okay when its called for, and funny!) Now i think that a little spaming is
nice, it increases the lively hood of the game, where it may not be all role-playing,
hey whets ooc used for?!?!? Chatting over a zone is fine, as long as you try to
include others! Once I was conducting a team duel in the Freeport arena, now
maybe some will remember this, WE (as in 20 others) were getting ready to duel,
and of course using shout and ooc because the arena is just a smidgen to large
for normal talk, when a level TWO, level TWO paladin complained, infact i ooc
(out of character) Told him that when he started sending me a check for my EQ
payment that i might let him tell me how to play my character, he promptly said
he was an author and could afford my account, which of course is absurd at most,
considering he himself was not using shout (not ooc but shout) to argue, now
where exactly did i ask for his profession? No where, and then when others in
the group started shouting out that they wouldn't buy his books, he got angry
and THREATENED to petition that we were interrupting his game play, and not
using ooc and shout as they were intended! At this we laughed and invited him to
make his threat real, and come down and duel, where he just zoned and continued
to bitch at me using tell, but we never had any problem with him again :P. This
is unfortunately how EQ has been in almost ALL the populated regions! Something
must be done, when an Anti-Spammer yells out at you for conducting something,
others need to immediately point out to him that he is alone in his opinions,
and that itself is enough to make an asshole realize that without popular
support they are going to pay for their actions, hehe unfortunately if you don't
shout out support for the &quot;accused&quot; the Anti-spammer will assume that
he has the popular support of the crowd! ANTI SPAMMING MUST BE STOPPED! THANX!</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><BR>ALSO!

- 28<BR> </font><font color="#FF0000">EverQuest's
ironic money system...<BR>I am a devoted EQ player, and have gotten myself to a
respectable level, now being somewhat high level, i have found that money is
rather useless to me, because any of the items&nbsp; I desire are not found on
merchants, and most players who have them are as high if not higher than me, and
of course they only wish to trade seeing as no one ever has any use for platinum
any more.... Now when i was a newbie i myself dreamed of having lots or platinum
and a full suit of plate mail! but now that i have that stuff i am faced with a
challenge.... There are NO uses for money at the levels above 25! This is
extremely ironic as just when your dreams of money are within your grasp your
suddenly faced with the fact that money is no longer necessary... Now some of my
friends knew this from their friends, but i did not seeing as my only mentor was
a somewhat A-Social Enchanter whom i will not give his characters name out
online seeing as he has SOME friends (like 3 or something) who are so much
higher than i that it would be EQ suicide to piss all of them
off....&nbsp;&nbsp; Now my friends who knew this went out and kept their rare
items and held them, while buying mine or watching me auction them off... Now
these later levels, they are loaded with tradable items, whereas my bank is only
full of keys and other useless, and rather pointless items! WHY is it that they
make a system based on currency and the higher level players ONLY use their
money to buy FOOD (or rip off some unfortunate newbie with a nice item)! What is
wrong with this? In the beginning of the game, you cherish your money, and save
up and save up till you can afford that combine, and plate b plate, but then
after that, suddenly you have no use for that hard earned money, and you are
able to earn lots of it! Whereas when you actually NEEDED the money, you had
very little, and almost no way of getting any!&nbsp; I think that they should
work out a system where there are special merchants deep in dungeons or something
who are amiable to EVERY mob in the dungeon, and certain races and whom sell
special magic items, at of course very high prices, and of which these items may
be used, or required for special quests! This would fix the lack of spending
done at the higher levels, because the higher ppl would be more likely to do the
quest, and more able to get to the merchant, and would actually HAVE the money
to do this! Whereas lowlies and newbies could continue to save up for their
plate, only to discover that they could make money a lot faster, and still need
it, and not just give Dirdyen 100plat for his b-day!&nbsp;<BR> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">ALSO!
