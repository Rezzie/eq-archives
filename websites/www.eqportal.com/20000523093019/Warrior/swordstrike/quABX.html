The quest is given by Beno Tenarl, the keyword to start the quest is "What Eye of Stormhammer?" He'll then give you a letter to take to the Jail Clerk in High Keep.  When you get to High Keep, the Jail Clerk gives you a Cracked Emerald (container) and tells you the thief Bronin Higginsbot went to Rivervale.  You will find Bronin near the Wall in Misty Thicket.  When you speak to him about the Eye of Stormhammer, he tells you that he'll give it to you for a "small favor."  Asking him "what small favor?", he tells you about Slaythe the bounty hunter and asks you to kill him.  Slaythe can be found between the Orc camp and the Wall.  He is pretty tough even though he cons white/black to level 20.  Killing Slaythe, you will get a froglok leg (no drop) to return to Bronin.  Bronin then gives you a strongbox key (no drop) to take to the bank clerk in High Keep.  He also tells you about "a second emerald shard" which he hid near Kelethin.  Take the key to the Bank Clerk and she'll give you an emerald shard (no drop), then head to the Scouts of Tunare in Kelethin.  The guildmaster will tell you the gem was stolen by Faldor Hendrys and only his brother, Elmion, in Dagnor's Cauldron knows his whereabouts.  Speaking with Elmion, he tells you that Faldor has gone to the thieves' guild in Qeynos.  Travelling to Qeynos, you'll find Faldor Hendrys in the backroom of Crow's.  He spawns approx. 2 and a half hours after you talk with his brother.  A beggar often spawns in his place and does so about once every 2 hrs. 20 min.  Watch out, if you kill Faldon too much, you can go KOS in Crows.
