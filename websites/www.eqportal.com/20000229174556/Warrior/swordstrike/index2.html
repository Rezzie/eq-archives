<font color="blue">Quick update today.  We had the incorrect stats on the Bone Bladed Claymore, so I've fixed that.  Thanks to <font color="white">Omadar</font> for the heads-up.<BR><BR>

<font color="blue">Well, I was in Steamfont Mountians today, and I came upon a bard.  A normal occurance, you say?  No, this was no ordinary bard.  Sainy Dragonfriend was her name, and she had a blue drake pet with her.  She went into singing a song, which I got stored into my eqlog.  Heres the song for ya:
<blockquote><font color="silver">
I follow Veeshan...I shall now sing my song<BR><BR>
From the world's core, the rock children rose<BR>
Shielded from wurms eyes by dirt and stone<BR>
With gnarled hands and broken bones<BR>
They carved their place into Veeshan's home<BR>
Soon after, the woodlands and deserts and swamps<BR>
All nurtured life planted, by interloping Gods<BR>
Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her lair<BR>
turned her back on Norrath, and her fellow God's laws<BR>
The Crystallin Dragon content in her lair<BR>
Sealed off the Sky and still slumbers there<BR>
Some dragons went made, apart from their queen<BR>
Others took charge and formed a wurm Ring<BR>
The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks<BR>
To dwell in the lands inhabited by the weak<BR>
One of these rebels, a lady white as snow<BR>
Swept up a shard of a nature unknown<BR>
As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell<BR>
Into a deep slumber from what no one could tell<BR>
Their magic had faded, because of the Shard?<BR>
Or perhaps from the magic they call Veeshan's Veil<BR>
Now a new verse to this legend I'll share<BR>
In regards to Sky and what is happening there<BR>
Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin<BR>
The Wurm Queen's neglect wakes her children again<BR><BR>
My song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of my verse, for they speak the truth.<BR>
And only dragons once dwelled<BR>
but the door to Sky is not a one way portal<BR>
There is much to learn from the great Wurms<BR>
and much to fear<BR><BR>
I must be off...come my drake friend
</font></blockquote>
There ya go. Try to make some sense outa it.  Go ahead and email any ideas.  What I'm thinking is that there's going to be a GM quest similar to the one upon the opening of the PoH, but theres going to be dragons with this one.  Another thing that I'm thinking, is because she said, "There is much to learn from the great Wurms" that there might be a 'hail'able dragon in this gm quest.  Who knows?  Oh yes, I have also uploaded my <a href="GMQuest.txt" target="_blank"><B>eqlog</b></a> so that you can look at what she said.  Of course, I cleared out the clutter.<BR><BR>

<font color="blue">Well, its been getting kind of slow, and I must apoligize for the lack of updates on both Sparty's and my part.  I have, although, been working diligently on the new page, and I'm hoping it'll be up by the end of the month.  It's looking really good, and I'm just putting the finishing touches on now.  When I do finish, we'll open up the new page to a 'beta' testing, so that all you guys can go check it out and make sure its not bugged up or anything :-)  So hold tight, and you'll get some results.  Thanks for your patience, and I really gotta put another poll up there... that one's getting kinda boring, dont you think?

I must appologize for the amount of time its taken me to answer some of the Hotmail msgs...  I have been having modem trouble, (still am... had to answer the msgs from school...) And you dont even want to know how long it took me to transfer this all through my FTP editor...  BUT i answered some E-mails, and updated the other armor section.  Thanks again <font color="grey">LordBob</font> for the Skull Shaped Barbute stats...  I appologize again to him for the amount of time it took me to respond to his email (10 whole days!) But bare with me, i had HD problems and am still recovering from a hard formating....  If i get a cable modem soon then probably i wont have problems anymore *crosses fingers*  So sorry again...<BR>
