Well not to be left out, i have been working TOO :P  I am on e on a bestiary, and before you critize me for it, i am only lvl 30, so it takes me a while to look up the info, and ask friends to compile a list (ady is no help, being lvl 10 and all). i will post the Bestiary in the guides section when i finish it, which i hope will be by mid october, to the end of it...  ALSO on a side note, thanx to ady pushing me, i am starting to learn more bout dhtml, but click on <span onclick="expandText('expand',-10,10,1,30);" style="color: blue;cursor: hand">THIS</span> hyperlink and look at my name below...<body bgcolor="ffffff" onload="expandText('expand',-10,10,1,30);">

<font color="blue">*sighs heavily*  Okay all, I just finished doing ALL the armor!  Its done! Yay!  Go see how good a job I did by clicking <a href="equip.html"><b>HERE</b></a>.  Okie dokie.  I'm gonna put up the quests for crafted, yes, thats right, CRAFTED.  It'll be up in a few mins, or, maybe tomorrow.  Either way, it'll be up.  All that information (on almost all the armor and the crafted quest) came from <font color="white">Tialar the Druid</font>, now known as <font color="white">Sharg Har, the Troll Warrior</font>.  Welcome to the dark side, Sharg.  MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!<BR><BR>
Alright, I'll be taking down the poll on Saturday (or, if I dont have the time, on Sunday), so, quickly, vote for yes *really wants the frames version because it'll be easier on him*.  Remember that the prototype, which you can see <b><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/aderyneq">BY CLICKING HERE</a></b>, isn't that great because its just supposed to give you an idea of how'd it look.  PUUUHHHHHLLLLLEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEEEE vote yes!<BR>

<font color="blue">Well, I updated the Equipment section, and we're really gonna try to keep that part of the page going.  I hope as soon as I get back into the habit of school (or during winter break, whichever comes first ;-) I will write a low level warrior guide.  Its also my resolution to finish the Equipment section by mid-October.  I dont know if I... erm... we can do it, but I'll try.  I also want to send out a special thanks to <font color="white">Tialar the Druid</font>. Why is a druid sending us info? Why is he helping a warrior only site? God only knows. *Twighlight Zone music*  And also people who check the message board.  :) Cya ppl.<BR>

<font color="blue">Well, whadda think about the quote? (no, i wont put up a poll about it ;-) But anyway, sparty loves it.  Other then that we are getting back to doing the armor section.  If any high level warriors out there would please send us in the stats (mainly ac) on Rubricite, Banded, and any other 'special' armor out there (ie from the PoF).  On top of all that we've been added to the <b><a href="http://eqss.stratics.com/everring/" target="_BLANK">EverRing</a></b>, of EQSS, you can find a link at the bottom of the page... later all.<BR>

Another update today... I put up a new Quote under the intro of our site... its REALLY cool, read it...(its the italicized grey....) Also Ady was considering puting up a weekly quotes section... So voice your opinions bout that on the msg board!<BR>~<i>Spartycus</i><BR><BR>I AM BACK!!!! Yeah we havent been updating much, but we have been working a little.... (as for me i have been studying and passing tests...) i also got around to writing another rant, this one is on pvp, so come and view it at <a href="Weeklyrant.html">Spartycus's Weekly Rants! DUH!</a>So go there, view my rants, reply to them on the board, and please no flaming, remember they are just my opinions, i dont deserve to be insulted about it... logical arguments ppl! Also for those of you wh havent heard of a Mithral Mask, its REALLY rare, and very uncommon! Also if you ask for it in email without a background then lightning will come out of the sky and blast you where you stand....<BR>~<i>Spartycus</i><BR><BR><font color="blue">
Second Update: We recieved a Quest!!! Another one for a weapon, the Lanseax and the Lanseax of the Wolves.  I personally think that these two are great weapons, and I would like to throw out kudos to <font color="white">Joril Stoutbear, Waladen and Hance</font> thanks ya guys!
</font><BR><BR>
<font color="blue">Well, we haven't been updating much, but we've decided to change the background.  I've put up a new poll, and it asks if you want frames.  SO DO YOU?  Well I churned out a sample page, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/aderyneq/" target="_BLANK">Right Here!</a>, so that you can go and view it and stuff.  The background is different, so tell us if thats good.  Um... yeah none of the links work because its a prototype.  And thats it.  If you have any suggestions for a background, or if you can design one yourself, send it to us, and if we deem it worthy, you will win ... drumrolls, please, ... THE LOCATION OF THE MITHRIL MASK!!! WOW HOW AMAZING!!! Oh yeah and last but not least, I dont wanna see the dummy answer almost catch up with one of the real answers =)

<font color="blue">Heh well, Sparty beat me to the update.  So hes gonna do all the pics that get sent in... so whatever he can do it if he wants.  On the other hand, theres a new poll... please take time to fill it out :).  On the other, other hand, I also wish to say that I'm sorry for all the ppl on the East Coast who have been battling Floyd (who the heck thinks up these names NEway?).  Like sparty said, GREAT weather up here in CA.  On the other, other, other hand, I'm almost done with a 'prototype' frames webpage.  When I post the link, Ill put up a new poll to see what you guys think.  Thats it, later.

<BR>
<BR> God we haven't been updating much these days... Well i have been reading the posts, but we need more feedback, and no one offered to help with my frontpage thing :( guess no one wants to know where the razing sword of skarlon is.... hehe Well on another sad note, we are hoping that all you East Coasters are doing alright through the hurricane and all... It sure is nice here in California, like the weather i mean :) Well a while ago i posted that <font color="silver">anyone who wanted their warrior posted in the friends section of our page could, all you had to do was crop it and stuff so that all the really hard stuff is taken from me, and make it a jpg...</font> Well no one sent anything, so once again PLEASE send us your warrior picture, also include a nifty little profile for it... thanx!<BR>

<BR><font color="blue">So I'm sitting here, minding my own business, listening to the Mr. Roboto song (which is a very strange song... I like it... it starts out slow, then it goes to the fast, then it gets a little slower, then it goes to the main part that we all know from the Voltswagon or whatever commerical.  Pretty kewl anyway.. back to business) and I think to myself, "I should work on frames".  Then I think, "Hey, I should get Flash!".   Because I've worked with it before, I know how to use it.  So I start downloading.  It was gonna take 40 mins.  Big suprise on a 56.6k modem during peak hours.   So I download it, do HW, etc.  And I begin to setup, but its CORRUPTED!!! I wasn't happy.  I got over it, and began to download it again.  This is a good time to say that I have a power saving monitor that shuts off when no one uses it.  So its been about 1/2 an hour and I jiggle the mouse... about halfway done.  Then I go phew... this is gonna take a while.  On my hands way back up to my body, I tap the enter key.  And cancel the dl.  THAT SUX.  So in conclusion, I'm working on the frames section.<BR>

TEE HEE! Well i got around to writing my <a href="Weeklyrant.html">Weekly Rant</a> and so its up, i dont think its as long as it could be, but well i wrote it late at night, at around 2330, cutting it close but i did it! To find my Weekly Rants, go to the Guides section and click on <a href="Weeklyrant.html">Spartycus's Weekly Rants</a> Hehe reply to them, argue etc in the msg board! I need something to do with my hr which i cannot play eq but have nothing else to do!<BR>~<i>Spartycus</i><BR><BR>
YEAH! I DID IT! okay the background is alot better now, its red and blue, but the jpg also made it more spaced out, and dimmer, which is a plus! sorta, just dimmer woulda been better, but welll it doesnt conflict with the reading much at ALL! so its cool! Also if someone can explain to me WHY microsoft frontpage now crashes when i copy html from swordstrike, or other angelfire sites, into it, i would be most grateful!!! ALSO if ya tell me how to fix the damn thing, (tried re-installing it AND win 98) then we will..... tell ya where an item location is! YES thats it! a CONTEST! FIRST person to tell me how to fix frontpage, AND me actually being able to fix it, and i will tell ya WHERE to get the Razing Sword of Skarlon...<BR>
~<i>Stressedoutycus,<BR>er... Spartycus</i>
<BR><BR>
Okay, in an effort to make the background not as conflicting with the text, i goofed...(wow a whole sentance WITHOUT a swear word!!! Whoo hoo *puts a quarter in the anti-swear jar*) Okay now that that bs is over with, i really f-ed up and broke the background, BUT i think the damn infernal BLACK, seems to fit with the site, i want <u>FEEDBACK</u> <u>I</u> could really use that kinda help in the format on how the site looks, and if we go to frames, although NO ONE has sent any feedback on that either, we will need the help... (sorry, i am grouchy too much homework, and after 3days on no sleep, i am going crazy...)

<BR><BR><font size="5" color="#FFFFFF">September 10, 1999<BR></font><BR>
<font color="blue">Hey all... No, we haven't been neglecting our responsibilities as webmasters... actually, we've been overloaded by school, and haven't had much time to update, but as you can see from the subtle changes, we are here, just to lazy to update :) <BR>So I had a brainstorm: USE FRAMES!!! I really would like feedback about this, because I think that useing frames would be a lot easier on both sparty and me, but can degrade some of the visual cosmetics of the site... Wow thats my big words for the month.  Anyway, we... <u>I</U> would love some feedback about it... send us some email, and put something like Frames in teh subject... you feedback <u>IS</u> appreciated.<BR>
In other news, Sparty put up a Guild links page... screwed it all up cause he sux with html (sorry sparty, but its true) so I had to fix it... wasn't that hard tho, hes getting better.  Well... laterz ppl.

<BR><BR><font size="5" color="#FFFFFF">September 6, 1999<BR></font><BR>
<font color="blue">WOW... Sparty was <i>thinking</i> today!!!  I am amazed.  Well, anyway, the quests page, as some of you may have noticed, has been up for a few days, but no quests :-( Luckily, <font color="white">Mordrien Mistbane</font> came to our rescue and sent us in a quest, you can see it by going there now.<BR><BR>
On a compeletely unrelated topic, today is my birthday!!! *cheers* Thanks everyone!<BR><i>-Aderyn</i></font>
<BR><BR> I got to thinking today, we could add screenshots of your characters in the "About our friends" section, it would be hard, so please send in a already cut screenshot, i will make it transparent just make it easy for me :P and of course what you would like to say about your character.. Also to make the sorting of the pics easier, title it "My Warrior Character" and i will make it transparent and post your warrior, as well as your persona below it in the friends section, THANX! happy hunting!<BR>~<i>Spartycus</i><br><BR>Well i answered all the postings in the msg board. Also i fixed the rants section... The one problem with useing frontpage is copying and pasteing...  But well anyway, something bout adys archiving makes Frontpage crash when i try to use it and the news section, so i guess now is as good a time as any to ween myself from it...(sorry i cant spell its 1:30) Tee hee looked at our counter info, we have gotten ALOT of hits and its nice! gotta go to school again tommorow(as in Tuesday) great some more stress to add to this... As for ady wanting to archive again, of COURSE it will happen, i intend to work on this site even more, considering its fun and gives me something else to think about besides EQ and homework... well gota sleep, hope i helped those who asked questions... ASK MORE QUESTIONS, feel free, Ady and i have no lives, so we will help when we get on the computer... Enough of my rambling, going to sleep!<BR>~<i>Spartycus</i><BR><BR></font>
<font size="5" color="#FFFFFF">September 5, 1999<BR></font><BR>
<font color="blue">PHEW, finally got around to archiving the news... it was getting rather lengthy, don't you think?  Well, it's been archived, and you can get to it by following the "Old News" link at the bottom of the page.  (Should be right under this, unless... *dreams of the day when he has to archive the news <i>again</i> and hopes the site stays around that long*)Well, I made a page for the quests, which is kinda pointless because we dont have any quests because for some reason you guys dont send em in... PLEASE do.  Take em from another site and paraphrase it.  Or something... whatever, just send em in.  Okay, I know your thinking, 'Why doesn't that lasy Aderyn just go and paraphrase himself?'  Because I'm too lazy.  No, actually I'm kinda busy... playing EQ, updating the page... etc, and it would be A LOT easier if you guys would just help us out here.  Thanks.<BR><BR>On compeletely unrelated news, I've finished the  first week of school, with THREE schedule changes because of how nothing is working right at my school, and it seems pretty good.  Just huge amounts of home work, but I can go through that without going insane, I did it last year, right? RIGHT?  Good. <BR>
