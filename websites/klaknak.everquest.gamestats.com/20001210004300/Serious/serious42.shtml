      <blockquote> 
        <p>This hasn't been the best month for Verant.</p>
        <p>Although there are some players who think Verant has been the embodiment 
          of evil since Everquest became a germ of an idea, most believe, as I 
          do, that Everquest has been a pretty awesome experience overall.</p>
        <p>But what has happened recently?</p>
        <p>While I was running around to different websites hocking my latest 
          humor material, I came across all kinds of EQ craziness I had neglected 
          to notice before (due to my recent Asheron's Call play). </p>
        <p>Here are some recent events for you to ponder</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1. Verant starts off the month of hell by announcing that its new 
            EULA will give Verant the right to sniff our computers for programs 
            like ShowEQ. Many customers, myself included, went absolutely apeshit 
            ballistic. Verant recanted. </p>
          <p>2. Verant also declares all Ebay-style auctioning a no-no. This displeases 
            some, but pleases most, myself included. </p>
          <p>3. As part of an April Fool's joke, Verant nerfs the test server. 
            Mostly, some losers get really upset, but secretly some people (including 
            myself) wonder if Verant should be working on EQ's numerous problems 
            instead of screwing around in the test server with April's Fools jokes. 
            The actions also seem to be a not so subtle finger-in-the-eye to those 
            players who take issues like game balance very seriously. It seemed 
            ... a little vindictive ... instead of funny. </p>
          <p>4. The minions at ShowEQ discover that humans do NOT get a racial 
            experience boost, contrary to what the Official guidebook states. 
            The powers at Verant reply in a very Clintonesque way, saying that 
            they had no control over the guidebook. Eventually, Smed (I think) 
            said that humans may seem to level faster because they dont suffer 
            racial penalties which makes sense to me, at least. I just kinda wonder 
            why he hadn't mentioned it earlier. </p>
          <p>5. Player accounts are banned for improper station names. According 
            to news reports, the players were not given the opportunity to change 
            their name. Verant says, once again, that this was not really their 
            mistake but that they are looking into it. </p>
          <p>6. Players are banned for selling their accounts and whatnot on Ebay 
            and related services. </p>
          <p>7. And finally, in a crushing blow to Verant, it was revealed that 
            some customers would not receive their upgrade shipments on time. 
            Verant promises to give these people a free month of EQ but some question 
            whether this will recoup shipping costs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So, let's return to the previous question.</p>
        <p>Is Verant on crack or are they taking charge?</p>
        <p>I think it is easy to look at these past events and see them as some 
          sort of incredible meltdown in the glorious home office, but I think 
          it is important to consider a few things.</p>
        <p>First, not all of these issues are really branches from the same tree. 
          Some of the problems were the result of really bad PR work, some were 
          from Verant's good faith attempt to lock down on exploiters in the game 
          and some were just flat out bad mistakes. Now, you could reasonably 
          argue that since it is the same people running this crazy farm that 
          all of these problems are the same, but I think in some cases Verant 
          is acting in good faith and in other cases they are not. I think there 
          is definitely a difference, although if I was a hoary old school stock 
          holder I would probably be screaming for Smedley's head on a plate right 
          about now.</p>
        <p>I think Verant's attempt to crack down on hackers or losers with stupid 
          names is a good faith effort to keep EQ from turning into the sewage 
          dump that is Ultima Online. OSI really didn't give a rat's ass about 
          most of these issues and as a result it saw its populations slowly fall 
          as other games came available on the market. Verant is trying to protect 
          EQ from a similar fate. Do you think it is a coincidence that all of 
          this new stuff is going on at the same time UO is releasing its new, 
          "people friendly" expansion to UO? I think not.</p>
        <p>The problem, however, is that the PR people, who happen to be the game 
          developers and servants, must have learned PR work from a team of gorillas. 
          Never in my life have I seen so many gross misjudgments and missteps. 
          I find it almost impossible to believe that someone on the team didnt 
          think that the new EULA clause regarding sniffing might cause a little 
          bit of a ruckus. Is Verant that out of touch with everyday events? In 
          a year where Amazon.com was universally booed for patenting its one 
          click schtick and congresses and federal agencies the nation over are 
          seriously looking into how companies may be violating consumer privacy, 
          Verant charges ahead on this sensitive issue, and ends up getting clobbered. 
          This was one of the most braindead decisions I have seen in a long time. 
        </p>
        <p>The latest mistake (and possibly a deathblow for some customers) is 
          this shipping mistake. In normal companies, this would signal the end 
          of the careers for probably half of management. But in game companies, 
          I am not sure how this works. This is just such a collosal (albeit more 
          traditional) business screw up that Verant will be paying for this one 
          for months. Everytime a little problem comes up from now on, this shipping 
          fiasco will be used, justifiably or not, as an example of Verant's continued 
          foibles. </p>
        <p>Because what Verant is suffering from, more than anything, is a horrible 
          image problem and some of this image problem is actually pretty justifiable. 
          It wasn't losers alone who complained about the EULA and it isn't losers 
          alone complaining about the shipping problems. Now, I am the first person 
          to admit that most people are probably happy with the game and the vocal 
          minority are the ones trying to bring it down, but with the EULA and 
          now the shipping fiasco, I wonder if some of this discontent is seeping 
          into the warm and fuzzy majority that never speaks.</p>
        <p>Finally, the real shame is this: Verant has basically ZERO room to 
          wiggle if Kunark has even the slightest problem when it goes live. People 
          will already be hypersensitive to even the smallest snafus; and a big 
          snafu, like a major server outage, could curse EQ for months and months 
          to come. If Kunark turns out to work fairly well, I think most people 
          will forget the events of the last month and focus on the new continent. 
          But if there is a major outage or problem, many will probably wonder, 
          as I will wonder, if the people who run Verant really are incompetent, 
          like the vocal minority has been suggesting for months now.</p>
