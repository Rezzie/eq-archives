  <p>Hiya, folks. It’s update time again. I know I will be labeled a loser by 
    all the powergamers and d00ds out there, but I have to say, I love working 
    on skills in EQ. I have mastered in all of them with one character or another, 
    except for jewelcraft. But by far my favorite skill to work on is Alcohol 
    Tolerance. My group mates will agree, hardly a camp goes by that I do not 
    pound down a few brews. But you have to be careful. Nothing worse than being 
    drunk off your arse and then having every monster spawn at once. So I petitioned 
    Verant and they actually listened! (NOT!) </p>
  <p><a href="../Parody/AntiVer/antiver18.shtml">Verant’s New Warning Labels on 
    Alcoholic Beverages</a> </p>
  <p>I have gotten very few e-mails for my advice column. C’mon folks! I know 
    all of you out there are dysfunctional! A couple of brave souls did send in 
    questions, so I will dispense more of my worldly wisdom in the <a href="hottub.shtml">Hot 
    Tub</a> </p>
  <p>A new Stupid Topic is here! Yes, you no longer will have to stand around

 Hiya, everyone. A word of advice. Never buy a house unless you have enough 
      money to pay someone to do everything for it. And just so everyone knows, 
      painting and wallpapering sucks. By the way. I saw the movie 'Gladiator' 
      over the weekend and it was awesome! I highly recommend it. Now to wait 
      for Mission Impossible 2. On to the update! First off, I play both AC and 
      EQ and I really like them both. However, they are both very different. When 
      AC first came out, you could usually tell who was an EQ refugee by the questions 
      they asked. And me being a smart-ass I had alot of sarcastic answers for 
      them. 
    <p>So here are the <a href="../Topten/topten59.shtml">Top 10 Sarcastic answers 
      to an EQ refugee's AC questions</a>
    <p> As I'm sure most of you out there know unless you have been in a coma 
      or you got to this site by the link from '1001 Worst Internet Sites', Ruins 
      of Kunark, the EQ expansion came out. People by the thousands flooded to 
      the new lands in the last week or so. However, I stayed behind. Why you 
      ask? Because. 
    <p>Here are the <a href="../Topten/topten58.shtml">Top 10 reasons I'm not 
      going to Kunark</a></p>
    
  <p>Before you begin to think this site is 'Phaethon's House of Top Tens', I 
    do post other things. So keep hitting that refresh button. A new stupid topic 
    is on the way!</p>

    <p>First off, I’m sorry for the lack of updates but I have been swamped with 
      work. Luckily my boss is gone today and you know what that means…UPDATE! 
    </p>
    <p>Now for the big news. As you know, this site is dedicated to EQ. But I 
      have been making fun of EQ for almost a year now, and I am starting to run 
      out of stuff to joke about. Sure, Kunark might provide me with some fodder, 
      but I want to branch out into other games. As I have talked about in My 
      Brain, I play a lot of other games that just beg to be made fun of. I know 
      some of you purists will flame me, but I gotta go where the humor is. So 
      here is my first non-EQ humor post. </p>
    <p><a href="../klakboard/klak07.shtml">Walmart’s Top Selling PC games</a> 
    </p>
    <p>And don’t fear. I will still post EQ humor. As a matter of fact, I still 
      love EQ. To prove it, here are my <a href="../Topten/topten57.shtml">Top 
      Ten Things I like about EQ</a> </p>
    <p>Thanks to everyone who sent in responses to my Stupid Topic. One common 
      theme was people responding that they would pick Cyanna Thunderhammer if 
      she were a super hero. That got me thinking. <a href="../klakboard/klak08.shtml">What

    <p>Hello, all. I hope this update finds you all well. Let’s begin with a story. 
      The master bedroom in my house has huge windows facing out to the front 
      of the house. The master bath is my husband’s domain (I do not go in there 
      unless armed with rubber gloves, a gas mask, and radiation suit), so I use 
      another bathroom. Well, my bathroom is very small so I normally dress in 
      the bedroom. Now the neighbor across the street likes to sit on his front 
      porch and it seems he is always looking up through the window. Sometimes 
      I forget to close the blinds and I will walk past them in my underwear and 
      there he is looking in. I mentioned this to my husband who thought of a 
      creative solution. He waited until I told him the guy was looking. Then 
      he walked up to the window, totally naked and then bent over, putting his 
      big hairy butt right against the window. Now, not only does the guy not 
      stare in the windows, but he never talks to us either. </p>
    <p>As you know from looking at the Cyanna’s Secret section, I have a lot of 
      pets. I love animals, especially cats. My six cats are my babies and I love 
      them more than anything, even though they drive me crazy at times. And my 
      dog, who is only a few months old is a terror. So I can sympathize with 
      the EQ classes that have to deal with unruly pets. In honor of those noble 
      classes saddled with less that cooperative pets here are the <a href="../Topten/topten55.shtml">Top 
      Ten signs your pet may have been secretly nerfed</a>.</p>
    <p>I also talk about my obsession with The Sims in <a href="brain.shtml">My 
      Brain</a>. Thanks to everyone who sent in responses to the Stupid Topic. 
      I am currently sifting through the masses of e-mail, so you will have to 
      tune in next time for it. </p>
    <p>Be sure to tune in next time because a big change is coming for Cyanna’s 
      Place. </p>



  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">April 12, 19100</font></b></p>
  <p>Well folks, I have 2 stories to tell you about that will preempt 
    the talking about my pets. (I’ll save that for another update). </p>
  <p>If you have seen my picture in the Cyanna’s Secret section you 
    are probably thinking I look kind of young. I am regularly treated like a 
    teenager even though I am over 30. I am always being carded for R movies and 
    for getting into bars. The other day I went to the drug store to get some 
    stuff, including some diet pills (being sick for a week helped but I still 
    have not reached my goal). [editor’s note: And no, I am not going to say how 
    much I weigh] Well, I got to the counter and the woman said I had to be 18 
    to buy them. I said ‘I am almost 32 years old.’ She said ‘Yeah, right. Can 
    I see some ID.’ I did not have my license with me so I showed her my company 
    ID with my picture on it. I said ‘I would not be a network tech if I was still 
    in high school.’ It was not good enough. Finally I said ‘Look, if I was under 
    18, I would not need diet pills!’ The manager came over and I was able to 
    convince her I was over 18. Sheesh! </p>
  <p>Then my husband and I went to our martial arts class. Now my 
    husband is what CK would call a big galloot. He is not buff, he is just a 
    really big guy. There was this guy at class that kept coming on to me. He 
    was always talking to me, and staring at me, and wanting to work with me. 
    After class he went up to my husband and said ‘I saw you come in with Anna. 
    Are you her dad?’ My husband, ever the smart ass, said ‘No, I’m her husband. 
    Want to spar with me?’ The guy hurried out and never came back to class. </p>
  <p>Message board regulars will recognize my new stupid topic since 
    I posted it there a long time ago on the old board. But I resurrected it since 
    my husband has been lacking in the Stupid Topic department. (slacker!). So 
    here in its encore presentation is the <a href="stupid.shtml">Stupid Topic.</a> 
  </p>
  <p align="left">As the Klaknak librarian, it is my job to keep track of all 
    the EQ archives. Here is a compiled list of the <a href="../klakboard/klak06.shtml">Shortest 
    Books in the EQ Library</a>. </p>
  <p align="left">Lastly, I know you people are dysfunctional, so send in some 
    more advice questions! They do not even have to be EQ related. Next time I 
    will talk about my pets, I promise, plus another new Top Ten, and a story 
    about foiling peeping toms. </p>

  <p align="left">I am back and better than ever, baby!</p>
  <p align="left"> I have to relate a humorous story. I work at an insurance company. 
    A friend of mine works in the sales rep training department. He was telling 
    me about how he has to make some training videos. I asked him if he was the 
    director. He said, more the executive producer. Since my company is so cheap, 
    he is not allowed to hire professional actors but has to get his friends to 
    act in the video. Jokingly I asked him if I had to sleep with him to get a 
    part since I want my 15 minutes of fame. I told him I had 'acted' in some 
    other 'videos' but I cannot use them on a resume since you never see my face. 
    I told him if he wanted an example of my work he could download it off the 
    internet. I asked him if this was the kind of video where they get some good 
    looking hunk to come to my door and I answer it in some flimsy lingerie. The 
    guy says 'I am here to sell you some insurance'. I say 'Come in'. And then 
    some bad 70's music starts playing. Anway, I am cast as Wife #3. Coming to 
    training facilities and adult bookstores soon. </p>
  <p align="left">We here at Cyanna's Place serve to not only entertain the public 
    but to educate and assist as well. Have you ever heard this 'WTS/WTT FBR for 
    BIBS' shouted across the zone and responded with 'WTF?' Have you ever been 
    in a group and heard this exchange 'OOM', 'AFK BRB GGP', 'ROFL'. Well, worry 
    no longer. I have constructed a handy dandy <a href="../Parody/AntiPlay/antiplay11.shtml">EQ 
    Glossary of Acronyms</a>. Soon you too, will be slinging 'LOL's, 'BRT's and 
    'WTB's with the best of them. </p>
  <p align="left">Also, we have the responses to the latest <a href="stupid.shtml">Stupid 
    Topic</a>. Lastly, I have halfling and druid guests in the <a href="hottub.shtml">Hottub</a> 
    to whom I dole out more bad advice. </p>
  <p align="left">Coming soon: I talk at length about my pets (hey, at least I 
    have not brought out the vacation trip slides), a new Stupid Topic to discuss 
    at the water cooler, and a new Top Ten! Hurray! </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">April 1, 19100</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">Ack. Sorry for the lack of updates by I have been battling a 
    case of the 72 hour bubonic plague. But I am back to fighting strength now 
    and I lost 5 pounds in the process! WOOHOO! So now I can have my rootbeer 
    and ho-ho's and not feel guilty. </p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, a little bit more background about me. I grew up in 
    upper middle class suburbs. My husband grew up in the ethnic melting pot of 
    Miami. When we got married we moved to the country. Boy, were we in for some 
    culture shock! I had heard all those 'You might be a redneck if...' jokes 
    but I had no idea how true they were. Now I live in the world of Wal-marts, 
    pickup trucks and shotguns. I even learned to like country music. So, always 
    one to capitalize on someone else's ideas, I present: <a href="../Parody/AntiPlay/antiplay10.shtml">You 
    might be an EQ redneck if...</a></p>

  <p align="left"> I also talk about my latest obesession in <a href="brain.shtml">My 
    Brain</a>. I know it is not much of an update (Leave me alone! I was sick!) 
    but the next one will be a biggie. I'll have some new bad advice to dispense 
    in the Hottub, Stupid Topic responses (Hurray!), and a helpful EQ glossary.

  <p align="left">I LOVE toys! My house and office are full to bursting with toys. 
    There is not a room in my house that does not have a stuffed animal in it, 
    and every uncluttered space in my office has some sort of toy on it. My co-workers 
    fear me and my squirt gun! I have a magic eight ball to help me make important 
    business decisions (I especially like to use it in front of my boss or customers). 
    I also have a ball the size of my fist that I made entirely out of hundreds 
    of rubberbands (I was bored one afternoon). My favorites toys are Pikachu, 
    Elmo, Dilbert, and Meeko (the raccoon from Pocahantas). When I heard that 
    Verant was coming out with a line of EQ toys I had mixed emotions. I love 
    toys. I have a love/hate relationship with EQ. Will I actually give Verant 
    more of my money for these toys? I had to find out more. Here are my findings:
