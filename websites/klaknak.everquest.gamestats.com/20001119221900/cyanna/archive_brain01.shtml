      <p >As some of you may know if you looked at the Cyanna’s Secret section, 
        I am hopelessly addicted to ‘The Sims’. This is one of the best games 
        I’ve ever played, but I cannot really call it a game. There is no competition 
        (except for affections), no enemies (except my boyfriend’s wife), and 
        no ending (unless I die in an unfortunate oven accident). And I do not 
        know why it is so addicting. I just have to keep playing for one more 
        day, or until I get a promotion, or until I have so much money saved, 
        or until this person falls in love with me. </p>
      <p>One of the things I like about it is how free form it is. Almost anything 
        you can do in real life you can do here. I love building my houses. Sometimes 
        I tear them down just to build them back up again. And I love decorating 
        them. I love shopping for new stuff. I love creating families using my 
        own friends and families as models. And it is amazing how much they act 
        like their RL counterparts. My Sim hubby is a slob who never picks up 
        after himself and spends too much time watching TV. Sim Anna will not 
        get off the computer and is late for work almost every day. If not for 
        caffeine, she would drop over from exhaustion from playing on the computer 
        all night.</p>
      <p>I am also working on creating custom skins. I cannot wait to make a Cyanna 
        Thunderhammer skin. I have gotten some requests for more info on my Sims, 
        like screenshots and stuff, and I will be posting some of my personal 
        Sims stuff in the future.</p>
      <p>Relationships are the best part of the game. Interacting with Sims is 
        always an adventure and you never know how they are going to react. Love 
        triangles abound in my Sim neighborhood, and slap fights break out occasionally. 
        As I have said in the past, I love paying matchmaker and this program 
        allows me to do it without losing RL friends. I try and come up with bizarre 
        situations and place my Sims in them to see what happens, and I am never 
        disappointed by what they do. The only limit is your imagination. My friends 
        and I have even started talking like Sims. My brother said the other day 
        as he headed for the bathroom, ‘My bladder bar is in the red’. I told 
        him, ‘Make sure you flush and wash up or your hygiene will go down.’ I 
        saw a bunch of cars in my neighbor’s driveway and I told my husband, ‘They 
        must be working up their social bar.’</p>
      <p > In closing, this is a great game and I encourage all of you to give 
        it a try. You will be amazed and hopelessly addicted just like me. </p>

      <p>I just want to say that I LOVE ‘The Crocodile Hunter’! <br>
        This is one of the best shows on television and one of my all time favorites 
        (along with Law and Order). For those of you living in a cave or under 
        a rock without cable TV, The Crocodile Hunter is a show on Animal Planet 
        and Discovery channel. It is about this wacky Australian guy named Steve 
        Erwin and his American wife, Terry. This guy is totally NUTS! He is a 
        real life Tarzan and Crocodile Dundee rolled into one. He travels around 
        the world irritating the most fearsome and dangerous animals on the planet. 
        I have seen him go nose-to-nose with some of the deadliest snakes in the 
        world, jump into croc infested waters to wrestle one into his boat, and 
        pull on the tails of huge komodo dragons. Every episode I wonder how he 
        is still alive after the totally goofy and screwball stunts he does. His 
        insurance premiums must be astronomical! </p>
      <p>One of his trademarks is the tan shirt, shorts, and hiking boots he wears 
        at all times. I have seen him scuba dive in them and one time he attended 
        a black tie party in New York in them. I just wonder how many pairs of 
        them he has. I’m guessing one.</p>
      <p> And his wife has got to be a saint of understanding. If my husband did 
        half the stuff, Steve does, I would kick his butt (or at least nag him 
        a lot). Some of the funniest times are when they get really aggravated 
        with each other on camera but try and stay civil to one another. </p>
      <p>One of Steve’s endearing traits is how expressive he is, and how childlike 
        his fascination is. Everything he sees is the most beautiful or biggest 
        he has ever seen in his entire life. He is like a big kid having fun with 
        the lizards and spiders in his back yard (only he is doing it with 1000 
        lb. crocodiles and poisonous snakes).</p>
      <p> One incident sums up the show perfectly. He was driving at night and 
        he saw a huge black snake on the road. Rather than get it run over, he 
        got out and grabbed it by the tail to move it. Of course the snake was 
        the biggest and most beautiful ever, so he had to get a closer look. Well, 
        the snake struck and latched onto the meaty part of his hand. He pried 
        the snake fangs out and moved the snake off the road. Then he was so flustered 
        he could not remember if the snake was poisonous or not. As he commented 
        ‘If that snake is poisonous I am as good as dead.’ He got out a book and 
        started to look it up. When he found out the snake was not poisonous, 
        he raised his fist in the air and yelled ‘WOOHOO!’</p>
      <p> I want to say that in these days where just about everything on TV is 
        about violence and sex, this show is a bright spot of entertainment. It 
        is a show that the whole family can watch and enjoy. It teaches conservation, 
        and treating all animals and the environment with respect, plus it is 
        a major hoot. And after watching and reading about Steve and Terry in 
        numerous interviews and articles, I must say they are the nicest, sweetest 
        people. They lead a simple life as caretakers of a zoo in Australia with 
        their daughter. </p>
      <p>They also have a daily show called ‘The Croc Files’. So check your local 
        listings to find out when they are on and watch them, by crikey! It is 
        great, simple, and nice entertainment. </p>
      <p>P.S. I just got my Crocodile Hunter shirt in the mail and I am so excited. 
        It has Steve on the front holding a crocodile and saying ‘What a little 
        beauty!’ Now if the darn videos would just get here. </p>

      <p align="center"><font class="basictitle">March 15, 2000</font></p>
      <p>First off, I love RPGs, whether they are pen-and-paper or computer games. 
        I have been playing D&D for a very long time. I actually met my husband 
        playing D&D. I told him the reason I married him was because he was such 
        a good DM and I did not want to lose him.</p>
      <p>We still play every Saturday night, and recently my group completed a 
        2-year long Planescape campaign run by my husband. It was one of his best 
        ever, and when I saw they were making a computer game about it I had mixed 
        feelings. Computer games are never as good as the pen-and-paper games 
        but it was being made by the people who made Fallout 2 (the best CRPG 
        ever in my opinion) so it had potential. </p>
      <p>Well, after playing it for a while all I have to say is WOW! This game 
        is great! It has everything that made Fallout 2 the best and more. It 
        has interesting and memorable characters, a great story, and true roleplaying 
        elements. Quests, puzzles, and dialogue are all based on your stats and 
        how you choose to play. It strays from the true D&D formula, but in all 
        the right ways, making it more immersive and less number intensive. It 
        was also very neat to see visually all the things I had heard and read 
        about Planescape. Sometimes this can be disappointing if the images do 
        not match your imagination. But this was not the case for me. The first 
        time I walked out into Sigil and saw the city curving up over my head 
        on the horizon it was even better than I imagined.</p>
      <p> I have not finished it yet, so until I do I cannot say if it is the 
        best ever, but if you like CRPGs or if you have ever played Planescape 
        you need to play this game.</p>
