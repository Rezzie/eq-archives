  <p>Swimming Skill, Idiot Skill, Same Difference - by Brokk</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> My name is Brokk, on the Bristlebain server. I had been chatting 
    with a friend in Crushbone, who was struggling with killstealers on the trainer 
    hill. So, I decided to be noble, and go from Misty Thicket, where I had just 
    gotten and was just hanging around bashing bats, run to Freeport, and hop 
    a boat to help him. As I zone (on the boat) into Butcherblock, I hear the 
    screams and cries of a swarthy Dwarf. He dropped his axe off the dock and 
    couldn't find it in the ocean. So I jumped off the dock, looked around quickly, 
    and told him that it was next to a pillar and a barrel, and I saw him swimming 
    toward it. So I got up, and stood on the beach, ostensibily waiting to make 
    sure he found it, but really waiting to be thanked. He still couldn't find 
    it. So I jumped back into the water, swam down to it, and tried to pick it 
    up. No luck. I watched my air-meter, and I had plenty of air for the task, 
    so I tried again and again. No luck. Maybe I was too tall. So I ducked down 
    to pick it up. No. I'm thinking "this is weird... I wonder why I can't get 
    it?" The dwarf swims by, and I inspect him. He swims off, and I go back - 
    "hey... I'm almost out of air. I'd better swim back to the top." For some 
    reason, I couldn't swim. I could barely walk. I can't figure out why not. 
    Panic sets in. I'm flailing at the keyboard, trying to swim up, yelling at 
    the top of my lungs. My wife, ever helpful, looks over and says "point up, 
    swim straight up." I yell back "I am! I am!" and then it dawns on me. Yup, 
    I'm still ducked. I stand up just in time to drown. [Loading ... Please wait...]
