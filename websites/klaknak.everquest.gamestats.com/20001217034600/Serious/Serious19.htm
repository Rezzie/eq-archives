  <p>A Nonpartisan Takeover of the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <p>by Mortimer Screw</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Under the leadership of President Pat Robertson, Christian 
    Coalition is the largest and most effective grassroots political movement 
    of Christian activists in the history of our nation. Now, under the 21 Victory 
    Club plan, we are recruiting 100,000 volunteers to serve as liaisons between 
    their churches and local Christian Coalition chapters - an effort to mobilize 
    hundreds of thousands of pro-family activists by November 2000. Our efforts 
    to encourage conservative people of faith to participate in the democratic 
    process includes: Nonpartisan voter guides and scorecards, Religious Rights 
    Watch and other newsletters, Nationwide conferences and training seminars, 
    A lobbying staff in Washington, D.C., Affiliates in every state - more than 
    2000 local chapters, Action Alert postcards, phone calls, and e-mail, Get-out-the-vote 
    mailings and phone calls.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left">Before we get started with the Klaknak, let's all reflect on your 
  past mistakes by reading some selections from the Christian Coalition quotable 
  quotes!</p>
<p align="left">(Disclaimer: While we certainly applaud our members' demanding 
  that these quotes be made part of the Holy Bible, we ... oh shoot, go ahead. 
  We won't mind.)</p>
<p align="left">"The Constitution of the United States, for instance, is a marvelous 
  document for self-government by the Christian people. But the minute you turn 
  the document into the hands of non-Christian people and atheistic people they 
  can use it to destroy the very foundation of our society. And that's what's 
  been happening." -- Pat Robertson, The 700 Club, Dec. 30, 1981</p>
<p align="left">"You say you're supposed to be nice to the Episcopalians and the 
  Presbyterians and the Methodists and this, that, and the other thing. Nonsense. 
  I don't have to be nice to the spirit of the Antichrist. I can love the people 
  who hold false opinions but I don't have to be nice to them."--Pat Robertson, 
  The 700 Club, January 14, 1991</p>
<p align="left">"Just like what Nazi Germany did to the Jews, so liberal America 
  is now doing to the evangelical Christians. It's no different. It is the same 
  thing. It is happening all over again. It is the Democratic Congress, the liberal-based 
  media and the homosexuals who want to destroy the Christians. Wholesale abuse 
  and discrimination and the worst bigotry directed toward any group in America 
  today. More terrible than anything suffered by any minority in history."--Pat 
  Robertson, 1993 interview with Molly Ivins </p>
<p align="left">"I know this is painful for the ladies to hear, but if you get 
  married, you have accepted the headship of a man, your husband. Christ is the 
  head of the household and the husband is the head of the wife, and that's the 
  way it is, period."--Pat Robertson, "The 700 Club," 1/8/92 </p>
<p align="left">"I don't know that atheists should be considered citizens, nor 
  should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God."-- George 
  Bush </p>
<p align="left">"We should resist the temptation to identify our religious convictions 
  with the platform of a party or the platitudes of favored politicians."--Ralph 
  Reed, 1996</p>
<p align="left">"It's like guerrilla warfare. If you reveal your location, all 
  it does is allow your opponent to improve his artillery bearings. It's better 
  to move quietly, with stealth, under cover of night. You've got two choices: 
  You can wear cammies and shimmy along on your belly, or you can put on a red 
  coat and stand up for everyone to see. It comes down to whether you want to 
  be the British army in the Revolutionary War or the Viet Cong. History tells 
  us which tactic was more effective."--Ralph Reed Los Angeles Times, 3/22/92</p>
<p align="left"><font size="1">[Klaknak's note: Bwahahah. These two quotes together 
  are priceless.]</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="1">[Christian's note: Shut up you!]</font></p>
<p align="left">I want to be invisible. I do guerrilla warfare. I paint my face 
  and travel at night. You don't know it's over until you're in a body bag." --Ralph 
  Reed, Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, 11/9/91</p>

<p align="left">Ok, now that we have realigned your Satancratic views and have 
  brought you to the light, let's talk to this Klaknak fellow so that I may show 
  you the error of his ways. </p>
<p align="left">Mortimer Screw: Bring in the prisoner.</p>
<p align="left">Tom Delay: Yes, master. </p>
<p align="left">[Delay shuffles off and brings the Klaknak into the room]</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Mr. Klaknak! Mr. Klaknak!</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Hi.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Mr. Klaknak, it is our purpose to interview you and 
  show to your fans the errors of your ways. You are here of free will, correct?</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Um ...</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Mr. Lott! The whip!</p>
<p align="left">[a whip cracks across the Klaknak's back]</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Yes! Yes! I am here of my own free will.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Very good. Now, please tell all of us the purpose of 
  your Satanic site here.</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Would you mind removing the pincers from my scrotum please?</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Oh, very well. There. Feel better?</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Yes, thank you. Well, the Cackling Klaknak website is 
  a humor website dedicated to the game Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Ah, I see. And what is Everquest?</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Well, on the face Everquest is a Computer Roleplaying 
  game where people can come together and play various roles in a fantasy environment. 
  In reality, it is merely an experiment in crowd control.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Ah, roleplaying. My nemesis. I thought we got rid of 
  that back in the 80's by secretly promoting Menudo with their ribald, sensuous, 
  glistening ... ahh ... sexuality ... ahhh ...</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: No, not true. Roleplaying games have made a huge comeback 
  by becoming glorified MIRC channels.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Ah, yes. MIRC. Are you familiar with the Christian Coalition's 
  God Hates Fags channel?</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Um, no. So, anyway, I wanted to do a humor site on Ultima 
  Online, another online crowd control experiment, but I hated the game, so when 
  Everquest came out, I quickly jumped on the opportunity to shove my Satanic 
  propaganda down everyone's throat.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Ah hah! So you admit it! Mr. Buchanan! Show him the 
  instruments!</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: You know, back when your organization flourished in the 
  1500's, they only showed the instruments when someone didn't confess.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Oh, yeah. Right. Damn, I never get that right. </p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: So what is your problem with my site?</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: It is a tool of the devil!</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: How is that?</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Because you promote Satanism!</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: How?</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: By being a tool of the devil!</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: I ... see ...</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Do you admit being a tool of Satan?</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: Sure! When do I learn the secret handshake?</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: You don't know it? Oh, well, first you take your pinky 
  finger and ... um ... hey! </p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: What kind of name is Mortimer Screw anyway?</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: It is the name you gave me to parodize the Christian 
  Coalition</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: How postmodern.</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Indeed. Our conversation, even now, undermines the authority 
  of narrative in instructive discourse.</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: k3wl!</p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Satan! Satan!</p>
<p align="left">[A loud noise startles the participants in the dungeon. Three 
  gallants dressed in finery rush to the scene.]</p>
<p align="left">Al Sharpton: The Cackling Klaknak! We are here to save you!</p>
<p align="left">Reggie White: All for one, one for all!</p>
<p align="left">Jesse Jackson: As soon as I heard your plea, I flew to Appalachia. 
  Then I flew here, to be with you in good cheer.</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak: It's the Three African American Reverends come to save 
  me! </p>
<p align="left">Mortimer: Ahhhh! Ahhh! N----- ! Run!</p>
<p align="left">[Exeunt Christian Coalition]</p>
<p align="left">The Cackling Klaknak: Thanks guys! I don't know much about Christianity, 
  but I know those guys are wrong.</p>
<p align="left">Jesse Jackson: I am glad we made it here in time, to save you 
  with our Christian rhyme.</p>
<p align="left">The Cackling Klaknak: If it rhymes, it must be right. With our 
  raps, we will Pat Robertson smite!</p>
<p align="left">Jesse Jackson: Ok, white boy. Leave the rhyming to me. Let's go!</p>
<p align="left">[And so the Three African American Reverends and the Cackling 
  Klaknak fly off into the sunset]</p>
