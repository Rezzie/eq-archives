  <p><font size="4">Drinking and Befallen is Contraindicated - by Drapper Everglade</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I was a 15th level Druid, partied with one of my best buds, 
    another 15th level Druid. We seem to both be very cautious, and we finally 
    made the trip from Kelethin to Freeport. We decided that it would be great 
    fun to check out Befallen. Well, it was late at night, we were both having 
    a few beers in real life, and it was starting to get nerve racking.</p>
  <p align="left">First level, no problem. Second level, a little tougher. We 
    would heal ourselves, med up, peek into the next room, then withdraw to discuss 
    strategy. We would storm a room of 5 or 6 undead, kill them all, and med again. 
    Thankfully the spawn rate is pretty slow there, and that allowed us to med 
    in the rooms we just cleared. Now the good part. After a particularly hairy 
    battle, which we barely won, we headed for the next room all fired up. I opened 
    the door and side stepped to the left, back against the wall to survey the 
    room. Arzak, my partner, came barreling into the room, and right into a hole 
    in the floor *** CRUNCH ***. He tells me he's in a room with one door on the 
    third level, and hes gating back to the entrance. So, like a good friend, 
    and trembling at the thought of dying alone, I gate back also.</p>
  <p align="left">We head back in and fight our way back to the same room. I turn 
    and tell him, "Now remember that hole, dont fall in again !" He assures me 
    it wont happen again. Guess what? It was like instant replay, down the hole 
    he goes again. Trying to contain my laughter, I can hear him cussing, but 
    he comes up with a brilliant idea. Theres a fallen rock down there that leads 
    back up to the room im in. So he scales it, and it pushes him to the crouch 
    position. Due to some graphical bugs, which im sure youve all experienced, 
    I can see his head and shoulders popping up through the floor, with that swishing 
    sound of someone in crouch mode.</p>
  <p align="left">Unfortunately the skeleton in the room sees him too and starts 
    attacking. Im in tears as I see him stop, spinning in circles, trying to see 
    whats attacking him. After I regained composure, I kill the skeleton, and 
    all that remains is an infected rat in my room. The ever determined Arzak 
    swears he can get through the ceiling/floor back up to my room.</p>
  <p align="left">Then the tears started flying, his head ended up right under 
    the rat. Arzak pauses, starts spinning in circles to get his bearings, stops 
    and utters, "Tell me, is my head up a rats ass?"</p>
  <p align="left">That was it, I lost it, i couldnt play for nearly 15 minutes 
    as I howled at his statement. I even called him in Canada from the States, 
    just to laugh at him. Maybe this wouldnt have been so funny if we werent drinking, 
    but it was a great nerve breaker. Drapper Everglade</p>
