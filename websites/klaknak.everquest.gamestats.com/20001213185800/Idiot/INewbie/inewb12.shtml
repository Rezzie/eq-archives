  <p align="center">Ah, the noble magician - by Saelaan, 5th circle Magician, 
    Prexus Server</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I had just started a new high elf magician, after my old one's 
    corpse (and all of his money, weapons, regs and armor) was lost due to having 
    to log out. But that's another story. </p>
  <p align="left">I had just brought my magician up to level 4, and decided to 
    hunt around Crushbone. Being in Gfay, I had no bags or boxes. Those stupid 
    orcs are just too stingy with their bags. Uhh disregard the previous statement. 
    Anyway, the pickings were good, and in no time, I had more loot than I could 
    carry in my inventory. But since I was near the orc lift, I figured I could 
    just run over, activate the lift, go up, drop the extra rusty spear, sell 
    the rest of my loot, and then pick back up the spear and sell it. If only 
    I had known that items dropped on lifts don't stay on. </p>
  <p align="left">I started up, thinking that the spear was right beside me. When 
    I reached the platform, I noticed that the spear was gone! I reactivated the 
    lift, and when I reached the forest floor, the spear was back. Thinking that 
    I just missed the spear, I rereactivated the lift. Once again, the spear was 
    gone. I got off the lift, and someone activated it and it went down. Then 
    I noticed the spear on the forest floor. Thinking someone would take it, I 
    leapt boldly down, and was hit for 65 damage, just short of my hitpoints. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">I was unconcious on the lift, but I figured I would just wait 
    until I regained conciousness and could pick up the spear. Then, I heard the 
    grinding of the lifts gears as it began to rise. Throughout this, I was pressing 
    the direction arrows franticly to get off the lift when I regined conciousness. 
    By the time I regained conciousness, the lift was more than halfway up. once 
    again, I boldy, and accidentally, leapt off the lift. This time, however, 
    it was no mere unconciousness. I received the too familliar LOADING, PLEASE 
    WAIT.. </p>
  <p align="left">To make matters worse, when I got back to the lift, the spear 
    was gone. </p>
