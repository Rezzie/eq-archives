      <p align="left">(NOTE: I do not condone these, I just think them up) </p>
      <p align="left">10. This one requires that you be something like a ranger, 
        with healing and Kick. Offer any insanely weak newbie 1 pp (or whatever) 
        to duel you. More often than not, you will find a willing volunteer. Then 
        lead him away from the guards. Beat the person down, until they have a 
        fraction of red on their life bar. The Kick them. It should only be powerful 
        enough to knock them out, not kill them. Then /shout "Should this person 
        live or die?". No matter what the result, heal them. When they get back 
        up, Kick them unconscious again. Repeat. Eventually, let them off, or 
        Snare them and let them up and taunt them with jibes like "I rule your 
        fate!". Then kill them. But that's maybe too evil.</p>
      <p align="left"> 9. /auction that you are willing to sell a Two-Handed Dagger. 
        Make up good stats. </p>
      <p align="left">8. /shout that you are giving away free rings or something. 
        Make sure you are in a dungeon when doing this. Keep /shouting this, and 
        /shout that you are at a nearby zone point. When a million newbies have 
        gathered, blocking the entrance and infuriating many, log off. Or worse, 
        train a powerful monster there, then log. </p>
      <p align="left">7. /duel a newbie. He'll probably give you a /tell asking 
        what's going on. If you're lucky, this will never have happened to him 
        before. Then, tell him to cancel the duel he just has to type "/duel". 
        No mercy.</p>
      <p align="left"> 6. Pay newbies to shout how stupid they are. They'll probably 
        do it for as little as 3 gp. </p>
      <p align="left">5. Create a mule character. Then, challenge a newbie with 
        at least one or two pieces of leather armor to a duel. Too strong, and 
        they will realize the trick, since it is an old one. Then stand next to 
        a guard.</p>
      <p align="left"> 4. Take offense at some incredibly stupid thing a newbie 
        says. Then threaten to KS him for the rest of his days unless he apologizes 
        or /duels. </p>
      <p align="left">3. Tell those that ask who Tovax Vmar is that he gives 2 
        pp to everyone who hails him and asks "Does the squirrel have the nut?" 
      </p>
      <p align="left">2. This one is pure evil, and should never be done: Get 
        together a group with characters your level. Ask if they want to hunt 
        in <name of
made-up-place>. When they ask where that is, reply it's in <name of closebut large area>. 
        Then take them there, after describing the ideal conditions. Lead them 
        into the deepest and most forsaken wilderness, never stopping, turning 
        a lot. Make sure YOU know where you're going. Then abandon them. Say that 
        you have to med, then log off.</p>
      <p align="left"> 1. Only Innorrukk himself would do this: If you have the 
        spell Levitate or a friend does, cast it on a newbie. Then tell him you 
        will take him to a great place for exp and will level him. Lead him over 
        an ocean. Then tell him to left-click the Levitate icon on his screen. 
        Then leave him to his certain drowning doom. </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">I feel all dirty after writing these. If you do them, a 
        GM will probably bust you for it. </p>
