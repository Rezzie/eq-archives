      <p align="left">[Note: I wrote the following essay while suffering from 
        a severe tequila hangover. As such, I have now included a few embarrasing 
        admissions and caveats. Sigh. Live and learn, man. Just live and learn.] 
      </p>
      <p align="left">For those who don't know, ShowEQ is a program that allows 
        users to see the spawn, experience, and loot (I think) of MOBs in a zone 
        in real time. It also allows you to find out exactly how much experience 
        you get when you group, how much experience you get with a pet, and the 
        exact numeric value of faction hits. </p>
      <p align="left">I have to admit that, even though I am fond of Everquest 
        and do NOT think that Brad is satan, I kinda chuckled deep inside when 
        I heard of this program. To me, I view hacking a lot like I view organized 
        crime: I know it is probably wrong, but secretly I think it is kind of 
        cool. </p>
      <p align="left">However, being the responsible website running person that 
        I am, I would like to respond to a lot of the debates out there concerning 
        this product. The number one caveat I can offer is that I know very little 
        about how these programs actually work, so take any of my technical mumblings 
        with a grain of salt. </p>
      <p align="left">And so, without further ado, the great ShowEQ debate! </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      A. The Generic Hacker Apology 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>From my meagre knowledge on the subject, there seems to be two kinds 
          of hacking: plain ole mischief and hactivism. </p>
        <p>I think many people think that all hackers are just into plain ole 
          mischief. Just as our fathers may have raced souped up cars to the edge 
          of cliffs in order to score points with Mary Rottencrotch, these modern 
          day wahoos, the myth goes, hack into programs and networks just to show 
          they can and to score points with women who have 458 body piercings 
          and a taste for oriental fem punk bands. </p>
        <p>On the other end of the spectrum, you have the hactivists. These are 
          the people who let themselves into Uncle Mao's computer network in order 
          to spread anti-chinese propaganda. Their main purpose, supposedly, is 
          a new kind of civil disobedience.</p>
        <p> I was reading an interesting article on this very subject the other 
          day in Spin magazine. According to some critics of hactivism, the "activism" 
          part is merely a front for what is basically a bunch of people interested 
          only in plain ole mischief. So, for example, a person may hack into 
          McDonald's website and claim, in retrospect, that they were protesting 
          the killing of third world babies to make the chicken mcnuggets, when 
          in reality, McDonald's was the only one they were successful with, and 
          they threw on the activism after the fact. </p>
        <p>Even though I must rely solely on the author of this Spin article as 
          far as the Truth goes, this hactivism critic IMMEDIATELY reminded me 
          of the Generic MMORPG Hacker Apology which I will detail below.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>B.The Generic MMORPG Hacker Apology. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Even though I suppose this is not "hacking" in the pure sense, when 
          people create a website with a list of bugs in a game, they almost always, 
          invariably, say this: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>"It is our intent to discover bugs in EQ/UO in order to help the 
            companies make better games." </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Indeed, this sounds a lot like hactivism. But remembering the Spin 
          article's critique of certain kinds of hactivism, let's examine a few 
          "details" of these websites that seem to undermine their altruism: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>1. Money dupe bugs are found in abundance whereas bugs that dont 
            provide any kind of cheap money or experience are mysteriously left 
            out of the website.</p>
          <p> 2. On many of these sites, you cannot view the bugs unless you are 
            allowed membership into the "secret area". Membership usually requires 
            some sort of fee or contribution in the field of hacking. </p>
          <p>3. Many of these sites actively seek out people who can hack the 
            game code. Again, I am not a technical wizard, but neither am I naive. 
            What, are these people going to hack the code so that they can help 
            EQ/UO make a better game? Hell no. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In other words, to sum things up a bit, people who say "we are doing 
          this to help the game" are full of shit and they know it. As does everyone 
          else. </p>
        <p>However, does this mean that ShowEQ is wrong? </p>
        <p>I don't know. I am decidedly very mixed (although I would never use 
          the product). I think "wrong" here is a very relative question. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>C. ShowEQ is wrong: the arguments. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1. ShowEQ is wrong because it essentially nerfs Druids and Rangers. 
          This is because even the frumpiest low level wizard is now able to find 
          spawn, with the aid of the program. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Someone on one of the boards made a very interesting comment about 
            this. He said that he was glad that it nerfed druids because he felt 
            that druids already had too much power. This, it seems to me, is a 
            "hactivist" type statement. But he also said that it really bothered 
            him that rangers were nerfed. I mean, let's face it, a ranger without 
            ... ranging .. is a seriously nerfed character indeed.</p>
          <p> Ignoring all the moralistic and legalistic arguments, I think this 
            is the strongest argument against ShowEQ. The absolute last thing 
            this game needs is an added advantage to those people who would run 
            around camping the best critters as soon as they spawn. ShowEQ creates, 
            in a way, a kind of dynamic camping system, and ... christ ... we 
            just don't need that (unless ... hmm ... more on this in a moment). 
          </p>
          <p>However, for those who like ShowEQ because it nerfs Druids, I can't 
            honestly say that I am not on your side. It is not that I am a proponent 
            of druid nerfdom (I know very little about it), but I am constantly 
            perplexed about EQ's power balancing decisions (more on this in a 
            moment) and I think a lot of players are sick of feeling that they 
            have absolutely no say when confronted with Verant's Secretive-Hammurabi's-Code-on-Crack 
            mode of making balancing decisions. I realize that, to Verant's credit, 
            they have become much more vocal about game decisions than in the 
            past, but, as politics has taught us, the mere flapping of the lips 
            does not endear one to the unwashed masses. In fact, I think it serves 
            to infuriate our skanky sensibilities even more. </p>
          <p>So I am not sure how I come down on this one, but the dynamic camping 
            aspect and the nerfing of rangers really bugs the hell out of me. 
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>2. ShowEQ is wrong because when players know the exact numeric values 
          of the game, they will powergame even more. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>When I first started EQ, I think I remember this being Verant's standard 
            answer to any number of questions like: "Why can't we know how much 
            mana we have?" or "Why can't we know our exact experience count?" 
            etc.</p>
          <p> In theory, this sounds really nice. It sounds really Lord British 
            vision-esque. </p>
          <p>In reality, this just simply doesn't wash at all. Can anyone out 
            there seriously say with a straight face that knowing these exact 
            numbers will somehow revolutionize the gameplay in EQ? I seriously 
            seriously doubt it. If anything, knowing the exact experience count 
            may serve to spread out the population a little more. </p>
          <p>As EQ stands now, most people tend to camp the same spots from knowledge 
            that has been handed to us by countless websites. What if it was suddenly 
            known that critter X, Y and Z, critters no one has camped, has decent 
            experience without all the camping headache? Well, it may just be 
            that people will start moving away from the traditional spots (like 
            Oasis, for chrissakes) and start ... gack ... hunting in other parts 
            of Norrath. Isn't this the whole point of EQ according to Verant. 
            Sure, they may want people to do this out of a lust for exploration 
            rather than a lust for stats, but here we see a perfect example of 
            how "vision" seems just a little too goddamn pompous for a computer 
            game. </p>
          <p>I do have a slightly more cynical comment to make, however, and I 
            think it is the most interesting question that ShowEQ raises.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> 3. ShowEQ is great because it makes Verant accountable. </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>All other arguments aside, this is absolutely the most seductive 
            aspect of ShowEQ.</p>
          <p> If I can digress for a moment, I am absolutely SICK of spin and 
            doublespeak. I am SICK OF IT! SICK OF IT! I am not talking about just 
            Verant, I am talking about our whole freaking culture. For those of 
            you who think Clinton somehow ushered in an era of lying and subterfuge, 
            you are full of it. America was built on money and money is built 
            on the glorious deification of the product that must be protected 
            with every kind of lie the courts will allow you to tell (or will 
            allow you to tell if you can bankrupt your complainant with tons of 
            motions and hearings). Here is a perfect example of this:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> There is a certain graham cookie product made by a certain big 
              company. On the side of the box, it shows a food pyramid and says 
              something like "by eating graham crackers, you are fulfulling the 
              need to eat all of this bread-like product at the bottom of the 
              pyramid, as mandated and legitimized by the US gov'mint." What the 
              box DOESN'T tell you is that these glorious cookies are loaded with 
              sugar and fat, which the pyramid tells you to eat only very sparingly. 
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Now, Klaknak, you say. This is silly. Sure, ok, maybe it is ... but 
            before you start spouting off some sort of pro-capitalist papal bull, 
            let me tell you this. This cracker company is DECEIVING THE PUBLIC 
            in order to MAKE MONEY. And if you think this stops with crackers, 
            you are full of it. I only have two words for you: tobacco and the 
            Pinto. </p>
          <p>Now, naturally, if Verant is shaping the truth to fit their needs, 
            it is not something I am going to cry about. This is, people, just 
            a game. However, it is also a game that I spend a lot of my time playing. 
            If Verant tells me through some sort of doubletalk that something 
            is a certain way, but it turns out that Verant is basically lying, 
            then I want to freaking know about it so I will stop wasting time 
            dealing with this lie. </p>
          <p>Already, there is a certain rumor floating around in the ShowEQ community 
            that is a perfect example of this. Some say that humans, whose only 
            real advantage is that they level quicker than anyone else, DO NOT 
            ACTUALLY LEVEL QUICKER THAN EVERYONE ELSE. </p>
          <p>If this is true, holy shit. We aren't talking about locations of 
            MOBs here, folks. If you chose a human based on this little bit of 
            info and this little bit of info is wrong, you have a right, whether 
            this is a game or not, to be extremely pissed off ... especially if 
            you have spent several months working on this character. </p>
          <p>There is also a rumor that ... gasp ... having a full group does 
            NOT give you bonus experience. Is this true? I don't know. But if 
            it was true, do you think Verant would admit it without a hacker program 
            breathing down their neck? Hell no. </p>
          <p>[Post-Hangover Note: As a few irate consumers of the Klaknak product 
            have noted, the full group = bonus experience rumor is itself a .. 
            rumor, and an incorrect one at that. I am pretty damn embarrassed. 
            I cant spin that, man. (It was the tequila!)(Shut up, Bill and Al)].</p>
          <p>Again, I will repeat this again ... these are only rumors ... but 
            this is a perfect example of why I cannot totally scorn ShowEQ. I 
            am sick of being lied to by companies of all shapes and sizes and 
            if Verant is lying to me, I want to know it and I want to know it 
            NOW. If they are telling the truth, then that is great. I really do 
            think they run a pretty good ship over there, in spite of all my little 
            problems. But if they are lying, I might seriously consider trashing 
            my characters right now (Diablo 2 anyone?). </p>
          <p>In other words, if ShowEQ delivers some kind of bombshell about how 
            Verant has been lying to us all this time, and people leave in droves 
            as a result, there may be a good result after all: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"With the recent EQ fiasco, companies have now learned to lie to 
              their customers at their own risk."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> Is this a bad thing? Do the ends justify the means? I dont know. 
            Since we are just talking about a game and not some world crisis, 
            I kind of think so. </p>
          <p>[Post Hangover note: Ok, here is the tequila talking. Do I think 
            ShowEQ is going to cause some sort of mass revolt on EQ? Probably 
            not. In fact, my statement here is in direct contradiction to statements 
            I have made in other places that it is the silent majority, and not 
            the outraged minority, that keeps the EQ boat afloat. Still, if there 
            are any major embarrassing things out there, and ShowEQ discovers 
            them, Verant will suffer something of a public relations nightmare 
            ... at least with vocal fools like me who cant even get their *($# 
            facts straight.]</p>
          <p>So there is my little ranticle on this ShowEQ stuff. If you have 
            any intelligent comments, please send them in.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>- CK [Post Hangover Note: Eating Crow]</p>
      <p>[Post Hangover Note: Other people have also argued that ShowEQ is legally 
        wrong. I didn't really bring this aspect up at all because even tho I 
        may no little about *$(# group experience, I know absolutely nothing about 
        the law. Hacker advocates claim ShowEQ is merely a passive sniffer, and 
        therefore legal, but whether they are right or not is way beyond my knowledge 
        on the subject.]</p>
