      <p align="left">Aradune sailed over to Faydwer, <br>
        He was looking for another class to ruin. <br>
        He was feelin' pretty good, <br>
        'Cause he knew he could, <br>
        And he had a plan a brewin' </p>
      <p align="left">When he came across this Wood Elf killing a PoD, <br>
        And killing him quick. <br>
        And Aradune jumped up on the newbie lift and said, <br>
        "Elves like you make me sick!" </p>
      <p align="left">"I guess you already know this, <br>
        But I'm a Ranger too,<br>
        And if you care to take a dare,<br>
        I'll make a bet with you. </p>
      <p align="left">"You got some nice equipment son, <br>
        That much is true, <br>
        "But I'll bet this sword of flame and my bad name<br>
        Against a nerf or two. </p>
      <p align="left">The Elf said, "My name is Bladesongs, <br>
        And it might upset the Great Mother, <br>
        But to your bet I agree, 'cause I'm gonna see <br>
        That you never nerf another. </p>
      <p align="left">Bladesongs you better notch your bow, <br>
        And swing your swords like mad.<br>
        'Cause Aradune in loose in Faydark, <br>
        And he also wants to nerf you bad. <br>
        If you win, to you the Fiery Avenger he will pass,<br>
        But if you loose, Aradune will nerf your class. A</p>
      <p align="left">radune grabbed his hilt and said, <br>
        "I'll make you as useless as the thief!" <br>
        And fire engulfed his sword <br>
        As he pulled it from his sheath </p>
      <p align="left">And he swung the sword through the air <br>
        And it made a wicked hiss. <br>
        Then a bunch of GMs gathered round, <br>
        And it looked something like this: </p>
      <p align="left">[add EQ melee sound effects & music here] </p>
      <p align="left">Aradune slashes YOU for 38 points of damage. <br>
        Aradune says 'Hit By non-melee for 3 damage'<br>
        Aradune tries to kick YOU, but misses! <br>
        Aradune slashes YOU for 70 points of damage.<br>
        Aradune says 'Hit By non-melee for 3 damage' <br>
        Aradune kicks YOU for 6 points of damage' A<br>
        radune tries to slash YOU, but misses! <br>
        Aradune tries to slash YOU, but YOU parry! <br>
        You feel your skin ignite. </p>
      <p align="left">When Aradune had paused, Bladesongs said, <br>
        "Well your sword has a pretty nasty proc." <br>
        But stand right while I cast Snare, <br>
        And let me show you what I got.</p>
      <p align="left"> (chorus)<br>
        Sprit of the Wolf, Run, Blade Run <br>
        Bow kiting Aradune is so much fun! <br>
        Guild mates all around going, "Go Blade, Go!"<br>
        Now it's about time to go toe-to-toe. </p>
      <p align="left">Aradune fell to the ground,<br>
        'Cause he had just been beat. <br>
        And he had to leave that fiery sword <br>
        On the corpse by Bladesongs' feet. </p>
      <p align="left">Bladesongs said, "Aradune, just come on back <br>
        If you ever want to fight on my turf, <br>
        'Cause I'm one Ranger who will duel you anytime<br>
        Just to stop your meaningless nerfs."</p>
      <p align="left"> And the crowd sang: </p>
      <p align="left">Sprit of the Wolf, Run, Blade Run<br>
        Bow kiting Aradune is so much fun! <br>
        Guild mates all around going, "Go Blade, Go!" <br>
