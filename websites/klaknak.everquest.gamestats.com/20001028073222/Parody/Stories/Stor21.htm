  <p><font size="4">Norrathian Holidays - by Cyanna &quot;Wonderfarm&quot; Thunderhammer</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Here are my Norrathian equivalent holidays, sure to amuse and 
    offend.</p>
  <p align="left">Aradune Day - This is a weekly holiday in which Aradune comes 
    out of his <br>
    house on the Plane of Sky and the first race or class he sees is instantly 
    <br>
    nerfed. If he does not see anyone, we will have a week free of nerfings and 
    <br>
    actual bugs and broken quests might actually get fixed.</p>
  <p align="left">Valentines Day - This is a holiday of romance and love. It usually 
    involves <br>
    hordes of hormonally challenged teenagers asking every female character they 
    <br>
    see for cybersex, heedless of the fact that the females in question might 
    <br>
    actually be 300 pounds guys that rarely bathe.</p>
  <p align="left">King Luther Martin Day - This commemorates the founding of Erudin 
    by the <br>
    dark skinned humans. They achieved independence from the stupid, <br>
    uncivilized whites, to found a culture based on equality and learning.</p>
  <p align="left">Fat Tuesday - This is the day before Ash Wednesday when people 
    party like <br>
    they have never done before. People camp, killsteal and powergame for 24 <br>
    straight hours, gorging themselves on food and booze before they have to <br>
    give it up for the next day.</p>
  <p align="left">Ash Wednesday - This is the day people give up the riches of 
    the flesh. <br>
    They eat and drink only summoned food and water, and they give up their <br>
    powergaming ways to **gasp** roleplay!</p>
  <p align="left">Bristlebane Day - This is a day for wearing green and drinking, 
    where people <br>
    crowd the taverns of Kelethin, for the wood elves' famous green beer. Then 
    <br>
    everyone gets stinking drunk and falls off the platforms.</p>
  <p align="left">Passover - This is to commemorate a great even in history. A 
    long time ago, <br>
    Aradune set forth to &quot;balance&quot; the classes of Norrath. People huddled 
    <br>
    together in their homes waiting for his Angel of Nerfing to appear. <br>
    Luckily, a select few players who watched for signs on the test server, <br>
    posted 20 dollar bills on the frame of their door, and the Angel of Nerfing 
    <br>
    passed them by (but it did take the money!)</p>
  <p align="left">Easter - This holiday is in remembrance of when a GM came down 
    from the <br>
    Plane of Sky to visit with the PVP inhabitants of Norrath. Put the poor <br>
    bastard went link dead and the evil, misguided players killed him. He arose 
    <br>
    3 minutes later and banned them all.</p>
  <p align="left">Independence Day - This is a dark elven holiday celebrating 
    their <br>
    independence from the opprevssive goodness of the elven race. They <br>
    celebrate it by strapping high elves to giant kegs of dynamite and then <br>
    lighting it. It is also the only day of the year when the dark elves turn 
    <br>
    off the neon signs of their homeland so as to better watch the &quot;fireworks&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">Veterans Day - This day, everyone celebrates the deeds of powergamers 
    <br>
    everywhere. These veterans of many a camping session may not have social <br>
    lives, but at least they have a holiday named after them.</p>
  <p align="left">Labor Day - This is a day to celebrate the poor misguided fools 
    that <br>
    actually spend time developing trade skills. People all over Norrath forgo 
    <br>
    the usual ridicule to congratulate people who have spent hundreds of hours 
    <br>
    and thousands of plats to do something else in the game besides kill things.</p>
  <p align="left">Halloween - This is a holiday for the darker races of Norrath. 
    Trolls, <br>
    ogres and dark elves go forth with their backpacks asking folks for a &quot;trick 
    <br>
    or treat&quot;. If money and items are not soon forthcoming, they train you 
    to <br>
    death with giants, griffons, and spectres.</p>
  <p align="left">Submuloc Day - This is to commemorate the discovery of the continent 
    of <br>
    Erudin. Hundreds of years ago a human explorer named Submuloc sailed west 
    <br>
    from Qeynos and discovered a new continent inhabited by friendly felines <br>
    called Kerrans. The humans then set about systematically exterminating <br>
    every kerran they found, and chasing them onto a small island off the coast 
    <br>
    were they now reside, surrounded by humans.</p>
  <p align="left">Thanksgiving - This holiday is the time of year when everyone 
    gathers <br>
    together with friends and guildmates and gives thanks for the few spells and 
    <br>
    abilities they have left that have not been nerfed to hell.</p>
  <p align="left">Christmas - This is a time when everyone is overcome with the 
    spirit of <br>
    giving and the plight of the unfortunates. It is a time of great twinking 
    <br>
    for newbies, for many people go to the bank of Freeport handing out plat and 
    <br>
    other goodies to the hordes of newbie beggars that congregate there.</p>
