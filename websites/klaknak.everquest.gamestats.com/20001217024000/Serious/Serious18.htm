  <p>Why Corporate America Annoys Me</p>
  <p>by Jen Kafflensprager</p>
  <p>(middle management)</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I awoke one morning to find myself transformed into a hideous 
    creature. Due to continued success in my workplace and dedication to my company 
    even through some difficult times, I was rewarded with: A Position in Middle 
    Management. When the full reality of this slammed onto my chest like a load 
    of bricks ("OOF!"), I found myself staring in the mirror and saying, "I'm 
    WHAT, again? Wasn't I supposed to be almost done writing the Great American 
    Novel by now?" Eventually the shock wore off. By then, however, I had ample 
    opportunity to realize that while my title did not invest me with Evil Superpowers, 
    it did invest me with something almost as boggling: Employees. I had just 
    been one, hadn't I? In fact, to a certain degree, I still was one. I had a 
    boss, who had a boss, who had a Vice President, who had a CEO. Now, however, 
    I had People... People to fight for, people to evaluate, people who Reported 
    To Me. A brief explanation of our company. My esteemed employer, Company A, 
    was 'acquired' several years ago by Company B. Your Humble Author was hired 
    mere weeks after this merger occurred. Company A was small, but filled with 
    hard-working extraordinarily dedicated completely insane people who worked 
    70 hours a week because they really kinda believed in what they were selling. 
    Novel, no? Company B was pretty big, but wanted to be bigger, and wanted to 
    corner a new market: The one which Company A specialized in. Thus, acquisition. 
    We at Company A waited warily while Company B gradually moved in and began 
    that dark time known as The Integration. Here we were, a "Team" at last.</p>
  <p align="left">My efforts were noticed, and my promotion given. One of the 
    first things they did was send me to A Management Class. "Oh, god, no." This 
    was my reaction. Afterwards, my reaction was "why, god, why?" Company B had 
    big plans for their newest limb, Company A. "Here is what you need to know." 
    "Here is the new organizational chart." "Here are the new procedures." (No, 
    we don't care that the old ones worked already.) "Here is who is in charge 
    of HR now, aren't they lovely troglodytes?"</p>
  <p align="left">Okay, here's the crux: Company A wasn't very "corporate." Company 
    B lived by their DayRunners and their "Seven Habits of Highly Successful People" 
    and their suits and sensible shoes. Company A had the basic dress code of 
    "don't show up naked." Company B was stepping out on a big limb when they 
    adopted "Business Casual" ... for a whole SUMMER! I have seen the best minds 
    of my generation ruined by ... corporate pablum. But a lot of what I want 
    to say is, there are still some Company A types in the world. There are people 
    in Middle Management who know the main focus is the employee, and who fight 
    the Good Fight. My company (the name is new, but we've still got some of the 
    A gumption floating around) has never brought in a motivational speaker. We 
    still reward hard work, knowledge, and dedication. We still fight with Company 
    HQ when they screw our employees over.</p>
  <p align="left">Upon reflection, this isn't much of a repsonse at all, it's 
    more like a reflection on what went before. However, I agree wholeheartedly 
    that bringing in speakers like that kills the spirit of the employees and 
    makes them resentful. Free pen or no.</p>
  <p align="left">--- Obligatory EQ reference: So I'm horribly lost and bound 
    in Highhold. I'm a level 14 shaman. Am I going to just die a lot? Will I ever 
    see the lovely frozen wastelands of my youth? How many doors must I walk into 
    before I learn to duck? Stay tuned! </p>
