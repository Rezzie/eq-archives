      <p align="left">Dear Cackling Klaknak, </p>
      <p align="left">I found your article on the pros and cons of "ShowEQ" to 
        be very well written and well thought out. However, I would like to bring 
        to light a couple of points that I feel you have left out.</p>
      <p align="left"> 1. First off, hackers cannot be divided into merely two 
        groups. Yes, the vandal hackers (the ones who just like to cause mischief) 
        and the hactivists are two very valid types, but there are many, many 
        more. There are computer hackers who specialize in theft of funds, industrial 
        espionage, program code cracking, encryption cracking, registration code 
        theft and cracking, credit card fraud.the list goes on and on. And, truth 
        be told, computer crime, which has been dubbed by popular culture as "hacking," 
        is a very lucrative business. I believe that ShowEQ is a form of electronic 
        theft. This person or persons who has designed this program is after one 
        thing: benefit for himself or herself. </p>
      <p align="left">2. I have to disagree with your closing statement:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> "Is this a bad thing? Do the ends justify the means? I don't know. 
          Since we are just talking about a game and not some world crisis, I 
          kind of think so." </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">The reason for this is plain and simple. Sure, this program, 
        in theory, could keep Verant "honest." But there is one little catch. 
        It is unfair, and I am not speaking of game mechanics (negating rangers 
        and such) The fact that this program has been designed and used has caused 
        Verant , in an effort to be fair to all it's players, to have to change 
        a few things about the game.one of these things being the procedure which 
        the game uses to move a character from one zone to another. Now, this 
        is not a simple thing to change, and it has caused many problems to arise. 
        People have lost characters, had zoning problems, been removed from guilds, 
        and had to petition for corpses to be looted. Now some might say that 
        these things are the fault of Verant for releasing buggy code. I would 
        dispute that fact. I work for a software company, and I can tell you this: 
        when you design and implement a game or program of this size, BUGS ARE 
        INNEVITABLE! Even with the most thorough design and testing, things of 
        this sort happen, especially when a large and often used portion of the 
        game, such as the zoning procedure, has to be changed. Nothing is perfect, 
        as much as some people would like to believe. So, here is the bottom line:</p>
      <p align="left"> What happened? Someone has designed a program (ShowEQ) 
        to reveal secrets about EverQuest that are not meant to be revealed in 
        such a manner. </p>
      <p align="left">Why? To be able to cheat the system, which is only made 
        worse by the weak excuse of keeping the game makers (Verant) honest. </p>
      <p align="left">Result: Verant, in an effort to be fair to it's players, 
        has had to make some major changes in the game to negate this program 
        (ShowEQ) which allows a select few people access to information that makes 
        them very powerful in the game at the expense of players (many of whom 
        still have unresolved problems), the GMs (who are already over-worked 
        and under appreciated, have to work to help the players with problems) 
        and Verant (who now has to pay programmers, GMs, and technical support 
        representatives to work to fix this problem) </p>
      <p align="left">My take: Any time you make a large amount of trouble for 
        a large amount of people purely for personal gain, you are in the wrong. 
        I'm sure that if any anti-Verant wacko read this, his or her comment would 
        probably be something akin to this: "Verant deserves it for making such 
        an unbalanced game!" Well, I have only one thing to say to that. Using 
        ShowEQ as a way to keep Verant honest is taking the law into your own 
        hands, also known as vigilante justice. And last time I checked, vigilante 
        justice was illegal. No man is above the law. We have law systems, and 
        rule systems in place for a reason. I think that Verant has come a long 
        way toward making the game more balanced. Making everyone absolutely equal 
        in a world as large, complex, and containing as many variables as Norrath 
        is a near impossibility, and certainly isn't the type of thing that happens 
        over night. It is a work in progress. Things such as this are detrimental. 
        How is Verant ever going to have time to work on class balancing if they 
        keep having to make huge changes due to a few greedy ingrates? It always 
        happens, a few numbnuts ruin it for everyone.</p>
