  <p>Interview</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Ok, I have been reading a lot of Brill's Content recently and 
    I decided I needed to get Verant's side of the GM story in order to be fair 
    to both sides (and in order to maintain my account). Shortly after I published 
    the Patrick GM Abuse story, Elder Guide Semiramis emailed me and said he was 
    available if I had any questions. So I asked him several questions and we 
    soon decided it would be better to handle this in interview form. So here 
    it is. Enjoy.</p>
  <p align="left">Caveat: This isn't a parody.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left"> <font color="#990000">The Cackling Klaknak: Who are you and what 
  do you do?</font><br>
  <br>
  Semiramis: I am Elder Guide Semiramis, the non-Verant volunteer head of the 
  EverQuest Guide Program.<br>
  <br>
  My main duties are to provide Program wide direction and oversight for the Guide 
  Program as a <br>
  whole. I also work closely with Verant on Guide Program issues and the overall 
  development of <br>
  the Guide Program, and act as a counterpart to the Verant GM-Liaison to facilitate 
  communications <br>
  between the Guide Program and Verant. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: Could you please outline the guide chain of command?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: There are four basic layers within the Guide Program. These are:<br>
  <br>
  Apprentice Guide - Apprentice Guides are new to the Guide Program. During their 
  apprenticeship<br>
  they are trained and observed by the Guides and Seniors on their server. The 
  training period<br>
  typically lasts from two to four weeks after which the person is evaluated and 
  either promoted<br>
  to Guide status or released from the Guide Program depending on how they perform. 
  Apprentice<br>
  Guides do not have access to the commands that are granted to Guides and higher 
  and must work <br>
  under the supervision of a Guide or higher. They are generally limited to answering 
  questions<br>
  and learning how to handle player petitions. <br>
  <br>
  Guide - The Guide or &quot;Full Guide&quot; is mainstay of the Guide Program. 
  A Guide is given access<br>
  to the bulk of the &quot;tools&quot; that are available to the Guide Program 
  volunteers. These tools<br>
  include the ability to perform corpse retrievals and resurrections as well as 
  other common<br>
  tasks the Guides are called upon to do on a day to day basis. The Guides handle 
  immediate<br>
  issues, answer game play questions, and are responsible for the resolution of 
  common problems<br>
  that players encounter. They also mentor and train Apprentice Guides and assist 
  in the <br>
  execution and administration of dynamic quests.<br>
  <br>
  Senior Guide - The Senior Guides are the server level management of the Guide 
  Program. A<br>
  Senior Guide is a proven Guide that has shown good judgement and is willing 
  to invest additional<br>
  time in the Program. Senior Guides handle the more difficult problems that players 
  encounter<br>
  on the server including problems escalated by the Apprentices and Guides on 
  their server. Seniors<br>
  handle investigation of exceptional incidents such as reports of exploitation 
  or harassment. <br>
  The Senior Guides also work as an administrative team for their server providing 
  a communication<br>
  focal point for their server. Many of the Senior Guides also participate as 
  a member of a <br>
  focus group or team within the Guide Program that concentrates on providing 
  a more streamlined<br>
  decision making process on a specific area of concentration within the Program.<br>
  <br>
  Elder Guide - The Elder Guide is the consulting and Program level management 
  of the Guide<br>
  Program. In this role I work to provide direction and oversight at a Program 
  wide level.<br>
  I work directly with the Verant Customer service management and Lead GMs to 
  ensure the <br>
  welfare of the Guide Program as a whole. The Elder Guide is the highest point 
  of escalation<br>
  within the Guide Program. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: What do you think is behind the perception that many 
  GMs abuse the system?</font> <br>
  <br>
  S: Unfortunately, I think that simple misunderstanding of the roles of the Guides 
  and Verant GMs<br>
  can be attributed to this misperception. At times I also think that the players 
  sheer passion<br>
  for the game can lead to an unfounded perception that the GMs are abusing their 
  power.<br>
  <br>
  One of the first things that we have to be aware of is that there are two different 
  <br>
  organizations that are commonly referred to as &quot;GMs&quot;. There is the 
  Guide Program which is a<br>
  large organization made up of volunteers from the EverQuest player base and 
  there is the <br>
  Verant GM organization. Verant GMs are paid employees of Verant Interactive 
  that provide<br>
  customer service. These two organizations work very closely together as one 
  large team to<br>
  provide the customer service within EverQuest.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: How valid is this perception?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: I would have to say that there is very little validity in this claim. Both 
  Verant and <br>
  the Guide Program are very serious when it comes to reports and cases of abuse 
  of power in<br>
  the GM and Guide ranks. If there is any report of abuse against a GM or Guide 
  it is investigated<br>
  thoroughly and if found to be valid, the individual perpetrating the abuse is 
  removed from their <br>
  position.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Will you take any steps to help eliminate 
  this perception?</font></p>
<p align="left">S: Understanding seems to be the key to the whole perception issue. 
  Hopefully through interviews like this one will help clear some of the misunderstandings. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: If a player believes a GM is abusing the system in 
  some way, what is the exact procedure he needs <br>
  to follow to report this abuse?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: In any case where a player believes they have been witness to a GM abusing 
  the system, the <br>
  player should use the /report command to capture any text that may provide evidence 
  of the <br>
  abuse. The /report command sends the last 10 lines displayed on the text window 
  to a file <br>
  on the server, ensuring that this text cannot be tampered with or modified in 
  any way. These<br>
  files can only be accessed by Verant staff so that they can be used as evidence. 
  Screen shots<br>
  can not be used as evidence due to the ease with which they can be forged. <br>
  <br>
  Once the player has captured the text using /report they should then /petiton 
  the support<br>
  staff to make them aware of the situation.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Ok, I am going to be a hard ass. Are 
  you basically saying that if a GM aids a player in any way that is not loggable, 
  there is no way in the world he would ever be caught to the degree needed to 
  confirm the action? </font></p>
<p align="left">S: Actually, it is far from that. There are logs of all transactions 
  between characters. There really aren't any activities that cannot be verified 
  by Verant. <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: What are some of the more common complaints you receive 
  about GMs?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: I would have to say that the most common complaint I see is along the lines 
  of &quot;GM or <br>
  Guide X did not replace my lost items when I died due to Y.&quot; The variations 
  in &quot;Y&quot;<br>
  are absolutely huge!<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: What helps you judge whether or not a petition against 
  an alleged GM abuse is valid?<br>
  </font><br>
  S: There is usually a large amount of investigation involved when a complaint 
  about a<br>
  GM or Guide is received. This investigation includes contacting both the customer 
  and<br>
  the GM or Guide in question and gathering information on both sides of the situation.<br>
  Log files that are maintained by Verant are also used to validate the claims. 
  <br>
  This is a tremendous over-simplification of the process.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Would it be possible for a rogue GM 
  to give an apprentice more powers?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: No, this isn't possible without changing the Guide's designation in the /who 
  all<br>
  listing. If you see a Guide that is listed as an &quot;Apprentice Guide&quot;, 
  that defines<br>
  the limit of their abilities. This is also true of the other levels within the<br>
  Guide Program. </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Have any GMs ever been disciplined?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: Yes, we have had cases of Guides being disciplined and even removed from 
  their positions.<br>
  I will note though that these cases are relatively rare. As far as I know there 
  has never <br>
  been the need to discipline a Verant GM for an abuse of power or authority.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: What is the toughest part of your job?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: Finding time to sleep! &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#660000">CK: But you get a dental plan, right?</font></p>
<p align="left">S: Absolutely! If a Guide ever has a problem with their teeth 
  Verant will send an Ogre Shaman over to take care of it! <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: Do you think I was right to publish the email that 
  started all of this recent hoopla?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: I see no problem at all in your publishing of the e-mail. I leave the responsibility<br>
  of interpretation to the players themselves. I hope that through this interview 
  I can<br>
  give them some information that might help them view future cases such as this 
  in a <br>
  more clear light!<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: Come on, be honest.</font><br>
  <br>
  S: Uhmmm... Okay... You got me! The &quot;angry red bulb hat&quot; frightened 
  me! &lt;grin&gt; </p>
<p align="left">[editor's note: Fans of the site will remember that I bought an 
  angry red bulb hat last week.]</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Hey, man. I was peeved after I bought 
  it. I put it on my head and realized that I had finally lost any real chance 
  of actually dating. But it does intimidate people, so if I can't have love, 
  I will settle for power ... the kind of wrathful power that only simmering unrequited 
  love can ... um, anyway ...</font></p>
<p align="left">S: Wow... that was pretty wild! I like how you got your head to 
  turn completely around! Mind if I get that on video tape? </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: I am double jointed. Do you have any 
  specific comments about the Patrick email that started all of this?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: My simple advice would be to read the e-mail with an open and clear mind.<br>
  <br>
  When I read the e-mail I found that I had several questions, many of which were 
  also<br>
  asked by the readers of your site. One that I have yet to see asked is this... 
  It <br>
  seems to me that there is a segment of this &quot;story&quot; missing. I am 
  not sure what would<br>
  motivate a person &quot;several zones away&quot; to start harassing &quot;Euthanasia&quot;. 
  This was<br>
  never really explained in the e-mail. If I were a person that was determined 
  to <br>
  harass someone, there are precious few zones in Norrath where I would not have 
  a<br>
  large selection of people within the same zone that I was in to choose from. 
  Why<br>
  was this person singled out &quot;several zones away&quot; to be harassed? I 
  would be curious<br>
  to find out what the root of the actual harassment was in this case.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Why was Verant's naming policy recently 
  rewritten?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: As EverQuest evolves and the player base grows we find that some policies 
  need to<br>
  be revised, updated, or even completely rewritten. EverQuest is quite unique 
  in<br>
  that it is a constantly evolving entity. A living world as it were. This fact<br>
  alone will bring about policy changes as we move forward.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: What are some of the major changes or revisions?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: The main changes were put in place in an attempt to make the rules less ambiguous.<br>
  The rules were rewritten to be more clear and concise. <br>
  <br>
  There were also rules added to govern when a name or surname can be changed 
  by a <br>
  customer service representative (Senior Guides or higher) and to give some basic<br>
  rules for surnames. </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Do you basically just ignore bad names 
  until someone petitions them?</font></p>
<p align="left">S: We do not actively hunt down bad names. This is not to say 
  that if a Guide happens to see a person with a name that is in blatant violation 
  of the naming policies and no one has petitioned about that name they won't 
  contact the person and change their name. </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Do you think Euthanasia is an offensive 
  name? Does it violate the common word rule?</font></p>
<p align="left">S: We stumble into a very gray area here. Is "Euthanasia" offensive? 
  That question will be answered differently by different people, as you well 
  know. Personally, I do not find the word offensive. Do my views on the word 
  preclude it from being offensive? That is a resounding no. The diversity of 
  the players in EverQuest is one of its most amazing qualities. This diversity 
  also has to be taken into account when we handle a situation such as this. In 
  a case like "Euthanasia" the Guides would usually discuss this before making 
  a name change. If there was a consensus that the name could be found offensive, 
  the player's name would be changed. </p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#990000">CK: What is your favorite EQ class and 
  race?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: I actually have a couple that I really like. I am a Ranger at heart. My first 
  <br>
  character in EverQuest, back in beta, was a human Ranger. I also like playing<br>
  High-Elf casters. Lately though, as I said earlier, I've been playing a gnome<br>
  Mage who I've become quite fond of! </p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: I like the wee people as well. I wanted 
  to start a guild called Nuggets of Justice, comprised solely of little people, 
  but no one seems interested.</font></p>
<p align="left">S: Surprising! I think that's actually a pretty cool idea! <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: Why did they nerf pottery!!! (the Klaknak starts sobbing)<br>
  </font><br>
  S: It was found that pottery was the craft that was going to take Norrath by 
  storm. <br>
  I hear rumor that Bill Gates was actually talking about investing heavily in 
  <br>
  Norrathian pottery and that... <br>
  <br>
  On a serious note, if there were one word associated with EverQuest that I <br>
  would love to see abolished it would be the word &quot;nerf&quot;. Verant is 
  constantly<br>
  faced with the inexorable fact that you cannot please everyone. I've been playing 
  <br>
  EverQuest since early Phase 1 beta and I can honestly say that I have never 
  seen <br>
  a change in the game that was made to specifically target a class or skill for 
  its <br>
  destruction, contrary to popular belief. The changes they make in the game are 
  <br>
  always made in an effort to improve the overall game play and player experience.<br>
  If a change seems to effect your favorite class in a negative way, you might 
  want<br>
  to broaden your view of the game a bit and see what impact that change has on<br>
  a more global scale.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Hey, man. I couldn't care less if classes 
  are tweaked now and again. Frankly, I have never really understood why players 
  get bent out of shape over balance so much. Hey, a necromancer can kill an Orc 
  quicker than me? So what.</font></p>
<p align="left">S: I try not to reduce EverQuest to a "function". Adventure, explore, 
  and enjoy the world! <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000">CK: Who is sexier. Kirk or Picard?<br>
  </font><br>
  Hmmmm... Tough one here! I consulted my girlfriend on this and she said Picard 
  <br>
  without a doubt. I, personally, think it has to do with the bald head. Why do 
  <br>
  you think I play a gnome when I play? &lt;raises an eyebrow and grins slyly&gt;<br>
  <br>
  I'd have to say that while Kirk always seemed to get the women, Picard is much 
  <br>
  more suave and sophisticated. <br>
  <br>
  Remember when you asked me the hardest part of my job? I think I just found 
  the<br>
  answer... It has got to be questions like this one! &lt;grin&gt;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Are there any other issues you want 
  to address?</font><br>
  <br>
  S: One thing that I see quite a bit of is that the Guides and GMs are rarely 
  seen in a<br>
  good light. When a player petitions a Guide or GM they are usually not happy. 
  In<br>
  the vast majority of the cases, when their petition is resolved, they walk away 
  happy<br>
  with the resolution and nothing is ever heard of the situation. If you take 
  the number <br>
  of petitions handled each and every day by the Guides and GMs and compare that 
  number <br>
  to the complaints you see on the message boards and web sites, you'll find that 
  the <br>
  ratio of positive to negative experiences is very high. Happy players are not 
  vocal<br>
  players. <br>
  <br>
  If you have a positive experience with a Guide or GM, please, voice those experiences<br>
  as well. The volunteers in the Guide Program are there because they like to 
  help<br>
  other players enjoy EverQuest, they do this out of a true passion for the game. 
  Let <br>
  them know when they are doing things right too, it is definitely appreciated! 
  <br>
</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">CK: Who are you voting for? I am stuck between 
  McCain and Bradley. Actually, I was thinking about looking into joining the 
  Republican party, but I received a letter from their national committee today 
  and they referred to Hollywood as "left-wing kooks." So there went that idea. 
  Oops, sorry got off track. Um</font><br>
</p>
<p align="left">S:<ducks and runs for cover> Politics... I don't do politics! 
</p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#990000">CK: Thanks for the interview! As soon as 
  you send me the bribe money, I will send you a case of Ole Virginny Soybread 
  cookies. They are quite tasty. </font><br>
  <br>
  S: You are quite welcome! Thank you!</p>
