  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I sit back and laugh at the idiots who grace your pages, happy 
    in the knowledge that i had never done something similar....well that -was- 
    until this week <mutter-sigh-kicks-things-at-random>.</p>
  <p align="left">Picture this : the sunny shores of Lake Rath. An Aviak guard. 
    A Necromancer and his faithful <but never fed> pet. A battle ensues of course.. 
    The Necromancer is the victor , and that familiar DING resounds. "Welcome 
    to Level 24 !"</p>
  <p align="left">/shout DING !!!!!</p>
  <p align="left">Bob shouts: WTG !</p>
  <p align="left">Lisa shouts: Congrats !</p>
  <p align="left">With a slightly larger ego, the Necromancer sits and scribes 
    his new spells <glad that he had bought
them earlier>. "ooh - what's this? Shock of poison... mm sounds dangerous. Let's 
    try it on the next Aviak"</p>
  <p align="left">*BOOM*</p>
  <p align="left">With a new found toy, the Necromancer has become ... a superhero 
    ! Well not quite, but he feels like a Wizard right now, and when the /tell 
    "Hey come and fight Treants in Sth Karana with me !" Came through, he agreed 
    .</p>
  <p align="left">After a zone and long run, he confronts the giant druid-trees 
    that are loved by all races evil, and they immediately set to work destroying 
    them. "We'll both send in our pets....and then blast the left one til it dies, 
    then the right one , okay?"</p>
  <p align="left">"Okay" replied the Necromancer, just waiting to start blasting. 
    "Hmmm i could to with a shield spells up", he thought .</p>
  <p align="left">"F1 - yeah thats the one, cast spell - ooh it even looks better 
    now " and he was ready.</p>
  <p align="left">GO! shouted the companion...as his pet ran in.</p>
  <p align="left">The Necromancer pressed his /pet attack macro, and then began 
    to whack at the Shock of Poison macro .</p>
  <p align="left">"Hmm my target is dying....but youch, i'm dynig too - no matter, 
    he'll be dead in a sec ! muahahaha !! "</p>
  <p align="left">famous last words..</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING ... PLEASE WAIT.</p>
  <p align="left">"What the..." he replied from the safety of his computer desk. 
    You have entered Lake Rathetear</p>
  <p align="left">/g "What the hell happened ?!"</p>
  <p align="left">Your group tells you : Not sure, but they're both dead...i had 
    to finish them by myself, your pet didn't even run in ! " </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;.... #$%& !!!"</p>
  <p align="left">The Necromancer checked his journal...</p>
  <p align="left">"Your skin blisters as the poison sears your skin..." x 3 /g 
    Heh...you'll never guess what happened.... From here on the Necromancer was 
    put back into his place....and the moral of this story ?</p>
  <p align="left">*shrug*</p>
  <p align="left">Don't hit F1 to target yourself when a spell will automatically 
    do it for you...</p>
