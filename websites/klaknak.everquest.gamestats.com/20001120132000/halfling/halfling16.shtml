      <p align="left">One misty Scottish morn a man was driving through the hills 
        to Inverness. Suddenly out of the mist, a huge red-haired highlander steps 
        into the middle of the road. The man is about six foot seven and built 
        like a fucking tank. He has a huge red beard and despite the gale force 
        wind and freezing temperatures, is wearing only his kilt and his tweed 
        shirt. At the roadside there also stands a young women. She is absolutely 
        beautiful, slim, shapely, fair complexion...heart stopping. </p>
      <p align="left">The car driver's attention is dragged from the girl when 
        the highlander opens his car door and drags him from the seat onto the 
        road. <br>
        "Right you," he shouts, "I want you to masturbate."<br>
        "But..." stammers the driver. <br>
        "Now, or I'll bloody kill you." <br>
        So the driver turns his back on the girl, drops his trousers and starts 
        to masturbate. Thinking of the girl on the roadside, this only takes a 
        few seconds. <br>
        "Right," shouts the highlander "do it again!"<br>
        "But..." says the driver.<br>
        "Now!" he bellows.<br>
        So the driver does it again.<br>
        "Right do it again!" demands the highlander. <br>
        This goes on for nearly two hours. The driver has cramps in both arms,he 
        has rubbed himself raw, and despite the mist and wind, has collapsed in 
        a sweating jibbering heap on the ground, unable to walk. <br>
        "Do it again." says the highlander.<br>
        "I just can't any more, you'll just have to kill me." whimpers the man. 
        <br>
        The highlander looks down at the pathetic heap slumped on the roadside. 
        <br>
        "All right," he says, "now you can give my daughter a lift to Inverness".</p>
