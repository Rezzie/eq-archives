      <p align="left">Thought you might enjoy this, I know I didn't going through 
        it. Not sure it's an idiot file, just more a funny journal (so my friends 
        that didn't have to go through it say).</p>
      <p align="left">Well, this all happened over a 2 month period, but I refer 
        to each time I tried as a day. Several people tried to help me along the 
        way, thanks to all of them.</p>
      <p align="left">Day one: Hear about magnificent quest given by female warrior 
        in Halas. Talk to female warrior in Halas, get told to hunt rats. Continue 
        to bug NPC for 2 hours before going and killing rats.</p>
      <p align="left">Day two: Find out who really gives quest for Langseax. Talk 
        to said person. Said person sends me to Barb village in W Karana. Residents 
        in W Karana give me the finger. One NPC is nice enough to laugh at me 
        and sends me back to Halas. Bring the smack dab down on gnoll commander 
        while passing through BB. NPC in Halas tell me to get sweaty shirt for 
        some mutt back in W Karana to help me track the murderer. NPC says Dok 
        has shirt. Talk to Dok, who tells me to find Tundra Jack, as he sold the 
        shirt to this Jack. </p>
      <p align="left">Day three: Finally find Tundra Jack. Find out that my "a" 
        key is still mapped to attack and that I had not in fact hit the "/" key 
        first. Wave to Halas guards as I jog back to get my corpse. Wander around 
        blind in the dark in Everfrost, find corpse. Find Iceberg but no Jack.</p>
      <p align="left">Day four: Find jack again, remap "a" key, then ask for the 
        shirt. Jack tells me to not quit my day job. Mentions his bear has it 
        and I need to distract the bear with "Lion's Delight". Con Iceberg, smile 
        and walk away. Head to W Karana. Ask everyone and their brother about 
        Lion's delight. Get the finger again. Go back to Halas. Ask an NPC vendor 
        about Lion's delight.</p>
      <p align="left">Day five: At the advice of the vendor, head back to W Karana. 
        No finger this time, they are getting to know me. Talk to vendor, get 
        shipment, take shipment to Halas,get Lion's delight!!!!!! Go to Everfrost, 
        get message that I am out of food. Hmm. Find Iceberg, find out that I 
        ate Lion's delight.</p>
      <p align="left">Day six: Back to W Karana, they have lemonade waiting for 
        me this time. Get shipment and head back to Halas to get the Lion's delight. 
        Head to find Iceberg. Give bear treat, bear gives me a shirt!!!! Take 
        shirt back to W Karana, put smack on gnoll elite guard on the way. Give 
        shirt to Frostbite the dog. Dog pees on my leg, takes off. I follow dog. 
        Dog stops to fight everything and anything. Dog continues, dog stops and 
        barks. Dornin sees Basil!!!!! Basil cons blue, Dornin drools, and attacks. 
        **SERVER HAS STOPPED RESPONDING** Log back on, NPC is gone, but I am still 
        alive - and lost.</p>
      <p align="left">Day seven: Find fishing village, get delivery, head to Halas, 
        get Lion Delight, find Iceberg, get shirt, head back to W Karana (they 
        wave now), give shirt to dog, follow dog, see group of people attacking 
        Basil in the distance, see them kill steal him from me and log off.</p>
      <p align="left">Day eight: do the whole run from one place to another thing, 
        give shirt to dog, follow dog. OMG!!!! It's PAGLAN!!!!! The rare spawn!!! 
        I am gonna get the two hander!!! Cons yellow. /who all t'or. Hmm, only 
        8 people on, all in Cazic, none that could gate or teleport. Hmm, no healers 
        in the zone, weird. What the heck, gotta try, got buffs. Loading, please 
        wait.</p>
      <p align="left">Day nine: get corpse, start over, forget about food, eat 
        Lion's delight, start over. Very frustrated, log off in W Karana in the 
        home of one of the locals.</p>
      <p align="left">Day ten: Give shirt to dog, dog runs off, stops, runs back 
        to pen. Apparently someone was waiting on the NPC to spawn and killed 
        him.</p>
      <p align="left">Day eleven: do everything, see Basil, fight Basil, Povar 
        and login server crashes. Get back on in 3 hours, run from Halas to get 
        corpse.</p>
      <p align="left">Day twelve: kick dog, give dog shirt, dog runs to Basil. 
        Attack Basil, kill Basil, Basil has nothing on him. Petition, Verant laughs, 
        log off, spend rest of day cussing, give up on quest.</p>
