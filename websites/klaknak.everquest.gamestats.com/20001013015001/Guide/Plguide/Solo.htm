  <p align="left">D<a name="Garg"></a>ear Subscriber Garg Guide:</p>
  <p align="left">Me sent message into ether. Me receive tons of mail back. Me 
    eat mail.</p>
  <p align="left">Garg. </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">T<a name="Intro"></a>his guide started when I posted an HTML 
    file of frustration. I, like many people, hate grouping ... not because it 
    is not a good idea ... and not because it can't be fun ... but because too 
    many obstacles have to be overcome before grouping can be fun.</p>
  <p align="left">The obstacles:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Maintaining a steady group of friends.</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left" class="klakstyle"> 
    <p>a. Time zone differences and RL obligations create problems.</p>
    <p>b. Some people or characters level faster than others.</p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center" class="klakstyle"> 
  <p align="left">2. Game mechanics</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left" class="klakstyle"> 
    <p>a. The grouping paradox: If a level 10 group needs another member, and 
      you are level 12, they may (may) not want you because it hampers their experience. 
      If a level 12 group needs another member and you are level 10, you may (may) 
      not want to join because it hampers your experience.</p>
    <p>b. Loot. Alpha loot, equitable currency distribution ... it's all a bit 
      of a pain when you are in a group.</p>
  </div>
  <div align="left" class="klakstyle"></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center" class="klakstyle"> 
  <p align="left">3. People are idiots.</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <div align="left" class="klakstyle"> 
    <p>a. Chances are ... if you find a group that is made up of strangers ... 
      or if you are a stranger in the group ... you will find that most people 
      don't know how to group effectively for shit.</p>
    <p>b. Even effective group combatants are always finding ways to stall gameplay: 
      1) a character runs out of food; 2) a character is selling items as he fights 
      (&quot;hold on, guys ... someone wants to buy this derv ring I am selling&quot;); 
      3) the player has to eat/sleep/pick-up-his-kids/have-sex-with-his-wife etc.; 
      4) link death, etc.</p>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center" class="klakstyle"> 
  <p align="left">Granted, many of these items can be avoided if you are lucky, 
    but odds are that you will not be able to avoid all (or even most) of them 
    unless you are in a very well run guild or you play EQ with your RL friends.</p>
  <p align="left">The solution: Be capable of soloing if you have to.</p>
  <p align="left">But again, I was frustrated. Which classes are the best classes 
    to solo?</p>
  <p align="left">Without a doubt, this is one of the most often asked questions 
    on bulletin boards, and a couple guides have been established in an attempt 
    to clear up the confusion.</p>
  <p align="left">Well, here is another guide. Rather than write the guide myself, 
    I have instead included comments from people (from all over the world) who 
    send email to my Klaknak site.</p>
  <p align="left">All of these are opinions, of course, and many of my emailers 
    disagree fundamentally, so I think this guide may be very useful. Rather than 
    stating the opinion of one person, it states the opinions of several ... enjoy.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">A very important note: When I posted my whine, I made the following 
    conditions: I had to have bind and I would prefer to have pets and SOW if 
    possible. This will explain what some contributors mean by &quot;your criteria.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Another note of some import: These advices were sent in just 
    prior to Verant destroying the Necromancer, Druid and Bard classes, but with 
    the imminent destruction in the air, so do not be surprised if you don't see 
    much comment on these previously praised classes.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><font size="5"><a name="guideo"></a>The Guide</font></p>
  <p><font size="5"><b><font size="4">In General</font></b></font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;ALL classes can be soloed with little problem (yes, I 
    said ALL) if you use your mind. Enchanters can be deadly when used right, 
    wizards are excellent soloers (root, nuke, rinse and repeat), and warriors 
    have so many hit points and special attacks that they rarely need to sit down 
    to rest. Think about it for a second. Now I know what you are thinking, nothing 
    can solo perfectly, but that's exactly correct. Nothing can solo perfectly, 
    BUT everything can be soloed. Soloing is all about tactics, which way to approach 
    your prey, how to get it's attention, how to keep alert of wondering mobs 
    while attacking, etc...&quot; - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I am like you, bind and gate is NEEDED so that boots everything 
    but 7 classes, Mag Enc Nec Wiz Shm Dru and Clr.&quot; - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot; Before I recommend your new race/class, I must say that 
    your webpage is fantastic! I laugh at almost everything! I have told most 
    of personal friends about it, so the word is spreading.&quot; - Quor [Editor's 
    Note: oops, how did that get in there?]</p>
  <p><b><font size="4">Bard</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Bards: Second best groupers in the game (second only to 
    clerics). They have an enhanced version of SoW at level 5, although they get 
    very few of the warrior abilities which makes them at a loss higher up in 
    levels.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Clerics</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I hear a lot of folks whining about clerics being weak 
    at solo. The dwarven cleric that I adventure with when I play my ranger solos 
    pretty damn well and I can't imagine him having trouble finding a group. A 
    cleric in a group with a meleer can take on very tough enemies. Clerics have 
    pretty good DD and awesome buffs and healing and (especially if you choose 
    a dwarf), you are fairly tough in melee...a hell of a lot tougher than a druid-especially 
    if you have the right armor and weaponry.&quot; - Dystan</p>
  <p><font size="4"><b>Druid</b></font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Then I thought "Hrm, a combination of melee and casting, 
    that's a hell of a trick" ... So I, thought, Druids have SoW at 14, and nice 
    spells, and have a reputation of being VERY solo-able. So I tried it, couldn't 
    handle it for 2 reasons: One, being short, I was told to go with halflings 
    and I don't like being short. The other reason is, I don't like their spells, 
    Only being able to use a good half of them out doors, so there are no good 
    in dungeons about.&quot; - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Druids: SoW AND bind!!! While they are going to be nerfed 
    (no doubt in my mind Verant is going to greenlight the DoT-nerf patch), they 
    still remain as one of the top soloers along with Necromancers/Magicians/Shamans.&quot; 
    - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Anyway, if you can give up the &quot;Swords Rule&quot; 
    philosophy your best solo class is a Druid... until around level 31. Druids 
    can solo whites from level 9 to level 27 by just dumping a ton of mana into 
    burn and using the most cast spell in the druid's arsenal... SNARE. You get 
    SOW at 14, along with BIND.&quot; - Holdaran</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;A druid is always nice. They are the super cheese of the 
    game.&quot; - Dave<br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Enchanters</b></font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Now you think. Enchanters are the weakest damaging spells 
    on the game. A paladin could out damage me *LAUGH* but in a split second I 
    could make that same paladin stop attacking, then make him run off, or make 
    him follow me devoting his life to my cause with charm. or hell, i could make 
    him stand in one place and spin in circles.&quot; - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Enchanters literally rule the fight in everyway. They 
    can start a fight with a mean DoT and stop it with mesmorize. they can make 
    a npc follow you with charm, or run like hell with fear/chase the moon spells. 
    They can make magic jewelry (Only trade skill that anyone gives a shit about 
    but most expencive and hardest to raise skill in) and summon a decently nice 
    pet. But they can't teleport, and they can't cast hard DD spells. And these 
    are what I like too.&quot; - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;"I hate when i sit there bored, just sitting around, without 
    a group, just being bored.&quot; And wizards sure get boring just sitting 
    there meditating their entire thing after EVERY fight. Enchanters get them 
    sweet illusions! At level 4 as my dark elven enchanter I can enter Every big 
    town on the game and not be KoS (by town I mean starting points for players 
    and like high pass and such) I get invis at level 4 which makes travelling 
    much safer, wizards don't get till level 16. So I went with an enchanter. 
    I've already felt the hard to solo of it, but also easy to solo. Their pets 
    seem extremely hard hitting for their low level. And their pets hit magic 
    at level 8, which is nice for wisp hunting. Besides that, picture a high level 
    group, 3 warriors, 2 clerics. If they get a choice between a wizard or enchanter, 
    most often gonna choose enchanter. I can make a warrior speed up attacks, 
    hit more often, and just be a stronger warrrior. I can make a npc slow down 
    almost to the point they fall asleep (I get that spell too) or if we losing, 
    i can mesmorize it so it stops fighting and everyone walks off happy.&quot; 
    - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Enchanters: Only the smartest know how to solo an enchanter 
    and survive as well as a magician (?!). Try this class out, you might like 
    it. It's all about tactics.&quot; - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;If u want to be able to solo or group whenever you want 
    perhaps you should consider an Enchanter. I like to solo and I do pretty well, 
    each rank of spells provides you with a new Pet which is cool to have. Keep 
    in mind that as you near the next rank the crits that con blue will still 
    beat the crap outta your pet so you have to be part tank <g>. I have a 30th 
    lvl warrior, 15th lvl wizard, 6th lvl druid among other lower level stuff. 
    The Enchanter I play now(16th lvl) is by far the most fun.&quot; - Zealott</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I suggest instead the trickiest class around. The Enchanter. 
    Can they solo? Oh yes! But only if you're really on top of things. It's hard, 
    it's risky, and it's sometimes downright stupid. Thus, I thought you'd really 
    appreciate it. They have pets. Stupid, weak, lovable pets that can't be commanded. 
    You'll find yourself shouting "No, Jobobobobtik! Not the griffene!" And you 
    will secretly find this very amusing as you run like hell. (Personal note: 
    You will feel some small measure of pride zoning back, to find that the griffene 
    has taken 1/4 damage from your homicidal, stupid, dead pet...) They have no 
    real damage causing capability other than their stupid pet. You'll thrill 
    as monsters resist ALL of your spells at the same rate as Root. (35%, baby!) 
    "But Az," you're possibly thinking, "this sounds like it really sucks." Never 
    fear! Enchanters make up for it all with the ability to truly screw with the 
    world. We have illusions. Go anywhere, do any quest. (I secretly want Soulfire, 
    just to spite people.) We can Charm. This is the most powerful spell in the 
    game. (Bite me, Ice Comet.) After you've done this, you'll never look at an 
    enchanter the same way. They can debuff like mad. Chuckle as your stupid pet 
    tears into things that are unaccustomed to being slow, weak, and clumsy. Best 
    buffs of an INT caster, by far. We can make things just sit there, and drool 
    as your party slices up their friends. (A personal favorite.) I have personal 
    accounts of people that have soloed their enchanters well into the upper twenties. 
    I've soloed to 17.5, and I'm going strong. Plus, smart groups love enchanters, 
    because they make the combats so much easier, with mez, charm, speed buffs, 
    and debuffs. Here's the best part. We have already been nerfed. Brutally. 
    But we're still pretty good, and, gods willing, we'll stay pretty good for 
    a while. Sounds like the best thing you can hope for, really.&quot; Azraphael</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;An enchanter is a great solo uptill 16th. You get a pet 
    right off the bat. 1-4 Is hell. At 4th you'll get a new spell. You'll basicly 
    cast it on a bat the bat will run at you then your pet will smack it and it 
    dies. At 8th you get root So you'll basicly root in nuke.&quot; - Dave</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Joe</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Joe's collection of pornography is a plus, but you really 
    have to ask yourself ... how does this help one fight Emporer Crushbone?&quot; 
    - Frank</p>
  <div align="center" class="klakstyle">
    <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Magician</font></b></p>
  </div>
  <p align="left">&quot;I could piddle him around at low levels, collect equipment, 
    and not group much, just solo. In this case Magician is your key (I kicked 
    necro out cause of DoT's and I don't wanna be evil) But a magician is the 
    WEAKEST of any caster at high level. Pets are DEADLY in a dungeon, as in deadly 
    to you, they lose you around corners then they find a quicker route to you 
    (which is almost NEVER safe) and train a good 40 mean pissed npc's on you. 
    So I kicked magician outta my list.&quot; - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Magician: The second best soloer (and with the new necro 
    patches to come, the ultimate soloer) in the game, magician combines a good 
    deal of wizard burn with an enhanced version of the necromancer's pet. No 
    SoW or root, but bind is what you'll be aiming for.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Monks</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Monks: Hands down one of the best melee fighters in the 
    game, with the special ability of Mend as well. Good for soloing, but doesnt 
    have bind nor SoW.&quot; - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Monks are still the best melee class in the game solo. 
    Not as good for grouping than Warriors or Rogues, because of Taunt, Bash and 
    Backstab. Bind Wounds and Mend will bring you up to 75% health within a minute 
    of finishing a tough fight, which makes them much better soloers than Warriors 
    with a 100 skill BW cap and no Mend and much more hitpoints to heal. Pros: 
    a. Level fairly quickly Good, b. fun guild quests (even if the items you get 
    are crap) c. Good Melee damage d. Little down time e. No spells to buy f. 
    No Weapons to buy g. Minor armor requirements h. Feign Death, best skill in 
    the game. Cons: a. No self-bind b. No SoW (until you get Jboots) c. Blind 
    at night. Having little item requirements means cant be twinked very well 
    (actually, I consider this a Pro, as it keep the powergamers away from the 
    class) I have successfully Solo'd my Monk all the way up to level 28, and 
    see no barrier to continuing this up into the 40s.&quot; - Zadkiel</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Necromancers</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;h: Necromancers: I hate necromancers, so I wont go there.&quot; 
    - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Paladins</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Paladins: Like in many great RPGs, Paladins are one of 
    the most unbalanced (though very subtle) classes (though many would argue 
    otherwise) because it combines the best abilities of a warrior with the great 
    healing of a cleric (with great swords too!). Try this class, you wont be 
    disappointed.&quot; - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Rangers</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;i play a ranger and believe it or not, you CAN solo, however, 
    it isn't always easy. If you are a ranger soloing, the easiest way to kill 
    stuff you would normally kill in a group is to snare, run backwards and shoot 
    arrows until you get the monster to a point where you can take it down with 
    melee. However, there still are downsides. For one, if you are poor, arrows 
    cost money, and bows cost even more. Healing for a ranger takes FOREVER if 
    you haven't noticed. At level 32 it takes about 3 minutes and 30 secs for 
    me to med to full mana.. and that much won't heal half my HP (well, maybe 
    it will, hehe). Although 3.5 mins doesn't seem long, trust me, unless you 
    have something to do (eat, showever, go to the bathroom, etc.) it's pretty 
    annoying.&quot; - Lord Ravana</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Shadowknights</b></font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Shadowknights: Not a bad class. Harm Touch, Warrior melee, 
    and pets. Evil is good.&quot; - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Shaman</b></font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Go with a shaman, it fits all of your criteria nicely. 
    Not only are shaman great soloers if need be, but they are also much sought 
    after group members. They are the masters of buffing, great at healing, they 
    can bind, have SoW, get nice pets later on, and can melee decently since you 
    will be one of the large races with great strength. They can summon food/drink 
    and a pouch that makes items weightless, for those trips far away from home. 
    Personally, I would go with a troll... not only are they the coolest looking 
    race (and most fun to roleplay), but the HP regen advantages actually helps 
    with mana regen later on thanks to a little spell called cannibalize (trade 
    hp for mana), stick a chloroplast on your self and watch your hp's/mana go 
    flying up. I've rambled too long... go create a Troll Shaman!&quot; - Hayden</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;So we move on to shamans. After playing them i realized 
    they wern't nearly as good at melee as them short ass halflings, the barbarians 
    cant see at dark. Trolls and Ogres don't have night vision, and their wisdom 
    is incredibly Low.&quot; - Skyler</p>
  <p align="left">&quot; Anyway, I have an ogre shaman on Povar. Why ogre? Because 
    of the role-playing and large size. It is so easy to role-play an ogre or 
    troll. The massive size of an ogre demands respect instantly! An ogre posses 
    the most strength than any other race, equal intelligence of barbarian, and 
    better intelligence than the trolls. Throw the extra stats into wisdom and 
    agility. Remember, all stats can be buffed accept for wisdom and intelligence. 
    Why shaman? Shamans are great solo artists. This aspect descends slowly in 
    the later levels and you become more of a healer and buffer. They have SoW, 
    fantastic buffs, Dots, DD, and pets at level 34. So you are Evil, big deal! 
    You get to kill a hell of alot of things that cause bad faction ratings that 
    don't make a bit of difference to you anyway. Ogres are the best shamans stat 
    wise, shamans have got to be in the top three most popular classes, so why 
    not be one of the most powerful race/class combinations in the game? I have 
    had a great time with Quor [------], level 30 ogre shaman, [----] server. 
    I highly recommend this to you!&quot; - Quor</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Shamans: SoW at level 9!!! Need I say more? The only problem 
    is that you are rescricted to only 3 races, two of which are evil.&quot; - 
    Kekvit</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Warriors</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Warriors: great melee fighters with massive hit points. 
    Unfortunately that's a loss since you'll have no such thing as a hit point 
    meditation (Verant, you idiots!).&quot; - Kekvit</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Wizard</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;But a wizard has GREAT damage spells, and they get solo 
    teleports at level 20 and I hate riding from Antonica to faydwer, that just 
    really pisses me off. Sitting in one place staring at the poorly animated 
    wooden plank deck of the stormbreaker, not my cup of tea if you know what 
    I mean.&quot; - Skyler</p>
