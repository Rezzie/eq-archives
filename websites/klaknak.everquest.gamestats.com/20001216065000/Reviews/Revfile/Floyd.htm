<p align="center"><font size="4">Floyd</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left">I grew up in South Georgia (NOT Hotlanta). I spent summers at 
  my grandmothers house in south Florida. I have been through more hurricanes 
  than I can count. I was even camping during one while in Virginia. And in my 
  first month of college, Hugo wiped out my dorm as my drunken friends and I did 
  Tai Chi on the tennis courts.</p>
<p align="left">A couple weeks ago, Dennis parked over my house for about a week 
  (it seemed) and dumped tons of water on us. </p>
<p align="left">And now, Floyd.</p>
<p align="left">But the question is ... Can Floyd keep me from playing Everquest? 
  Well, let's see.</p>
<p align="left">1. Toilet paper run. I have said it once and I will say it again: 
  people are idiots. Whenever the Weather Channel (AKA YuppieVision) says it is 
  going to rain or snow, people run to the nearby Food Lion and loot it. I swear 
  this is true: There have been times that I did not know a bad weather system 
  was coming through until I went to the grocery store and couldn't find any milk, 
  bread, or toilet paper. Here is an actual (not really) conversation I had with 
  someone last winter right before we got hit with a powerful blizzard (which 
  resulted in one inch of snow).</p>
<p align="left">Me: I see you have 10 gallons of milk there. And 20 loaves of 
  bread. And 500 rolls of toilet paper. Are you with a militia? Can I join? I 
  love Jesus and guns.</p>
<p align="left">Them: A blizzard is coming!</p>
<p align="left">Me: Ah. I see. Um. Has it occurred to you that those 10 gallons 
  of milk will spoil before you are able to drink them all?</p>
<p align="left">Them: What? A blizzard is coming! Lloyd, we need cheese! Buy more 
  cheese! Lloyd!</p>
<p align="left">Me: Um. Why all the toilet paper? Are you lactose intolerant?</p>
<p align="left">Them: I live in the county! A blizzard is coming!</p>
<p align="left">Me: But why all the milk? I am just not getting this milk thing.</p>
<p align="left">Them: Um. I need it for ... for ...</p>
<p align="left">Me: I guess my question is ... if you have 10 gallons of milk, 
  won't you need 20 or so boxes of cereal?</p>
<p align="left">Them: What? But ... but I don't eat cereal! (Them begins to panic).</p>
<p align="left">Me: So why do you have all the milk?</p>
<p align="left">Them: Because a storm is coming! I live out in the country. I 
  need milk! Toilet paper! Cheese!</p>
<p align="left">Me: But why?</p>
<p align="left">etc.</p>
<p align="left">SO, sigh. I am out of beer which means I am going to have to stand 
  in line behind a hundred idiots with 1000s of rolls of toilet paper and 1000s 
  of gallons of milk. That will keep me from Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">2. Slackers at work. You know, I don't really like working, but 
  here is my take: I get paid to work. Wha? I know, this is a revolutionary concept, 
  but the idea is simple. I work and because I work, the company gives me money. 
  Now, many people don't suscribe to this view. They are constantly looking for 
  ways to get out of work, not caring that because they are not working, other 
  people who work just as hard as they do will have to suffer.</p>
<p align="left">Whenever there is a big storm or snow or whatever, people who 
  drive drunk, drive in blizzards to go skiing, walk through hurricanes to get 
  some smokes, suddenly, surprisingly start whimpering that they can't go to work. 
  The excuses are simple:</p>
<p align="left">a. My car has real wheel drive. I can't go to work.</p>
<p align="left">b. My house plants are stressed by the storm. I can't work.</p>
<p align="left">c. Or, I am scared of the storm (actual quote). I can't work.</p>
<p align="left">SO, as Floyd draws near, I expect the phone to start ringing off 
  the hook: &quot;Klaknak, can you come in and work? Joe Schmoe called in and 
  said he had to drain water from his bathtub because of the storm.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">THIS may keep me from Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">3. Power.</p>
<p align="left">When a hurricane comes, you can pretty much expect the power to 
  go out. There is really nothing funny here to say except ...</p>
<p align="left">Why does the power go out when it is sunny? This is the real reason 
  why I get pissed off when power goes off during a bad storm. If power ONLY went 
  out during bad storms, I would blame nature. But the fact that the slightest 
  bit of rain or solar radiation or squirrel stupidity suddenly blankets the city 
  in darkness makes me wonder where all my HUGE power bill monies are going. </p>
<p align="left">Well, the quick answer to that is: stock holder dividends. But 
  I digress.</p>
<p align="left">Power outages will keep me from playing Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">4. Television. You simply MUST watch local and national news programs 
  during hurricanes. In case you don't have enough time to spend hours watching 
  news in order to see the rampant idiocy that is endemic to the medium, just 
  turn on the tube during a hurricane for a concentration of idiocy and sap.</p>
<p align="left">a. The Courageous Reporter: It used to be that dynamic journalism 
  involved sending Joe Schleimel to cover a revolution in South America. Now, 
  as Ivy League nancy boys grace our airwaves, we have to wait for hurricanes 
  for them to step into danger's way. Basically, the reporter will go out in 50 
  (ooooo) mph wind and start shouting in the microphone, mainly talking about 
  himself:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Here I am Joe Schleimel and man is it windy. Whoa! Oh boy, 
  wow, as you can see it is blowing me this way and that. Wow. And it is wet. 
  Woooo. Very windy! Woooo. Wow, I can't believe I am out here. Whoa. Wooo.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">to which the anchor responds (with mock concern):</p>
<p align="left">&quot;You be careful, Joe. We are pulling for you here.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Hey, here's a news update: Hurricanes are windy. Send Joe home. 
  I think there is a High School basketball game tonight where he can go and possibly 
  get hit by a wayward jump shot.</p>
<p align="left">b. The Weather Man: A hurricane is a weather man's wet dream, 
  but there is really nothing ever for him to say except: &quot;A storm is coming.&quot; 
  Here the cheese really starts dripping out as the weather man struggles to keep 
  concern on his face for 12 straight hours. It is laughable, really.</p>
<p align="left">c. Human interest stories. Oh, these are priceless, both before 
  and after the storm. Now, my family has experienced some widespread damages 
  due to storms, so I do not mean to belittle the tragedy because ... well, because 
  that is for the media to do. Again, the sap comes streaming out as tough reporters 
  ask these searing questions:</p>
<p align="left">Reporter: Did you just lose your home?</p>
<p align="left">Man: Yes.</p>
<p align="left">Reporter. How sad. Back to you, Monica.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Oh, and let's not forget the children</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Reporter: Are you a child?</p>
<p align="left">Child: Yes (hugs a cute doll).</p>
<p align="left">Reporter: How sad. Back to you, Bernie.</p>
<p align="left">Bernie: How sad. (mock concern)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">So, anyway, when a hurricane comes, I MUST watch the lunacy on 
  the tube. This too will keep me from playing Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">5. My ass will be blown all the way to Oz. That will keep me from 
  playing Everquest. Nuff said.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Anyway, I believe Floyd must get the highest rating for creating 
  the greatest possibility of me not being able to play Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">Peace out.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
