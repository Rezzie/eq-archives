  <p><font size="4">Chapter One - The Half Eaten Sandwich</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I hate nature and everything in it.</p>
  <p align="left">I didn't realize this until I woke up one morning not as a Temporary 
    Resource Technician at the state university psychology department but as a 
    wood elf ranger in the city of Kelethin, land of Norrath.</p>
  <p align="left">But I am getting ahead of myself.</p>
  <p align="left">My name is Ralph Nike (no relation). I am single and live in 
    Plankton Triangle, Virginia, a suburb of Newport News.</p>
  <p align="left">A couple nights before the day after, my friend Jim and I were 
    surfing through the channels on our apartment television when we noticed that 
    the cable man had accidentally added HBO to our basic cable package. And as 
    if this boon was not enough, that very night HBO was showing a Tales of the 
    Crypt marathon from 6PM to 6AM the next morning.</p>
  <p align="left">Needless to say, we were thrilled. </p>
  <p align="left">Unfortunately, since both of us were broke, we didn't have any 
    drugs.</p>
  <p align="left">A couple weeks earlier, Jim tried to score some by going to 
    the local psychiatrist complaining of &quot;global night vision,&quot; but 
    all they gave him was a box of Zoloft samples. So, caught between taking laxatives 
    and popping Zoloft, we decided to take Zoloft as the marathon began.</p>
  <p align="center">***</p>
  <p align="left">During an episode where a man has feline hormones injected into 
    his brain, Jim started getting a little ... moody.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Get off my cloud, man!&quot; he shouted at the television. 
    &quot;Get off my cloud! Your hormones don't fool me.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Dude, shut up,&quot; I said, wiping raspberry fun syrup 
    from my leutinator.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;This ... man ... he is on my cloud, man, and I want him 
    off!&quot; Jim shouted again.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;He's not on your cloud, Jim. Sit down.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Hey, I didn't major in chemical anthropology for nothing,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;His feline hormones don't scare me.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Jim ...&quot; I said, trying to pull his ass down.</p>
  <p align="left">He would have nothing of it. He dove for the television but 
    missed, gashing his head on the entertainment center. Jim screamed, scaring 
    away the Lenin leprachauns.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I have to plug the blood!&quot; he screamed and ran into 
    bathroom.</p>
  <p align="left">Disentangling myself from the couch, I followed Jim into the 
    bathroom where he was stuffing all of our porn into the toilet, clogging it 
    up nicely. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I have to plug the blood!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Before 
    the feline hormones escape!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Dude, man,&quot; I said. &quot;You're wasting good porn 
    ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">But he would have nothing of it ... and the fun syrup found 
    me again. I passed out.</p>
  <p align="center">***</p>
  <p align="left">The next day, I woke up to the sound of plunging. Bleary eyed, 
    I stumbled into the bathroom where Jim was vigorously trying to plunge several 
    months worth of porn out of our toilet.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;It's hopeless,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What got into you last night?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;I had to clear my head 
    a bit.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I tried to nod, but my chin hit my chest and I was unable to 
    lift it. In the corner of my eye, a shiny object caught my attention.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What's that?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh, that!&quot; Jim said, leaping to his feet. &quot;I 
    think it is the key to my car's trunk!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No way,&quot; I said. &quot;You lost that 3 years ago. 
    I think there is some beer in your trunk!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I know, I know,&quot; said Jim. &quot;Let's go see if 
    it's still there.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I tried to nod again, but my chin was still stuck to my chest. 
    Jim popped me on the forehead, moving my head back.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Let's go,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="center">***</p>
  <p align="left">A few hours later, we were sitting in the front of the television 
    drinking a case of three year old Milwaukee Best and smoking some pot we had 
    scrounged up from the carpet of the trunk.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Are you sure that carpet is safe,&quot; I said, trying 
    to talk, spit out carpet, and hold my shit in at the same time.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;&lt;schuh schuh&gt;,&quot; coughed Jim, trying to keep 
    his shit in too.</p>
  <p align="center">***</p>
  <p align="left">When I woke up again, it was the middle of the night. An advertisement 
    for Nick at Nite screamed from the television set and my stomach was wracked 
    with a severe case of the munchies.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Jim,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">No response.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Jim.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">No response.</p>
  <p align="left">I grimaced as I stood and walked into the kitchen. I opened 
    up the cupboard:</p>
  <p align="center">1. minute rice.</p>
  <p align="center">2. lettuce.</p>
  <p align="center">3. bread</p>
  <p align="center">4. A packet of soy sauce</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ah,&quot; I thought. &quot;That would make an excellent 
    rice and salad sandwich.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Drooling with hunger, I began putting the sandwich together. 
    If I had only turned on the light, I would have realized that it is not good 
    to keep lettuce in the pantry. But I didn't and I hadn't. I passed out again.</p>
  <p align="center">***</p>
  <p align="left">When I woke up, I was standing in a courtyard. A garish sign 
    greeted me:</p>
  <p align="center">Welcome to Kelethin: City of Elves</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;Elves,&quot; I thought. &quot;I told Jim we shouldn't 
    smoke that car carpet.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I lifted the rice and salad sandwich to my lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Welcome to Everquest,&quot; it said.</p>
  <p align="left">It was going to be a long day.</p>
