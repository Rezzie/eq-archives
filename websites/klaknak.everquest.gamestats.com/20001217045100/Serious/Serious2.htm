  <p><font size="4">Kiting and Proposed Changes - by the Cackling Klaknak</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">My opinion about kiting is lukewarm at best.</p>
  <p align="left">The first time I saw kiting, I did not know what it was. I saw 
    this bard fellow running around in Northern Ro with an Orc or something hot 
    on his tail. Being the noble cleric I was, I chased after the orc and began 
    frying it with spells. Eventually, I killed the orc and went to check on the 
    fleeing bard.</p>
  <p align="left">Imagine my surprise when he called me an &quot;afjklsf.&quot; 
    Or maybe it was &quot;Ifjkd,&quot; I am not sure. After a few perplexed minutes, 
    it finally occurred to me: Oh, so this is what kiting looks like.</p>
  <p align="left">The bard then asked me if I was against kiting, and without 
    even thinking I said, &quot;Nah. Not really.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">After thinking about it some more, I still don't think I am 
    against kiting.</p>
  <p align="left">Why am I not against kiting? Well, basically I just don't give 
    a damn if someone wants to run around for several minutes in order to get 
    a kill. I think they look completely silly and, although I have never done 
    it, I am not sure I understand where skill comes into play, but if they want 
    to do it, I say let them. It's not harming me or anyone else, that I can see.</p>
  <p align="left">Two key objections seem to come up over the whole kiting thing:</p>
  <p align="left">1. From the purists, you get the (legitimate) argument that 
    kiting is a gaming loophole ... a phenomena not intended by the developers 
    and therefore wrong.</p>
  <p align="left">2. From certain powergamers, you get the (maybe legitimate) 
    argument that kiting creates class imbalance. It is not fair ... blah blah 
    blah ... that ... blah blah blah ... can do ... blah blah blah ... but my 
    character can't.</p>
  <p align="left">These arguments are strong, but I come from a different point 
    of view:</p>
  <p align="left">Perfect game balance is impossible. A few classes will always 
    be able to solo better than others.</p>
  <p align="left">Therefore, my response is a big fat &quot;SO WHAT.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I play a cleric, arguably one of the worst soloists in the game, 
    and I love (almost) every minute of it. I simply don't give a rat's ass if 
    DoT's give other classes advantages over me. I wonder if it is only the powergamers 
    (and I believe Brad is one) who are really concerned about this.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course, just because perfect game balance is impossible doesn't 
    mean certain glaring problems should be ignored, but I think (again) that 
    kiting is a big fat &quot;so what.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I do have to end, however, with a stab in the back for all you 
    kiters out there. Any player with even the tiniest slice of intuition HAD 
    to know that Verant would eventually do something about this. I think most 
    people have played EQ, UO, and other ORPGs long enough to realize that if 
    something is too easy, it is going to eventually be nuked. So, don't come 
    crying on my shoulder if you have built up a 30+ level character on kiting 
    and now you don't know what to do.</p>
  <p align="left">My advice: Play a cleric. Our skills are so anti-levelling, 
    we won't be nerfed ... ever.</p>
