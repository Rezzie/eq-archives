      <p align="left">EQ Toys </p>
      <p align="left">I got a scoop on the new EQ toys that are being produced. 
        So without further ado, here it is a list of the action figures under 
        development. </p>
      <p align="left">There will be one line of toys featuring each of the classes 
        of EQ. Consumers will pay a one time fee to purchase the figure but must 
        pay Verant a monthly fee if they want to play with them. The initial figures 
        come with lots of cool accessories like magic items and spells but each 
        week, a Verant employee will come to your house and take back one of the 
        accessories, until each figure is left with nothing. These limited edition 
        collectables called “The Balanced” can be resold to the toy manufacturer 
        for a fraction of the purchased price. This is good for the economy. </p>
      <p align="left">They are also creating a line of toy accessories but the 
        manufacturer is only creating one of each item per month, and each item 
        will go to only one designated store. The packages give the messages, 
        “Can’t get enough of camping in Everquest? Experience the thrill of camping 
        those special items in Real Life!” and “Watch out for Kill-Stealers!” 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Special limited edition figures include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Cackling Klaknak – Pull the string and hear the famous phrase, 
          “BWAHAHAHA”. Comes with a jumbo bottle of ether.</li>
        <li> Aradune - Comes with all of the accessories of the class figures 
          and includes a special feature, where if you squeeze him, he expels 
          a blast of hot air. </li>
        <li>Abashi – Includes ‘All customers are whiners’ t-shirt and special 
          ‘exploding head’ effect. </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">They are also creating a line of EQ player toys featuring 
        some of the popular players of EQ. They are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Hacker – Sold separately is an accessory pack including duplicates 
          of all of the Hackers items plus lots of plat. </li>
        <li>The Powergamer – Comes with a free calculator, stat sheet and a years 
          supply of No-Doze.</li>
        <li> The Roleplayer – Comes with a special voice chip that decodes speech 
          to include lots of ‘thee’s and ‘thou’s. </li>
        <li>The Kewl D00D – Pull the string and hear such famous phrases as ‘U 
          SuX N3wB1e’ and ‘Give me ph@t l3wt B4 I PK U’. </li>
        <li>The Newbie – Some assembly required, and instructions in Swahili. 
        </li>
        <li>The Nerd – Comes with a free personality and social life. </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">They are also coming out with some plush stuffed animals 
        for the younger kids. Featured are gnoll pups, orc pawns, kobold runts, 
        and goblin whelps. </p>
