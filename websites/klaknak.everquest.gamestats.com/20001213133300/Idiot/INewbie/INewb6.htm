  <p>Get up, you! - by Cyanna</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> First I just want to say I love your sight and read it every 
    day. I just sit at my desk at work hitting the refresh button waiting for 
    an update. Anyway, enough flattery.</p>
  <p align="left">Here are my 2 best idiot file submissions. When I was but a 
    young newbie hunting in the Qeynos Hills I grouped with a 2 other fellow newbies. 
    We fumbled around killing bats and rats when we were beset upon by a rabid 
    wolf. My groupmates and I fought valiantly but I was diseased and then knocked 
    unconscious. Before I bled to death or was killed, my friends killed the wolf. 
    Seeing me lying there, they assumed I was dead. However, I was just unconscious 
    but because of the disease, my hit points did not regen. I was left lying 
    on the ground looking at my body unable to respond to my groupmates. They 
    kept asking where I was bound and how long until I got back but I could not 
    answer. If you have ever been diseased you know how long it lasts. Eventually 
    they got tired of waiting for me to respond so they wandered off leaving me 
    there to just stare impotently at my body. After about 20 minutes the disease 
    wore off and I was finally able to regen to the point of consciousness. I 
    swore I would never fight a diseased monster again.</p>
  <p align="left">Which leads into my next story. Many levels later I was hunting 
    in the East Commons. I was fighting an asp in the southern part of the zone 
    when I was poisoned. No big deal I thought, I still have over half my hit 
    points. Famous last words as one of the ghouls from the ruins came and attacked 
    me. I killed it but it diseased me and knocked me to less than 2 bars of health. 
    I sat down to regen but the disease kept me from regening and the poison kept 
    dropping my hps. With the poison and disease eating at my shattered body I 
    knew I had to get healed fast. I did a shout for a cure and someone said they 
    would cure me at the entrance to Nektulos. I ran as fast as I could, hit points 
    dropping all the way. Just as I got to the entrance within sight of my savior, 
    I dropped over unconscious. My hit points were still dropping me to death, 
    when the healer saw me and rushed over to heal me. The heal spell hit me when 
    I had less than a bubble of purple life left. It was the closest I have ever 
    come to dying without actually dying. Even closer than the time I was attacked 
    my a sand giant and zoned with 1 hit point left, but that is a story for another 
    time. Cyanna of The Wayward Travelers</p>
