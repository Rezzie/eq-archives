      <p>Well, here is my first official submission to your site for humor. I 
        loved reading all the idiot files, thinking I was soo much better than 
        all those fools till it happened. </p>
      <p>I hit lvl 30 finally. I was so excited, it had finally happened! Yay. 
        Ok, excitement time over, back to what I was doing, transferring some 
        items to another char of mine. So a friend logs in a newbie mule at Halas 
        for me and I give him lots of goodies. He takes them all and puts them 
        on and says, "Hey man, I had to destroy my food and water to hold all 
        that stuff, now that I'm wearing it I have room, kill me so it'll come 
        back." and he promptly /duel's me. </p>
      <p>I laugh at his puny lvl 1 ass and fire off my potent Frost Strike spell...WHAMMO! 
        One dead lvl 1 barbarian warrior. Well the next 5 seconds were a blur 
        of guards and stuns and lots and lots of damage, ending in the Loading, 
        Please Wait.....You have lost a level, Welcome to Level 29! Guess the 
        Halas guards didnt take to kindly to my murder. </p>
      <p>So I'm mad, my friend comes back to his bind spot and sees my corpse 
        and says he's real sorry. We do the item swaps and he logs in his druid, 
        saying he's gonna help me get my lvl back. We whisk away to faydwer and 
        enter the undersea world of Kedge Keep where he says he'll pull and heal 
        me and I'll get it back fast. This works great except for a couple crashes 
        of my machine and soon Im back in my lvl 30 glory. In that doing I got 
        a fin needed for my totemic quest, yay! I'll go make my tunic. I rush 
        to South Karana on my way to Lake Rathe when a guild friend of mine asks 
        for a little help on the PH spawn. Me being the nice guy I am rush to 
        his aid. I buff them, buff myself (put on a levitate, dont wanna fall 
        off and die and lose my new lvl do I?) and heal them a bit.</p>
      <p> I med as Im now low on mana and they ask me to kill the Avocet that 
        has spawned, Im big and bad, Im lvl 30, "Sure!" I say. I med up a little 
        more, slap on some ofmy fancy shmancy new lvl 29 spells and start whackin 
        on that bird. It's going pretty good when another bird spawns on my head....Uh 
        oh, Im getting pummeled. I send a quick "Im gonna zone" to my guildy and 
        promptly run off the edge of the PH in the direction of Lake Rathe.....</p>
      <p>I really should have checked to make sure that levitiate was still up...I 
        zone all right....Loading, Please Wait.....Welcome to Level 29. /cry /cry 
        /cry. </p>
      <p>Well there it is, for your reading pleasure, the idiocy of a lvl 30...oops 
        29 shaman.</p>
