      <p align="left">After several hours of basically begging ShowEQ supporters 
        to defend their position, two finally agreed to answer the questions I 
        posted on their message board. In the spirit of intrigue, I will name 
        them "Mr. X" and "Mr. Y" (for no real reason whatsoever ... their answers 
        can be found on the site's bulletin board). </p>
      <p align="center">Interview with Mr. X.</p>
      <p align="left"> Mr. X: [to another member of the message board; one person 
        didn't want to visit my site because he was afraid I would log his visit 
        and turn him in]. First, let me address the issue of having and IP address 
        logged. What are you talking about? If you think this is the only way 
        that someone can get your IP address, you have some serious misconceptions. 
        Second, have you ever heard of NAT? I share a handful of external addresses 
        with out 1000 other machines. So please post how this is relavent to anything 
        hanz...Now, as far as the article. For someone who has his article posted 
        on a humor site, you seem to be pretty serious. I thought the article 
        was half a joke. I guess I was wrong. So let's talk about your issues. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Some say that this program unfairly nerfs rangers. What 
        is your response? </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. X: Have rangers and druids been nerfed? I don't think 
        so. Showeq has not taken their abilities away from them. A nerf implies 
        that their abilites have become less effective. They still have their 
        abilites and they are still helpful in a group. Showeq users can't join 
        a group as a warrior and start leading their party around without giving 
        away he is using showeq. </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Some say that this program gives unfair advantage to 
        people who are able to meet the hardware and software requirements and 
        know-how to run ShowEQ. What is your response? </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. X: Showeq absolutley gives us an advantage over people 
        who don't have it. What is it that Verant keeps preaching? Norrath is 
        a dangerous and unforgiving world where things aren't always fair? Besides, 
        have you ever tried to get customer service from Verant? It's non-existant. 
        I lost about 600pp in items due to a game crash during a trade. I petitioned 
        and sent e-mail for 2 weeks and nothing came of it. The only responses 
        I did recieve told me to prove that I lost the items during the crash. 
        So showeq, helps me recover some of my losses by killing MOB's with good 
        loot.</p>
      <p align="left"> CK: Why are you doing it? Ego? Activism? Both? None of 
        the above?</p>
      <p align="left"> Mr. X: I think this is explained in [the answer above]. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Do you think this program is legal? Why? (I am not talking 
        about the User Agreement .. I mean, legal legal) </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. X: Do I think this program violates the user agreement? 
        Yes. Do I think it is legal asside from the user agreement? Yes. These 
        packets are traveling across my network. I have a handful of machines 
        on a small LAN and if I want to look at the data traveling across that 
        network, then that's my choice. </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Some say this program keeps Verant from taking care 
        of more important issues. What is your response?</p>
      <p align="left"> Mr. X: I don't see how this question is really relevant. 
        Who can really answer for Verant on this? If this is taking Verant's time 
        away from other issues, then Verant needs to address this internaly. They 
        are the ones that need to make custome service decisions. Perhaps they 
        need to ask questions about why poeple are using showeq( server overcrowding, 
        camping sucks, lack of customer service, etc... ). Besides, Verant has 
        made statements that they have devoted next to no time in during their 
        encoding of packets.. </p>
      <p align="left">CK: If you think this product is fine and justified, why 
        are you so defensive about it? </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. X: I don't know how you arrived at the conclusion that 
        everyone is so defensive about it. I don't think I have really seen much 
        of anything on these boards about the ethics, morality, or legality of 
        showeq. I think your questions and my answers have been the largest discussion 
        I have seen on the issue. Perhaps I am looking in the wrong place. If 
        so, please point me to text that contains the defensiveness you describe.</p>

      <p align="center"> Interview with Mr. Y</p>
      <p align="left"> CK: Some say that this program unfairly nerfs rangers. 
        What is your response? </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Y: How? I don't see this affecting rangers at all, but 
        extending similar (but not identical) abilities to other classes. In addition, 
        it's also a bit more difficult to pay attention to two monitors at one 
        time, whereas a ranger just has to look at one. Perhaps that balances 
        things a bit. Either way, the rangers/druids tracking ability remains 
        unaffected. </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Some say that this program gives unfair advantage to 
        people who are able to meet the hardware and software requirements and 
        know-how to run ShowEQ. What is your response?</p>
      <p align="left"> Mr. Y: Of course it does. Higher IQ gives some people unfair 
        advantages in gaining employment as engineers instead of janitors, and 
        the point being what? I'm sorry, I don't play this game to be exactly 
        like everyone else. This game is about the aquisition of loot, fame and 
        fortune. Socializing too. ShowEQ gives people an edge, why should they 
        deny this? </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Why are you doing it? Ego? Activism? Both? None of the 
        above?</p>
      <p align="left"> Mr. Y: None of the above. I almost quit EQ several times 
        before ShowEQ came out, but I have a renewed interest now, gives me somethin 
        to look forward to and something I can contribute to. I can't do that 
        with Verant directly. </p>
      <p align="left">CK: Do you think this program is legal? Why? (I am not talking 
        about the User Agreement .. I mean, legal legal) </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Y: In no way is this program illegal. I don't even know 
        where people get this goofy idea? It is against the TOS of EQ, but it 
        does not violate any US or international law. Where did you get this idea? 
        What aspect of the program do you think could even conceivably violate 
        a US or international law?</p>
      <p align="left"> CK: Some say this program keeps Verant from taking care 
        of more important issues. What is your response?</p>
      <p align="left"> Mr. Y: Laff ... was Verant ever taking care of more important 
        issues before ShowEQ? The answer is an emphatic NO! There have been a 
        miriad of pathetic, known problems that Verant STILL hasn't dealt with, 
        yet they add useless and trivial things like baking and pottery, etc... 
        They constantly focus on things no one cares about, the small, easy things, 
        and leave the hard decisions and problems to rot. ShowEQ does not take 
        time away from anything important, they simply choose to ignore important 
        issues until it's convenient. As an aside, Smed stated that they only 
        spend 5 or 10 min here and there working on the encryption properties 
        of the datastream to disable ShowEQ. </p>
      <p align="left">CK: If you think this product is fine and justified, why 
        are you so defensive about it? </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Y: I think we need a defintion of "Fine and justified" 
        that we both can agree on. In all honesty, I rarely even use ShowEQ for 
        spawns. I am extremely well to do EQ wise, all of it obtained long before 
        ShowEQ. I don't really have a need to camp wandering spawns for any reason. 
        I primarily use ShowEQ for the numbers. I love to know what my exact stats 
        are, what the mobs HP is, what experience I am receving or have lost due 
        to a death. I absolutely love it. If the mob SPAWN data was never sent, 
        but I could still see the monster HP and the rest of my personal stats, 
        that would be enough for me.<br>
        I like to see exactly how close Nagafen, Vox, Maestro, Innoruuk and CT 
        get to death when my entire party and everyone else is dead.I like seeing 
        that the Maestro starts lifetapping like mad at 4200hp, but not before. 
        I like the numbers... that's why I use ShowEQ. If Verant would put a numbers 
        switch in the game, that would go a long to eliminating a lot of SEQ users.<br>
        The only other reason I use ShowEQ is the for the map. Yes, the map. I 
        like seeing exactly where I am, and the fastest way to get to the next 
        zone. Even a year after playing, I have found that I have been taking 
        round about ways through some zones. <br>
        It's all in the numbers. Verant spouts on about "Oh we want to keep the 
        mystery of the game there" It's a #$@%%@#%ing mystery to me why monsters 
        should be able to attack through walls, why they know EXACTLY where you 
        are in the zone, no matter where you are, why they know EXACTLY where 
        you are even if you are invisible, why they can cast and move at the same 
        time, why they don't follow the same LOS rules on spells, why they hit 
        10 times harder at the same level, why they teleport on top of me if they 
        happen to get stuck, why we can't use terrain to our advantage like anyones 
        common sense would dictate, etc... THAT is the mystery of EQ, keeping 
        the numbers from the players is not enhancing mystery, just fostering 
        frustration... guess what, I'm a lot less frustrated now! </p>
