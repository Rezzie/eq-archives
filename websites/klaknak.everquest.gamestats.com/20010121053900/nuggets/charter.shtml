        <p align="center"><b><font size="5">The Charter of Ether Goodness</font></b></p>
        <p>Anyone who wishes to join the Nuggets of Justice should know one thing. 
          We are primarily a social guild whose duty it is to push the line between 
          annoying idiocy and ether-induced cleverness. We have only a few rules, 
          all of which can be broken:</p>
        <p>1. Your name should be ridiculously long.</p>
        <p>2. You must pay Joe $20,000 to join.</p>
        <p>However, there are some rules that can NOT be broken:</p>
        <p>1. The squirrel has the Nut.</p>
        <p>2. You must play a short character (halfling, dwarf, gnome, Regis Philbin)</p>
        <p>And so, without further ado, the Charter of Ether Goodness (bow to 
          its supreme authority):</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><font size="5"><b>The Camel Lights Tenets of Destiny:</b></font></p>
        <p align="center">Canto 1</p>
        <p>Verse 1. This sentence is false.</p>
        <p>Verse 2. And lo the servants of the tallards did come to this place 
          from another place (complaining about the high price of eggs) and they 
          did try and conquer this place that is not that other place, but lo 
          and behold this miracle: for then, a short Gnome whose name has been 
          lost in time did find the sacred squirrel and lo the squirrel had the 
          nut. All praise the Nut.</p>
        <p>Verse 3. Those who trust in the Nut are like Forehead of Brell, which 
          cannot be moved, but lives forever. As the buttocks of Trolls are Showing, 
          so the buttock of the Nut is Showing from this time forth and evermore. 
          For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the Nut allotted to 
          the righteous lest the righteous put forth a bitching recipe for chicken 
          salad. Do good, O Nut, to those who are good, and to those who hold 
          the Nut in the bounty of their hearts! But those tallards who turn aside 
          their crooked ways, the Nut shall beat the ever living Shit out of them 
          anyway, because we don't like them. Amen and peace to the Nut!</p>
        <p>Verse 4. Whenever a tallard comes into your presence, you will crouch 
          and walk around him in circles until he is bored. Thus spake the Nut.</p>
        <p>Verse 5. Whenever travelling to an extremely dangerous area, you will 
          crouch and thereby walk crouching long enough for people to notice you 
          and say &quot;Ha ha that is funny.&quot;</p>
        <p>Verse 6. And lo, if a tallard does not leave your presence, you shall 
          then dance by crouching and standing very quickly. Thus spake the Nut.</p>
        <p>Verse 7. And so it came to be that an apprentice came to the Nut. And 
          the apprentice was heard to have asked: &quot;Lo, what is the meaning 
          of the Nut?&quot; At which time the Nut did hit him with the Nut Stick 
          and the apprentice became at Nut with the universe.</p>
