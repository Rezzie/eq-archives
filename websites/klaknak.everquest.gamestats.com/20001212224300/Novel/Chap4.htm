  <hr>
  <p align="left">&quot;Let's go kill rats,&quot; my sandwich said.</p>
  <p align="left">I threw some of my newbie food down on the ground and began 
    stomping on it in an attempt to kill the flavor. I picked it up and popped 
    it into my mouth.</p>
  <p align="left">Better.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Where are they?&quot; I said. &quot;And is the Lady Vox 
    with them?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich frowned.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Let's just concentrate on the rats for now,&quot; it said. 
    &quot;First, you need to equip your sword.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;My sword!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Cool!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I removed the sword from my backpack and began swinging it around.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Luke, I am your father!&quot; I said and began swinging 
    wildly.</p>
  <p align="left">I accidentally decapitated myself.</p>
  <p align="left">A beautiful voice chimed:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Now Loading ... please extinguish all cigarettes ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Soon, I was in the afterlife.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, for years I had secretly dreaded the afterlife because 
    whether I ended up in hell or heaven, the bottom line was that I was afraid 
    of heights. Neither sitting on a cloud nor plummeting to the nether regions 
    really appealed to me, so I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up from blackness 
    to find myself in a queue line. The afterlife, I was surprised to find, did 
    not look totally unlike the DMV.</p>
  <p align="left">From what I could tell, I was in a line to get a ticket. I would 
    then get a ticket and sit and then wait to be called to stand in another line. 
    I would then be informed that I had misinformed the ticket agent as to the 
    true nature of my complaint and that I should get in line again.</p>
  <p align="left">Hell, as far as I could tell, was forever being looped through 
    this process. Heaven, it appeared, involved moving through the line quickly 
    and receiving a commemorative license plate.</p>
  <p align="left">Just ahead of me was a wizard of some sort (the hat gave him 
    away), so I decided to strike up a conversation.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Hello, wizard.&quot; I said. &quot;Why are you here?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Death,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Hey, me too! What happened?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I accidentally teleported my group to Karanas instead 
    of casting a combat spell. They were not amused, so they killed me.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ah,&quot; I said. &quot;How very sad.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;How did you die?&quot; he asked me.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh,&quot; I said. &quot;Who? Me? Heh heh. Well, I ... 
    um .. I accidentally tripped and hit my head on a door knob ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The wizard smirked. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; he said. &quot;Whatever you say, bud.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">He then turned and the line moved ahead. Soon, it was my turn.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What are you here for?&quot; the clerk asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Death,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Which game?&quot; she asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Everquest,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Hurry up, man. We haven't got all day!&quot; screamed 
    a little voice.</p>
  <p align="left">I turned and saw a little worm in a jet pack behind me.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Sorry little guy,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">The clerk handed me a form. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Please fill out this form. When your number is called, 
    return this form to Queue 13.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">I took the form and walked over to the bank of chairs, sitting 
    next to a horizontal bar who looked eerily similar to a Pong paddle.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Excuse me,&quot; I said. &quot;Aren't you a Pong paddle? 
    I thought that game went out of style years ago.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Pong 3-D, smart ass,&quot; he replied. &quot;Mind your 
    fucking business.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Chastized, I turned to my form. It was a simple affair. In the 
    upper right hand corner, instructions instructed me to put an X in a circle. 
    The rest of the form was FOR STAFF USE ONLY.</p>
  <p align="left">Many hours passed, until finally my number was called. I jumped 
    in my queue and soon was with the clerk.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;How did you die?&quot; the clerk asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Um ... I ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;And don't give me any of that door knob shit,&quot; she 
    said. &quot;If I had a nickel...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">and she kind of muttered a bit.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Um... I decapitated myself with my sword.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Bwahahahah&quot; she said and she stamped my form.</p>
  <p align="left">***</p>
  <p align="left">I awakened in Freeport completely naked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Bwahahahah.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich, and half the citizens of Freeport were still laughing 
    at me.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Hey ...&quot; I said, but no one cared.</p>
  <p align="left">Burning red in embarrassment, I bent down to collect my items 
    off my corpse. Under normal circumstances, looting my own corpse would have 
    given me some pause but I was too embarassed to notice. I did notice, however, 
    that I was going bald and that I had some gum stuck to my ass.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I'll be damn,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">I equipped myself but decided to take a different approach to 
    combat. I put away my sword.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; my sandwich asked?</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Swords are dangerous,&quot; I said. &quot;I am going to 
    use Tai Chi to kill the rats.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My freshman year of college, my roommate and I were sitting 
    in our dorm room trying to figure out which physical education credit to take 
    to meet our requirement. We had almost settled on juggling when Jane Pauley, 
    screeching profundities on the Today Show, introduced her next guest. Her 
    next guest was this 4 foot tall Chinese man, a renowned master of Tai Chi.</p>
  <p align="left">After a pointless little interview in which neither Jane nor 
    the Chinese man had any idea what the other was saying, they walked over to 
    a mat in the studio so the Chinese man could provide a demonstration.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;So Tai Chi is primarily a meditative discipline,&quot; 
    Jane said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh, true,&quot; said the Chinese man. &quot;But it can 
    also be used for combat.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">He then grabbed Jane Pauley and flung her to the floor. Jane, 
    laughing, stood up and said:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Indeed, I can see that ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">And the Chinese man threw her to the floor again. For the next 
    three minutes, Jane tried desperately to stand up and go to commercial, but 
    everytime she tried, the man would throw her to the ground again.</p>
  <p align="left">Needless to say, my roommate and I were very much impressed. 
    Our college was offering Tai Chi, so we decided to sign up.</p>
  <p align="left">A week later, we were bored with it, but received a PE credit 
    anyway due to clerical error. I barely recalled anything involved with Tai 
    Chi, but I did seem to remember something about pelicans and monkeys in trees.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You see, sandwich,&quot; I said. &quot;I know this technique 
    called The Salivating Pelican Monkey Climbs a Tree. Very devastating.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich frowned. And me without a camera.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Whatever you say,&quot; it said. &quot;But let's get moving. 
    You need to gain some experience.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Very well,&quot; I said ... and I began bending my knees 
    and swaying back and forth. I carefully lifted my right hand and began smacking 
    the bad juju in the air. My left hand swirled in an arc by my side. I began 
    to drool.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok,&quot; I drooled. &quot;I am ready. Bring on the rat.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich frowned again.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Maybe we should leave the city,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">And so we did. Standing in front of us was a wide open expanse 
    of horrible critters and players, waiting to meet the Pelican Monkey.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I am ready,&quot; I said. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;There is a rat right over there!&quot; my sandwich said. 
    And indeed ... there was.</p>
  <p align="left">I walked over to this ugly, drooling, horrible rat (about the 
    size of watermelon) and bowed.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I honor you with my Pelican Monkey move, please,&quot; 
    I said and began squatting again and moving my arms about.</p>
  <p align="left">The rat bit me in the neck and I died.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Now loading,&quot; a beautiful voice chimed. </p>
  <p align="left">***</p>
  <p align="left">Again, I was in line.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What are you here for?&quot; I asked a 3-D deer.</p>
