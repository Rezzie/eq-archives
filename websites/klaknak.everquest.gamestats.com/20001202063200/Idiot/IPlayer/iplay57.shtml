  <p align="center">The Day I Unintentionally Killed All The Newbies - by Palatine</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I guess we've all trained people before, but this is probably 
    the worst thing that happened to me. I was in the open area of Everfrost Peaks 
    and was attacked by an ice-boned skeleton. I don't know if this is still the 
    case but an ice-boned skelly is very aggressive, attacking just about anyone 
    within a certain radius of it. I didn't own any magic weapons, so I ran like 
    hell to the outer guard area, just inside the labyrinth that divides Halas 
    from the open fields of Everfrost (where the dungeon permafrost is). I don't 
    know if this was a bug or anything, but the guard just stood there while the 
    ice-boned skelly WHALED on me. I panicked and thought that maybe the guards 
    at the entrance to the ramp to Halas would kill it, So I yelled "Ice boned 
    skeleton to ramp!" and ran for it. I got about 50 game feet from the guards 
    before the skelly killed me. </p>
  <p align="left">I spawned back in halas, swam the lake to Everfrost Peaks and 
    was almost immediately surrounded by dead newbies. There were corpses everywhere! 
    It looked like a UFO cult after judgement day! I guess this was a rare occasion 
    when there were no high levels or twinks with magic weapons around. People 
    were shouting and telling me that I was a jerk (which I was, I guess)! I finally 
    had to log because it was getting so hot and I was sooo embarrassed! </p>
