  <p align="center">Why I Don't Do Windows</p>
  <p align="center">by Calisca, 18th Level Paladin of Tunare, Veeshan Server</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Have you ever noticed that Hybrid classes get REEEEEEEEEEALLY 
    cocky once they hit their first rank of spells? Like we're god or something...or 
    even Aradune. Fortunately for the rest of Norrath, this phase doesn't last 
    long as we squirm in ignominious death at the feet of a particularly nasty 
    MOB. Still, however briefly, it does happen, and this phenomenon seems to 
    affect Paladins like me the worst, since we start out with that god-like Lay 
    Hands thingie. </p>
  <p align="left">My name is Calisca. I am an 18th Level Paladin, and recovering 
    idiot. Remember this is an ongoing process, and I may never be fully cured. 
    But here I share my stories with you, Gentle Reader, that you may be one of 
    the few who bypasses Hybrid Spell GOD Syndrome....and may I advise you off 
    the bat that just because you can cast spells doesn't mean your hit points 
    increase. We tend to forget little things like that. </p>
  <p align="left">I had gotten my spells AND meditate, so I was pretty doggone 
    full of myself, flouncing around Crushbone, PROUD of my spells and my "Infamous 
    Villain" status with these oversized evil Smurfs with big nasty pointy teeth. 
    I'd been doing pretty well, so when the opportunity came to join a group and 
    finally venture into the Castle, I bit. I mean, how could I deprive a group 
    of my Righteous Paladin-ness (that nickname continues to stick, by the way, 
    much to my newfound chagrin)? In we marched, banners waving. </p>
  <p align="left">It didn't take long to clear a pretty big swath in the throne 
    room, and my experience was zooming. So was my ego. We'd even (don't ASK me 
    how, it was a miracle I haven't had the chance to repeat) managed to take 
    down Crush so now I had a spiffy Dwarven Ringmail Tunic. WooooooOOOOOooooo!</p>
  <p align="left"> So how hard could it be to take D'vinn, right? Oh, THAT hard, 
    you say....OK...but I want a peek. Just a little peek, to see what he looked 
    like. I guess I peeked a little too far in (doggone, what do you MEAN Paladins 
    don't get Eye of Zomm?) because the first thing I see is a Royal Guard. And 
    I am Infamous. REALLY Infamous, apparently, because he attacked me. And boiling 
    right out behind him is D'Vinn and Crush. They don't seem to want to socialize 
    with me, unless that extremely painful backstab was D'vinn's way of inviting 
    me to tea and crumpets. </p>
  <p align="left">Stupidly, I ran into the Throne Room instead of OUT. Surrounded 
    by big nasties, I started to panic. And Lay Hands was gone by now to save 
    a fellow group member, so no use to me (though I kept pushing the button just 
    in case!!). I was going down fast when the magic words came from my inattentive 
    group leader... </p>
  <p align="left">"CALI! Use the WINDOWS!"</p>
  <p align="left"> She didn't realize I was low on HP, being kind of busy herself. 
    For that matter, neither did I. Or more accurately, I didn't realize I couldn't 
    just FLY out, you know. Even in the face of death, I'm still god. And it's 
    not that big a fall, right? So....I....jump, ready to bounce to my feet and 
    run like hell to the zone. </p>
  <p align="left">Oh...not only do I not get Eye of Zomm, I don't get Safe Fall 
    EITHER. "Ambassador Dvinn backstabs YOU for 87 points of damage!" "orc oracle 
    begins to cast a spell" (where the hell did HE come from??) "you feel your 
    skin numb as the Frost Rift strikes you!" "Emperor Crush bashes YOU for 30 
    points of damage!" "Pain and suffering try to strike YOU but miss!" "You died." 
    "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....." </p>
  <p align="left">Ooh. Ow. See what I mean? GOD what an ego. But I learned my 
    lessons...<br>
    1) Crush and D'vinn don't take kindly to unannounced guests. <br>
    2) Paladins are NOT GOD just because they can cast spells. <br>
    3) It's never a good idea to jump out of a tower window when you have two 
    bubbles of life left. <br>
    4) Egotistical Paladins falling out of windows to their death makes the assembled 
    masses waiting for the Orc Warlord laugh...until that heavily aggro'd train 
    derails onto them.</p>
  <p align="left"> I laugh now, but it was a bruiser at the time. Needless to 
    say...this is why I DON'T DO WINDOWS! </p>
