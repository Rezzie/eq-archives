  <p>My husband loves that ‘Survivor’ show and he talks about it all the time 
    to our friends. I have watched some of the episodes and it is a very intriguing 
    idea. In case you have been camping Lower Guk for the last 2 months and not 
    left your computer, the show is about 2 groups of people dropped on an island 
    with nothing but the clothes on their back and one personal item. They have 
    to try and ‘survive’ but it is no ‘Gilligan’s Island’. They have to do contests 
    every week and the winning group gets a reward while the losers have to kick 
    someone off. The last person on the island gets a million bucks. My husband 
    and I got to talking about it the other day, and a stupid topic emerged. As 
    I said, they each got to take one personal item along with them. <br>
    My husband being the smart ass that he is said his one personal item would 
    be a refrigerator filled with food. I told him that I know it is his closest 
    companion, but what would he do with no electricity? (which means that I could 
    not bring my computer, so no EQ) He then gave me his real answer which was 
    his pillow. Now, this is not just any pillow. My husband has some kind of 
    freakish bond with his pillow. He takes it everywhere, vacation, camping, 
    long car trips, you name it. He has told me in the past how he has only had 
    3 pillows in his entire life. (I know how disgusting this sounds, believe 
    me). He said he had the one from his childhood until his mother made him throw 
    it out and get a new one. When we got married, I made him throw that one out 
    and get a new one. I have not been able to get him to get rid of his current 
    one. I tried to throw it away once and he pitched a fit and got it out of 
    the garage. I make him wash it himself because I will not touch it. Next, 
    he asked me what my personal item would be. I said well, the computer of course 
    would be out, and I do not think they would let me bring Russell Crowe with 
    me as my personal item. I thought maybe my oldest cat, but I would be afraid 
    he would wind up on a spit with an apple in his mouth. So I said my personal 
    item would be my big hardbound copy of the complete works of Shakespeare. 
    I figure it would give me something to do, and heavy enough to kill small 
    animals or crack nuts if I hit them with it. And in an emergency I could use 
    it as kindling or toilet paper. So my question to all of you is, if you were 
    stranded on a deserted island with only one personal item what would it be 
    and why? As always, e-mail me your responses and I will post them </p>
