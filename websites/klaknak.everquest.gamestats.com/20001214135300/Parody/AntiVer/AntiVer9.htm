  <p>Cyanna's EQ Fashion Emergency - by Cyanna</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I have had enough of the male created graphics for my fellow 
    females in Norrath. I think they need a woman’s touch. Namely, mine. So I 
    have decided to declare... CYANNA’S EQ FASHION EMERGENCY </p>
  <p align="left">Dark elves - What is up with the backless pants? Those went 
    out of style with David Lee Roth. Give the poor girls some real clothes before 
    they freeze their butts off (literally). And who knew Victoria Secret made 
    banded mail? I thought this stuff was supposed to protect you. The bottoms 
    consist of thigh high boots, black lace panties and a garter belt. But I have 
    found out that this is all just a plot hatched by these ebony succubi (look 
    it up) to charm the men of Norrath and twist them to their evil will. Be strong, 
    fellows and do not give in!</p>
  <p align="left">Dwarves - Poor things need electrolysis or waxing or something 
    to get rid of that unsightly facial hair. No amount of plucking will fix that 
    problem. And unless you are a nun or a prison guard (yeah, I know, same thing) 
    the matron look is out. Maybe try some big sweaters and loose pants. Definitely 
    stay away from anything form fitting. I have seen boulders with better figures. 
    (Note to dwarven men: dwarven women see this as a compliment)</p>
  <p align="left">Ogres - Someone needs to tell them the flintstones look went 
    out about 63 million years ago. And remember, vertical stripes are quite slimming. 
    And seeing them in leather armor looks like they lost a feces throwing contest 
    with a chimp. As a side note, a dentist willing to relocate to Ogguk would 
    make a fortune. Just make sure you are not KOS.</p>
  <p align="left">Trolls - They have rogaine for women, too, you know. And you 
    might want to think about a bra that gives a little support. In the heat of 
    battle one of those things could put out an eye.</p>
  <p align="left">Humans - They need some banded LEGGINGS. The banded pants look 
    like chain mail underwear. And we all know how uncomfortable that is.</p>
  <p align="left">Half elves - I know the butt thong is nice to look at but have 
    you ever bent over to loot a monster in one? It gives a whole new meaning 
    to the word “Wedgie” You have to spend the next 5 minutes getting it back 
    out. And I am not so sure about the butch haircut. It might be sending the 
    wrong signals, you know what I mean? Maybe let it grow a bit or try a nice 
    weave.</p>
  <p align="left">Halflings - See dwarves above about the matron look. And maybe 
    you should stop slamming down those jumjum juices and drink a couple of slimfasts. 
    I know halflings are good cooks, but you might want to lay off the seconds 
    or at least the thirds.</p>
  <p align="left">High Elves - I know men like the blond barbie doll look. But 
    you might want to think about a shorter skirt. How can they run in that thing? 
    And have you ever worn a plate mail skirt that reached to the ground. It must 
    weigh a ton! And go out and get some sun for gods sake!</p>
  <p align="left">Erudites - Our western sisters are very nice looking and I love 
    their robes. I just wonder why they always wear hoods? I can only guess they 
    must have one heck of a lousy stylist on Erudin. Come on girls. Come to Qeynos. 
    You see how nice the human women’s hair is. And you can shed that hood once 
    and for all. </p>
  <p align="left">Wood elves - I was trying to think up something mean to say 
    but I can’t. I am big enough woman (insert barbarian joke here) to admit that 
    I am just jealous of them. They are just so petite and cute and all you men 
    drool over them. And they look so dang good in that green swimsuit. Grrrrr. 
    I hate them. Let’s see how cute they look after I whack them with my maul 
    a few times. Oops. Er...um...Did I say that out loud? Hehe. Uh...next.</p>
  <p align="left">Barbarian - I want to know what male sadist gave us these constricting 
    halter tops. Can you say, “mono-bossom”? That thing is straining harder than 
    a folding chair at a weightwatcher meeting. I am afraid to take a deep breath 
    because it may snap and kill someone. I go through baby powder like you would 
    not believe. (You men may not understand this)</p>
  <p align="left">[Editor's Note: Men do understand this. We have areas that ... 
    ahem ... chaff as well.]</p>
  <p align="left">My final words: lift and separate. Cyanna "EQ Fashion Consultant" 
    Thunderhammer</p>
