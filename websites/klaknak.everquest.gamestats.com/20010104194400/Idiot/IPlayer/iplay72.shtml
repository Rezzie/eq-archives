      <blockquote> 
        <p>I have read every single one of the stories on the "Players are Idiots" 
          site... now I think it's time to step up and admit that I too, am a 
          fool. 
        <p>Since level 7 I have had my Ogre Warrior bound in Qeynos. A druid friend 
          ported and bound me there. I liked hunting around this area because 
          there was a lot more there to hunt, and it was easier finding a group. 
          Eventually, I killed enough Gnolls that the guards and merchants conned 
          "Apprehensively" to me. This took a lot of effort. That was an understatement. 
          Eventually I ended back up in the Feerrott. Got bound there, etc. Some 
          time much later another EQ friend of mine suggested I come back to Qeynos. 
          I didn't really want to all that much (after all, the merchants STILL 
          hissed "I have something Ogres can use here...it's the EXIT...now Get 
          Lost!!", etc. at me when I tried to do buisness. Not gud.) After explaining 
          this to my stubborn hummie friend, he told me that there were merchants 
          and a bank in the Qeynos Catacombs that did deal with evil races. 
        <p>So ZAP, zip, back in Qeynos again and bound there. I follow humin frend 
          down the sewer until we came to the local Necro/SK/etc guild. Sure enough 
          all the NPC's glowered at me dubiously. So after going through all of 
          this, and getting past that darn gate that humans have to duck to get 
          through after about 15 minutes, the only merchant that didn't hiss racial 
          slurs at me was the banker (who also conned dubious). Hummie frend told 
          me all I needed to do was kill the two Paladins in West Karana (Estle 
          and Chintle) a bunch of times to bring my faction up with BloodSabres. 
          That it should work after just a few spawns. So I take his word, and 
          under the Pally-Tree I stay for a few days, killing the paladins. They 
          were too easy to kill, and embarrasing when people ran past you wondering 
          "what the heck that silly ogre is doing." The good thing about killing 
          Estle and Chintle a lot was that it brought up faction with the bloodsabres,just 
          as hummie frend told me. The BAD thing was that it brought down my faction 
          with the guards..... big time. And very, very fast. 
        <p>One night I finally get to the point where the guards con Threateningly 
          to me all over again. After coming to this point, I decided to log off 
          for the night. 
        <p>Next night, I come back on. I'm in west Karana, so I popped up right 
          beside the tree. I started wandering around past the the paladin tree, 
          and I get attacked by A grizzly bear that was one level too hard for 
          me to chop up. I was within view of the guard tower, so the first logical 
          thing that came to my mind was "Run to the guards." I did just this, 
          and sure enough they killed my hairy predator. So I just continued on 
          my way back to the tree, not a care in da world till....WHAM!
        <p> LOADING,PLEASE WAIT...
        <p> I had forgotten all about the faction blow the Paladins had cursed 
          on me. Luckily my frend was on, and he drug my corpse to a safe place 
          where me culd loot in peece.
        <p> -- -dat me, Anagrog, moron warrier of da 13th lebel. <br>
