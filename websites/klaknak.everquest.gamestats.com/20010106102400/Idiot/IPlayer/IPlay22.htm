  <p>Charisma - Repaver</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Greetings Klaknak, I have been playing ..err living in EQ for 
    about the past 3 months now and have been a frequent visitor to your site 
    for nearly as long (since finding AllaKazam while searching for weapon stats). 
    Your site has frequently been directly responsible for hysterical laughter 
    and tears to explode from my eyes. I almost coughed up a gnoll when I read 
    Quest by Varris and Inside the Dev's Studio by yourself.</p>
  <p align="left">Here is an Idiot mistake that I made the other day.. not much 
    of one, but costly just the same. I play a Dark Elven Shadowknight on Innoruuk 
    named Repaver, I had mamaged to save enuff money to make the step from Bronze 
    to Steel Plate armor (that can only be bought not looted) and took all my 
    money from the bank to do so. I wanted to buy Steel leggings and Steel Boots 
    and had previously noted their prices. So I go to the shop in Neriak Commons 
    and buy the Steel Boots. I see them in my inventory and click on the Steel 
    Leggings.. wait, what's this? Not enuff money for them? But I checked, but 
    I had enuff money. But I ... doh... but I was still wearing my Grotesque Mask 
    with it's -9 charisma penalty, not my happy + charisma gear. Drastic difference 
    in prices. Still half stunned and beginning to curse my own stupidity (I had 
    done this sort of thing before and swore 'never again') I clicked on the new 
    expensive Steel footware and went to equip them when I lagged out. It took 
    me nearly 30 minutes to get back on the system, and when I had, I spent 10 
    more minutes downloading the new patch and when I finally got back into Neriak... 
    no Boots.</p>
  <p align="left">Needless to say the moral here is Always remove your charisma 
    penalty gear before you buy anything from a venor. </p>
