  <p><font size="4">Exploitz - by the Cackling Klaknak</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The debate about exploits is almost as tired as the debate about 
    PKing and the rotting corpse of a system called the player run economy. But 
    several events both today and yesterday find me in a moment of reflection. 
    So come on in, grab a beer, and take a listen.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Yesterday, on the way towards resolving a guild generated quest 
    with a friend of mine, I found myself in Rivervale waiting to fight Nillipus. 
    When I had played Fimble more frequently, Nillipus had been something of an 
    unobtainable goal for me since I spent most of the time as Fimble pickpocketing 
    creatures instead of fighting them.</p>
  <p align="left">When I arrived in Rivervale with my higher level cleric, I decided 
    to give Nillipus a solid clunk on the head. So Frank (not his real name) and 
    I sat on the ground and waited for Nillipus to show. About ten minutes later, 
    he arrived and before we had a chance to kill him, an absurdly high halfling 
    druid (I think) came along and killed him with one spell.</p>
  <p align="left">I was furious. The halfling claimed he was roleplaying and therefore 
    exempt from the &quot;no kill stealing&quot; etiquette. I told him, and this 
    was true, that if I had a copper for everytime a kill stealer claimed he was 
    &quot;roleplaying&quot; a killstealer, I could retire. In my mind, the roleplaying 
    schtick was just that ... schtick ... to justify DoOdish behavior.</p>
  <p align="left">He responded by saying that he was extremely rich and did not 
    need to killsteal. I again said he was full of shit. He then gave me 100 plat 
    to prove his point. I refused to take it several times until finally he just 
    left it on the ground. SO ... I took it and split it with Frank. The killstealer 
    and I then talked for quite a bit and eventually somewhat warmed to each other. 
    In spite of the fact I still thought what he did was rude (roleplaying or 
    no, I think game etiquette supercedes an individual's need to roleplay), we 
    started talking about EQ money. He claimed that money was extremely easy to 
    obtain because EQ had been filled, since the beginning, with all kinds of 
    exploits.</p>
  <p align="left">Our conversation ended soon after (I think he was bored), but 
    I started thinking about exploits again. Ultima Online, as we all know, was 
    a veritable exploit orgy for hackers and time warp seekers, but I thought 
    EQ had been relatively immune to it. I had heard on a few occasions of exploits, 
    but they all seemed to be of the urban legend category: &quot;someone knows 
    someone who exploited, dOod, and has millions of plat now,&quot; etc. Anyway, 
    I soon forgot about it.</p>
  <p align="left">Later that evening, I was talking with some guildmates when 
    the whole glowing stein topic came up. The stein quest had created something 
    of a controversy in our guild because many of us thought guild members were 
    exploiting the game (and the guild) by using our numbers to make a ton of 
    plat. What I didnt realize until last night was that the glowing stein was 
    selling for 600 plat. SIX HUNDRED PLAT? Two things twirled my mind: (1) 600 
    PLAT?!?! and (2) Who the hell can afford 600 PLAT?!!?.</p>
  <p align="left">This knowledge, plus my ongoing rant against the decaying corpse 
    that is the player run economy, had my brain twirling again, but I soon forgot 
    about it again.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, this morning, I was hunting solo in a certain region of 
    the game when I realized that certain creatures would not pass an invisible 
    border within the zone. Happy with this knowledge (because I had been running 
    from these creatures for a loooong time), I had my vengeance by skirting the 
    border and decimating the offending parties.</p>
  <p align="left">I told my guildmate about it. He told me this was a well known, 
    bannable offense. At first, I couldn't believe my ears. Since 99.9% of the 
    critters I have run into in EQ will chase you from one end of the zone to 
    the other pounding you into meal, I had just assumed that these particular 
    creatures were merely defending their territory until I left. But the more 
    I thought about it, the more I realized that, regardless of what the creatures 
    were doing, it probably was an exploit for me to run along an invisible border 
    frying these fellows with Strike.</p>
  <p align="left">What finally compelled me to right this article was my question 
    to my guildmate:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Why is it that running this invisible border is a bannable 
    offense, but buying tons of prepatch pottery sketches and selling them postpatch 
    is not?&quot; I mean, so what if I get a few tiny slivers of exp by skirting 
    the border. These people made off with tons and tons of plat. My little offense 
    affects others very little. The tons of plat generated by the pottery sketch 
    scam could be responsible for the entire &quot;player run economy&quot; (cough) 
    into the ground.</p>
  <p align="left">The guildmate then told me that the most egregious pottery sketch 
    offenders had had their ill gotten gains yanked from under them. But still, 
    the question loomed in my mind.</p>
  <p align="left">So, with exploits on my mind, I visited a little bugs site called 
    <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com/">Dr. Twister</a> and, as if a bolt from 
    god, he had posted a little essay ... a little bit of which I produce here:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Well, to put this in simple terms, we are hated across 
    the EverQuest informational web page community. A few days ago, I emailed 
    12 different EverQuest sites, asking for a link exchange between us. "You 
    scratch our back, we scratch your back" kind of thing. Needless to say, most 
    of these folks told me to shove it, but in more polite terms. I can't say 
    I didn't expect this, but it's still a little surprising how many people that 
    run these sites don't realize that this site gets bugs fixed much faster than 
    any other method.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Hmmm ... this had me thinking as well. And so now, let me end 
    the story and posit a few comments about exploits:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Which is the best skill to learn in Everquest? Is it bakery? 
    Pottery? Alchemy (bwaha)? No ... it is creating a player on the test server. 
    I don't want to make up any fake statistics, so let me instead pose a question. 
    Of all the players who have tons of plat in the bank, how much of it was made 
    by legitimate means? If a large (or even a medium) percentage was not, what 
    does this say about the feasibility of a true player run economy?</p>
  <p align="left">2. Is it wrong to post bugs on a website? Yes and no. Many exploit 
    sites (especially in UO) require people to pay money or submit bugs in order 
    to gain a password for entrance to a site. To my mind, this is not informing 
    the public about bugs (as they claim). It is what it is ... a bunch of exploiters 
    exploiting the game for personal gain. But Dr. Twister' site appeared to be 
    different. Everything was out in the open ... until I noticed that he was 
    actively seeking to hack the game. He even went as far to say that since we 
    had bought the game, we had a right to hack it and exploit it. To me, this 
    goes beyond mere information exchange. I do honestly believe that open public 
    bug sites serve the gaming public, because they force typically sluggish gaming 
    companies into action. But is hacking the code helping anyone? No.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Has anyone really ever been banned from Everquest or any 
    other online game? I am sure they have, but if I was to be banned for hunting 
    across an invisible border after I had spent weeks and weeks making pots so 
    I could afford a decent pair of snakeskin shorts just to be able to survive 
    ... and then Joe Bloe uses an exploit to make tons of plat ... I would be 
    very pissed. And I would have a right to be very pissed, I think.</p>
  <p align="left">4. If a well known exploit exists, should I use it? This is 
    a tough question. Since we are laboring under Verant's ill conceived player 
    run economy, if exploiters are using a bug to make money, and Verant is doing 
    nothing about it, wouldn't it be stupid for me not to take part also? Just 
    to stay afloat? Sitting here, typing in a vacuum, with no knowledge of any 
    exploits, my first response is: &quot;No, of course not. I am against exploits.&quot; 
    But if someone told me about an exploit, and I knew I would never be caught, 
    would I be tempted? You bet your ass.</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, these are a few thoughts of mine. I welcome any helpful 
    comments and I will post well thought out responses.</p>
