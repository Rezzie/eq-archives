  <p>10 Deaths in 1 hour - by Avearon</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> OK like most people that visit this site frequently, after 
    reading about someone elses, uhh, "mistakes" i think its time to bless the 
    people with this story that happened last weekend...</p>
  <p align="left">It started off with my brand new Level 1 Human Shadow Knight 
    (why? i dunno)</p>
  <p align="left">anyways i had a level 23 halfling druid who grew up in Misty 
    Thicket, so i thought that place had a lot better spawn rate then thise Freeport 
    spot, so after all my training at my guild and such, off i go - wasnt too 
    hard of a trip, just follow the desert wall =P</p>
  <p align="left">Arriving in Rivervale, as i turn the corner id say about 5 give 
    or take (probably give) NPCs start yelling at me because "Shadow Knights like 
    you allways bring out the worst in me" so i say to my self.."eh.."</p>
  <p align="left"> LOADING PLEASE WAIT,</p>
  <p align="left">now with that you'd think people would go, ah ok lets not try 
    that approach again..but noooo it took me like 3 more tries to understand, 
    because with other human characters they dont KOS me, so i thought to myself 
    "hmmm maybe its the shadowknight part getting to em.." (as you can tell im 
    quite the quick thinker =P )</p>
  <p align="left">So i have a person in Freeport cast Invisible (albeit unreliable 
    at times) but anyways it held up to the rivervale zone, i turn the corner 
    - and all the NPCs stay in thier spots..WHOOHOO finally here...as i round 
    the corner near Fool Gold.. </p>
  <p align="left">ou Appear</p>
  <p align="left">Avearon says "mommy.."</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING PLEASE WAIT</p>
  <p align="left">Gahhh <insert word here> invis spell came off...so i go and 
    get "Camoflauge" which seems to be a little longer lasting then invis, so 
    to make a long story short it came off when i entered rivervale, so sitting 
    by the zone in that cave with no invis and so far from Freeport to go back 
    to get another one, i /ooc'd a few times until a nice Magician came and casted 
    it upon me, "YAY" so i finally made it by the guards - i think my body count 
    is around 6 by now..so i zone to misty thicket -</p>
  <p align="left">ack forgot to bind, jump back in the zone line,</p>
  <p align="left">/ooc out, i had to pay for a bind so thus i have to trade, and 
    as without my knowledge, invis comes off when you do that, so you can probably 
    guess what happened next... and since i was bound in town i died about 3 times 
    getting to the zone line running from the Deputies, so as i sit there,</p>
  <p align="left">FINALLY, finally finally im here...walk out the cave Avearon 
    says "SWEET MOTHER OF GOD NO" as i had forgotten about the two deputies guarding 
    the entrance of that cave... LOADING PLEASE wait and </p>
  <p align="left">Oh yes i died a few more times getting to the zone from my bound 
    spot , but i did eventually just give up after the travelers had to wade through 
    my many corpses -formerly known as Avearon</p>
