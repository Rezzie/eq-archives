  <p>The Klaknak's Top Ten Movies of All Time</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The only caveat I really need to add is this: I am not saying 
    these are the top ten greatest movies of all time. I am saying these are my 
    top ten favorite movies of all time. And the list changes weekly.</p>
  <div align="left"></div>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">1. The Conformist. Even though I claim my list changes weekly, 
    this movie (and the next one) have been the top two on my list for about ten 
    years. On the face, The Conformist (by Bertolucci) is the story of a young 
    man trying to rise through the ranks of fascist Italy by killing his old college 
    professor. Below the surface, however, this movie is one of the most subversive 
    critiques of politics and intellectualism I have ever seen, read, heard or 
    smelled. The Manchurian Candidate has NOTHING on this movie. It is my dream 
    to one day write a screenplay for an American political version of this movie.</p>
  <p align="left">2. The Conversation. Even though Francis Ford Coppola rose to 
    absolute prominence with The Godfather, I believe this movie is far better. 
    Starring Gene Hackman, this is the sad tale of a loner surveillance expert 
    who thinks he has discovered a murder plot. The plot hardly matters, however, 
    because this is a filmmaker's movie. Coppola took all the artistic questions 
    raised in the movie Blow Up and applied it to the world of audio, with far 
    more interesting results. Sure, he cheats a little towards the end of the 
    movie, but I really don't care.</p>
  <p align="left">3. The Elephant Man. In anyone else's hands (I am still waiting 
    for a shitty 90's version to come out), this film practically begs to fall 
    into the pit of cheap moralizing. In capable hands of the young David Lynch, 
    however, this movie rises way above most. I think the primary reason for this 
    is because Lynch realizes that style is just as important as theme in any 
    movie worth its salt. Many movies today (and even back then) fail because 
    they take some admittedly good themes and bury them in artistic mediocrity. 
    If I am interested solely in intellectual discourse or cheap sentimentality, 
    I will go purchase a theological tract from one of the bums in the local railroad 
    tunnel. When I see a movie, I want to be stimulated intellectually, but I 
    also want to be titillated by an artist in command of his medium. Few directors 
    have greater command than David Lynch.</p>
  <p align="left">4. My Life as a Dog. This is, quite simply, the sweetest movie 
    ever made.</p>
  <p align="left">5. Jacob's Ladder. There isn't any cool intellectualism here 
    ... only extreme psychological violence. The director (whoever he is) takes 
    an incredibly interesting theme (the psychological nature of demons), throws 
    in some Dante, and then starts beating on your limbic system with a lead pipe 
    ... with nails in it ... and some plague on the nails ... Scary. He also has 
    a very interesting visual style. The demons are not these pitchfork wielding, 
    chain brandishing comic book freaks used to scare children ... they are faceless, 
    only slightly deformed humans aimed to keep adults, not children, up at night. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">6. Brazil. Holy cow! Christ. I think this was the first movie 
    I ever saw that told me: &quot;movies are a whole hell of a lot more than 
    magic dragons and Ewoks.&quot; Once again, as with other movies on my list, 
    theme and visual artistry are perfectly intertwined. </p>
  <p align="left">7. Dead Ringers. I can't decide which is the scariest movie 
    ever made ... this one or Jacob's Ladder. Dead Ringers is the story of twin 
    gynecologists who ... freak out a little bit. I honestly can't understand 
    how any woman is capable of watching this movie. By now many of you are probably 
    saying, &quot;Jesus, Joe, you sure do like them fucked up movies.&quot; to 
    which I have to say &quot;yup.&quot; I am not sure why that is except that 
    I am intrigued by psychologically violent films. I think we can easily become 
    jaded when watching traditionally violent movies (Die Hard, etc.), but I think 
    it is impossible to form an immunity against psychological violence evident 
    in movies like Dead Ringers. And that really intrigues me.</p>
  <p align="left">8. Dr. Strangelove. Ok, everyone has seen this movie, but I 
    want to add my own little twist. This movie is NOT about the absurdity of 
    a nuclear age. This movie is about the absurdity of people. Period. I think 
    it is easy to watch this movie and laugh and say, &quot;the military is so 
    stupid,&quot; but I dont know. We run into people from this movie everyday. 
    Whenever someone goes through a express checkout line with 11 items instead 
    of 10 and the cashier starts scolding them with self-righteous glee, I can't 
    help thinking about the military officer's reluctance to shoot the soda machine 
    to get dimes for a telephone call. Or when I see thousands of us rushing to 
    buy shark cartilage or exotic juju juice (and a bag of doritoes) to prolong 
    our silly lives, I can't help thinking about the commander's obsession with 
    his precious bodily fluids. We are all every one of us petty, stupid and full 
    of loony ideas. And that is funny. </p>
  <p align="left">9. Impromptu - So it's a costume period chick flick. I don't 
    care. I love it. It's about the author George Sands (played by Judy Davis) 
    falling in love with Fredric Chopin (played by that goofy British guy ... 
    you know, the one who likes porn. What's his name?). Awesome movie. Very sweet. 
    Judy Davis is still the sexiest woman in the universe. But she won't return 
    my calls.</p>
  <p align="left">10. Ran - Pshew, I am tired so let me just say this. Ran is 
    the most beautiful movie ever made. Kurosawa is the master.</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, I don't want you all to think I am some artistic snob, 
    so let me list some of my favorite guilty pleasure movies (in no particular 
    order):</p>
  <p align="left">1. Die Hard.</p>
  <p align="left">2. L.A. Confidential.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Star Wars (duh).</p>
  <p align="left">4. Aliens</p>
  <p align="left">5. The Wrath of Khan</p>
  <p align="left">6. Kingpin</p>
  <p align="left">7. Love and Death</p>
  <p align="left">8. Murder by Death</p>
  <p align="left">9. All the Pink Panthers (Cato????)</p>
  <p align="left">10. Latex (excellent porn!)</p>
