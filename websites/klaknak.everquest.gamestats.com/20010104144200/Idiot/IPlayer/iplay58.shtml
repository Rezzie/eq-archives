      <p align="left">I am a ranger of Tunare, on my 18th campaign, and I and 
        some companions were clearing the maze of king Grobb of its nefarious 
        minotaur inhabitants.</p>
      <p align="left"> I would camoflage myself, run into the maze, find a fine 
        gorge minotaur or two, snare them, shoot them, and then run them into 
        the welcoming arms of my companions. Once or twice I even find a chasm 
        minotaur that has gotten too close and invite him over for tea. </p>
      <p align="left">The maze also has many muddites, short little lumps of clay 
        that can blind you with a mud-slide if you are not careful They come int 
        two sizes: the minors which are green and the elders. Elders are unpleasant 
        because they run fast and hit hard. We had been getting many minors in 
        our pulls, mezzing them, and polishing them of later - I had not yet been 
        blinded although my friend the ranger had gotten it a couple of times.</p>
      <p align="left"> So, I decide to pull a chasm minotaur from the very back 
        of the zone - this is going to be a long run. Whoops, there is a gorge 
        mino there as well. I check with my friends and they want the gorge mino 
        too. OK - I run in, snare the big mino, shoot him with an arrow and start 
        running back.</p>
      <p align="left"> I run between the legs of the gorge mino and he starts 
        chasing me. Whoops - what is this - there is a Muddite elder hitting me 
        as well. He must have been by the chasm mino. Well, I only get stunned 
        once and now I can run again. </p>
      <p align="left">I tell my friends we have an elder.</p>
      <p align="left"> I get blinded - first time all night. </p>
      <p align="left">I tell my friends that I am now blind - touch typing it 
        of course. </p>
      <p align="left">I get my sight back and see the inventory screen - that 
        is odd. Close inventory and continue to run - the chasm mino caught up 
        with me and now three of them are hitting me. </p>
      <p align="left">I run - my I am SLOW - have I taken that much damage already. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Oh LOOK - another gorge mino in my path. I sure hope I am 
        going the right way. </p>
      <p align="left">stunned again - I can usually outrun these guys - what is 
        going wrong? </p>
      <p align="left">They then proceed to pound on my poor elven frame until 
        I decide to take a nap.</p>
      <p align="left"> I wake up naked and in Rivervale. Oh well. </p>
      <p align="left">While running back I ask my friends if they knew I had been 
        blinded - they said that I had not told them anything, but that they had 
        figured it out. </p>
      <p align="left">AHA </p>
      <p align="left">I had forgotten to hit return before telling them that I 
        was blind - and during my final death march I had been trying to flee 
        while ducking! </p>
      <p align="left">Don't do that.</p>
      <p align="left"> At least I learned something from the experience (don't 
        plan a long pull of 2 critters, and don't touch type while blind.) </p>
