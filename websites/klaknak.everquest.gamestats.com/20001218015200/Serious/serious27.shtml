  <p align="center">Reader response to the Interview with Guide Semiramis - by 
    ...err.. name accidentally excluded</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I found this very interesting. You recently interviewed Elder 
    Guide Semiramis primarily about GM behavior, player banning and naming policy. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Quoting from Verant's naming policy on http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_naming.html: 
    The following types of names are unacceptable and are listed in order from 
    the worst to the least offensive: ... </p>
  <p align="left">4. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin 
    (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin). </p>
  <p align="left">The Elder guide herself(?) is in violation of the naming policy. 
    Semiramis is a historical and religious figure. </p>
  <p align="left">Semiramis was the wife of Nimrod and mother of Tammuz. This 
    is the Nimrod of Genesis 10 and Tower of Babel fame. The short version is 
    that after Nimrod was proclaimed to be the Sun god. After he died Semiramis 
    became pregnant and claimed that it was a virgin conception, having become 
    impregnated when a sun ray struck her. This child which was born was Tammuz. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Semiramis was the original "Queen of Heaven" and Tammuz her 
    virgin born son. The whole family was worshipped as gods. Semiramis was the 
    most revered and Tammuz the most bemourned. This led to all of the Babylonian 
    derived myths from Isis and Osiris down to modern day mariolatry. I have no 
    doubt that a character named VirginMary would have an immediate name change.</p>
  <p align="left"> I offer the following for reference, an excerpt from the book 
    "The Two Babylons" by Alexander Hislop, <a href="http://www.biblepreaching.com/twobabylons/sect221.htm" target="_blank">http://www.biblepreaching.com/twobabylons/sect221.htm</a>. 
    This is not an endorsement of the web site or its content, it is not my site. 
    They just had the excerpt I was looking for online.</p>
