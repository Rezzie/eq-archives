      <p align="left">Introduction</p>
      <p align="left"> For those who have been following my serious stuff, you 
        know that my essays tend to follow a certain style. Rather than using 
        style and conjunctions to form beautiful, well transitioned paragraphs, 
        I usually just throw a bunch of lists out there in a pseudo-logical style. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is a reason for this and my step-mother calls this 
        "grasshopping." My grandmother does it, my dad does it and I do it. </p>
      <p align="left">Grasshopping (n) - the product of a manic mind, grasshopping 
        is the inability of the speaker to stick to one subject for very long. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">If I didn't force myself into lists, I would never get my 
        point across. I feel my essays are extremely tangential as they are. </p>
      <p align="left">But there are times when even lists don't help. Recently, 
        several events conspired to throw my mind into a tizzy concerning relationships 
        and I am not even sure how to start. </p>
      <p align="left">This morning, however, the solution presented itself. I 
        want to start you off with a very simple, if initially obvious, statement, 
        then jump to some real world examples, and then try to pull it all together 
        the best I can. </p>
      <p align="left">So here we go: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Obvious statement: Romeo and Juliet was a TRAGEDY. Obvious, no?</p>
        <p> Ah, but not as obvious as you think. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">First, a few real life examples: </p>
      <p align="left">Example #1: Here is an email a friend of mine sent me: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"Last weekend I went on a massive Bacchanalian pub crawl. It was wonderful. 
          A dear friend of mine got really drunk and basically told the people 
          who drove him to the pub crawl that the reason he doesn't want to date 
          me even though he's terrifically attracted to me is, he isn't 100% sure 
          he can see me with him 35 years from now. " </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Example #2: Here is a (reconstructed) conversation I had 
        with a friend last night. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Treena: There is this guy I really like, but we are having problems 
          sorting things out. <br>
          Joe: What do you mean? Are you dating?<br>
          Treena: No, we are not dating.<br>
          Joe: What is the problem? <br>
          Treena: Well, we both really like each other, but we are not sure if 
          we are really right for each other.<br>
          Joe: What do you mean? <br>
          Treena: We are both really stubborn and we worry that this sort of thing 
          would just clash in a relationship.<br>
          Joe: Ok. <br>
          Treena: Also, sometimes he says he likes me and wants to date, but other 
          times he says he isnt sure. <br>
          Joe: Ok. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Example #3: Here is a (reconstructed) argument I had with 
        the last girlfriend I had dated for any long period of time. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Fifi: I think we need to talk about our relationship? <br>
          Joe: What about our relationship? <br>
          Fifi: I think we just need to talk about it. It's good to talk about 
          these things. <br>
          Joe: But what exactly do you want to talk about? <br>
          Fifi: Don't get all defensive.<br>
          Joe: You know, I am really fucking sick of these relationship talks. 
        </p>
        <p>(relationship ended shortly afterwards). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Example #4: Here is a (reconstructed) argument I had with 
        a married friend a few months ago.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Gretchen: I think I want to divorce my husband. <br>
          Joe: Why? <br>
          Gretchen: I think marriage is a trap. <br>
          Joe: uhhhh ... </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Part 1. Romeo and Juliet is a TRAGEDY. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Whenever we think of romance in literature, what is one of the first 
          literary works to pop into our minds? Romeo and Juliet. It's not difficult 
          to see why. These two star crossed lovers spend most of the play speaking 
          unbelievable words to each other and they end up, tragically, dying 
          for their love. </p>
        <p>I have two points to make about this:</p>
        <p> a. "you kiss by the book" - Juliet <br>
          b. Romeo and Juliet ended up DEAD. </p>
        <p>Shakespeare's plays are many things, but I believe they are primarily 
          morality tales. They are not morality plays in the sense of earlier 
          literature in the English lit canon, but they always seek to teach a 
          lesson. Almost all of Shakespeare's comedies followed the traditional 
          hero pattern of "hero encounters adversity - hero hangs out with societal 
          misfits for a while - hero overcomes adversity and brings the boon back 
          to his society." Most of Shakespeare's tragedies follow the pattern 
          of "flawed hero breaks himself/herself on a rigid code". </p>
        <p>If you think about it, Romeo and Juliet seems pretty far removed from 
          the tragedies of Hamlet or Othello or MacBeth. What could be more different 
          than two teens in love and three grizzled psychotics going slowly ... 
          psychotic? </p>
        <p>Does this mean that Romeo and Juliet somehow breaks from Shakespeare's 
          tragic mold? Not at all; and believing that Romeo and Juliet is somehow 
          different from these other tragedies is completely misunderstanding 
          Romeo and Juliet. </p>
        <p>In all of these cases, the true tragedy does not lie in the feuds between 
          courts or siblings or whatever but in the heroes' inability to free 
          themselves from some sort of rigid code. Hamlet is driven insane by 
          his rigid sworn allegiance to his father. Macbeth is ripped apart by 
          his fiercely dogmatic duty as king, as is Othello.</p>
        <p> What does this have to do with Romeo and Juliet? Everything. No other 
          line more elegantly states this than Juliet's comment to Romeo after 
          a kiss:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> Juliet: You kiss by the book. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Ah, how romantic. Um ... not really. Here's a modern translation:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> Juliet: You kiss as if you picked up a Kissing for Idiots book and 
            studied it ... you really kinda suck. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Whereas Hamlet, MacBeth and Othello were broken on the rock of monarchical 
          duty, Romeo and Juliet were broken on the rock that is the good ole 
          fashioned Plutarchian notions of love. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Gah, how do I sum up Plutarch. Quickly, Plutarch's tales were widely 
            published in Shakespeare's time as Plutarch's Lives and Shakespeare 
            borrowed HEAVILY from him. In many ways, Plutarch was in Shakespeare's 
            time what Shakespeare is in our time. When people thought about love 
            back then, they thought about Plutarch. It is difficult to overstate 
            how incredibly important Plutarch was in the "love tradition" of English 
            literature. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And it was this kind of mindless following of Plutarch that Shakespeare 
          was criticizing in Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet were very much 
          in love, but they were in love according to the book (I cannot emphasize 
          this enough ... their speeches are classic Plutarch both in form and 
          function). Have you ever wondered why whenever they meet, they tend 
          to talk to each other in 5000 word paragraphs? This is no accident. 
          Here, Shakespeare is showing that they are not communicating as much 
          as they are shouting love poems at each other.</p>
        <p> Romeo and Juliet die, not simply because of their warring families 
          (the obvious reason), but because they are so seduced by the language 
          of love. Do I need to tell you that many of Plutarch's heroes died because 
          of love? Shakespeare is simply too smart for this to be a mere coincidence. 
          In fact, the absolute genius of Romeo and Juliet is that it is now considered 
          to be one of the greatest love stories of all time, recited by countless 
          lovers, when it is this exact kind of blind recitation that led to the 
          tragedy to begin with. </p>
        <p>&lt;dramatic, Plutarchian pause&gt;</p>
        <p>Because let's not forget, friends, that the death of Romeo and Juliet 
          may be aesthetically pleasing from a far, but from their point of view 
          ... THEY ARE DEAD. This is not a good thing to be. It has always astonished 
          me (even at a young age) that one of our chief western documents on 
          love ended in a double suicide. To summarize what Shakespeare really 
          means (I think): if this is love, I will stick with porn, thank you 
          very much. </p>
        <p>Pshew. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Part 2. Um, What Does This Have to Do with Anything?</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Read back over the real world examples above. These examples have 
          everything to do with the points I just made on Romeo and Juliet. </p>
        <p>In our "modern" society, we no longer run around reading Plutarch. 
          Neither do many of us run around reading Shakespeare. Since we don't 
          get our lessons in love from the classics, where do we get them from? 
          Well, we certainly get many lessons from legitimate sources: our parents, 
          the church, etc. </p>
        <p>But we dont really listen to our parents or our church, do we? Hell, 
          no. Here is where we really get our lessons in love:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> 1. Billions of self-help books. </p>
          <p>2. Therapists </p>
          <p>3. Oprah </p>
          <p>4. Self-administered magazine surveys (you do it too, men, dont deny 
            it!) </p>
          <p>5. Bubble gum pop movies. </p>
          <p>6. The Cackling Klaknak (poor souls)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Self help books and Plutarch dont seem to share anything in common, 
          but they share a very key component in common. And this is the key lesson 
          of the day. </p>
        <p>"As in Shakespeare, modern lovers or potential lovers speak to each 
          other in the trappings of other people's words rather than in the trappings 
          of their own heart." A</p>
        <p>nd you can quote me on that, babe. </p>
        <p>The examples I presented to you above are absolute perfect examples 
          of this. When I heard these conversations, I could smell the stench 
          of Oprah and our modern day psychology today "love advice" like a foul 
          cloud over a bubonic dog. </p>
        <p>I want to go back over these conversations and add some comments (with 
          apologies to one person who I may offend with my straightforward speech) 
        </p>
        <p>Example #1:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> "Last weekend I went on a massive Bacchanalian pub crawl. It was 
            wonderful. A dear friend of mine got really drunk and basically told 
            the people who drove him to the pub crawl that the reason he doesn't 
            want to date me even though he's terrifically attracted to me is, 
            he isn't 100% sure he can see me with him 35 years from now. " </p>
          <p>Klaknak responds: You know what this guy sounds like to me? He sounds 
            like a spineless idiot who is trying to rationalize either his lack 
            of attraction for the person or his raging insecurity with some sort 
            of bullshit about his long term relationship goals. I dont know this 
            guy, but I kinda feel like punching him in the face and demanding 
            he grow some balls. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Example 2 </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Treena: There is this guy I really like, but we are having problems 
            sorting things out. <br>
            Joe: What do you mean? Are you dating? <br>
            Treena: No, we are not dating.<br>
            Joe: What is the problem? <br>
            Treena: Well, we both really like each other, but we are not sure 
            if we are really right for each other.<br>
            Joe: What do you mean? <br>
            Treena: We are both really stubborn and we worry that this sort of 
            thing would just clash in a relationship.<br>
            Joe: Ok. <br>
            Treena: Also, sometimes he says he likes me and wants to date, but 
            other times he says he isnt sure.<br>
            Joe: Ok. </p>
          <p>Klaknak responds: If you want to date, tell him you want to date. 
            If he starts mumbling about his stubbornness or his problems with 
            his life script, leave the idiot to wallow in his own spineless goo. 
            Jesus Christ. What has happened to people? </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Example 3</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p> Fifi: I think we need to talk about our relationship? <br>
            Joe: What about our relationship?<br>
            Fifi: I think we just need to talk about it. It's good to talk about 
            these things? <br>
            Joe: But what exactly do you want to talk about? <br>
            Fifi: Don't get all defensive. <br>
            Joe: You know, I am really fucking sick of these relationship talks. 
          </p>
          <p>Klaknak responds: Some of you out there may be saying, "Ah, Klaknak 
            is such a typical guy. Why is he scared of communication." My answer 
            is: If I am going to communicate, I want to communicate about SOMETHING. 
            I dont want to communicate just for the sake of communicating. If 
            you are so insecure about your relationship that you feel you must 
            have weekly affirmations of communication, I dont want to have anything 
            to do with your whining ass (and you can quote me!). If you have a 
            problem with me, talk to me about it. I can take it. But if you just 
            want to fill your Oprah quota, you can go find one of those millions 
            of available pansy men who are too pussy whipped by Cosmo magazine 
            to call bullshit when they see it. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Example 4 </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Gretchen: I think I want to divorce my husband. <br>
            Joe: Why? <br>
            Gretchen: I think marriage is a trap. <br>
            Joe: uhhhh ... </p>
          <p>Klaknak responds: Who is really talking here? You or Gloria Steinem? 
            This is really an interesting case. Gretchen was being so absurd, 
            that I urged her strongly (over her strong protestations) to see a 
            marriage counselor. As it turned out (not surprisingly), there were 
            other, more meaningful issues that were harming the marriage. But 
            when she said this, she really meant it and she was really ready to 
            end the marriage because she thought marriage was a trap. Bah! Bah!, 
            I tells ya! </p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>So here are my final thoughts. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Here, I present, the Klaknak's Guide to Dating: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>1. When you start feeling anxious about the relationship, don't hide 
            underneath psychological mumbo jumbo. Communicate IN YOUR OWN WORDS 
            what is going on. </p>
          <p>2. If some guy/girl can't decide whether or not he/she wants to date 
            you because they are dealing with some Oprah issues, RUN LIKE YOUR 
            LIFE DEPENDS ON IT .. because it does. </p>
          <p>3. I don't know about you, but when I fall in love with someone, 
            I fall in love. If, in the first months, I am getting in touch with 
            my inner child and discussing issues like "communication strategies," 
            I need to SERIOUSLY reconsider whether I am dating this person because 
            I really like them or I am dating them because I am bored / lonely 
            / horny / full-of-self-loathing. </p>
          <p>4. If you and your mate fight all the time, but have good sex, consider 
            this: Sex is very pleasurable. Even sex with someone you hate can 
            be a lot of fun. So, if you are fighting except when having sex, guess 
            what is going to happen when you stop having sex? You are going to 
            be fighting all the goddamn time. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Bah. I have very strong opinions on this stuff. I am sure many people 
          will disagree, but remember .. I am always right :). </p>
        <p>Next on tap: The Klaknak's Test of Partnership: "If everyone in the 
          world was single and available, would I be dating this person?</p>
        <p> Coming soon to websites near you. </p>
