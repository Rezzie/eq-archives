  <p align="center">Lock me up for my own protection - by Tallisker Oban, mage 
    of the 31st circle, Tribunal, White Wolf Clan</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I was in my 27th season in my career as a magician, and was 
    feeling quite proud in my flashy new Robe of the Elements. Having finished 
    my business with Joyce in the Temple of Solusek Ro, I thought I would check 
    out Najeena. </p>
  <p align="left">I ran into a monk friend inside and we proceeded to kill tentacle 
    terrors for awhile. This was pretty easy, so we decided to go deeper. Being 
    unfamiliar with the dungeon, I followed the monk, who led us right into a 
    pitfall down to the basement. Well, surprise surprise, as soon as I hit the 
    floor in the basement a named ogre guard started pounding the pudding out 
    of my skinny Erudite butt. In a panic, I started to run, but was dead before 
    I had gone far. It was late, and I was bound far away, so I decided to log 
    and get my corpse the next day. </p>
  <p align="left">The next day I got a map of Najeena and logged on. The monk 
    had already retrieved his corpse using feign death, but he had died several 
    times in the process. But I had nothing to worry about -- invisibility and 
    summon corpse! So I disappeared and went down to find my corpse. Uh oh, where 
    the heck is it? I don't see it anywhere. Wait a minute, what is that speck 
    of red I see inside that door? It looks sort of like a jail cell. Ah, there 
    is my body! How did it get in there? Oh well, I'll go in and get it. </p>
  <p align="left">Hey!! The door is locked!!??! Ok, I'll summon it. <your corpse is too far away to summon> 
    Oh oh. . . . Ok, this was a bug, if that door is locked there is no way I 
    could have run in there last night -- I will petition. But then the monk figured 
    it out -- the mobs inside the cell opened the door to come out and kill me 
    when I fell into the basement, and in my panic and confusion I ran through 
    the open doorway right INTO the jail cell. Well, then the fun really began. 
    I borrowed keys from everyone who had any, but none of them fit. I died once 
    or twice when my invisibility wore off in a bad place, and got a good ribbing 
    from my guildmate when he saw 2 of my corpses in the zone. My rogue friend 
    ran all the way from Everfrost to pick the lock, but it didn't work. Eventually 
    7 people had come to my aid, and we were able to kill the mob who had the 
    key to the mob who had the key to . . . and so on, until I finally got the 
    right key.</p>
