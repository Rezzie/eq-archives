  <p align="center">A Passion for Incompetence - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I have played computer games for damn near my entire life. So 
    has my beloved brother The Gun Wielding Klaknak. In many ways, our different 
    tastes in games have summed up our differences in personalities. I have always 
    gone for RPGs and he has always gone for blowing shit up. </p>
  <p align="left">Recently, however, thanks to a little game called System Shock 
    2 I have become enamored with first person shooters. I played System Shock 
    2 (my favorite game from last year) until I was nearly dead from fright and 
    adrenaline. System Shock 2 was such a great game, I went through a several 
    month period where I bought several games and couldn't play any of them. I 
    wanted System Shock 3 and I wanted it right then. </p>
  <p align="left">Finally, about a month ago, I broke down and bought Unreal Tournament 
    for myself and for my brother. I also bought a little known title called Half-Life.</p>
  <p align="left"> First, I tried Unreal Tournament. Needless to say, I was extremely 
    bad. </p>
  <p align="left">While I was playing System Shock 2 and reading various people 
    talk on various message boards, I decided that most single-player player styles 
    can be broken down into two distinct groups: </p>
  <p align="left">1. Rabid, hard core gamers who run and shoot until everything 
    is dead. </p>
  <p align="left">2. Methodical plodders who savor every bullet as if they only 
    have one for the entire game.</p>
  <p align="left"> I most definitely fall into the latter group. In System Shock 
    2 (and especially in Half-Life) I was always at my limit for ammo. I hardly 
    EVER used ammo. I methodically and, I think, skillfully walked through each 
    level and did the bare minimum to make my way through. My favorite weapon 
    by far was the crowbar (it was a crowbar, right?). Even in Half-Life, I tried 
    whenever I could to sneak up on unsuspecting grunts and bash their brains 
    in with the crowbar instead of using any precious ammunition. </p>
  <p align="left">But when I started playing Unreal Tournament, I had to . ahem 
    . change my approach. I was astonished . nay, I was aghast that ammunition 
    and weapons were so plentiful.</p>
  <p align="left"> What kind of freaking game is this, I thought. Where is the 
    skill? You basically have an unlimited amount of weapons and an open arena. 
    Who couldn't win this game? </p>
  <p align="left">Oh boy. </p>
  <p align="left">Last night I played my very first multiplayer first person shooter. 
    I was so extremely bad, I almost broke down into tears. No matter what map 
    I chose, I was quickly and mercilessly eliminated by every single person on 
    the map. </p>
  <p align="left">I mean, man. Listen to me for a second. Let this seep into your 
    mind and bones for the full effect: I WAS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY BAD. </p>
  <p align="left">My first impression was to simply dismiss this multiplayer madness 
    as some sort of mindless crap for adrenaline idiots, but underneath the plastic 
    exterior of my ego-saving persona, I realized that I was just shit bad and 
    I needed to get my act together if I ever hoped to beat even the whoriest 
    of bad players out there. </p>
  <p align="left">So what do I plan on doing?</p>
  <p align="left"> Fix some chili. </p>
  <p align="left">What does this have to do with Unreal Tournament? Absolutely 
    nothing.</p>
