        <p>(to the tune of Hotel California) </p>
        <p>On a West Commons highway, Cool buffs in my hair, <br>
          Warm smell of some griffons,rising up through the air. </p>
        <p>Saw a wisp in the distance,Ball of shimmering light, <br>
          My sword was strong, but my sight was dim, <br>
          Twas a most risky fight.</p>
        <p> There she stood at the tool-booth, <br>
          slowly castin spells,<br>
          I wuz thinkin to myself, <br>
          A lightstone to sell would be swell. <br>
          Then she lit up a sentry, and she kited away <br>
          there were newbies down the corridor,<br>
          thought i heard them say... </p>
        <p>Welcoming you to the Character Select Screen, <br>
          You can pick a race (you can pick a race), <br>
          and then choose a face. <br>
          Dumping you out to the Character Select Screen, <br>
          any time of year (any time of year), <br>
          You will lag to here. </p>
        <p>Her account is from E-bay, Name is Mercedes Benz. <br>
          She got a lotta twinked up elves, She calls friends.<br>
          As they group in the Courtyard, Sweet summer sweat,<br>
          Some train to the zone line, some tend to forget.<br>
          Some shout 'Will you twink me', some just like to whine.<br>
          They say, kiting was once so much fun, now it is borderline...</p>
        <p> And still those newbies are calling from far away, <br>
          Lag spike in the middle of a fight,<br>
          Loading, Please wait. </p>
        <p>Welcoming you to the Character Select Screen, <br>
          You can pick a race (you can pick a race),<br>
          and then choose a face.<br>
          Dumping you out to the Character Select Screen, <br>
          When you try to loot (when you try to loot) <br>
          You will get the boot...</p>
        <p> Mobs bash through the ceiling, <br>
          Lag costs you the fight,<br>
          Its never Verants fault, <br>
          Cos Bradley's always right. <br>
          In Sony's chambers, they gather for the feast, <br>
          Stabbing with our steely knives, until they nerf the beast.</p>
        <p> Last thing i remember, I was zoning to Kith'cor,<br>
          had to find a passage back the the place i died before. <br>
          Relax said the GM, we are programmed to appease,<br>
          you can log out any time you like, <br>
          but help you'll not receive... </p>
