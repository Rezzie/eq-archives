  <p>Are Computer Games Art?</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">After playing System Shock 2 for a few hours, this question 
    immediately leapt to mind. I offer a few thoughts on the subject</p>
  <div align="left"></div>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Before I can answer the question, &quot;Are computer games art?&quot; 
    I should first define what art is. </p>
  <p align="left">I have no idea.</p>
  <p align="left">This is such an impossibly difficult term to define that I would 
    hazard to say it defies definition. However, I kinda like what my dictionary 
    has to say and I will stick with that for now:</p>
  <p align="left">Art: &quot;The conscious use of skill and creative imagination.&quot;</p>
</div>
<p align="left">I think the best way to talk about gaming as an art is to examine 
  how film shook up the critical community when it came about. Film was a difficult 
  media to define also because it contained many elements familiar to the painting 
  community (mise en scene, etc.) but it also contained strong narrative influences 
  more familiar to the literary community.</p>
<p align="left">Some critics went as far as to suggest an auteur theory of film, 
  which was a fairly interesting, somewhat successful attempt to compare the director 
  of a film with the author of a book while at the same time, many of the more 
  experimental films were being shown in art galleries as a new kind of visual 
  arts exhibit.</p>
<p align="left">Eventually, of course, film developed its own critical language 
  that combined features from both camps. Looking at the history of film criticism 
  is not unlike watching the development of a child into adulthood. Early on, 
  film criticism was dominated heavily by the criticism of its parents (visual 
  art and literature) until, after a great deal of turmoil (the auteur movement), 
  film finally came into its own, sloughing off some lessons from its parents 
  while keeping others.</p>
<p align="left">If you are wondering why I am giving you a brief summary of film 
  criticism, let me tell you that there is method to my madness. In several recent 
  gaming articles both online and in print, editors have drawn a link between 
  film and games and I think they are right. In many ways, games achieve the holy 
  grail of films, total immersion, by actually planting the user in the game ... 
  something a film could never do. </p>
<p align="left">But aside from that key difference, many games share a common 
  bond with film. Games often have at least a semblance of a narrative and there 
  is also a very conscious emphasis on the quality of the game's visual art. </p>
<p align="left">But the question you have to ask, especially when playing games 
  like Carmaggedon or Tomb Raider, is whether the game itself is a work of art 
  or whether it simply contains works of art. I don't think there is a simple 
  answer to this question. I would say, however, that just as the film community 
  is dominated by films that are not art, so it is with games. To deny the art 
  of some games doesn't gainsay the whole. I honestly do think some games, in 
  their entirety, should be considered works of art.</p>
<p align="left">What games should be considered art? That's hard to say. I will 
  make up a list tho:</p>
<p align="left">1. Myst - I absolutely hated this game, but I have to give props 
  to its art. There were times that I was in absolute awe of the quiet, yet beautiful 
  craftsmanship of the game. </p>
<p align="left">2. the Final Fantasy games - I have many problems with the linear 
  nature of these games and I hate the big headed characters, but this was one 
  of the few games where I actually became a little upset when one of the main 
  characters died. Does that make it art? I dunno, but I think it does for me.</p>
<p align="left">3. System Shock 1 and 2 - Rock on, man. What an extraordinarily 
  beautiful but visceral game. If psychologically violent films like Coppola's 
  The Conversation are art, it is hard to dismiss the System Shock series as mere 
  games.</p>
There is oh so much more I would like to say, but this will serve as a good introduction 
I think. I am interested in hearing what you guys have to say.
