  <p>AAA - by Tulluian</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I had just hit level 5 with my Halfling Rogue when it occured 
    to me that I'm rather bored of the Misty Thicket. Having never been to Qeynos, 
    I decided that it would be fun to go there. It just so happened that I ran 
    into a friendly wood elf ranger who wanted to get there as well. Unfortunately, 
    neither of us knew the way, so we hired a Halfling guild for 1 pp. The elf 
    payed for the both of us. Our guide told us to put all our stuff in the bank, 
    which we did.</p>
  <p align="left">So we set off to Qeynos, zoned to Kithicor, and were slain by 
    some orcs. "No Problem", our guide told us. We set off to Kithicor again, 
    only to be slain by the same orcs. It didn't occur to us that we should wait 
    until the orcs leave before heading out, so we got killed by the orcs a third 
    time. Finally, some nice person killed them and we set out to Qeynos. We followed 
    our guide to Highpass, but unfortunately we were traveling at midnight. Anyone 
    who knows Kithicor will know that it is always dark, especially at night, 
    and we were traveling without a light source. We got seperated from our guide 
    and ran straight into an orc camp. Much to our dismay, our guide didn't realize 
    this until he had reached Highpass. We lost another 20 minutes trying to find 
    each other. Finally, we made it to Highpass.</p>
  <p align="left">"This should be an easy walk", our guide told us. Apparently, 
    he wasn't aware of the orcs that lived there. BOOM! BANG! SMASH! CRUSH! RRRIP!!! 
    LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... We retraced our steps to Highpass, this time sneaked 
    passed the orcs, and finally made it to some sort of building. Our guide went 
    in, and was slain by the prisoners in the basement of the prison in Highpass. 
    It was then that I started doubting his ablities as a guide. To make matters 
    worse, the elf went linkdead. Another 20 minutes went by, and finally he made 
    it to the pass and the elf logged back on. We proceeded to get killed by the 
    gnolls on the other end of Highpass. The elf went linkdead again, this time 
    for good. We waited for him for half an hour, then kept going. We were killed 
    by the orcs again, came back, killed by gnolls, came back, both went linkdead 
    at the same time, logged on, found we were dead, wished we had never been 
    born, came back, got lost and killed, came back...</p>
  <p align="left">To make a long story short (Too Late!), we finally made it through 
    the @$^#*&! hole after an hour or so, and came upon a group of travelers who 
    escourted us to Qeynos. We made it to Qeynos hills, and I could already feel 
    Qeynos nearby. Ah, Qeynos, at last I made it... Hey, who's Varsoon? RRRIIIPPP, 
    ROOAR, CRACK, SCREAM... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... AAAAAAARG!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  <p align="left">I appeared in Rivervale.</p>
  <p align="left">I left the game for a week, then came back after experiencing 
    some withdrawl simptoms (like saying "forward-slash smile" instead of actually 
    smiling in RL), and surprisingly enough found a party to lead me to Qeynos. 
    It was simply fantastic. I was stunned and awed by the beauty and colors of 
    the human city, how they were so different from Rivervale... I hailed a guard. 
    He answered me! All the deputies in Rivervale were deaf-mutes (except when 
    saying time to die a [insert monster name here])! Every NPC I hailed answered 
    me! I hailed Nerissa Clothespinner. She told me about [rumors] of corruption 
    and how she wished her [sister] was here. Intrigued, I began typing: W... 
    h... a... Huh? Why are you atta... KICK! BASH! SMASH! SHRED! LOADING, PLEASE 
    WAIT... I appeared in Rivervale.</p>
