      <p align="left">I have seen NO response of ANY sort by Verant to either 
        our walkout or protestations, emails, posts, etc. Nothing. NADA! </p>
      <p align="left">What the hell is up with that?!!! We stopped being quiet 
        and they still ignored us! </p>
      <p align="left">I have been looking at this situation from MANY different 
        boards and I have read many, many posts. Many were very well written, 
        well thought out commentaries on both our position and our lack of respect. 
        Does this mean nothing to Verant? I understand that this is their game 
        and we are paying them for the privelege of playing it, but at what point 
        do we get a say in it? We LIVE in this world vicariously. We make friends, 
        fight and (often enough) die in this world. their coding decisions are 
        just decisions to them but to us, they literally ARE the difference between 
        life and death, happiness and sadness. I mean, don't we even get a bill 
        of (in game) rights?</p>
      <p align="left"> If so, I challenge those of you out there of this bent 
        of mind to create one that we can submit to Verant. We can't let this 
        stop here. We need to assert our rights! For without us, they have no 
        game! They need us just as much as we need them, that alone should give 
        us rights. More rights than their license alone grants us. What say you 
        all? </p>

      <p align="left">It is obvious that one of Verant's worst customer relations 
        problems is with its GMs and Guides. Let me offer a simple solution that 
        would alleviate this problem and give the players a greater say in the 
        evolution of this game. In cases of disputes involving game play situations 
        such as kill stealing, harassment, naming, illegal looting and such let 
        the concerned parties have the option of either accepting the GM or Guides 
        decision in the matter or taking it to a jury of their peers. </p>
      <p align="left">This jury should be selected from a group of players of 
        every level on the server, providing of course they are not connected 
        to the players involved either through guild membership or immediate grouping. 
        As in a normal judicial procedure give each play the right to exclude 
        two members of the perspective jury and then let them present their case 
        before them with the GM acting as judge and or prosecutor. Then allow 
        the jury to decide and in consultation with the GM arrive at a punishment 
        providing guilt is established. In this way much of the arbitrariness 
        of GM decisions would be removed, players would be give new input into 
        the workings of this game, and a very real problem would be solved. Moreover, 
        a greater sense of fairness would be added to the administration of the 
        game and some of the distance between the players and staff would be removed. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">To expedite matters a time limit could be placed upon the 
        procedings and appeal could be made the the Senior GMs in case the players 
        involved felt they were unfairly treated. This, of course would not apply 
        to technical issues such as overt hacking and other forms of electronic 
        cheating except in cases where the player felt that they were unfairly 
        accused of such actions and then a form of grand jury could be convened 
        to determine if there was resonable cause act upon this matter, and if 
        there were turn it over to the staff at Verant for a final disposition.</p>
