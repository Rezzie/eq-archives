  <p><font size="4">The AllaKhazam Interview</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">For those of you who do not know, AllaKhazam's website is the 
    best Everquest resource on the internet. Sure, I am now his affiliate, but 
    if you run back to the old days of the Klaknak, you will notice in the links 
    section that I made a similar claim.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, for the first time ever, the Cackling Klaknak presents 
    the interview section. We are proud to invite AllaKhazam as our first guest.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"><img src="sg_sunshine.jpg" width="230" height="180">AllaKhazam 
    at his Martha's Vineyard retreat</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The Klaknak: When I first started playing EQ, I turned to 
    the Vault and Stratics sites because I had used them when I played UO. Then 
    I found your site and was immediately hooked. How did your site get started 
    and why is it so great?</b></p>
  <p align="left">AllaKhazam: I'll start with the second part. The answer is simple. 
    Subliminal advertising. When you log onto my site there is a picture of a 
    naked woman that appears so quickly you don't realize you're seeing it. Subconsciously, 
    you want to come back again and again. Keep logging off and on to my site 
    a couple thousand times and you might see her. Go ahead ... keep trying. Hehe.</p>
  <p align="left">As for how it got started, I found myself sitting at work bored 
    to tears and decided to try my hand at web page design. I was already totally 
    addicted to Everquest from beta, so I figured I'd write up a player's guide 
    and post it somewhere. People liked it and made suggestions for additions 
    and then made more suggestions and sent in more information, and so on and 
    so on. Next thing I knew I had this massive site. It amazes me as well.</p>
  <p align="left"> <b>How long have you been playing EQ?</b> </p>
  <p align="left">14 days, 16 hours and 9 minutes.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Who are some of your characters?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Oh no. AllaKhazam already gets plenty of tells without giving 
    away the names of my other characters. I enjoy hearing from people, but also 
    enjoy the fact that I can play the other characters completely anonymously. 
    AllaKhazam is a level 17 wizard on the Povar server.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>What is the best character to play in EQ? And dont give me 
    any of that "it depends on who you are" crap. Really. What is the best character 
    to play. Take a stand.</b></p>
  <p align="left">This one's easy. Hands down without a doubt the best character 
    to play is Aradune. Specially tailored stats, spells, armor and weapons. Able 
    to leap tall buildings, etc. You get the picture. If I had to pick any one 
    character to play, that would definitely be my choice.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>How has Everquest wrecked your real life?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Well my wife has threatened to strap a keyboard to her chest 
    to get me to pay more attention to her. Then again, she does get to use the 
    remote control more nowadays, because I watch a lot less television. I also 
    get a lot less sleep than I used to.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Which EQ women are sexier ... the high elves or the wood 
    elves?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Well of course they're mostly guys in women's clothing, so sexy 
    probably isn't the term I would use. But I personally love the dark elves 
    in the bikinis.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>What is the single most annoying aspect of EQ?</b></p>
  <p align="left">I'd have to pick the boat rides. What were they thinking when 
    they decided it would be fun to make people sit and stare at their screen 
    for 20 minutes with absolutely nothing to do just to get to another continent? 
    The guy in charge of the boats must have been doing crack or something.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Quick. What are the five best computer games of all time?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Number one would have to be Pong. Simple, elegant, compelling. 
    Actually, my favorite is probably Civilization, which is second only to Everquest 
    in addictive qualities. I also spent a lot of my pre-Everquest days playing 
    The Realm and Mordor 2. Is that 5? Close enough.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Someone once said: "It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock 
    a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky." Is this true?</b></p>
  <p align="left">More honest words have never been spoken.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Do you powergame? Why? Why not?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Well I'm playing a level 17 wizard that I started the day the 
    game came out. So you can guess at that one. I like to level and get nice 
    items much like everyone else, but I like to roam around and see different 
    things. I went from Erudin to Freeport at level 8, long before there were 
    people camping in Highpass to make the trip easy. I've been in almost every 
    zone now, except the really high level ones. And I like to do all the stupid, 
    worthless quests. Why? I don't know. Must be some character flaw.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Do you twink? Why? Why? Why not?</b></p>
  <p align="left">I don't know. I never looked.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Who is more irritating? Spamming k3wlDooDs selling Derv rings 
    or hardcore roleplayers?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Definitely spamming hardcore roleplayers selling derv rings. 
    "Doth hast a magical ring whych will maketh thee faster and more agyle which 
    I majestically slyced from the finger of a vile fiend." Whew.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Who will win the 2000 presidential race?</b> Antonius Bayle</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Why is the Cackling Klaknak such a great site?</b></p>
  <p align="left">Three words: location, location, location. </p>
