  <p align="center">Shadowed Man</p>
  <p align="center"> by Dathon, a.k.a. Leata Amberthorn, 21st Warrior of the Vale, 
    Brell Serilis Server</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">After tanking a shadowed man at the Nektulos spawn, my poor 
    Warrior had to sit and wait until nearly all her hit points slowly regen'ed. 
    (A Necro was the sole partner in the group.) As such, we were very bored, 
    and as a result of boredom-induced delirium, I came up with this parody of 
    my favorite musician/singer, Billy Joel. Hope you like it...</p>
  <p align="left">(sung to the tune of Billy Joel's "Piano Man")</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">/time...</p>
  <p align="left">It's nine o'clock on a Saturday<br>
    The Nektulos camp is set. <br>
    There's a Necromancer standing next to me,<br>
    Busy summoning his skeleton pet.</p>
  <p align="left">He says, 'd00d, do u know what will spawn here?'<br>
    'And what kind of loot it will drop?' <br>
    'Is it no-rent or lore?'<br>
    'Cause that's really a chore'<br>
    'U can't make much plat off of that!'</p>
  <p align="left">Hey can you spawn, you're a shadowed man. <br>
    Hey can you spawn tonight?<br>
    For we're all in the mood for experience, <br>
    And might make a level tonight.</p>
  <p align="left">Now Johan the Bard is a friend of mine<br>
    who gives me my buffs mana-free. <br>
    And he's quick with his drum, <br>
    or to go invis some,<br>
    but there's some zone that he'd rather be.</p>
  <p align="left">He says, 'I know that this MOB will just kill me!'<br>
    'And if I turn to run, they'll give chase!'<br>
    'Well, I'm certain that they will con red to me,' <br>
    'And I can't kite them out of this place.'</p>
  <p align="left">Hey can you spawn, you're a shadowed man.<br>
    Hey can you spawn tonight? <br>
    For we're all in the mood for experience,<br>
    And might make a level tonight.</p>
  <p align="left">Now Zarak is a Shadow Knight newbie,<br>
    Who never has time for a quest. <br>
    And he's talking with Dariyor,<br>
    The Level 20 Warrior, <br>
    Who nearly lost his whole life. <br>
    And the Ranger is practicing Fletching, <br>
    While the Ogre finds a spot with an itch. <br>
    Yes they're sharing a camp that's quite dangerous, <br>
    And dying is really a bitch.</p>
  <p align="left">Hey can you spawn, you're a shadowed man.<br>
    Hey can you spawn tonight?<br>
    For we're all in the mood for experience, <br>
    And might make a level tonight.</p>
  <p align="left">It's a pretty good group for a Saturday <br>
    And the group leader emotes a smile. <br>
    Cause off the corpse he just found<br>
    Is the item he's been looking for all around, <br>
    Though his quest isn't done by a mile. </p>
  <p align="left">And the spells sound like a carnival,<br>
    And everyone takes a swig of short beer,<br>
    And they sit at the spawn and stay there past dawn, <br>
    Wondering, 'd00d, what am i doing here?'</p>
  <p align="left">Hey can you spawn, you're a shadowed man.<br>
    Hey can you spawn tonight?<br>
    For we're all in the mood for experience, <br>
    And might make a level tonight. </p>
