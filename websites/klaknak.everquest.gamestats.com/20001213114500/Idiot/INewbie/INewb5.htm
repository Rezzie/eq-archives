  <hr>
  <p align="left"> All my life I played a Cleric in computer games and paper and 
    pencil. So I purchase this game Everquest. And think, Lets make my Cleric! 
    Human!! So I make "Bob" the Cleric. pad his STR and a little bit in WIsdom. 
    (Notice no discussion about tutorials or book/manual reading)</p>
  <p align="left">Start in freeport...walking around. (walking) Fall in a little 
    pond and almost crap my pants! O NO! I move around some more and my swimming 
    skill goes up! YEAH! Figured out how to equip my Club...and see a guard. Cool, 
    he is alone! Lets see how well I do, I mean, MAN, I put so much into my STr, 
    I should be able to take him!</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">Wow, that sucked, ok, now where am I?.....move around city, 
    find docks, move around some more... Find this cool looking Priest dude. WOW! 
    I bet he is part of my guild. (Priest of Discord) So I talk to him. He asks 
    for a book, WHICH I HAVE! cool. Give him book. Nothing in return. What the 
    text say? O who cares. End up killing lots of rats and bats and make level 
    2! Wow, this is easy. But wait? How do I make money? I'm running out of food 
    and water? and what level do I get spells? I hope Clerics can actually heal 
    and such. Still no money, running out of food and water, I zone to east commons.</p>
  <p align="left">Run up a bit and see this little ball of light. A wisp? Cool, 
    lemme try that. INVULNERABLE? O NO Someone runs by stops and says, "don't 
    run, just die." Yeah fun game.</p>
  <p align="left"> LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">So I finally get into a group. and someone teaches me how to 
    use spells. We get into a fight, and I start healing them...NO EFFECT! They 
    die. Talk about some nasty messages. I disband saying "I tried, I swear!" 
    Made it to level 4 before I realized 1. Loot what you kill to make money 2. 
    I am PvP+ and can't cast spells on everyone in game except other (very rare) 
    PvP+ PC's</p>
  <p align="left">Arg.</p>
  <p align="left">Delete this guy, and start over, 3 weeks later. I am now a level 
    29 Cleric, Human. And Officer of a top guild on the Innoruuk server. heh, 
    the learning curve of this game is amazing!</p>
