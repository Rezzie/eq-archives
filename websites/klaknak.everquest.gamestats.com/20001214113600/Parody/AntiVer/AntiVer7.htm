  <p>Peregrine Interviews the EQ Banker</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> To better serve the fine people of Norrath, I arranged for 
    a private interview with Bungle Holefiller, Assistant Deputy Chief Manager 
    of Operations for the Bank of Ak'Anon. I thought it would be a good way to 
    get to know the people behind the counter and clear up some mysteries and 
    rumors about the way banking works on EQ.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: Sorry to interrupt your busy schedule. But I have 
    to ask, with all those clockwork bankers out front to deal with the public, 
    what do you and your staff do all day?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: Well, we fill countless ledger books with doodles, take 
    long lunches, and make play-forts out of platinum pieces, mostly.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: Err, okay. So, is it hard keeping track of the money 
    and items of people from all over Norrath? I know my question is, how do you 
    sort out whose money is who's?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: We don't, normally. Just take it out back and throw 
    it on the pile. Then when people want to make withdrawals, we just summon 
    some more up at the counter.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: *blinks in disbelief* Are you saying that you can 
    magically summon coins? You don't bother actually using all the coins you 
    have?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: Oh, yes, been doing it for years, my boy. Came down 
    from the top, part of the Player-Based Economy. The lads in that part of the 
    office have a saying, "Spend all you want, we'll make more!" Works out pretty 
    well, really.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: And how do you store all the items? The bank doesn't 
    seem big enough to hold all the lockers and drawers it must take for that.</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: Well, it isn't. We use a big summoned dimensional pocket, 
    that takes care of most of the items. Some of the lighter stuff we just throw 
    away.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: A summoned pocket? What if, umm, the summoner logs 
    off?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: Oh-ho! We'd be busy then, wouldn't we! Never happened 
    before, guess we'd have to blame a bug. Good thing is, no matter what happens 
    to the stuff we hold, if it's lost, we blame a bug. Let the GMs take care 
    of all that mess!</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: It doesn't sound like a very good way to run a business. 
    So the items just sit in the pocket until the person needs them?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: *lights a large, expensive cigar* Well, no. They're 
    usually on loan. To our clients. </p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: On loan? *greedy look in his eye* Can you...erm...loan 
    me some rubicite then?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: *laughs* No, no, no! Not to you, our other clients. 
    You know, the orcs, goblins, lizard men, what have you.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: Why would you give them items? Aren't they our enemies?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: You have to understand, son, that there aren't that 
    many magic swords and pieces of armor in the world. Have to do a little recycling, 
    you know. You put a runed totem staff in the bank, after a few days it goes 
    out to the gnolls in Paw, and eventually it will end up back here! Hell, if 
    it weren't for us, there'd be nothing for you heroes to fight! You wouldn't 
    believe how much it costs us a month to keep the orcs and minotaurs in business.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: So you're saying that you, the banks, control the 
    monsters we fight? If it weren't for you, the world would be peaceful now?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: Sure. But peace is boring, we'd have warriors brawling 
    in the streets, wizards holding up vendors, dynamic quests being run all the 
    time, what confusion! Better this way. The way it has always been. The great 
    circle, we call it. You wouldn't be, ah, causing any trouble for us after 
    this, would you?</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: No, of course not! I wouldn't...I mean, who would 
    believe it?</p>
  <p align="left">Bungle: *opens his ledger book and reveals a Doodle of Power, 
    putting it in front of Peregrine's face* There's nothing unusual going on 
    here, son. Just your friendly neighborhood bank, doing normal business. You 
    go tell that to all the good folks.</p>
  <p align="left">Peregrine: *a glazed look in his eyes* Of course. Nothing going 
    on here but normal business.</p>
  <p align="left">In conclusion, friendly neighborhood bank. Everyone should come 
    and deposit all their possessions.</p>
  <p align="left">So, there you have it. My thanks to the busy folks at the bank 
    for letting me talk to Mr. Holefiller. It's quite a job keeping up with all 
    that money, but they have secure facilities just for that purpose. I say, 
    good for them! So remember, deposit all your possessions at your friendly 
    neighborhood bank. </p>
