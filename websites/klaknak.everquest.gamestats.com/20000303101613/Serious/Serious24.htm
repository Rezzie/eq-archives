  <p>GM Harrassment on Nameless? - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Several days ago Patrick sent me an email claiming GMs were 
    harrassing him. Here is the full story (or as much as I could get). I wouldn't 
    call this a news article, since I will add some commentary throughout, but 
    I am trying my level best to present both sides of the story as clearly as 
    possible. This will be an ongoing project and I hope that EQ fans will write 
    in with both their opinions and clarification on some of the issues I will 
    raise below. Yes, yes, this is an EQ humor site, but what the hell.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>The email.</b></p>
<p align="left">Several days ago, a player on the Nameless server sent an email 
  to me complaining that the GMs had harrassed him. At the center of the dispute 
  was his wife's character's name &quot;Euthanasia&quot;:<br>
</p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;My wife and I have been playing Everquest since 
  late summer. When a new server came online we crated [sic] new users and began 
  adventuring together. My wife likes Dark Elves, and created a cleric who is 
  a follower of Innorruuk. Lots of time went into selecting a name that would 
  best describe the character. She is of an evil race, and yet she is a healer. 
  </font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;She chose &quot;Euthanasia&quot;.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">She's an evil race. She's a cleric. Her role-playing 
  personna [sic] is to allow the weak to die as painlessly as possible, while 
  killing the weak (mobs).</font></p>
<p>If the author is to be believed, then, the two players have been playing with 
  these characters for some time. He then says:</p>
<p><font color="#990000">One unfortunate Friday in December, &quot;The Nameless&quot; 
  crashes. When the dust settles, Euthanasia's account is misspelled. She petitions 
  for the name to be changed back. Within an hour it is corrected.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I am not sure why the author included this except, perhaps, 
  to establish that Verant had &quot;seen&quot; the name before and hadn't removed 
  it then. I have not heard of any instance in which names were misspelled but 
  since I do not read all the EQ news all the time, I could definitely be wrong. 
  Any documented clarification on this would be helpful.</font></p>
<p>Patrick then talks about the event that led up to his email (I have edited 
  some of his email for clarity and brevity. The full text may be found <a href="Serious23.htm">here</a>.)</p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;A few days ago Euthanasia received harassing /tells 
  from Gremm, an unknown player who was many zones away. We had never heard of 
  him before. He began saying how he was going to challenge Euthanasia to a duel 
  and boast to anyone who would listen. It went on for an extended period of time. 
  My wife isn't into the &quot;dueling&quot; aspect of the game. She usually hangs 
  out in low-level dungeons healing random players she doesn't know. The Gremm 
  guy just wouldn't let up. When it became obvious to him that she was not going 
  ot ever duel him, he said he &quot;would get her name changed because he found 
  it offensive&quot;. He didn't mention that at all until the very end.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;Sure enough, a GM (Ezerah) told her a petition 
  had been filed on behalf of her name and she had to change it because ONE person 
  had complained. After a conference of different GM's on the issue, he stated 
  that she didn't have to worry about her name being changed. He also said that 
  he thought it was a good name for a dark elf.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;A few days later out of the blue Euthanasia gets 
  a /tell from a senior guide that her name is being changed because it is offensive. 
  Someone had petitioned (probably the same person, or a friend of his) about 
  the name. No clue who this person was, or why they did it. After trying to explain 
  what &quot;euthanasia&quot; means, her character is changed to &quot;Eutanasi&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;I checked two different web pages regarding the 
  official naming policy. The exact text of these two web pages is further down 
  this email. None of the eight rules listed in the naming policy were broken.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">&quot;I petitioned immediately to try to speak with an 
  actual VERANT GM. I received a reply from an apprentice guide, who halfway through 
  my petition decides that he doesn't want to do the job he volunteered for. No 
  resolution had been given on the issue, and I never got a response from him 
  regarding my petition. While I was trying to get an answer as to why he was 
  suddenly warning me about talking to him (after he asked me what he could do), 
  he says talking to him is suddenly considered &quot;abuse&quot;, then he disconnects 
  me. The complete transcript is at the bottom of this email. He suspended me 
  for giving him /tells while we were resolving a petition. He wouldn't answer 
  my question as to the status of the petiton he was responding to - he simply 
  kicked me off the server. He couldn't even tell me why the name &quot;Euthanasia&quot; 
  was offensive.</font></p>
<p>Here is the transcript of the log. As everyone knows, transcripts are easily 
  editable but this does not necessarily mean this one has been. I have removed 
  all material not related to the subject at hand.</p>

  was &quot;inappropriate&quot;'<br>

  days ago.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:11:15 1999] You told Mieko, 'it is not profanity, nor does it 
  stand for the Holocost.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:11:22 1999] You told Mieko, 'you know this as well as I'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:12:00 1999] Mieko tells you, 'I'm sorry sir. It goes against 
  guidelines.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:12:22 1999] You told Mieko, 'tell me how it goes against the 
  guidelines. In what way does it violate the rules?'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:12:44 1999] Mieko tells you, 'I was told you shuld read the website 
  under the section about offensive names, and also the agreement you agree to 
  everytime you log on.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:13:07 1999] You told Mieko, 'Specify how it is offensive and 
  violates the agreement.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:13:11 1999] You told Mieko, 'you cant'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:13:17 1999] You told Mieko, 'simle as that'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:13:41 1999] You told Mieko, 'you have absolutely no basis for 
  changing the name, other than some GM is bowing to a personal friends wishes.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:14:56 1999] Mieko tells you, 'This is not the case sir. And it 
  does remind me of the holocaust. I'm sorry.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:15:03 1999] You told Mieko, 'all I am asking for is one fact. 
  just one. Give me the reason.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:15:15 1999] Mieko tells you, 'It is offensive.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:15:22 1999] You told Mieko, 'Check webster's dictionary for the 
  definition then.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:15:38 1999] You told Mieko, 'no mention of holocost anywhere 
  in it. no senseless slaying, nothing.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:15:57 1999] You told Mieko, '&quot;slayer&quot; or &quot;bullet&quot; 
  would be offensive under the same guidelines'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:16:20 1999] You told Mieko, 'heck, &quot;arrow&quot; would be 
  a violation'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:17:22 1999] Mieko tells you, 'You will need to stop sending me 
  tells, because any further tells in this matter will be considered harrassment 
  and you will be given a warning.'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:17:57 1999] You told Mieko, 'I am looking at the naming convention 
  rules right now. no where in there, in any of the eight rules, can Euthanasia 
  even come close to being offensive. I wish to speak with a verant gm'<br>
  [Thu Dec 23 21:18:09 1999] Mieko tells you, 'You have now gotten your first

<p align="left">That ends the pertinent email text.</p>
<p align="left">I posted the email (without giving it as much thought as I should 
  have) and received several emails.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Some Guides Anonymously Respond.</b></p>
<p align="left">The first email was from a guide who claims to be familiar with 
  the facts. This person asked that I only summarize the comments and here are 
  some of what I consider to be the relevant facts:</p>
<p align="left">1. As far as this person knew, Ezerah never told Patrick his wife 
  had to change her name. This didn't come until later.</p>
<p align="left">2. Person X confirmed that the person who petitioned the name 
  was also the heckler.</p>
<p align="left">3. Person X confirmed that after the initial complaint, the GMs 
  decided not to force a change in name but that since then, the GMs had received 
  several complaints about the name. X did not say whether or not there had been 
  any complaints before.</p>
<p align="left">Another guide wrote in saying that someone had posted the link 
  to this site and that some of the GMs had been concerned about the last part 
  of the log while others, including the head GM, had doubted the veracity of 
  the log.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Players respond.</b></p>
<p align="left">Along with the guides, several people not related to the event 
  emailed from both sides of the issue: </p>
<p align="left">&quot;Well, I have been playing EQ for over a year now and I think 
  this article is an example of shear bullheadedness. The issue is no longer whether 
  or not the name is offensive but rather the conduct of a guide in this matter. 
  I have petitioned several times in my year of playing and have always had helpful 
  curtious GM's, who have actually helped me. I have also heard horror stories 
  about GM's acting like jerks to players that they are supposed to be helping 
  with game issues and bugs. I also understand that some people abuse GM's by 
  petitioning for inappropriate things. This being said, I am greatly disturbed 
  by the last 25% of the log. THe GM, refused to answer that one important question 
  about the petition...is it closed. Although the outcome would not have been 
  satisfactory, the situation still begs the question of why did the GM just say 
  it was a closed matter and take his complaints to Verant via email or phone. 
  It does worry me that guides can have people booted off EQ. I pay money to roleplay 
  just like everyone else. Even these volunteers should respect that EQ is a business 
  and that they are a form of customer service. Again, I personnaly have never 
  had any problems with Guides or GM's(even when i lost a BS tunic by dropping 
  it on the ground by accident...note: it was my problem for losing the tunic) 
  even though I may have felt dissatisfied with the outcome. I hope that Verant 
  as a company takes a herd look at the need for guides and the monitoring of 
  their activities.&quot; - Scott</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;I wanted to comment about the post regarding the GM harassment. 
  IMHO the gm/guide was in the wrong by forcing the name change but....the complainant 
  was offensive and rude to the guide and should have either A) Waited a bit and 
  calmed down before talking to guides/gms a bit more. B) Swallowed his anger 
  and tried to be nice even tho he was very upset, or C) should have just disconnected 
  to save both him and a GM a lot of trouble. He got out of line. He was kicked. 
  I was laughing at him at the end of the story because if he would have thought 
  before he spoke (typed) he would probably still be playing AND have his wife's 
  name back to what it was. Just a thought :/&quot; - Mareth</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Hello, I have just finished reading over the post of the 
  problem with the GMs on the server, The Nameless... I would like to state that 
  although I can not vouch for this instance, and since I don't keep logs, have 
  little proof except my husbands' word with my own, that this problem is not 
  just a one time deal. I personally thought her name was clever, but that is 
  beside the point. The main point of this response to the post is about the GM 
  behavior. Not only were they out of line, but it's happened to me. I don't know 
  if it is the "new breed" of GMs that are coming in almost daily now on the servers...that 
  they are being whipped through training or what, but they are becoming more 
  and more rude, and unable to answer simple queries and problems within the game.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;To me, the new GM is nothing more than a powergamer out 
  for the newest level of gaming... and that is simply WRONG! I agree, someday 
  I completely swear off EQ because it is so much stress at times... you have 
  these idiots running around powerleveling, ruining the game for everyone because 
  they simply don't obey any of the rules whatsoever.... IN fact, if the GM wants 
  to change her name, or ban her or her husband for any of this... boy do I have 
  a list of names for Verant!! Today alone while in Steamfont there were FIVE 
  players on that you could easily see what their last names would entail, all 
  leading to some sort of sexual act or part... and that to me is disgusting. 
  But, what is to be done about it?? Nothing.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;I had a problem with a harasser yesterday, I petitioned...they 
  were training the minotaur guards onto us repeatedly, our bodies were strewn 
  everywhere... to me it was an act of PVP, and they would shout their rude comments 
  across the zone each time we died, one included : "You shouldn't stick your 
  finger in your pee hole!" So I petitioned... a GM appeared, I complained of 
  the problem, and their rude behavior and comments, as did the other members 
  of my party.. so the GM came to our zone. After a brief discussion with the 
  group who was making the comments..she was gone, and they remained.. We were 
  quickly told that we should watch our backs now... so we camped. The game has 
  been ruined because of idiots like that, and because GMs either don't know how 
  to handle the situation, or are too afraid to.. or even worse, are best buds 
  with the idiotic individuals. Good people re leaving the game everyday because 
  of moronic individuals, be they GM or player. I am sorry that this couple had 
  such a difficult time, but believe me, it was not a rare occurrence.... what 
  I suggest is they write to Verant itself, and pressure them to Term that specific 
  GM. The GM program as of now is a volunteer thing, and if they throw out the 
  "customer" word into their complaint, I would hope that Verant would be smart 
  enough to pay attention a little to it. - Agreeing with the many voices..... 
  EQ is beginning to suck (Justin)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;I have to comment on this. What the guides did was just 
  plain wrong. That was unbeleiveable and Verant should be ashamed.&quot; - IMKRE8VE</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Hi, I am writing in response to the message you put up on 
  Jan. 5th regarding the person who got kicked because he was "harassing" a GM. 
  While I do agree with him that the GM should not have kicked him off because 
  they were still discussing the same issue, I disagree with him that his wife 
  had a valid name. I myself do not petition GMs to have others change their name, 
  (even though I see some stupid ones like Funnybob and Honeybuns) but it does, 
  IMHO, take a lot away from the game. The name that person's wife used, Euthanasia, 
  does fall under the Common Words category and that is technically illegal. In 
  the first place, that guy's wife should have reported that the guy challenging 
  her to a duel was harassing her.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Second, you never get anywhere insulting GMs and threatening 
  to stop playing over a name?!?. I mean come on, a rose by any other name... 
  Third, he was given three opportunities to stop telling this GM. Just stop and 
  re-petition the next day. or even better yet, call them up on the phone so you 
  can talk to someone live and explain your situation better. I am sure he is 
  not the first, and will not be the last, to have a GM tell you that you need 
  to change your name. One of the main things that I find takes away from the 
  game is the pettiness of the people playing. When a name means more then the 
  enjoyment of the game itself, then it is time to stop playing the game. On the 
  first night of the Lanys T'vyl server being up, there were over 130 people in 
  Nektulos at any given time. With that many people, it is inevitable that some 
  low level player would run into Skeletons (not decayed). these players would 
  run back to the newbie log and the Skeletons would commence laying waste to 
  all newbie players. People were get irate and extremely hostile because of this. 
  The way I saw it was that most of these people were level 3 and below, they 
  should expect to die, multiple times. That is what low level players do.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Also, many people were getting mad about Kill Stealing. 
  While KS'ing is generally frowned upon, there were over 130 people in the forest. 
  The moss snakes and black wolves were few and far between. (probably hiding 
  for their lives) I guess my point is that while highly addictive, EVERQUEST 
  IS ONLY A GAME (believe it or not). If you think the name you are making is 
  even slightly questionable, use the Name Generator. That is what it is there 
  for. I have had to petition the GMs a few times for different things and every 
  time they have been very helpful and friendly, even to a Dark Elf. :) This guy 
  sounds like one of those people who thinks everybody owes him something. IMHO, 
  he got his due. My 2 cents.&quot; - Aaeleaa </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;It does not suprise me at all that this has occured. As 
  a regular player on The Nameless and the Guild Leader of Decadent Few I have 
  witnessed not-stop harrassment and whining by the guide and admin staff of this 
  server. In the last two weeks I have seen daily login messages stating that 
  harrassment of guides will not be tolerated, in essence blaming the whole server 
  for a problem the main admin Hideki (sp?) cannot seem to handle. The guide and 
  admin staff on this server is extremely unresponsive and uncooperative to even 
  the simplest petition. They hand out form written answers to any question and 
  threaten to ban you if any question about a petition are asked at all. What 
  follows is a simple story (no log included) about one of my guild members and 
  his run in with one of these "customer service" representatives:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Tock was planning on playing in the South Karana area and 
  decided it would be prudent to seek a bind in the Arena area in case of death. 
  He /shouted (in lake rathe) at regular intervals for about 45 mins that he was 
  paying for a bind in the Arena. After getting no responses he decided an attempt 
  at humor was in order. Tock then shouted that he was paying 100pp for a bind 
  in the Arena. He immediately received several /tels from folks that were NOW 
  willing to bind him. For every tel he got he said "Welcome to my ignore list" 
  and put them on ignore. A few minutes later a guide pops in and gives him his 
  first warning saying that he is harrassing players. When Tock asks the guide 
  if lying is now against policy the guide gives him a second warning. Tock then 
  asks if the guide is going to respond to his question and is then given a third 
  warning and expelled.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;After this occurance I sent a tel to Hideki and asked him 
  if he could send me a tel if he had a free moment, as I had a question. Several 
  minutes later I received a tel from him saying "What do you want?". Pushing 
  on through his rudeness I asked if he had a moment to speak about his guides 
  and their liberal banning policy. Hideki told me "I will not tolerate the harrassing 
  of my guides. If you send me another tel it will be considered harrassment and 
  you will be expelled." I must express my absolution frustration with the communist 
  attitude of a staff that is suppose to be in place to help the player base. 
  Please add my name to the list of concerned players. Many thanks and good wishes&quot; 
  - Dan</p>

<p align="left"><b>Naming Policy</b></p>
<p align="left">In case you didn't know, here is the naming policy from EQ's official 
  site:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original, 
    high-fantasy names are desired. The following types of names are unacceptable:</p>
  <p>Vile, rude and obscene names including common swear words, anatomical references, 
    and deliberate misspellings and homonyms of these words.</p>
  <p>Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g., Hughjass, TugMcgroin).</p>
  <p>Names of religious or historical significance (e.g., Allah, Stalin).</p>
  <p>Non-fantasy names from popular media (e.g., Rambo, Darthvader).</p>
  <p>Common words, phrases, or sentences non-suitable for the environment (e.g., 
    Switchblade, Phaser, Ikillorcs).</p>
  <p>Proper names from EverQuest (e.g., Rathe, Karana).</p>
  <p>Popular and easily recognizable names from existing literature or media (e.g., 
    Merlin, Gandalf).</p>
  <p> Names containing built-in titles (e.g., Ladygray, Sirtallon). </p>
  <p>If you are found with an improper name you will be contacted in one of the 
    following ways: </p>
  <p>For category one offenses, the name will be changed immediately. A GM will 
    then contact you and offer an opportunity to choose an appropriate name. Player's 
    corpses rendered unlootable by this process are not eligible for reimbursement. 
  </p>
  <p>For category two through seven, you will be contacted and given the opportunity 
    to choose an appropriate name. In the event you cannot do so in a timely fashion, 
    a name will be chosen for you. The player is responsible for informing the 
    GM if their character has any unlooted corpses at the time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><b>Commentary</b></p>
<p align="left">This is a big mess but here is how I feel:</p>
<p align="left">1. I am still not sure who is harrassing who in the above log. 
  I am not so sure it is an online's guide responsibility to debate the offensive-ness 
  of a name online. I definitely get the impression that no answer the guide could 
  have given would have satisfied Patrick and he would have sent /tells until 
  the cows came home demanding satisfaction. If I was online at the time stuck 
  in a tree and petitioning a GM, I would be upset if I knew a contigent of them 
  were in conference debating the merits of a character's name.</p>
<p align="left">2. That being said, however, I personally have tried to address 
  some personal grievances of mine with Verant (off line) and have received HORRID 
  support ... um ... change that ... NO support. Even Ultima Online (the great 
  satan, IMHO) had the decency to send a form letter back. I have never received 
  a single email from Verant about issues I have raised with them. So, I can understand 
  Patrick's reluctance to rely on email in order to resolve the issue.</p>
<p align="left">3. I also think it is interesting to note the second Guide's response 
  above. If his or her account is true, none of the guides said Mieko acted appropriately. 
  Some said he acted inappropriately and others doubted the truthfulness of the 
  log. No one (according to the guide commenting above) actually said his conduct 
  was good. This may seem like a small and subtle point, but I think it is very 
  important. One of the guides who wrote me was pretty upset by this guide's conduct 
  so I don't think it is difficult to feel Patrick's pain especially if none of 
  the guides (according to my source) claim that the offending guide was acting 
  decently.</p>
<p align="left">4. Euthanasia. I will just say right off the bat that when I saw 
  the word Euthanasia, I cringed. I didn't cringe because the word is offensive 
  to me (it isn't) but because I already knew what the argument behind the removal 
  would be: The holocaust. Does anyone remember when UO changed Cabal to something 
  less offensive because of the &quot;outcry&quot; from concerned players (I was 
  never sure if the outcry was from one person or many)? I am not saying that 
  these words are not offensive to Jewish people but I have to question who out 
  there in the Jewish community is really offended by a dark elf named Euthanasia 
  in an Everquest game. Why aren't they offended by the entire pantheon of pagan 
  gods? Does anyone remember the old prophets railing against magic? I don't know, 
  I don't want to put my foot too far into my mouth, but from my point of view, 
  I think it is ridiculous to ban this name. Especially since I have grave doubts 
  over whether there really was anyone out there who was truly offended by it. 
</p>
<p align="left">5. I assume that no one complained about the name before the event 
  with the heckler, else the name would have already been changed (according to 
  Verant's policy and according to what happened to Patrick's wife here). Since 
  all the &quot;outcry&quot; arose after one person threatened to petition the 
  name, one really should question (and the GMs certainly should) whether or not 
  this name is truly offensive.</p>
<p align="left">6. It is interesting to note that the name the GMs chose for the 
  dark elf &quot;<font color="#990000">Eutanasi</font>&quot; sounds an awful lot 
  like Euthanasia. If this name was truly offensive, why merely change a few letters? 
  Why not just ask the person to completely change the name. Cosmetically changing 
  the name begs the question: If this name is truly offensive, why change it to 
  something that reminds people of the offensive word? Weird.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">As a final note, I should add that my interactions with guides 
  in EQ have been great. I rarely petition guides but when I do it is usually 
  because I am so angry, I can't even see straight. In spite of my ... ahem ... 
  less than civil attitude, all the guides I have spoken with have dealt with 
  my problem (and me) effectively and politely (damn them).</p>
<p align="left">This is not to say that there aren't a few bad apples out there, 
  tho, and I would like to see Verant establish a way we can police the GMs. I 
  would establish a database of GM harrassment logs on this site as an incentive 
  for guides to act responsibly, but at this time I don't think I can do it because 
  there is no way to establish whether or not the logs have been edited.</p>
<p align="left">And this is my final warning to all of you: Most of the info I 
  have received here has been either from anonymous sources (with no confirmation), 
  from angry emailers or from easily editable logs. Caveat emptor.</p>
