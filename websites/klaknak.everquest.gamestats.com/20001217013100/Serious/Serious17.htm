  <p>Bullshit Incorporated - Company Seminars</p>
  <p>by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I have a dear friend (I will call her &quot;Jen&quot;) whom 
    I email everyday. Three of our core topics is the ludicrosity (tm) of self-help 
    books, company management and BDSM. Thankfully for you, but regrettably for 
    me, I had to attend one of our company's annual &quot;seminars&quot; dealing 
    with workplace issues this morning and it pretty much covered all these bases. 
    As I sat squirming in my chair, I began taking notes. Not to learn, not to 
    listen to ... but to ridicule. So here we go.</p>
  <div align="left"></div>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The paradigm (tm) is simple. Let me draw it out for you.</p>
  <p align="left">1. Employees' morale is low because of shitty pay and unrealistic 
    work schedules.</p>
  <p align="left">2. The employer senses this and forms a committee.</p>
  <p align="left">3. The committee decides to hire a motivational speaker.</p>
  <p align="left">In a way, I felt sorry for the guy they called in today. In 
    case you don't know, I work for a company that is about 70% psychologists 
    and there is probably nothing scarier for a motivational speaker than for 
    him to offer up his half-assed, acronym filled ideas to a bunch of people 
    who do real psychology for a living. But offer he did, and boy was it pathetic.</p>
  <p align="left">First off, the name of the seminar was &quot;The Art of Practicing 
    Safe Stress&quot; and the speaker was &quot;psychohumorist&quot; (tm) (he 
    trademarked this, people, I am not making this up) Mark Gorkin.</p>
  <p align="left">After dispensing with the usual pleasantries, he began on the 
    same path that every wrongheaded motivational speaker uses to make money. 
    Here is the how-to guide for corporate motivational speakers.</p>
  <p align="left">1. First, talk about the problem. This gets people to agree 
    with you. If they agree with you on this, it makes it easier for you to cram 
    your bullshit acronyms down their throat later. Example from today: This guy 
    basically gets up there and says: &quot;Boy, I sure hate stress.&quot; and 
    then begins spewing Reader's Digest humorous anecdotes. Everyone snickers 
    and pounds coffee.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Second, talk about the problem &quot;clinically&quot;. All 
    you have to do is grab the ole DSM IV and list the signs of the problem. This 
    gives your speech an air of authority.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Make up some sort of group project where the people at the 
    tables can get up and start bitching about things. This keeps people from 
    falling asleep and makes them feel like they are contributing. Example from 
    today: We had to make a list of things that stress us and represent it pictorially.</p>
  <p align="left">4. After the group effort, club the people senseless with your 
    stupid acronyms. You use acronyms to cover up the fact that every goddamn 
    motivational speaker in the world tells you the same goddamn thing. By using 
    an acronym that is particularly clever like P.A.R.A.D.I.G.M or G.O.! you will 
    be called to give seminars around the world.</p>
  <p align="left">Example from today: Here is how you deal with stress: A.A.A. 
    I will let you figure out what it means.</p>
  <p align="left">So here is my rant. It may take me a while to get back to the 
    psychotic humorist (tm) but stay with me.</p>
  <p align="left">What is the main goal of a company? To make money.</p>
  <p align="left">I have no problem with this, but here is where many managers 
    go wrong:</p>
  <p align="left">Because the goal of a company is to make money, it does not 
    make sense to give employees adequate raises, benefits, etc. etc. Paying employees 
    costs money. We are here to make money, not spend it. Ergo, the employees 
    are wrongheaded to ask for more money. We know what's good for them. They 
    are being unrealistic.</p>
  <p align="left">This may seem overly dramatic, but I don't think it is. I have 
    worked for a very large publishing company, for a small business and for a 
    health organization and this attitude pervades managerial decisions. Management 
    seems to be missing a core logic when they throw money all over the place 
    for marketing and building projects while constantly snipping away at the 
    workforce. Let me state what should be the true managerial logic.</p>
  <p align="left">The goal of a company is to make money.</p>
  <p align="left">The best long term way to make money is to nurture a happy workforce.</p>
  <p align="left">Flash in the pan marketing schemes, cost cutting, new fucking 
    &quot;paradigms&quot; etc. are all well in good, but if your workforce is 
    fundamentally unhappy, you are throwing good money after bad.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course, this is not to say that a typist deserves $100,000 
    a year, child care, 6 months of vacation, etc. etc. but if you are paying 
    her minimum wage and pay as you go health care, don't come bitching to me 
    if production and quality in your typing pool is stagnant.</p>
  <p align="left">Let's just take that example for a moment. Here is the traditional 
    way managers handle stagnant production:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Form a committee to look at stagnation.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Invite one token person from the typing pool to sit in on 
    it. Give him or her no power. When he leaves, talk about how you are tired 
    of hearing employees bitch. </p>
  <p align="left">3. Hire a consultant to look at the organization of the typing 
    pool.</p>
  <p align="left">4. Reorganize according to the consultant.</p>
  <p align="left">5. Send the typing pool to a motivational seminar.</p>
  <p align="left">6. Hold a picnic. Give each employee a pen.</p>
  <p align="left">7. When revenues are down, tell typing pool that since their 
    production sucked, you don't have enough money to give them much of a raise.</p>
  <p align="left">8. Watch as some of your best typists leave for better jobs. 
    Only the shitty ones stay because the shitty ones realize they probably couldn't 
    get a better job.</p>
  <p align="left">9. Hire a bunch of scrubs. Pay to train them.</p>
  <p align="left">10. Watch as production falls even more.</p>
  <p align="left">11. Go to #1.</p>
  <p align="left">Do you see where I am going here? I wish to hell I was making 
    this stuff up but I can assure you that I am not. </p>
  <p align="left">How do you fix this stuff? Here is the Klaknaks' guide (tm) 
    to creating a healthy worksource (tm). I realize that revenue (tm) is the 
    singlemost important thing and that some of these things are sometimes unrealistic, 
    but I bet if managers spent as much energy on employees as they do coming 
    up with the latest marketing gimmick, they could find some creative ways to 
    make this stuff happen:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Stop hiring motivational speakers for anything. There is 
    not an employee alive who sees this stuff as anything other than pure bullshit. 
    I am serious, people! It is downright offensive, I think, when employee complaints 
    are answered by management via a horseshit peddler.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Move HR to the second spot on your company's revenue disbursement 
    list. Here is the order: 1. Customer Service 2. HR. Again, this I know from 
    personal experience. Whenever our company made lots of money, instead of spending 
    it on employees (who made all that money), they spent it on marketing gimmicks. 
    Of course and certainly a company needs to expand, but if you expand your 
    company (ergo workload) at the expense of employees, you are asking for trouble. 
    Besides, I am not saying to totally ignore marketing, infrastructure, etc. 
    I am just saying you should move HR ahead of marketing and infrastructure.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Encourage employees to offer suggestions and then comment 
    on those suggestions and act on the ones that are good. How many of you out 
    there have been on a committee where employees make suggestions (some of them 
    good) and then every single one of them are ignored without one peep from 
    management? Just as with the motivational speakers, employees are incredible 
    bullshit detectors, so if you are going to run the risk of giving them more 
    bullshit to be angry about, make sure you actually listen to what they have 
    to say and act on what they have to say.</p>
  <p align="left">4. Treat your employees like you treat your stockholders. This 
    seems fair enough. Companies bend over backwards to assuage the people that 
    pump money into the company, but they do nothing to assuage the people who 
    use that money to make the company. If you have happy stockholders but unhappy 
    employees, eventually the stockholders will become unhappy too. I guarantee 
    it.</p>
  <p align="left">5. Encourage your employees to go out and get drunk together. 
    Ahem. Hey, I am being serious!</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, this is my take on things. Today was just a downright 
    offensive experience for me and more than once I started doodling on my pad 
    and coming up with ideas for my own business. Thanks for listening to me vent.</p>
