            I was in a staff meeting and my boss was telling us about a new executive 
            bonus program. He said that executives will get bonuses depending 
            on how under budget and before deadline a project was at completion. 
          </p>
          <p>I said &quot;So I could make a deal with your boss to over inflate 
            all my estimates and then they would split the bonus money with me. 
            Hmm. Oops. Did I say that out loud?” </p>

  <p>I am back from vacation and after spending a week with my in-laws I am actually 
    looking forward to my crappy job. </p>
  <p>First off, 2 EQ related things. One, hell levels suck major ass. I was in 
    level 35 for almost a month, and I almost quit in frustration. Whatever programming 
    genius thought up double exp levels needs to be taken out into the back alley 
    and beaten with a baseball bat. And I have heard it only gets worse, not to 
    mention the 50+ levels. Sigh. Enough ranting. Now for something good. I love 
    Kunark. I have had many people tell me how great it is and how I need to go, 
    but I have resisted (i.e. Krues among others). A friend finally talking me 
    into porting over there with them and trying it out. It was great! The zone 
    was crawling with tons of blue mobs and the exp after only a short time actually 
    made a dent in my hell level. Plus the new mobs and zones look really cool. 
    It really makes the old world seem kind of cheesy. The loot did suck, but 
    I can always get ported back to a good money making spot if need be. Needless 
    to say, I am hooked on Kunark. I know I promised to talk about E-bay in ‘My 
    Brain’, but I felt the need to talk about something else, so that topic will 
    have to wait until next time. Instead, I am going to discuss the burning topic 
    of guys hitting on me. <a href="brain.shtml">Check it out</a></p>
  <p>My husband has sadly contracted ‘Survivor’ fever and it had affected his 
    brain. Check out how in the <a href="stupid.shtml">‘Stupid Topic’</a> section. 
    Also, I have some new words of wisdom to dispense in the <a href="hottub.shtml">Hot 
    Tub</a>. </p>
  <p>And of course, this is an EQ humor site, so here is some humor. Verant recently 
    took over my company and instituted some ‘changes’. They are claiming they 
    are going to balance all of the departments, and provide a fun working environment 
    for everyone according to the new company Vision ™. Find out all about what 
    happens when <a href="../klakboard/klak12.shtml">Verant Takes Over</a>.</p>
  <p>Now back to catching up on work (ugh) and playing EQ. Next time I will talk 
    about E-bay, hopefully some Stupid Topic responses, and of course some humor.</p>

  <p>Hello all. As luck would have it, it is Friday afternoon and I have no work 
    to do. Rather than leave early, I decided to do an update! Yay! First off, 
    we have a song parody from Chronocide about yours truly, titled <a href="../klakboard/klak11.shtml">'Cyanna'</a> 
  </p>
  <p>I have been spending a lot of time reading the Official EQ Messageboards 
    so all of my posts today will be done with heavy sarcasm and just a touch 
    of anger and a dash of cynicism. </p>
  <p>As many of you know, I quit my job as a shaman and took up the life of a 
    warrior, and I absolutely love it! There is nothing better than getting hit 
    by a giant for 100 points of damage and barely seeing your hp bar move. So 
    here are my <a href="../Topten/topten60.shtml">Top 10 Best things about being 
    a warrior</a>.<br>
    I also have an inside scoop about the development of EQ2. So here is the <a href="../Topten/topten61.shtml">Top 
    10 things that will be different in EQ2. </a>All hail the Vision ™! </p>
  <p>I just got a memo that Verant has taken over my company. They are claiming 
    they are going to balance all of the departments and provide a fun working 
    environment for everyone. I’m anxious to see how it works out and I’ll report 
    back next time. Plus, there will be a new ‘Stupid Topic’, and I’ll talk about 
    E-bay in ‘My Brain’.</p>

  <p>Hello again, all. Sorry I have not updated lately, but I have a new boss 
    so I actually have to work again. To make up for a lack of updates, here is 
    a bonus Sarcastic Quote of the Day:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <i>I have a friend who is recently married who we will call ‘Andrew’. 
      Before he was married he was a very wild part guy. He went out with a lot 
      of women and during his dating ‘slumps’ he would fill the time with professional 
      help, if you know what I mean. After he got married, he and his wife moved 
      close to where we live and we all started going out a lot. He said he told 
      his wife about all the women he dated but that he did not tell her about 
      the prostitutes and made me swear never to tell too. It has been very hard 
      to keep this secret since I have gotten very close to his wife and consider 
      her a good friend.</i></p>
    <p><i> Last month we all went to the zoo together. While in the gift shop 
      we saw they had large stuffed animal butts mounted on the wall in a kind 
      of parody of the mounted heads you see everywhere in redneck country where 
      I live. They even had a giant stuffed elephant butt. His wife looked at 
      the price tag and she could not believe that it cost 200 dollars. Before 
      I could stop myself I said ‘That’s nothing. Andrew has paid more than that 
      for a piece of ass.’ </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For those of you who visit the Official Everquest messageboards, you will 
    notice that they are filled with horror stories of abusive GM’s. This is not 
    one of those stories. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The other day my group was hunting in SolA killing goblins and gnome 
      clockworks (sorry fellow nuggets). Some of the clockworks do a force shock 
      that can throw you around. Since we were fighting in an area surrounded 
      by lava, this is not a good thing. After the first time I got throw into 
      molten lava, we decided it best if the tanks had levitate on them. The very 
      next battle, I was hit by a force shock. My screen went all screwy and I 
      started getting messages that I was being killed by molten lava. I tried 
      to move, but I could not. My friends cast 5 greater heals but none of them 
      affected me. In short order I died. I talked to my friends as I started 
      my run back and they all said, I never left the platform and that they could 
      all see me just standing there but no spells worked on me. Being that I 
      am in a hell level and the exp I lost was many hours worth of hunting, I 
      petitioned a GM. I had heard many horror stories so I was all set to be 
      angry. In less than 5 min, I got a response from a GM, Sparrowhawk to be 
      exact. He talked to my party members that were on the scene and saw that 
      I died from lava but my body was lying on solid ground. In less than 5 more 
      minutes, I got a res. He was friendly, fast, and nice. In all, I died from 
      a bug and was back fighting with my group in about 15 min. I want to say 
      thanks, Sparrowhawk, you are a good guy! </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thanks everyone for the responses to the Stupid Topic. My mailbox was inundated 
    with hilarious responses and <a href="stupid.shtml">here they are</a></p>
  <p>I hate stupid people. I hate stupid inflexible rules. As promised here is 
    a story of <a href="brain.shtml">something that makes me mad</a>.</p>
  <p>This was supposed to be a timely humor piece about computer viruses, but 
    it sat on my hard drive for far too long. Oh, well. Here it is anyway. <a href="../klakboard/klak09.shtml">Everquest 
    Computer Viruses</a></p>
