  <p>Swimming Newbie, Idiot Newbie - by Gabriel</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Well I must say that I have had my share of mistakes just like 
    any other but have yet to hear of my very first newbie mistake from any other. 
    I LOVE magic,....and I LOVE being smart. So of course I enter my new world 
    as an Erudite Wizard. Oh yeah, gotta love it. Wander, battle, die, die, die, 
    did I mention die. FINALLY level 4 (gasp) is reached and suddenly I am a mighty 
    caster of magic. Obviously since fire beetles have lost there challenge and 
    no one could possibly kill a Kerran I must need to relocate.</p>
  <p align="left">Fazzarya says out of character: How do I get off this island 
    and get to the mainland??</p>
  <p align="left">(Anonymous) tells you: You need to go across the water dude.</p>
  <p align="left">You tell (Anonymous): Ok thanks man, which water?</p>
  <p align="left">(Anonymous) tells you: The docks in Erudin. Good Luck.</p>
  <p align="left">You tell (Anonymous): Alright, thanks alot</p>
  <p align="left"> Hell, I know where those docks are...off I go. On arrival I 
    realize that I cannot see the mainland. Wow... this game really is huge. HAha... 
    I have swam to Kerra island many a time (mostly to retrieve dead bodies) so 
    this should be cake. Off I go like the next olympic freestyle gold medal winner. 
    Swim, swim, swim, swim, swim, damn this place is a long way off. I probably 
    should stop and take some bearings. Do a quick 180....wait, or was that a 
    270.... had to been a full 360 degree turn. Swim, swim, swim, swim, swim. 
    Crap, where the hell am I. Needless to say, I did not want to lose all my 
    earthly possesions so I spent approximately 1 and a 1/2 hours swimming around 
    looking for Erudin. Stupid boat. Stupid Wizard...137 intelligence my ass.</p>
