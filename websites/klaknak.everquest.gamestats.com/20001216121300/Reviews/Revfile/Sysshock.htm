<p align="center"><font size="4">System Shock - by Thabor Llan</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left">When I first heard System Shock 2 was out I wasn't too sure that 
  I wanted to try it. I played the original, and while it was a good game, it 
  was also terribly long and tedious. Trying to keep an open mind I downloaded 
  the demo (Thank god work has a decent bandwidth).</p>
<p align="left">The Demo : It opens up, very nice graphics even on a crummy 3d 
  accelerator. The interface feels oddly very familiar and very comfortable (Thief 
  anyone?).. So, after an hour or so of fooling, I exit and note the 'multiplayer 
  cooperative mode' listed as part of the key features.. Needless to say I give 
  a friend a call and run out to buy it..</p>
<p align="left">The Game : One of the things I noted at the store was a distinct 
  lack of networking requirements or mention of multiplayer mode on the game itself.. 
  Shrugging it off with a small prayer the game goes home with me.. The full installation 
  is huge, and takes quite a while. Finally I start up the game, and get a CD 
  verification screen.. After waiting for it to check the whole disc byte by byte 
  (I guess that is what was taking so long) to verify that it is indeed a genuine 
  original cd the game starts..</p>
<p align="left">The graphics would be about the same as the demo, but since I'm 
  at home I crank them all the way up.. Still just as smooth, and very nicely 
  detailed. The soundtrack is decent on the rare occasions when it actually plays.. 
  But, NO multiplayer option.. Cooperative or otherwise. Later investigation reveals 
  that network support is supposed to be added in a patch.. Give me a break. As 
  of today (Friday, September 17) the promised network support is nothing but 
  vaporware. I wouldn't be half as upset if all the sales pitches and even a couple 
  reviews weren't claiming it as a major feature.</p>
<p align="left">If you are looking for a single player action game System Shock 
  2 may be for you. If you liked the original System Shock then this game is definately 
  for you. The one downside is that the game is far more stats driven then puzzle 
  driven. If your character sucks at hacking, you will suck at hacking. Hacking, 
  Repair, Modify all share the same interface based on stats and chance.</p>
<p align="left">If you're a big fan of wild weaponry then you may be a bit disappointed. 
  The weapons are adequate, but there more duplication than I care for. Standard, 
  Laser, or Exotic hand to hand weapons are all pretty much the same. The Psi-Amp 
  is probably the most versatile equipment you can get, and even it can be turned 
  into a basic bashing weapon. Ammunition for weapons can be pretty scarce, so 
  you usually only want to use better weapons in the most vital situations. Not 
  to mention that most weapons degrade and need to be repaired.</p>
<p align="left">As in the original creatures can regenerate, so you'll never be 
  'safe' even in areas you've completed. The puzzles pretty much all consist of 
  finding items x, y, z and taking them to places a, b, c.. The load times within 
  the game itself are quick enough that you can return to previous areas with 
  ease, and you aren't cut off or limited to the current game area. </p>
<p align="left">Resource management is going to be one of the most difficult aspects 
  of the game, especially if they ever do implement multiplayer (Which frankly 
  I don't think will happen). You are always a little short on healing, or ammo, 
  or power, antitoxin.. Critters like spiders aren't difficult to kill, but can 
  kill you an hour later with their poison. Overall its a good game. I'd give 
  it a 7 out of 10 as things stand. I'd give it 9 if the multiplayer support wasn't 
  just vaporware.</p>
