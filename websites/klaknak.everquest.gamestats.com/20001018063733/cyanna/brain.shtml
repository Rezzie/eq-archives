    are not the first. Here I express opinions everything both off topic 
    and our beloved EQ.</font></p>

  <p>Frist off, I am happily married (sorry guys). I wear a wedding ring and everything. 
    But I have always been very flirtatious and I still am. This has caused me 
    to get hit on a lot, which I always found flattering. It used to make my husband 
    mad, but after almost 10 years of marriage he is used to it and we always 
    have a laugh about it afterwards. I have never exactly been super model quality, 
    but I am attractive enough to have good looking guys come on to me. I do not 
    know if it is because I am getting older or if it is the couple of extra pounds 
    I just cannot seem to shed, but the quality of men that are hitting on me 
    is at an all time low. Here is a run down on the most recent come ons. (Note: 
    all of these come ones were entirely unsolicited, i.e. no flirting or charming 
    was involved) </p>
  <p>1. I was walking my dog in the park across the street from my house, and 
    some kid in his early teens on a bike road up and started talking to me. He 
    was of course bragging about himself as men usually do, but it was about teenager 
    stuff that I have not cared about for about 15 years. He asked me if I had 
    a boyfriend and I told him that not only was I almost old enough to be his 
    mother, but that I was married. He then asked me if I like younger men and 
    wanted to know if I wanted to make out in the bushes. </p>
  <p>2. There is a Taco Bell by my work that I eat lunch at a lot. I like to go 
    through the drive through and then go to a park and read and eat. There is 
    this Asian guy that works the drive through a lot when I go there. Of course 
    he can barely speak English, which is why they have him working in the drive 
    through, the better to screw up my order. Anyway, one day the drive through 
    was kind of busy so I went in and got it to go. This guy follows me out to 
    my car and starts talking to me. I could barely understand him but I got the 
    gist of his message. For some reason all I could think about was the movie 
    ‘Sixteen Candles’ when the Asian guy, Long Duck Dong, hung upside down and 
    said to Molly Ringwald ‘What’s happening, hot stuff’ </p>
  <p>3. I was on the bikes at my health club, reading and minding my own business. 
    This guy walks up to me and starts talking. What this guy was doing in a health 
    club instead of a Walmart was beyond me. His beer belly was so big he looked 
    like he had a watermelon stuffed under his shirt. It was hanging out of his 
    tank top so that he looked like Winnie the Pooh. Not to mention his slicked 
    down comb-over and his missing front teeth. He then proceeds to follow me 
    around during my work out talking about what a neat minimum wage job he has.</p>
  <p>4. I was working in the yard and the ice cream truck pulled up to me and 
    stopped. The ice cream man (who I think was sampling a little too much of 
    his wares) asked me if I wanted to go for a ride. I think he has been listening 
    to too much Van Halen. </p>
  <p>5. A friend of mine’s dad asked me out. He is almost old enough to get social 
    security. </p>
  <p>So there you have it. Hopefully, I am just in a slump and that by speaking 
    about it, I can break the trend. Plus I am still holding out hope of getting 
    Russell Crowe someday. If any of you women out there have had similar bad 
    come ones from horrible guys, I want to hear about them! E-mail me. Remember 
    misery loves company. </p>

<p>Something happened recently that really ticked me off. I know it is stupid 
  but I must share it. First off, we have a free cafeteria here at work. The women 
  who runs it, is the Cafeteria Nazi. She is the most strict, inflexible, rules-oriented 
  women I have ever seen. She and I have clashed before due to my rebellious nature. 
  Two days ago we had cheeseburgers for lunch. I love the cheeseburgers from the 
  cafeteria. She may be the Cafeteria Nazi, but she sure can make some yummy food. 
  Yesterday, we had vegetable burgers (yuck) and beefsteak, which was actually 
  a left over burger with no bun. I went through the line and got a 'beefsteak'. 
  I asked if I could have it on a bun. </p>
<p>She said, 'The buns can only be used for the vegetable burgers.' 'But the beefsteak 
  is only a left over burger without a bun. Besides what does it hurt to give 
  me a freaking bun?' I said. 'Sorry.' She said. Exasperated, I said 'Fine, give 
  me a 'beefsteak' AND a vegetable burger. Then I will throw away the vegetable 
  burger and use the bun.' I was thinking she would see the flaw in her logic 
  and agree to give me a bun and we would then forge a bond that would blossom 
  into a lifelong friendship. <br>
  Instead she said 'Fine. Do you want them both on the same plate?' Stunned, I 
  said 'Uh...ok.' She then gave me the beefsteak and the veggie burger. I picked 
  off the veggie patty, threw it in the garbage, and put the beefsteak on the 
  bun right in front of her. I then thought she would realize how stupid she was, 
  burst into tears, and ask my forgiveness for the years of tyrannical cafeteria 
  management. Instead she turned to the next person in line and asked them what 
  they wanted. AAARRRGHHH!!!! </p>
