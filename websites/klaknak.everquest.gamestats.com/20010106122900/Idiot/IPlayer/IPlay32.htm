  <p>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Yakyak Mukmuk</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> It was another nice day in the PoF. I was running around with 
    my level 50 Warrior with his new full Lustrious Russet armor. I didn't have 
    a group, and doing this in the PoF is a death wish. I was running around asking 
    if anyone needed a level 50 warrior on their group. A dark elf cleric tells 
    me to meet him by the hourglass and I can join his group. So, I go there (with 
    my journeyman boots on and SOW cast on me by a level 50 shaman). I'm just 
    running around looking for it (PoF is kinda hard to navagate). I finally find 
    it and start running towards it. I see the cleric with his group. There are 
    usually a large amount of people at the hourglass at any given time, but as 
    I was getting closer, I noticed people started turning and running. I didn't 
    think much of it, but as I got even closer, more people started to scatter. 
    Everyone was scattering until even the dark elf who had invited me ran. I 
    told him "Where are you going?" and he replys with a simple "dont stop running". 
    Perplexed by this, I keep running. I run right past the hourglass. "Should 
    I stop now?" I asked him, and he replyed "No dont think about it." Again wondering 
    what he was talking about, I keep running. I wondered if I ran way past the 
    hourglass, so i do a chase cam and see the hugest train following me of at 
    least 10 level 45+ monsters. "AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!" I tell the dark elf.</p>
  <p align="left">Well, as I later discovered, the train had killed most of the 
    people near the hourglass and almost killed me, but a wizard gated me out. 
    After I came back to the PoF, I saw at least 20 corpses scattering the grounds 
    next to the hourglass and at least 10 more in the immediate area. To make 
    a long story from getting longer, I cost at least 10 people their level 50 
    status and made 20 other level 46 through 49's drop a lot of experience. "Well 
    I guess I'll be staying out of the PoF for a while." I told my guild, half 
    of whom was looting their corpses. Well after I begged for apology to the 
    people I had killed, they decided to let me into the PoF again and not to 
    hate this poor level 50 ogre too much.</p>
