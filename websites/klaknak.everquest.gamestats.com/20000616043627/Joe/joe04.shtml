    <b>PC Gamer is a Whore of the Establishment</b><br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I dont even know why I buy PC Gamer anymore. Usually, whenever 
    I buy publications that will control what I buy, I try and gauge how well 
    they rate games I deem superior and fun. PC Gamer and I have a terrible record.</p>
  <p align="left">I think it is obvious why PC Gamer gets so many things wrong 
    and that reason is: they are a whore to the establishment.</p>
  <p align="left">Like Premiere magazine, its real world counterpart, PC Gamer 
    is constantly crossing that thin threshold between journalism and flat out 
    product endorsement. And, just as Premiere magazine gives movies like You've 
    Got Mail! four stars, PC Gamer guarantees itself interviews with industry 
    leaders by inflating shitty game ratings in direct proportion to the amount 
    of hype the magazine itself created. It's a vicious circle babe.</p>
  <p align="left">What made me angry about this month's issue? Their inclusion 
    of Ultima Ascension as one of the Top Three games of last year and their assertion 
    that, a few pesky bugs aside, it is the best roleplaying game ever made.</p>
  <p align="left">What ... the ... fuck.</p>
  <p align="left">Since PC Gamer fairly and correctly berated U9 in its last issue 
    (still giving it an overrated 80 percent, I believe), this curious flip flop 
    leads me to only one conclusion: they are hoping the gaming public has a short 
    memory and won't call them a whore. Well, the gaming public dont have a short 
    memory, man, and I am calling this shameless rag a whore right to its face.</p>
  <p align="left">The funniest thing about the whole article this issue was when 
    the editor's of PC Gamer slyly commented that the game didnt win the RPG of 
    the year because it was buggy and that other developers should take heed. 
    Like those developers give a rat's ass what PC Gamer says. All they have to 
    do is call PC Gamer up with an &quot;exclusive interview&quot; with the Head 
    Hype Minister and PC Gamer will suck their collective floppy appendages like 
    the whore it is.</p>
  <p align="left">There are two main things that bug me about PC Gamer's newly 
    revised view of Ultima Ascension:</p>
  <p align="left">1. It downplays the importance of bugs.</p>
  <p align="left">2. It assumes bugs were the only problem with this game.</p>
  <p align="left">I will slam both of these things in turn.</p>
  <p align="left">1. Bugs.</p>
  <p align="left">Here is the tried and trued (and wrong) defense of U9 and other 
    buggy products:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Other than a few bugs which were easily fixed in the patch, 
    this is an outstanding game, possibly the best RPG ever.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, fine. But what exactly are these bugs? These writers write 
    about bugs as if there is only one kind. Perhaps an NPC uses an incorrect 
    message thread or maybe a particular monster causes the game to freeze. For 
    my money, these bugs are OK (tho frustrating). I am the first to admit that 
    RPGs are very complicated to create and it is natural for there to be some 
    minor holes in the large complex fabric that is the RPG extravaganza.</p>
  <p align="left">But that is not exactly what we are talking about in U9, now 
    is it? Hell no. This game had all kinds of bugs from the minor to the huge 
    and to clump all of these into a statement claiming &quot;a few bugs&quot; 
    is the height of gaming spin. U9 was absolutely unplayable for a large group 
    of players who did not happen to realize that Origin had entered the whoring 
    business with a particular kind of 3-D software. Origin blamed others for 
    springing new software versions on them at the last minute, but this is just 
    a bunch of bullshit. If this was the first time Origin had ever had this kind 
    of problem, ok ... maybe ... but since Origin has put out really really shitty 
    first releases for the last several products, there is another, more reasonable 
    explanation: Origin is a shitty developer.</p>
  <p align="left">What? How could I say this?</p>
  <p align="left">Dude, look. From Ultima 7 on, Origin has consistently put out 
    shitty first release products. You can cry and whine all you want that Origin 
    produces good games (and, admittedly, Ultima 7 rocked (eventually)) but you 
    cannot deny that those first releases have been pure shit in terms of quality.</p>
  <p align="left">So these are the major bugs. Oh, and in case I wasn't clear 
    above, here is the major bug: Unless you have a very specific kind of system, 
    for which the game was obviously developed, the game will run for shit. Some 
    have claimed that the patches help some but that the game still runs like 
    a dog on certain machines.</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, rants are supposed to lack in style, so bear with me.</p>
  <p align="left">Let's, then, reexamine the statement above and place the exact 
    nature of the bug in place of the vague term &quot;a few bugs&quot;:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Other than the fact that U9 will not run properly on a 
    large percentage of machines which was not completely fixed in the patch, 
    this is an outstanding game, possibly the best RPG ever.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">So, there is the major bug. What about some of the minor bugs?</p>
  <p align="left">Here is the list of problems I had on my machine:</p>
  <p align="left">a. Game steadily slowed until it crashed.</p>
  <p align="left">b. NPCs were frequently found FLOATING across the landscape 
    as I ran after them trying to talk to them.</p>
  <p align="left">c. The famous inventory crash bug.</p>
  <p align="left">d. Major script problems (&quot;You have won the game!&quot; 
    &quot;What? I just started!&quot;)</p>
  <p align="left">According to news accounts, these bugs that I encountered were 
    very common. So, let's add them to the statement above:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Other than the fact that U9 will not run properly on a 
    large percentage of machines, slows until it crashes, uses floating NPCs, 
    crashes your inventory and contains numerous script problems, none of which 
    which was completely fixed in the patch, this is an outstanding game, possibly 
    the best RPG ever.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Bullshit.</p>
  <p align="left">2. But wait, there's more! The number one assumption many gamers 
    and whore mags make is that the bugs are the only problem with this game. 
    I beg to differ. Let's list a few of the &quot;minor&quot; problems I have 
    with the game:</p>
  <p align="left">a. The magnificent land of Britannia has been reduced to the 
    complexity of a Sony Playstation RPG. Lord British's castle is nestled not 
    in a bustling city (or even the ruins of a bustling city) but in a little 
    town-let that looks plain goofy.</p>
  <p align="left">b. The combat is absolutely brain dead. The AI in this game 
    is nonexistent. In nonhyped games, this would have been a deathblow, but in 
    the world of whoring, this was mostly ignored in favor of the beautiful graphics.</p>
  <p align="left">c. The voice acting is brain dead.</p>
  <p align="left">d. That stupid stupid moving, rotating, spinning, panning &quot;conversation 
    with a NPC&quot; sequence totally disrupts everything. All I want to do is 
    buy a stupid staff and I have to wait for the MTV style camera to zoom around 
    the NPC and ... gah, I want to vomit.</p>
  <p align="left">e. The puzzles are ... Tomb Raider puzzles. Brain dead. I should 
    be shouting &quot;How do I save Britannia!&quot; Instead I am shouting &quot;Where 
    is lever #2!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">f. The inventory system is brain dead.</p>
  <p align="left">So, let's add all this stuff to the sentence:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Other than the fact that U9 will not run properly on a 
    large percentage of machines, slows until it crashes, uses floating NPCs, 
    crashes your inventory, contains numerous script problems, is a watered down 
    version of Ultima, has braindead combat, has brain dead voice acting, has 
    brain dead NPC cameras, has braindead puzzles and a brain dead inventory system,. 
    none of which which was completely fixed in the patch, this is an outstanding 
    game, possibly the best RPG ever.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Do you see where I am going here?</p>
  <p align="left">Let's face it folks. There are only two fucking reasons U9 did 
    not receive horrible ratings from all reviewers:</p>
  <p align="left">1. The Ultima series is (justifiably) one of the best RPG series 
    ever; and</p>
  <p align="left">2. The graphics are absolutely stunning.</p>
  <p align="left">Is this what we have reduced ourselves to? I swear to shit that 
    these very same reviewers that praise U9 are always spouting out crap like:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;in the era of wow special effects and graphics, it is 
    nice to see a game that puts gameplay over graphics&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">but then ... BUT THEN ... they turn around and give shitpots 
    like U9 inflated scores based solely on the beautiful graphics and the fact 
    that once, years ago, Origin put out decent product.</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, I am just amazed at this sort of stuff. If you still 
    don't believe any of my arguments, let's use a little creative imagination.</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, in this world, some reviewers say that U9 is one of the 
    best RPGs ever, in spite of a few bugs.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, let's travel to an imaginary world where there is no Ultima 
    1-8 and this is the first Ultima product Lord British has ever produced. Will 
    he get a similar sentiment? That this is the best RPG ever, except for a few 
    bugs?</p>
  <p align="left">Hell no. This is what the review snippet would be:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Even tho the graphics are beautiful, this games sucks 
    ass.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">If you don't believe me, go to any of the last couple issues 
    of any gaming magazine and you will always run across at least one game that 
    has astounding graphics, but horrible gameplay. It will almost always get 
    a horrible rating because graphics will almost always fail to help a game 
    if the game is unplayable or sucks in some big way. Why is it that these games 
    get slammed but Ultima 9 receives accolade as one of the best games ever?</p>
  <p align="left">Because PC Gamer is a whore. </p>
  <p align="left">Thank you.</p>
