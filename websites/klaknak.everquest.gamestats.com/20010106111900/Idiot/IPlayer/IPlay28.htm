  <p>Loot Corpse - by Pallean</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I am a level 12 Erudite Enchanter named Pallean.</p>
  <p align="left">I had been wait four levels to get Illusion Dark Elf so I could 
    buy the Enchant Silver spell from the depths of Neriak. I made the trek from 
    Erud's Crossing to East Commons in three hours, fighting through terrible 
    refresh-rate lag and without SoW. Anyway, I had planned to bind outside Nektulos 
    in East commons near the border. In my haste, I zoned without binding. Since 
    the refresh lag was so bad, I did'nt re-zone, which would've taken forever, 
    so I bound close to the border in Nek and went on my merry way. Anyway, I 
    passed the guards outside with no problem and zoned into the Foreign Quarter 
    and headed to the guard complex just inside when I hear:</p>
  <p align="left">L'Crit says 'Take your blasphemy to the next realm!'</p>
  <p align="left">L'Crit says 'Die like the fool you are!'</p>
  <p align="left">L'Crit slashes YOU for 120 damage!</p>
  <p align="left">L'Crit kicks YOU for 39 damage! </p>
  <p align="left">You writhe in the grip of agony.</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">I came to my bind point in Nek, and cursed myself. I had forgotten 
    to recast the illusion. But my tale of woe doesn't end there, that was only 
    the beginning. I was not willing to risk another attempt with Illusion, so 
    I /consented my 6th level DE rouge, Spyrokeet, to loot the corpse and buy 
    the spell. I looted it, but I had to leave my 2 no-drops to loot with Pallean. 
    I used my rouge to drag the corpse near the zone, and then bought the spell. 
    I then took Spyrokeet out to E. Commons with the spell and most of the equipment 
    and suicided by jumping off a cliff. I consented,camped and logged to Pallean. 
    Unfortunately, the corpse was stuck in the cliff and I couldn't target it 
    to summon. I logged back to Spyrokeet and /corpsed it into the open and relogged.</p>
  <p align="left">After I finished looting, I needed to return to Neriak to recover 
    the no-drops. I brought up my illusions and entered Neriak, then I looted 
    my corpse and gated to my bind point in Nektulos. I gated into a guard train, 
    whup-dee-friggin doo. To make a long and painful story short, I died no less 
    than 7 times, and because the guard hung around killing me as I spawned and 
    not returning to their posts, I got 5 or 6 others killed and at least one 
    other person twice.</p>
