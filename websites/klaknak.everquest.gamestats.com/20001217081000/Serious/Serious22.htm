  <p>Tales of Joy - by The Klaknak Readers</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Is Everquest sinking into a pit of despair? Or does the Klaknak 
    need an attitude adjustment. Find out here!</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left">&quot;I was originally planning to relate a story about the all-time 
  biggest Blackburrow train--just to be original--until I read your self-centered 
  plea for help. "So," I thought, "what can I do to help the Klaknak? And what 
  am I gonna do for lunch? Man, I wonder if this got infected?" We'll cover the 
  foremost dilemma first. My first suggestion would be to jump servers. Play around 
  on The Tribunal or The Nameless a bit, then as soon as a new server comes up, 
  start a character on it. I originally played on Solusek Ro, but got tired of 
  seeing characters around my level pimped out in gear that would make Lady Vox 
  flinch. Either they were secondary characters whose players twinked them, or 
  they played mules for said players and ran off with all their stuff. The final 
  straw was seeing some passing wizard toss a second-level character 500 plat, 
  just for shits and giggles. "Why! Why must you wreck the system! Why can't you 
  just let people advance on their own, giving advice and healing when needed? 
  Why didn't you give *me* 500 plat?" After jumping over to The Tribunal, all 
  this stopped. Nobody was at extremely high levels, but everyone wanted to be, 
  so little to no twinking took place. Groups worked well together, because everyone 
  wanted XP. I played for three weeks before I saw a single incident of killstealing, 
  because killstealers are dealt with so harshly there. Finally, since the k3wl 
  d00ds didn't want to give up their underpowered level 50 wizards on the other 
  server, most of the players on The Tribunal had a clue. It made all the difference 
  in the world. Second, by all means play a Ranger. I know you're sick of casters, 
  but you're also fed up with travel time. Add to that the fact that as a warrior 
  you'd be sitting on your butt and healing one minute out of every five you play, 
  and those tree-huggers start looking pretty good. Rangers can fight well, they 
  get dual wield, they have a nice mix of skills, and decent travel magic with 
  a little healing and buffing thrown in. I'll tell you the Blackburrow story 
  some other time.&quot; - Keppo</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Greetings, Here are just a couple of rambling observations 
  and notes on why I'm still playing. I have a ranger. I created him so I could 
  get the same starting location as my wife. She had purchased the game a couple 
  of days earlier and already, I knew she was going to be an addict so the only 
  way I would be able to see her and spend time with her was to become an addict 
  myself. Well, my character is almost lvl 44 now. A very large amount of /played 
  time has been amassed on my part. I've tried quitting, but my friends and wife 
  won't let me. It has all come down to wanting to see more and do more. We have 
  spoiler sites all over the place now and if many people discover something new 
  and interesting, they want to have thier name posted on those sites as some 
  kind of reward while ruining the exploration for others. On the opposite side 
  of this, there are a LOT of things that still haven't been discovered, and that's 
  what I'm after now. For a long time I alternated between soloing and grouping. 
  Much of my experience has been gathered with only one or two friends or by myself. 
  The bind thing is pretty miserable at times, but, it's something you learn to 
  live with or work around. What it really comes down to though, are those occasions 
  where you or you and your friends manage to pull off some impossible feat, or 
  finally get to go someplace new and see what it's like. Yeah, you can look at 
  screenshots, but it really doesn't do the game justice when you have these moments 
  where you're seeing something for the first time, or doing something for the 
  first time, or completing that quest you've been working on for over a month. 
  I finally went into Kedge Keep a couple of weeks ago. Wow. What an incredible 
  place. It just looks.....so damn cool :) I've snuck up on the Allizewesaur and 
  sprinkled pepper on his bed. I've also, and if you havent tried this, you simply 
  have to, cast levitate on myself and seen exactly what objects and buildings 
  I can get on top of or float down from some obscene height. Honestly, I'm not 
  a huge fan of having to group to get any of the nice equipment or just get experience 
  for that matter, but, I adapted as well as I could for it. I ended up meeting 
  some really great people who ended up being part of my rotating group. I don't 
  group anymore unless I've got at least 2 of them with me. Speaking of which, 
  I've been amassing some good quotes from screenshots I've taken. They even include 
  a nice misfire to the group of a couple of people having netsex in tells. (I'm 
  going to put them all together and send them in one of these days. Heard this 
  one secondhand and it's a shame I missed it, but an enchantress on the server 
  was in PoF one day and a dwarven warrior in her group got lustrous russet greaves. 
  Her comment: "You look like Twikki from Buck Rogers." The rest of the time they 
  were camping the zone, people were shouting "Biddy Biddy, Heya Buck!") I dunno, 
  the game really kinda started for me at lvl 20. Before that I was learning to 
  play and exploring some, but I hadn't been to some of the more varied and interesting 
  places. It can be a pain getting to that point, but the payoff, in my eyes, 
  really makes up for it. If you end up making a ranger or whatever else on rodcet, 
  let me know, I can help out a bit on those first couple of levels :) &quot;-uber_yoyo

<p align="left">&quot;Hi Klaknak!!!! *big hugs* Well let me start out to say that 
  I can understand why you would wind up disillusioned with Everquest. I used 
  to play a textual mud in which i too became disillusioned and then came Everquest. 
  I can understand your desire to solo as well. There are several people I *LOVE* 
  to group with on my server (Tunare) but to be perfectly blunt about it there 
  are others, who, when they ask me to group I have a tendancy to do one of three 
  things: a) I say "I'm about to log." and then I log out whatever character i'm 
  in and choose a new character that that person doesn't know about until they 
  have moved on their merry way. (ie. grouped with others, logged themselves, 
  or until great friends of mine come along that I would rather group with so 
  that i can come back on and say "oh it was a false alarm and I wound up getting 
  a full group when i got back, sorry." OR until they've forgotten about me) b) 
  I just don't respond and pretend i missed it in battle spam unless they are 
  right there with me in which case i will just stand there and not move about 
  and then later i can claim "I was afk and forgot to type /afk". c) I say that 
  i'm not grouping period. I play Sephrana Angelsong a level 24 bard on the Tunare 
  server. I love my bard. They are an acceptable solo character if you can learn 
  how to do it without dying. While bards may not have gate or bind we do get 
  selos accelerando which, when played with the drum is faster than SoW ever dreamed 
  of being. I have outrun many things with it, sand giants and hill giants included. 
  When I say outrun I dont' mean i've stayed just far enough ahead. When I kite, 
  sometimes i have to stop running to let whatever is chasing me catch up to me. 
  See unlike a druid, bards can still kite somewhat. Our direct damage song only 
  does like 13 at my level but all of those 13's add up eventually. Kiting is 
  for the patient at heart though...which i'm not. Well Druids can kite but it 
  was nerfed as we all know. I have found the best combination to be my level 
  24 bard and a magician of approximately the same level. My very best friend 
  who i have met online plays a Magician and on a good day, with help from his 
  pet we can solo avocets at the aviak city. This was when i was level 23 and 
  he was level 23/24. Now he is level 28 because I've been dragging my feet, I'm 
  still just level 24. It only really got hard to solo at level 17. Before that 
  all i had to do was pull and pray nothing got trained onto me. I have found 
  the concert hall website, if you are interested in it let me know and i'll pass 
  it along. Also...if you want to start a bard just to see what all I am talking 
  about is about...and you don't mind switching servers, come over to Tunare. 
  I have some little characters I would be more than happy to group with you :) 
  Also - I generally tend to stay in the same place for a loooooooooooong time 
  so we would be able to travel together if you wanted to. I have no compunctions 
  about helping you twink on tunare either. So if this sounds like something you'd 
  like email me back and let me know and we can come up with a time to meet on 
  everquest. I generally play for the entire evening almost every day except when 
  i have papers due at school or tests to study for. I'll even send in a little 
  bit of humor to get you started back again.....sorry to clog your mail box because 
  i have numerous phenomenon shots and i have several funny stories. well, i consider 
  them funny but some people may not consider them funny. Just let me know ok? 
  *big hugs* Don't worry....I'm a girl ;)&quot; - Carol Mayo aka Sephrana Angelheart</p>
<p align="left"> A bullet list of points because I am too tired to craft a meaningful, 
  coherent letter: - I hate grouping, too, not so much because I am a "rugged 
  individualist" as much as I am a "selfish bastard". I am here to have fun, and 
  exactly what constitutes fun for me is defined (and constantly redefined) by 
  myself. I also detest arguments about what to do/where to go next. The only 
  group that is always in agreement is the soloing character. - I like the trade 
  skills that allow you to improve yourself without help from the outside. Tailoring 
  to get your own armor and fletching to make your own weapons, I absolutely love. 
  Smithing might be good, I've got no skill in it so I hate it. I see no point 
  to the others, except to make money, which isn't allowed. - I think the player-based 
  economy hurts the sense of discovery of the game, which for me is a big piece 
  of it. I have an 18th level Warrior (my highest level character) with a Bone 
  Bladed Claymore and wearing a full set of Bronze (well, as much as he can carry). 
  None of this is twinked, I just took so long to get to level 18 that I could 
  eventually buy it all in Freeport on weekends. In retrospect, I regret it. An 
  18th level character shouldn't be this well equipped. What do I have to look 
  forward to? By 30th level (at my rate, that'll be sometime next summer), I should 
  have many of the finest pieces of equipment you can buy (and what CAN'T you 
  buy?) I don't even know what to kill to get Bronze, yet I am wearing several 
  pieces. Who knew Wisps dropped Bronze? - I hate that all characters cannot bind. 
  This shouldn't be a spell, or if it must be, then you should be able to purchase 
  it from an NPC. Limiting me to longer corpse runs because of my class is just 
  silly. - I love that there is equipment that only certain classes can wear, 
  and I love that each class has SOMETHING all its own. - I like to travel, for 
  the most part. This explains my level after playing since April. I'd like it 
  still more if I hadn't done so many long corpse runs, though! - I want to be 
  able to turn off duel results. I don't care that Hocuspoker just defeated Johndenver. 
  I care less that Johndenver ran away. - I adore trying out new characters in 
  new cities and running all-new newbie quests. Even though the reward is always 
  minimal, I like the first level quests best of all. They give you purpose, and 
  they give you tasks that you can accomplish that very night. What's the point 
  of starting the Soulfire quest with my 1st level Paladin? I guess it boils down 
  to this: start a new class in a race whose city you are not too familiar with. 
  The sense of discovery comes back, the sense of wonder, the stress of being 
  lost in your (^%#% HOME CITY. The best ones for this are the cities of Faydwer. 
  All of them, except Felwithe, are pretty confusing at first. If you are a REAL 
  glutton, try a Dark Elf. A Necromancer is what really got me going again; although 
  I deleted him in the end, discovering Neriak and it's newbie quests got the 
  juices flowing. Lastly, if NONE of this works, don't be afraid to try Asheron's 
  Call. You are probably too spoiled by the superior graphics and more difficult 
  levelling of EQ, and will never respect AC, but then again, I could be wrong.&quot; 
  - Mark B.</p>
<p align="left">&quot; CK: Well, I read your piece on your growing disillusionment 
  with EQ, and I thought I would tell you of how I fell into the same trap, and 
  how I survived. I'm not going to go into too many specifics (I don't want people 
  to know who I am as they might track me down; you'll see why in a few), but 
  I had a character, who became fairly powerful, and a high position in a guild, 
  and fairly well equipped. And one day, I'm tooling along, killing whatever, 
  managing my little guild events, and I come to a realization: I'm not having 
  fun anymore. "Hmm," thinks I. "Maybe I'm just tired. Maybe I should go nap." 
  So, I do, and come back. Nope, still not any fun. So, I sit down and think. 
  And I begin to list why it's not fun, and it all boiled down to one thing for 
  me. You should not feel pressured inside a game. There is a lot of pressure 
  inside EQ if you don't manage it right. Pressure is not fun. Here is a partial 
  list of things that cause pressure: 1. Everyone is better equipped and has more 
  money than you, and you should catch up. 2. All your friends/normal groupmembers 
  are outlevelling you, and you should keep up. 3. All your guildmates are catching 
  up to you, and you should stay ahead of them. 4. You can't just abandon your 
  party; once you form a group you are responsible for that group's welfare. 5. 
  You have to act in certain ways. 6. You _must_ level, goddamn it!! 7. Because 
  you have to keep up/stay ahead/level, you should play a certain amount every 
  night... You can see where I am going, and I'm sure you can list about 300 pressures 
  and responsibilities you feel you have when you play. And we all have enough 
  responsibilities in life. And then I realized that all the responsibilities 
  I had in game were an illusion. No one knows who I am out in the real world. 
  No one can find me. If I wanted to, I could just say to hell with it, and deep 
  six this whole other virtual life I'd created. And when I realized that, it 
  suddenly seemed VERY attractive..."But wait," the little voice in the back of 
  my head cried out. "You can't DO this! All your hard work, all the time and 
  effort you put into this character..why, it would be foolish to do this..." 
  I hate that little voice. Especially when he calls me foolish. So, I said, "FUCK 
  this." I promptly bid my guildmembers farewell. Nice people all of them, and 
  I didn't do it in a mean way. I just came on, said "Well, it's been fun, I'm 
  done with this character. Good luck all, adios." Ignoring their plaintative 
  cries of "WHY," I dumped all my expensive crapola in a big pile in the middle 
  of the East Commons for some lucky lowbie to find (and boy, no one will ever 
  believe that guy when he tries to explain how he got so twinked). Then I camped, 
  and deleted that character. And started a new character, devoted to doing whatever 
  the heck I want, cause frankly, it's my 10 bucks a month, and everyone else 
  can go to hell. Rule #1: No one is going to keep tabs on me. If I have to keep 
  up with someone, it is pressure. I don't look for the same people I grouped 
  with before. In fact, sometimes I refuse to group with people just because they 
  are starting to keep track of me. If I think I've made it onto a person's friend 
  list, they get a /ignore for a week or so. No one should care if I level, no 
  one should be waiting for me to level or expecting me to level. Rule #2: I'm 
  going to play whatever class I want, how I want. For my new character, I took 
  a class without bind (before I thought I needed it, cause how else could I get 
  across Norrath fast enough?). I can't gate, which sucks, but I can usually get 
  bound pretty easily, just by offering a coin or two on auction for a bind. But 
  I'm having more fun, cause this is what I wanted to play all along. So what 
  if it takes me all night to walk from Queynos to Freeport? See #1 above. I don't 
  care how long it takes me, because no one is keeping track of me, and I don't 
  have to level anytime soon. In fact, sometimes I'll switch from run to walk, 
  just to check out the sunset in a zone a little longer, or watch some sorry 
  group of lowbies get crushed by a giant or griffon...just to take my time and 
  sightsee, in other words. Rule #3: I'm not going to worry about equipment. In 
  fact, I've taken several pieces of equipment with worse stats than other pieces, 
  simply because they look cool. I'm not going to totally ignore equipment, cause 
  it is fun to get something new..but I'm not going to obsess about "I MUST have 
  bronze" or whatever. Rule #4: I am going to act in total accord with my feelings. 
  This is a biggie, and relates to grouping especially. Past a certain point, 
  you basically have to group, or you really can't fight anything worth fighting. 
  Now, I am like you in that I HATE grouping. People are idiots. So, as I said 
  in #1 above, I have no set group. When I get to an area and decide to hunt, 
  I shout out that I am looking to group, with my class and level info. Some group 
  invariably takes me in. And you know what? If they suck, if they are annoying, 
  if they play poorly, if they bother me in any way, I say "Well, it's been fun, 
  good luck." And I disband from the group. And what can they do about me just 
  leaving? Not a goddamn thing. Heck, I'll even start shouting for a new group 
  in the same zone a couple minutes later. If they message me asking why, I say 
  "Your group wasn't what I was looking for.." and that's all. Further messaging 
  gets the old /ignore switch. Ok, you get the point. I could go on like this 
  all night. But I now wander the land, free from pressures, free from worries, 
  not antisocial (I still talk to people and group and whatnot) but not tied to 
  anyone either. Annoying people get ignored, annoying groups get bailed on. I 
  make snide sarcastic comments when people say stupid things. I do what I want, 
  depending on what feels like fun. I take my time. I attack red cons just to 
  see what they can do. After all, it's only experience, and I'll level sometime...I 
  have all the time in the world. My character isn't getting any older. And no 
  one cares if I level or not. I play when I want. If I want to kill a sunday 
  playing EQ with football on in the background, I do. If I want to log on for 
  an hour and kill a few things, and then go, fine. If I don't want to play for 
  a week or two, just as good. I can't be that free from responsibilities and 
  pressures in the real world. EQ is an escape again. And I'm having fun. I don't 
  know if this helps you or not...but I found I had a lot more fun if I started 
  looking at it as a game, not as a job or "another life." You don't have to go 
  to the extreme I did, and wipe your existing characters (unless you really feel 
  that you do need to in order to escape those you are associated with). But next 
  time you log on, just say "It's a game. No one knows me. I am going to act as 
  I damn well please, and everyone else can't do anything about it!" It's the 
  whole trick to the game.&quot; - JML</p>
