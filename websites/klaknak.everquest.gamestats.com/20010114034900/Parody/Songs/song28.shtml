  <hr>
  <p align="left"> A long long time ago, in Antonica far away, <br>
    Freeport was under an attack <br>
    And I thought me and Belgaron <br>
    could talk the (dark)elves into moving on<br>
    and maybe cut the humans a little slack <br>
    But their response it didnt thrill us <br>
    they flooded the zone and tried to kill us <br>
    we escaped from that day <br>
    met Seridian and Mahande <br>
    we took a boat off from the fray<br>
    and we went to Faydark to get away <br>
    we all wound up in Greater Fay <br>
    thats where we met those guys </p>
  <p align="left">oh my my Mr. Newbie guy<br>
    always begging<br>
    at my legging <br>
    now we gotta go try <br>
    to see if we can kill Dvinn tonight <br>
    oh yeah were gonna be quite alright<br>
    yeah were gonna be quite alright </p>
  <p align="left">did you know that puny slave<br>
    even though he's not even in the cave<br>
    if you free him its you he'll slay<br>
    ahhhh do you see him over on the hill<br>
    though he's not really tough to kill <br>
    yeah he'll... probably put a hurtin on you someday<br>
    yeah I know we still got far to go and I've <br>
    seen the place they're supposed to show <br>
    and we were broke its true.. <br>
    so we slayed a sister or twooo! <br>
    they dropped bronze weapons right there in our face<br>
    and the minute Belgie saw that awful waste<br>
    he got up and gave chase oh yes... he caught that elf</p>
  <p align="left"> we started singing my my Mr. Newbie guy <br>
    always begging<br>
    at my legging <br>
    now we gotta go try <br>
    to see if we can kill Dvinn tonight<br>
    oh yeah were gonna be quite alright<br>
    yeah were gonna be quite alright</p>
  <p align="left"> now we finally got to Kelethin <br>
    the woodelves there knew we wanted in to,<br>
    give the drunk those stupid beads <br>
    so we tracked him down and we told the tale <br>
    how we killed his daughters without a fail <br>
    and he might give us some E..X..P <br>
    oh the drunk one was impressed of course<br>
    he gave us our reward so coarse<br>
    we auctioned off the gloves <br>
    ohhh newbies did /tell us! <br>
    because we had something they revered<br>
    and the minute any of us came near <br>
    they were, there right, in our ear, saying <br>
    could we HAVE that? </p>
  <p align="left">we were singing my my Mr. Newbie guy <br>
    always begging <br>
    at my legging <br>
    now we gotta go try <br>
    to see if we can kill Dvinn tonight <br>
    oh yeah were gonna be quite alright<br>
    yeah were gonna be quite alright </p>
  <p align="left">we took a trip back to Unrest<br>
    to see if we could suffer less <br>
    I frankly would have liked to slay <br>
    we both fought in that epic zone<br>
    and we weren't long at all alone,<br>
    little drybones came outside and changed our dayyyy<br>
    and in the end some groupies died <br>
    some bones blew up and some mummies fried <br>
    a lot of folks were croakin<br>
    my buddies spells were broken<br>
    and the guild member I admire most <br>
    went in the house and turned to toast<br>
    that hag still always laughs the most <br>
    I guess... it was... his time</p>
  <p align="left"> and we were singing.. my my Mr. Newbie guy <br>
    always begging<br>
    at my legging <br>
    now we gotta go try<br>
    to see if we can kill Dvinn tonight<br>
    oh yeah were gonna be quite alright <br>
    yeah were gonna be quite alright </p>
