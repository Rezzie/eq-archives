      <blockquote> <font class="BasicFont"> 
        <p>I had a little experience last night that I thought you might like 
          for your idiot newbie files, or at least for a personal laugh. 
        <p>Being a level 9 Necromancer, I am just at "that awkward stage" where 
          the young character is still undeniably a newbie but desperately wants 
          to act otherwise, like an annoying younger sibling. The rest of my group 
          was not due to arrive for another couple of hourse, so I wandered morosely 
          through Nekulos Forest, killing the occasional decaying skeleton or 
          fire beetle, and wondering where I could safely kill time on my own. 
          I recalled someone telling me a few days previous that there was a gypsy 
          camp in Lavastorm that sold earrings of fire protection...I could use 
          those. I know, of course, there is no way I can fight my way through 
          Lavastorm alone. But maybe I don't have to fight... 
        <p>Upon appearing in Lavastorm, I quickly cast Gather Shadows on myself 
          and strike out for the camp, chuckling smugly at my own cleverness. 
          I arrive and realize I must become visible to deal with the merchants. 
          "Ah well, this will only take a few seconds" I think to myself. "Hail!" 
          "I don't sell to dark elves like you!" Well, phooey. You'd think my 
          friend would have mentioned that point...but then you'd think a handful 
          of merchants living in an infested magma wasteland wouldn't be that 
          picky. Oh well, home I go. I turn to start casting Gather Shadows. 
        <p>A fire imp smacks you upside the head for an obscene amount of damage! 
        <p>Uh oh...since I was running invisible I didn't have a pet with me, 
          and I'm being hit too fast to cast anything. This is bad... 
        <p>A fire imp socks you in the nose for half of your HP! A fire imp backhands 
          you for the other half of your HP! <br>
          LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>Well, don't I feel foolish. I guess I'll have to do another invisible 
          run, loot my corpse and come home. What a wasted trip. I arrive back 
          into the camp and kneel down next to my body and begin grabbing armor 
          & money. 
        <p>A fire elemental kicks you in the butt! 
        <p>What the...they can't see invisible! You mean I lose the spell if I 
          loo- "ARRRRGH!" I attempt to flee for the zone, and moments later realize 
          I could not recall what direction it was in. The fire elemental had 
          called a couple of friends over for a Dark Elf pinata party and proceeded 
          to beat me silly. I just reached for location when- 
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>Well, I don't know where that body is. Phooey. "That's okay, I have 
          Locate Corpse," I think calmly. I head back into Lavastorm, cast Gather 
          Shadows, cast Locate Corpse and noticed I was visible again...goodness, 
          this spell is persnickety! I recast, become invisible and autorun towards 
          my body. Half a second later, plummeting to my death off a cliff, I 
          rethink the wisdom of this tactic. 
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>Back at Neriak. "Well, the good news is I don't have to loot THAT one." 
          I am desperately grasping for some kind of silver lining to this experience. 
          I head back into Lavastorm, past a few people meditating at the entrance 
          who are snickering to see me run by half-naked for the fourth time. 
          I call to my guild for help and thankfully someone comes to my aid as 
          an escort. We get to the camp and I manage to loot the body left there. 
          Whew! Now for the other...wherever it is. My guide says he will wait 
          for me here, and I should drag my corpse back with me. I Locate Corpse, 
          become invisible once more, and trot off SLOWLY. Locate Corpse wants 
          to lead me directly through a lava pool, so I pick my way around carefully 
          to the other side. Locate again, become invisible again. Head off, now 
          Locate wants me off a cliff. I begin to wonder if someone can be KOS 
          to their own spells. After a dozen repeats of appear-locate-invisible 
          I find the body. Looking around, nothing is in the area...I duck down 
          quickly to loot the few pieces of armor and become invisible again. 
          Success! I happily trot back towards the camp and my escort, when invisibility 
          begins to fade. Not a problem... 
        <p>Your spell fizzles. Your spell fizzles. You do not have enough mana 
          to cast this spell! 
        <p>Okay, problem! Of course, I immediately hear the flap of heavy wings 
          approaching directly behind me. I duck behind a nearby rock, doing my 
          best to crawl under it completely. I sit and meditate frantically, then 
          the wingbeats carry an utterly disinterested fire drake by. I manage 
          to scramble back to my escort and safely back to the zone entrance, 
          and let out the breath I have been holding for 20 minutes. Feeling very 
          much like Peter Rabbit, I ran back to Neriak and collapsed, my ego now 
          well-tempered with humility.
