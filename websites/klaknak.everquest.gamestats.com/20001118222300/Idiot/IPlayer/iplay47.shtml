  <p>No answer - by Iilyanna (Dragons of the Night)</p>
  <hr>
<p align="left">Greetings to thee, Klacknak. </p>
  <p align="left">After having many a laugh over your idiot files, I've decided 
    to include the tale of one of my own unfortunate adventures.</p>
  <p align="left">When my ranger, Iilyanna, was level 14, I hunted wisps in the 
    West Commons then took them to N Karana to the gypsy camp. After doing so, 
    I decided to continue on to visit my guild in Surefall Glade. After asking 
    for a SOW, I was on my way. Oops, bandits on the path. I go around them, and 
    get back on the path. Hmmmm, I think to myself, this sure doesn't look like 
    the path to Qeynos. The path deadended in the mountains. Oh, hey, there's 
    someone sitting there, let me go ask him how to get back to Qeynos. 
  <p align="left">me: "Hail there, would you be so kind..." 
  <p align="left">&lt;an ogre shaman beings to cast a spell&gt;<br>
    &lt;an ogre shaman hits YOU for 90 points of damage&gt; repeat, repeat. <br>
    &lt;pain and suffering tries to strike YOU, but misses&gt; 
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. &lt;sigh&gt; 
  <p align="left">I respawn in Freeport. Yell for a tele to Nkarana. It so happens 
    that my friend, a level 24 paladin, was online at the same time, and he so 
    kindly offered to help me find my body. We ran around on the paths in the 
    West Karana for a hour trying to find where I had died. 
  <p align="left">me /ooc: can anyone help me find my body? i was killed by an 
    ogre shaman. 
  <p align="left">xplayer /ooc: there?!? wow, those guys are tough. 
  <p align="left">me /ooc: can anyone give me the loc of that place?? 
  <p align="left">&lt;no response&gt; 
  <p align="left">me /tell the guy who I tried to ask for help: hey, can you give 
    me the loc of my body pls?? 
  <p align="left">&lt;no response&gt repeated several times. 
  <p align="left">otherxplayer /tell: the loc is &lt...&gt, what's your loc I'll 
    come over and try to help you. 
  <p align="left">Being naked, weaponless, and terrible at using the grid system 
    set up, I gave him my location and he showed up in less than 5 minutes. My 
    paladin friend was still with me. 
  <p align="left">the nice wizard who help me: hey, i think that its this way. 
    &lt;casts invis on the party&gt 
  <p align="left">My paladin friend and I stuck together, and we were separated 
    from the wizard. 
  <p align="left">wizard /tell: hey, i found your body. heres the loc. 
  <p align="left">paladin: uh, i think its this way. 
  <p align="left">We wander around in circles for awhile, then end up where we 
    set off from. My friend has to log. I beg the wizard to come back and get 
    me to help me find my body. He does, and we wander around some more in the 
    mountains. Three hours later, I finally get my body clear of the hell-hole 
    in which I was stuck. And to make things worse, the guy who had been sitting 
    there when I died was STILL THERE when I went to get my body, yet he had not 
    responded to any of my tells. The wizard and I ran the rest of the way to 
    Qeynos, where he bound me and I promptly fell to my knees and thanked him 
    profusely. At three in the morning, after about 3 hours of trying to find 
    my corpse, I log, weary and resolute to take the long way around North and 
    West Karana if I have to!
