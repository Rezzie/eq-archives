  <p align="center">The Last Nerf - by Cyanna Thunderhammer</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">'Twas the night before Christmas', when all through the house, 
    <br>
    not a thing was moving but my right hand and mouse. <br>
    The house, all dark, by my monitor was lit,<br>
    In hopes that level 30 soon would be hit. <br>
    My hubby was asleep all snug in the bed, <br>
    While sounds of his snoring rumbled in my head. <br>
    Across my keyboard my cat, Bear, did splay, <br>
    As I settled down for a long night's play.<br>
    While from the message boards rose such a clatter, <br>
    I logged onto EQ to see what was the matter.<br>
    I clicked on the icon and it came up in a sec,<br>
    since my new cable modem was as fast as all heck. <br>
    When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, <br>
    But a message of patching, which filled me with fear. <br>
    There was a message, and assertions were made,<br>
    I knew in a moment it must be McQuaid. <br>
    More rapid than eagles, the changes they came, <br>
    And he lied and he boasted, and called them by name: <br>
    "Nerf Kiting! Nerf feigning! Nerf a high level pet! <br>
    Nerf trade skills, Nerf items, Nerf all spells that you get! <br>
    You used to level and solo, What gall! <br>
    Now nerf away! Nerf away! Nerf away all!" <br>
    &quot;From Qeynos to Freeport you used to could fly!<br>
    Now to try it you surely will die!" <br>
    So as the patch started, my modem was flashing, <br>
    As files were loaded and my hard drive was thrashing. <br>
    And then, in a twinkling, the patching was done,<br>
    and I knew that McQuaid may finally have won.<br>
    I logged into EQ with nary a sound, <br>
    Afraid of the nerfings that soon would be found. <br>
    My armor was nerfed, from my head to my foot, <br>
    And items were removed that I used to, could loot. <br>
    The spells in my spellbook were all changed or gone, <br>
    And I knew the improvements were all just a con. <br>
    I started to solo making sure to be wary. <br>
    For with all of these nerfings, it was sure to be scary! <br>
    The first mob I found was an orc conning green, <br>
    Who ripped out my lungs and munched on my spleen. <br>
    The stump of a my arm he held in his teeth, <br>
    And my intestines encircled his head like a wreath. <br>
    He hit me and kicked me right in the belly, <br>
    He squished me and squashed me like a bowlful of jelly.<br>
    And saying he hated me for being an elf, <br>
    Although I'm a barbarian, I thought to myself. <br>
    A flick of his wrist and a twist of my head, <br>
    And the next thing I knew I was lying there dead.<br>
    He spoke not a word, but went straight back to his spawn, <br>
    And then I was back on the Temple of Ro lawn. <br>
    Angry and frustrated I started to camp, <br>
    I rose from my chair and turned on the lamp. <br>
    A letter I wrote to Verant with a sigh,<br>
    I was sick of fighting greens only to die.<br>
    I canceled my account and went to the mall,<br>
    "Goodbye to EQ, Hello, Asheron's Call!".</p>
