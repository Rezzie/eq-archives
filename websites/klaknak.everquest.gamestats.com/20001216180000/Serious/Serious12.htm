  <p>Ultima Online 2: The Shit Sandwich Returns</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Here is Ultima Online in arithmetic form:</p>
  <p align="left">Great idea + Richard Garriot's ego = Shit Sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">Will Ultima Online 2 be any different? Read the FAQ below and 
    then peruse my interpretation.</p>
  <div align="left"></div>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> <font size="2">What is Ultima Online 2?</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Ultima Online 2 is the next Persistent State 
    World from the company that created Ultima Online. Born from the Ultima fiction, 
    Ultima Online 2 will push the boundaries of traditional fantasy.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Let me be honest here. I didn't really spew chunks when I noticed 
    that Ultima Online has a pompous name for what is basically just a &quot;really 
    big fat pseudo-MUD&quot; but I wish I had. I think they should add a (tm) 
    after Persistent State World before someone rips it off from them and puts 
    it on a gameboy.</p>
  <p align="left">As far as pushing boundaries of traditional fantasy, don't believe 
    it. This is what EVERY new RPG says. Traditionally, pushing the boundaries 
    of traditional fantasy entails:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Naming dragons &quot;wyrms&quot; or &quot;Legged Snakes Who 
    Braethe (sic) Fire.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">2. An incomprehensible and totally worthless attribute system.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Some sort of freaking robot towards the end of the game.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">What is a Persistent State World? Also referred 
    to as a PSW,</font></p>
  <p align="left">Ok, hold it right there. Who exactly also refers to it as PSW? 
    I mean, come on. The game is barely off the ground and already the Lord British 
    ego comes shining through. </p>
  <p align="left">Player: I hear UO is a Persistent Gaming World.</p>
  <p align="left">Player 2: What is that?</p>
  <p align="left">Player: You know, the PSW!</p>
  <p align="left">Player2: (smacks himself in the forehead) Of course! I am such 
    a newbie!</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">a Persistent State World is a virtual Internet 
    world that you co-inhabit with thousands of other people simultaneously. It’s 
    persistent in that the world exists independent of your presence, and in that 
    your actions can permanently shape the world. The fact that you are existing 
    with other real people from around the globe adds a level of immersion that 
    must be experienced to be believed.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Sure, we experience it every day. It's called the internet. 
    This is groundbreaking (the klaknak says in a New York Jewish accent)?</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">There will literally be people from around the 
    globe playing? Yes. Currently Ultima Online has players from every time zone 
    in the world, and UO2 will be no different. This is one of the coolest aspects 
    of a PSW.</font></p>
  <p align="left">What ... the ... fuck (sorry kiddies). First, what is intrinsically 
    cool about playing with people from different time zones? Second, how is this 
    groundbreaking? </p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">What about UO2 is going to make it great? In 
    the most general terms, UO2 is going to be great because it is being developed 
    by one of the most experienced teams in the industry.</font></p>
  <p align="left">They have more experience than anyone in releasing games way 
    too early and then sitting back as guys name BillGateZ kill everyone. They 
    also have more experience creating PK flagging systems that are so complex 
    that the world's greatest physicists have been known to use the equations 
    to gain tenure.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">More specifically, it will set a new standard 
    in graphics and gameplay. Using the latest in 3D technology, UO2 will provide 
    the most immersive and amazing environments to date. The UO2 team boasts unprecedented 
    online game design experience, and so UO2 will provide a cutting-edge massively 
    multiplayer environment, including features that have yet to be seen in online 
    gaming.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Like what? Wyrms? More convoluted flagging systems? Complex 
    vegetable economies?</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">What are some of the things I’ll be able to do 
    in the game? The possibilities are truly endless: Join an adventuring party 
    and loot perilous dungeons. Gather enough wealth to buy houses, mounts, pets, 
    or hirelings. Battle monsters, or compete and fight against fellow players. 
    Become a master craftsman by learning valuable trade skills such as tailoring 
    or cooking. Become an expert weapon smith and sell your array of deadly weapons 
    to the highest bidder. Master the art of magic and enlighten the minds of 
    young apprentices.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Ok, let's break this down.</p>
  <p align="left">1. Join an adventuring party and loot perilous dungeons - Get 
    together with other DoOds, camp in dungeons and kill everyone coming in.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Gather enough wealth to buy houses, mounts, pets and hirelings 
    - Use any number of exploitz (available due to horrible code) to buy crappy 
    houses that litter the countryside, mounts that slow down the servers, pets 
    that have the AI of peanut butter and hirelings that sit by your house all 
    day ripping off newbies.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Battle monsters - If you are lucky enough to find a monster 
    within a 500 mile radius, that is.</p>
  <p align="left">4. Compete against fellow players - kill newbies.</p>
  <p align="left">5. Become a master craftsman by ... cackle ... um ... bwahahahah 
    ... excuse me. Ahem. Become a master tradesmen by learning valuable trade 
    skills such as ... ahem ... bwahaha ... tailoring or ... bwahahah ... cooking! 
    BWAHAHAH!</p>
  <p align="left">6. Become an expert weapons smith - Along with 1,000,000's of 
    other people. Two years after you have enough skill to make a Big Sword, they 
    are selling to the highest bidder for 2 gold. Thank you exploitz!</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">7. Master the art of magic and enlighten the 
    minds of young apprentices. -</font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <div align="left" class="klakstyle"><font size="3">Newbie - Hail can you help 
    me, master mage?</font></div>
  <div align="left" class="klakstyle"><font size="3">Master Mage - Corp Por.</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div align="center" class="klakstyle">
  <p align="left"><font size="2">I’m new to this type of game, will there be help 
    provided? Absolutely. On top of a full-time staff that is there to help you 
    with any questions or problems,</font></p>
  <p align="left">(gargling sounds) ... (choking sounds) ... BWAHAHAHAHAHHA!</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">there will be a complete tutorial that will walk 
    you through every aspect of playing UO2.</font></p>
  <p align="left">You log on and a tutorial tells you how to don a shirt. Then 
    you are on your own!</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Will I be able to go on quests? UO2 will feature 
    a robust 'quest engine',</font></p>
  <p align="left">BWAHAHAHAH ... choking ... dying! Someone help me! Argh! Bwahahah! 
    Cough cough wheeze.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">which will provide exciting and interesting things 
    to do for all types of players.</font></p>
  <p align="left">... can't breathe ... need oxygen ... help ... bwahahahaha...</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">The culmination of these quests is the Path of 
    the Avatar, where players can choose to live by and enforce the eight Virtues 
    from classic Ultima - or they can deny the Virtues and walk the path of evil.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Kill other players and win a neat sash! Kill other players killing 
    other players and win a neat sash!</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Between that, the endless number of events, and 
    a world full of tense political intrigue, you’ll never be without something 
    fun and exciting to do in the game.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Political intrigue = telling your friends that BillGatez likes 
    to hang out in Despair and loot your kills before killing you.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">What kind of characters will I be able to play? 
    There are 3 distinct fantasy races in UO2, including human. Playing as one 
    of these races, you are free to choose what class of character you want to 
    develop through an innovative point-based role-playing system.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Clearly, this is where the innovative take on traditional fantasy 
    will rise to prominence. Hmmm ... let me guess:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Human (called a Luteran in order to break the traditional 
    fantasy mold).</p>
  <p align="left">2. Elf like creature (named Velves)</p>
  <p align="left">3. Some sort of evil lizard thing (named Slzyvyxyzyzy)</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">What are the differences from the first UO? The 
    differences are many, all of which would be beyond the scope of this initial 
    FAQ to clarify.</font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;We have no freaking idea. We need to pull people off of 
    the latest Ultima installment to work on it.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">One of the major differences is that it is 3D, 
    whereas UO is 2D. UO2 also has a very different feature set, which will be 
    detailed in future FAQs.</font></p>
  <p align="left">3-D. Thank GOD! I knew spending money on the Voodoo3 was well 
    spent. Wait, what was that? Voodoo 4? What the hell is motion antialiasing?</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">Is there going to be any external testing? There 
    will be a series of external tests starting in the near future. The testing 
    positions available in the 1st phases of these tests will be open exclusively 
    to current Ultima Online players. Please be sure to sign up on the mailing 
    list and check back here often to stay updated.</font></p>
  <p align="left">I think I will opt out and instead jab a fork in my scrotum.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">What will happen with Ultima Online when UO2 
    ships? Ultima Online will continue on as it has for the past 2 years, with 
    more support and work than ever before.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Oh, come on now. Why is the latest Ultima installment taking 
    so long to ship? Because they took all the designers from the project and 
    put them on UO. Does this sound like a company that will give a rat's ass 
    about an older product? Support = email system.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">The next major advancements to the world of Ultima 
    Online are currently in the works, which you can read more about by clicking 
    here.</font></p>
  <p align="left">I don't even have to click there. Let me guess: some weird swamp 
    monsters and another dungeon. Oh ... oh .. and a new set of armor called Mesh.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">I’m an Ultima Online player right now and I have 
    some questions about this game, where should I go? On the Ultima Online website, 
    we’ve provided an additional set of questions that are likely to be asked 
    by current UO players. Please feel free to peruse this additional FAQ by clicking 
    here.</font></p>
</div>
<p align="left">No thanks. I think I see what is going on here.</p>
