  <p>Dumb, Dumber, Dumbest - by Bradzinoa</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Well, after hearing many tales of the things in befallen that 
    I could get, I decided to go there at 1:00 am. By the way my name is Bradzinoa, 
    and at the time I was a level 16 Dark Elf Magician. Having just reached level 
    seventeen and having somewhere around three hundred something hit points (with 
    shielding and items). So, while in Nektulos, I shout for people to go to befallen 
    with me. What I get is 2 casters, level 12 and 9. So we find our way to befallen. 
    I bind my self just outside of the zone line. We go in. We head straight for 
    skeleton Llrodd - because people told me that's who has the keys. we kick 
    the sh*t out of Llrodd and some others who are there and I proceed to meditate. 
    While I'm waiting, my groupmates start to talking. Eventually, they come to 
    the question "What's down this hole?". "Lets jump down and find out" the level 
    12 says. I'll go says the level 9. "Wait," says the level 12, "who has the 
    most hit points?" That was me, and so I told them. "Well, get going" they 
    tell me. So I jump up, and try to creep over on the edge. As I'm getting closer 
    to the edge and looking down I realize this is the hole of death my friend 
    told me about while reading Idiot Files Gold. Just as I realized that, I fell 
    in, and got hurt for much damage. I turned around and saw a ghoul and an "Icebone" 
    skeleton. Luckily they hadn't seen me. "Good," I thought, "I can gate then." 
    I wasn't that lucky. My pet got down the hole in time for the monsters to 
    get really angry. Suffice it to say - I died (and lost my newly found level). 
    I asked them to try to summon my corpse up, after I gave them consent. I see 
    the words "Uh oh" come up on my group talk. And the level 12 bites the dust. 
    The level 9 tells us she thinks she can summon the level 12's corpse as it's 
    right at the bottom. She falls in, screams, and well, has a long run from 
    Nektulos. So, being the smart guy I am, I go to EC and try to find help. Well, 
    this level 12 guy who's ass I saved earlier gives me a tell and says that 
    there's a lvl 19 troll who'll help - they're in the same guild. He comes and 
    to help us. we go in, destroy all the stuff around the hole, then prepare 
    to go down. I use an eye of zomm to see if the monsters are there. The eye 
    is swiftly killed. I send another one down. Yay, no more monsters, the others 
    hastily jump in. As the lvl 12 loots his body the icebone skell returns with 
    backup. Well, we try again. The troll gets his corpse and so does the lvl 
    12. they gate just as the monsters come down the hallway, 3rd attempt. I go 
    down with troll, he holds off Icebone as long as possible. he ends up gating, 
    and I die. The troll decides to log. It's past 3 am. I'm in trouble. Before 
    he goes he tells me it's clear. I have no idea how he knew, but I went down, 
    very scared. Picked up most of the stuff on my corpse. with 2 things left 
    to loot (stuff that wasn't too important) I could feel the monsters closing 
    in, so I just gated with too much fear to stay. Well, that was the last time 
    I grouped with anyone more than a level below me. Finally, after 3 hours of 
    hard work, I ended up a level lower, with less stuff, and plenty of fear of 
    that place. At least the next wasn't as bad (until we drew an entire hallway 
    of stuff from the 2nd locked door) - but that's a story for another time.
