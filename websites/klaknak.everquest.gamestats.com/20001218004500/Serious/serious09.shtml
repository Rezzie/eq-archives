        <p><font class="TitleNormal">Gaming Girls: The World's Sexiest Woman</font></p>
        <p><font class="BasicFont">by the Cackling Klaknak</font></p>
      </center>
      <br>
      <font class="BasicFont"> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>As part of my continuing attempt to educate as well as entertain, I 
          will talk about a few more absolute truths and then bring these truths 
          together to argue that gaming girls are the world's sexiest women. </p>
        <p>In an earlier essay, I mentioned that generalizations are stupid. For 
          example, I go out into the world and see 3 or 4 hypocritical Christians. 
          I therefore conclude that all Christians are hypocritical.</p>
        <p>Clearly, this is wrong. Such overgeneralizations lead to the false 
          belief that there are absolutes in the universe. Universal truths do 
          not exist (except, maybe, for the fact that Computer Fishing Games suck).</p>
        <p>What does exist in the universe is probability. Everything in the universe 
          is based on probability. So, you can never really say all Christians 
          are hypocrites even if you think they are because there always may be 
          a nonhypocrite just around the corner. Instead, you may say (with increasing 
          certainty but never absolute certainty) that a certain percentage of 
          Christians are hypocrites.</p>
        <p>So, what the fuck does this have to do with gaming girls? Plenty, but 
          let me digress a little more.</p>
        <p>Every person is also made up of probabilities and you can pick up on 
          these probabilities by putting together clues about a person. To use 
          an extreme example, if you see someone with a laptop, the probability 
          is extremely low that he is a ditchdigger.</p>
        <p>Or, to use an example closer to the topic at hand, if you are a gamer 
          guy and you see a woman with a neat leather handbag, you will never 
          score. Don't even try.</p>
        <p>Why is that? Because that Eddie Bauer handbag has attached to it a 
          string of probabilities that correlate with it. For example, she is 
          probably some accountant wonk at a big corporation and thinks blow jobs 
          are kinky. She is probably looking for a man with a neat haircut. Granted, 
          none of this is a certainty ... nothing ever is (which was the point 
          of my preceding ramble). But, if you start putting together that handbag 
          with her expensive make up and her beginner model BMW, you can become 
          more and more certain that she will not have a thing to do with you.</p>
        <p>And I don't care how hot she is ... I don't care how desperate you 
          are ... ultimately, that just flat out isn't sexy. She can be sexy in 
          the sense that she is physically attractive, but for me, nothing shuts 
          down the main pipeline faster than seeing a physically attractive woman 
          with the charisma and attitude of someone who is contrary to everything 
          I believe in including, but not limited to, the dating of me. Call her 
          hot, call her fine, but she is not sexy.</p>
        <p>Enter the gaming girl. Today, our model is the incredibly cute PsychoCat 
          from <a href="http://www.gamegirlz.com/interact/psychocat.shtml" target="_blank">Gamer 
          Girlz</a>:</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="../Images/psychocat.gif" width="150" height="213"></p>
        <p>PsychoCat is ... a gaming girl.</p>
        <p>Now, what is it about a gaming girl that is so sexy? It is this: whenever 
          you meet a girl who plays computer games, you are opening up a whole 
          realm of interests and activities that ... gasp ... mirror your own.</p>
        <p>What? Is it possible to have sex with someone who actually enjoys doing 
          what you enjoy doing? Yes, yes it is. And it is incredibly sexy. Now, 
          I have to be nice because the lovely PsychoCat is married and pregnant, 
          but someone like PsychoCat is simply someone I would love to meet because 
          it is likely that with a gaming girl, I will get the following much 
          sought after attributes:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>1. No fucking cosmopolitan magazines in the bathroom.</p>
          <p>2. No kooky pro-conservative philosophies (aka Pat Buchanan wonk 
            debates).</p>
          <p>3. An avid interest in gaming.</p>
          <p>4. If an RPG fan, a probable interest in fantasy literature, sci 
            fi, Magic: The Gathering and other RPG things.</p>
          <p>5. Intellectually superior to her nongaming sisters.</p>
          <p>6. That whole tomboy thing. While times are changing, meeting a girl 
            who loves games is still like meeting a girl who can recite Brett 
            Favre's QB rating.</p>
          <p>7. Cool clothes.</p>
          <p>8. Tattoos.</p>
          <p>9. The appeal of having sex with someone who enjoys disemboweling 
            aliens with rail guns.</p>
          <p>10. A really good, usually off beat personality (and this is a good 
            thing, stop making fun).</p>
          <p>11. A greater probability she will expose a nipple and send it to 
            you via email or MIRC.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Face it people, this is sexy. When you meet one of these women, the 
          sexual tension is as palpable as holding a killer MTG hand, because 
          deep down, below all her cuteness, the gamer girl is utterly and hopelessly 
          COOL.</p>
        <p>Compare her to a normal woman. This is what you get with a normal woman 
          (and here come the overgeneralizations, true believers):</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>1. Cosmopolitan surveys</p>
          <p>2. Taking her to an expensive restaurant because you have to, not 
            because you want to.</p>
          <p>3. Boring conversations about banking and/or &quot;the relationship&quot;</p>
          <p>4. Having to wear Eddie Bauer to please her.</p>
          <p>5. Begging her to have sex in the school library or car or at a dinner 
            party.</p>
          <p>6. Seeing pre-engagement psychological counselors and working with 
            Meyers Briggs workbooks.</p>
          <p>7. Watching .... (the Klaknak screams)...</p>
          <p>8. Watching ... (the Klaknak screams)</p>
          <p>9. Watching Ally McBeal there I said it (the Klaknak passes out from 
            the effort).</p>
          <p>10. Discussing Ally McBeal and how it applies to &quot;the relationship&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I dont care HOW sexy the woman may seem to be, but let me tell you 
          from personal experience. You can date one of the most beautiful women 
          in the world, but once the sex loses its appeal, you are in deep deep 
          shit. And if you happened to get married ... oh boy.</p>
        <p>So let's talk about and sing praises of the gaming girl. The gaming 
          girl is the sexiest and most desirable girl on the planet. She is the 
          sexiest and most desirable girl on the planet not because she is the 
          only one who will go out with us but because she is the only one who 
          is capable of living at our level (whatever the hell that is). She understands 
          us because she is us.</p>
        <p>I have talked with both normal girls and with gaming girls over email, 
          and I can tell you hands down that gaming girls are by far more interesting 
          and ... heck ... smarter than the other girls out there. Email a gaming 
          girl and you will see. Instead of talking about bullshit you don't want 
          to talk about, you will probably find out that you have a ton of similar 
          interests because ...</p>
        <p>Returning back to my long, dry philosophical account above ...</p>
        <p>A gaming girl is more likely to have the same interests as you. And 
          whether you are seeking meaningless sex prior to meaningless gameplay, 
          a relationship, or marriage, you don't need to fill out surveys or go 
          to bars ... you simply need to scour the gaming world for the greatest 
          women on earth.</p>
        <p>Ode to the gaming girl!</p>
        <p>Sing her praises!</p>
