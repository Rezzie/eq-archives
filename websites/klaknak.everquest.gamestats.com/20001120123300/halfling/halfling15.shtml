  <p align="center">General Malignant - by Kneewhacker </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">One fateful day, some Minotaurs decided to form up in a troupe 
    behind their leader General Malignant, and do an eight mile hike around Steamfont. 
    Minotaurs, being rather rigidly militant (and none too bright, something like 
    a democrat), are wont to do this sort of thing from time to time, just for 
    physical conditioning purposes, you understand. </p>
  <p align="left">All was going well, young gnomes and gnomettes were dying by 
    the dozen, as most fingerwaggling gnomes and gnomettes are wont to do when 
    confronted with several tons of angry homo bovinus, when General Malignant 
    heard a tiny voice from atop the highest peak in Steamfont. </p>
  <p align="left">"I'm wee red Kneewhacker of the Glen! Send up your best slaver 
    and I'll send down 'is head!" </p>
  <p align="left">The General turned to his Hero and said, "Send up my best slaver, 
    I want that gnomes head!" </p>
  <p align="left">Well up the hill that slaver went, and in two shakes of kobolds 
    tail, down came his head. </p>
  <p align="left">"I'm wee red Kneewhacker of the Glen! Send up your best two 
    Guards, and I'll send down their 'eads!" </p>
  <p align="left">General Malignant turned to the Hero and said," Send up my best 
    three Guards, I want that gnomes head!" </p>
  <p align="left">Up the hill the Generals best three guards went and bumpity-bump-bump 
    come down their heads.</p>
  <p align="left"> "I'm wee red Kneewhacker of the Glen! Send up your whole damn 
    army, for I'm properly warmed up and ready for some sport! And if thats not 
    enough incentive, I have some Minotaur Steaks up here I'll share with you 
    to build your strength, you hosers!" </p>
  <p align="left">General Malignant turned to the Hero and said, "Take the army 
    up there and BRING ME THAT GNOMES HEAD!!!" </p>
  <p align="left">So the Hero and the rest of the troupe went running up the hill 
    and there was the worst skreeking and howling and carrying on you could imagine 
    for a couple of minutes, and then the Hero, bloody, beaten, and in that low 
    health slow motion stagger you all know so well, came down the peak with Kneewhacker 
    hot on his heels.</p>
  <p align="left"> Just before he died he spoke. "Run General! It's a trap! There's 
    two of them!" </p>
