        <p>Most of this stuff is probably pretty common and not very new or original, 
          but I had told these stories to others and they liked them, so I thought 
          I would send them, just for the fun of it. The thing that may separate 
          them from other stories is that I am not really recalling these things 
          from long ago. I am very much a newbie, having been playing EverQuest 
          for a little over a week. Just a way to see through a true (and very 
          frightened) newbie's eyes. So, here we go, in no particular order (just 
          as I remember them). 
        <p>All of these took place when I played on the Saryn server as Kilgallen, 
          Gnome Rogue (all my C's are Gnome Rogues) except for the one about how 
          I fell in the water. I've already forgotten his name.</p> 
        <center>* * *</center>
        <p>The very first time I played EverQuest, within a few seconds of starting 
          in Ak'anon, I walked through the waterfall and fell into the water and 
          was lost for about five minutes. I finally got out, but it was still 
          too dark to see and I continually fell in. I finally decided to not 
          be stupid and turn up the gamma correction. By the time I had done that, 
          my swimming was pretty good. 
        <p>I have actually had about four or five characters. The reason I started 
          over was because I lost the letter I started out with that I was to 
          give to the Rogue Guild boss. Little did I know, when I was looting 
          my dead bodies, I was looking at the wrong slots. Instead of seeing 
          the pretty obvious loot slots, I saw my current inventory slots and 
          decided, 'Hey, I guess it's gone.' I think I went through three guys 
          before I figured that out. 
        <p>One of my first fighting experiences as Kilgallen was in the mines 
          of Ak'anon (I love that place), playing with a newbie necro I had met. 
          He had conjured up a skeleton with some bone chips I thankfully had 
          on a previous dead body. So, we decided to take on some of the decaying 
          gnomes down there. Good idea, I said. We looked around until we had 
          found one, and attacked. The necro's skeleton buddy went down, one hit, 
          I went down, one hit. When I spawned again, there was my necro friend. 
          I have no idea what happened. I think one of the necro guild guys had 
          made that skele super, but I still don't know. It didn't end there. 
          For those that have never been to Ak'anon to get to the mines, you have 
          to go down a pretty steep little slope next to a cliff. Usually I just 
          drop off the lip and land close to the top of the slope, then sort of 
          slide down to the mine. On the way back to get my stuff, I dropped a 
          little too far down the cliff, and missed the slope. I was dead again. 
          On my way back, the server died. My friend and I decided that my stuff 
          wasn't really worth it anymore. 
        <p>We had decided to go outside after that and fight in the Steamfonts, 
          where there were rats we could fight. I think I died a few times, but 
          nothing special. Now, I'm not sure of the order, but some nasty things 
          happened to me out there.
        <p> I was fighting with another guy (I think) up by the druid ring and 
          all of a sudden, this huge troll comes out of nowhere (how easy is that 
          for a troll to do), comes running up to me, and as I'm blinking, slices 
          me down like nothing. It was Bugglebup, and it is some sort of quest 
          monster. I was reading about it and people said they could never found 
          it. Well, my level one guy found it alright. That was a scary experience, 
          tell you that much. I was deathly afraid of going back to get my corpse. 
          But my friend confirmed it was gone, so I (slowly) went to fetch it. 
        <p>Another occurrence with the same guy was when he decided to fight an 
          infected rat. I jumped in. I got diseased and died. If memory serves 
          me, I had gone back and gotten my stuff when all of a sudden, a kobold 
          shaman jumped out of nowhere. I was hit with a few spells, and I took 
          off for the guards. Nothing happened for a while, so I figured I was 
          outrunning him and would be soon safe. Wrong. Blam, a disease spell 
          hit me out of nowhere, and the sweet LOADING... message came up. Once 
          again, I spawned and creeped out to my stuff. Luckily, the shaman was 
          gone, and once again, my level one guy learned a lesson in destruction.
        <p> I've had problems, being a newbie, with how things work, the keys, 
          etc. Once I auto-attacked a Gemchoppers Guild guy while trying to talk 
          and he destroyed me. I decided that the book was right about re-mapping 
          that key. Another bad thing was a mix-up with the 'Run' button. I was 
          fighting a spiderling at...oh...probably second level. Of course, a 
          buddy comes to help him. I wasn't doing so well with one, and this other 
          wasn't helping. I decided to run while the running was good. So I took 
          off. But I kept getting hit. I figured the spiderlings were faster than 
          I thought. When I died, I noticed that I was still walking. Another 
          lesson learned. Never walk away from a fight. 
        <p>There was only one time that I ever successfully reached the guards. 
          I wanted to try my second level skills on some runaway clockworks. I 
          started fighting one. And, as per usual, a pal joined him. This time, 
          I was set to run, and I ran like the wind. I regenerated as I went, 
          going for the guards, when I noticed that I should have seen the tunnel 
          to Ak'anon, where the guards are, already. Luckily, in my haste, I had 
          run quite a ways away from it. So I pulled off a U-turn, giving the 
          clockworks some time to bit me up all nice and raw again, then ran and 
          ran. I saw a house, so I knew I was close. Then I saw the lovely Watchmen, 
          waiting for my newbie self to bring some foe to them. I got there after 
          an eternity and they took care of it, but it was a close one. -Very- 
          close. And I will always love the guards from this day forth. 
        <p>Well, that's about it. Hope you found it insightful or at least a little 
          enjoyable. Maybe both. A lot can happen in a week, and this I know. 
          But, strangely, no matter how grisly my doom, it's still fun. And I 
          keep trying.

          Guy Called Kilgallen) <br>
