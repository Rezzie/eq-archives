  <p><i>&quot;Dear Ms. Thunderhammer<br>
    I write to you regarding a problem plaguing many females of Norrath. Being 
    a wood elf warrior, I yearn for nothing but to prove myself to my peers in 
    battle. However, I've noticed a large number of male warriors do not take 
    me seriously, and, often, make crude comments about my appearance. I opted 
    for a bronze breastplate early in my life, thinking the high neck would deter 
    some comments. Might it be the leather pants? Or do human men have a thing 
    for the pointy ears? My question is, Tall One, how may I prove my might as 
    a warrior among a gender-biased community?<br>
    </i><i>signed<br>
    pretty warrior&quot;</i> </p>
  <p>Dear pretty warrior,<br>
    First off I will try and contain my jealousy about how good you little wood 
    elves look in your outfits. As far as proving yourself in battle, I do have 
    some advice for you and this is from my experience. There are a couple of 
    ways to change the opinions of the men of Norrath to put fear in their hearts 
    instead of fire in their loins. The first is to prove yourself given the game 
    mechanics of a warrior. Nothing makes a guy say, ‘Holy Crap!’ like a big critical 
    for 100’s of points of damage or tanking a hill giant. I get exclamations 
    all the time when people see me critical or shrug off 100 point double attacks. 
    Secondly, wield the biggest, scariest weapon you can find. A lot of the new 
    kunark weapons are truly frightening in both their appearance and damage dealing 
    capabilities. I get comments all the time on how scary my executioner’s axe 
    looks. Third, prove yourself in battle like a true warrior. Take command of 
    any battle, issue orders, protect those wussy casters, and always be the last 
    to flee or zone. The guys will note your courage in battle, believe me. My 
    motto on my character bio is ‘I take the damage so you don’t have to.’ Lastly, 
    and this may be the most difficult, is to not act feminine. I mean, honestly, 
    what true warrior born, male or female acts feminine? Leave that stuff to 
    the casters. Swill beer between battles, curse a lot, do a lot of offense 
    emotes, and tell potential suitors that you will only accept a man if he can 
    best you in a duel. I guarantee that this will eliminate almost all of the 
    lame pickup lines, come ons, and offensive emotes you receive in-game. And 
    even those that you do receive will be done with respect and just a little 
    fear. And as all women know, having your man fear you for more than just a 
    couple days a month is a good thing.<br>

  <p><i>&quot;Hi Cyanna,<br>
    this is Zanto Lo'Vrin and I am dying for help. I have many things going on 
    in my life right now and it is throwing me off wack. I am currently under 
    mass sleep Deprivation due to those satanic games from hell: Icewind Dale 
    and Diablo2, not to mention I am in a currently "active" time in my life ( 
    getting punani if you don’t grasp me) and I also smoking sub par amounts of 
    cheeba then the norm. Do you have any advice for me? I’m gonna end up shooting 
    my computer, putting my foot up my girlfriends ass, dying from withdrawal 
    of weed, or getting insomnia. Help.&quot; </i></p>
  <p>Dear Zanto, <br>
    OK, first off, put down the keyboard and step away from the monitor. Now take 
    a couple of deep breaths, and think about your happy place. No, not that happy 
    place! Now it seems you have 3 problems, so lets break them down. <br>
    1. Sleep deprived from playing computer games – I am not even going to touch 
    this one. I am not the person to get advice from, since I only got 3 hours 
    of sleep last night because I played EQ until I got out of hell level 35 (Yay!) 
    <br>
    2. Punani – First off, I don’t grasp you and if I did it would only exacerbate 
    your problem. (And yes I know that word sounds dirty but it isn’t) Enjoy it 
    while you can. It will give you something to remember when you are old and 
    married like me. I swear, I get the oil changed in my car more than I have 
    sex and I am really bad about getting my oil changed. <br>
    3. Smoking cheeba – I will have to refer (or should that be spelled reefer) 
    you to some of the resident potheads on the messageboards for this one. I 
    have enough problems with my hormones screwing up my brain, I do not need 
    anything else in my body making me act strange.<br>
    In closing, I would advise laying off the weed and the computer games and 
    spending some quality time with your girlfriend. <br>

  <p>From the highly ignored paladin who wishes not to tell his name:</p>
    <p><i>&quot;Dear Queen of advice, Why does it seem no one likes paladins? 
      I mean, I go into Greater Faydark and ask for a group and am ridiculed out 
      of the zone. And then later yet I re-enter the zone and go to the bandit 
      camps and there are two really hot Wood Elves there, I ask if I could join 
      their group and they say no because I am a gay paladin. I never did anything 
      to signify I was gay!!!! I am not gay!!! I even go into zones and ask for 
      any females that want to group with me, (Note, I don't do this often because 
      of what some players remarks are). The one person in this game that I had 
      the courage to ask them to marry me, responded with a sharp blow to somewhere 
      I'd rather not mention! What can I do to make people like me more? Is it 
      my bronze helmet? The only piece of armor I have that is visible. That has 
      to be it, it makes me look stupid, like one of those Neriak guards. Is there 
      anything that I can do? People don't even pay attention to me!!! I am ignored, 
      cast into the world with shameful hatred. Anything you could do to help 
      would be appreciated.&quot; </i></p>
    <p>Dear ignored, <br>
      I’ll try and work with the information given here. It could be the bronze, 
      if you are one of the races that looks stupid in the bronze helmet (i.e. 
      high elves). It could be your name. If your name is something like Gayfeather 
      (apologies to Ralph Nike) it may make you undesirable to women and men alike 
      (or desirable to the wrong kind of men). But I think it is something else. 
      I am going to let you in on a secret. Women like bad boys. It’s true. I 
      have no idea why it is, and I have fallen under their charms in the past 
      as well. You paladins are just too good and pure. That’s why all the dark 
      elf shadowknights get all the chicks. So embrace the dark side, give into 
      your primal urges, and start being naughty! If you need any help, just visit 
      the messageboards.</p>

    <p><i>&quot;Dear Mrs-Funny-with-a-big-beating-stick Ah! your advice is truly 
      remarkable! I am that lonely Druid who couldn't find a friend. Well, I took 
      your advice and guess what. I met some one special! We like each other a 
      lot, but again, I'm too wussy to do something about it. What's the best 
      way to propose to this remarkable enchantress that's charmed my heart? I'm 
      a druid, she's an enchanter and we hang around Qeynos alot. Any ideas? I'd 
      appreciate em!&quot;</i></p>
    <p>Signed, Cold Paws in Qeynos</p>
    <p> Dear Cold Paws,<br>
      I’m happy for you. As for how to do it, you can try some tried and true 
      lines like ‘I’m charmed by you”, “You’ve mezzed me with your beauty”, “I 
      want to be your pet”, or “Guarding you with my life, O splendid one”. You 
      can take her on a moonlight cruise through the Ocean of Tears. You can buy 
      her expensive jewelry. Or you can just come out and ask her. And if that 
      does not work, change to wolf form and start humping her leg. Women love 
      that. </p>
