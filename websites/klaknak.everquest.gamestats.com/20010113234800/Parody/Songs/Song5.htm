  <p align=center>Proof that Freddy Mercury Played Everquest - by Zadkiel Hopeseeker</p>
  <hr>
  <p align=3D"center">Let us examine the lyrics of one of his songs. <br>
  </p>
  <p align=3D"center">Under close scrutiny, you will see that the Queen masterpeice, 
    Norrathian Rhapsody, is infact the story of his first day playing EQ. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Is this the real life?<br>
    Is this just fantasy?<br>
    Born at the west gate,<br>
    No escape to reality.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">The start of the story. He had obviously just created his 
    first character, a human starting in Freeport, and was pondering this strange 
    new land. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see,</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Little red flying carpets.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>I'm just a poor boy,<br>
    I need no sympathy,</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">/auction ne1 got nething 4 a newby?</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Because I'm easy come, easy go,<br>
    little high, little low,</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Freddy was obviously a bug exploiter. Here is a blatant reference 
    to using the 'falls through the world' teleports. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me,<br>
    to me.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">This was the point where he first realised the clouds always 
    travel in the same direction.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Mama, I just killed a man,</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">It becomes obvious that Freddy was playing on Rallos Zek. 
  </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Put a sword against his head,<br>
    chopped his head off, now he's dead.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">He must have been a warrior. Here he describes getting a critical 
    hit</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Mama, life had just begun,</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Once again mentions his newbie status </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>But now I've gone and thrown it all = away.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Ahh, the first death, and the sadness you feel before you 
    realise that death is not permanent</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry,</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">First discovery of the emote commands</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,<br>
    Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Camping out from the game for the first time.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Too late, my time has come,<br>
    Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Freddy gets poisoned. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Goodbye, ev'rybody,<br>
    I've got to go,<br>
    Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Hmm. Perhaps Freddy was in the Freeport Militia. Here is an 
    obvious reference to his fear of the Paladins (face the truth).</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,<br>
    I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Freddy gets sick of his Warrior, and decides to re-roll another. 
    The next section are his thoughts on the other classes/races. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>I see a little silhouette of a man,</em></p>
  <p align="left">A dark elf. He didn't realise that they actually have dark skin, 
    and thought he was looking at a shadow).</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Scaramouche, <br>
    Scaramouche,<br>
    will you do the Fandango?</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Thinking about starting a bard.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Decides against a druid.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>(Galileo.)<br>
    Galileo.<br>
    (Galileo.)<br>
    Galileo.<br>
    Galileo.<br>
    Figaro. Magnifico.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">All rejected by the name filter obviously. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.<br>
    He's just a poor boy from a poor family,<br>
    Spare him his life from this monstrosity.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">We see he has created another level 1 character. A troll by 
    the sounds of it.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br>
    Bismillah! No, we will not let you go.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Attempting to create his third character, Bismillah, he falls 
    foul of the name filter once again. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>(Let him go!) Bismillah!<br>
    We will not let you go. (Let him go!)<br>
    Bismillah! We will not let you go.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">In frustration at the name filter, Freddy tries twice more.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>(Let me go.) We'll not let you go.<br>
    (Let me go.) We'll not let you go.<br>
    (Let me go.) <br>
    Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Utter frustration sets in. By this time he is banging his 
    head against the wall. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>(Oh mama mia, mama mia.)<br>
    Mama mia, let me go.<br>
    Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Mamamia the Darkelf Necromancer is created.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Freddy, deciding he knows the Freeport area better than Neriak, 
    takes his new DE Necro there. Here is the point where he learns about faction, 
    and the Freeport city guards. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>So you think you can love me and leave me to die.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Yet again Freddy gets poisoned. Screaming for help, the human 
    clerics all gather around and watch him die slowly, while they debate the 
    ethics of healing a Dark Elf.</p>
  <p align=3D"center"><em>Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,<br>
    Just gotta get out,<br>
    just gotta get right outta here.</em></p>
  <p align=3D"left">We can see that Freddy gets to level 4. Here he mentions using 
    the Gate spell. </p>
  <p align=3D"center"><font color=3D"#000000"><em>Nothing really matters, anyone 
    can see,<br>
    Nothing really matters,<br>
    Nothing really matters to me.<br>
    Any way the wind blows.</em></font></p>
  <p align=3D"left">Addiction sets in. At this point he notices again the fact 
    that the clouds only move in one direction, but it no longer bothers him. 
    Freddy is in Verants world now</p>
