  <p align="center">ALWAYS re-bind yourself - by Bolenie, Eci server</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I have enjoyed this site for many months now. I have made all 
    the mistakes others make and died because of them but this one REALLY tops 
    them all. </p>
  <p align="left">Last night I went on my 2nd FG raid into SolB. For those of 
    you who havent done an FG raid they kill players even when 3 full groups of 
    45+'s attack. When it came time to kill Magi Roykl all us casters were told 
    to bind on the ramp. This is a common practice so that if you die you will 
    be closeby to roll for and loot the items. I did so and we finished the raid. 
    Everyone got ported out and I logged.</p>
  <p align="left"> Here is where I got stupid. :) The following morning I was 
    camping specs with my guild in OOT. we were taking them down with little effort 
    but a few members had RL issues and had to leave for a bit. It got down to 
    3 of us and we decided on one last pull before abandoning our camp. we pulled 
    2 specs, not too hard, killed one and another spawned. Okay now we are low 
    on mana and I am down to 1 bub. We yell gate and I train the specs off the 
    island. My 2 friends gate back to the Safety of Freeport while I confirm thier 
    whereabouts. When I decide they are safe I tell them I am gating. No biggie 
    afterall the 2 specs are WAY behind me :) oops...I forgot to Bind after the 
    raid! </p>
  <p align="left">Well guess what, I'm back in the FG lair right on the ramp. 
    Noone is around and no FG's :) I tell my group and they freak. I tell my guild 
    and they freak as well. Okay calm down, do an /ooc and ask for help...noone 
    is camping SS room. The FG's should be spawning soon. I was told to run for 
    my life to the SS room to die and get resd later. I did but the 1st FG WIZ 
    had respawned.</p>
  <p align="left"> I died and luckly 2 very nice people came to my rescue, dragged 
    my corpse to the zone and resd me...</p>
  <p align="left"> Note to self. ALWAYS re-bind yourself after an FG raid! :)
