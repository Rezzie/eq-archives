  <p><font size="4">Peregrine's Guide to EQ Message Boards</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">A note from Garg: &quot;Me like thank Peregrine for good guide. 
    It help Garg. Garg know who to eat now and who to save for later. Garg think 
    K3wlDood taste like Froot Loop. Role player make good pudding. Powergamer 
    give Garg gas but provide Garg with valuable fiber.&quot;</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Everquest message boards can be a confusing place for a newcomer. 
    This guide is meant to help straighten things out, by helping you identify 
    the types of people on a board and some of the lingo you may hear.</p>
  <p align="left">First, some common acronyms and terms you may come across.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;IMO, and IMHO&quot; -- These mean a person is indicating 
    that they are right, and everyone else is wrong.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;wtf?&quot; (This is always lower case on a message board) 
    -- The poster is confused about what something means.</p>
  <p align="left">flame -- Normal reply</p>
  <p align="left">rant -- Normal post</p>
  <p align="left">Twink -- Anyone who has better equipment in-game than you.</p>
  <p align="left">Verant -- Deity of the message board, alternately worshipped 
    and cursed at.</p>
  <p align="left">Powergamer -- Everyone on the board except you.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, let's discuss the common types of posters on the message 
    boards:</p>
  <p align="left">Kewldoods-- These posts will be difficult to read, and will 
    revolve around the letter u, as in "F*** u," "U suck," and "I ht u." Don't 
    worry about trying to correct their grammar or change their ways, junior high 
    school will do that for them.</p>
  <p align="left">Whiners -- These posts will begin with "I'm tired of...," "We 
    should petition Verant for...," and "Class X sucks because..." These kind 
    of people will see the bad side of any situation, and yet attract a large 
    following from otherwise sensible people.</p>
  <p align="left">Roleplayers -- Their posts will always begin with "This is an 
    IC message board, your post is OOC, you kewldood loser." Roleplay and in-character 
    behavior are very important to them on the board. In-game they will usually 
    be kewldoods (see above) or twinks (see above.) [Editor's Note: Ouch!]</p>
  <p align="left">Newbies -- These are people new to the board, who do not have 
    this training. Their posts will begin with "I don't have the game yet, which 
    class is best?" or "I don't have the game yet, but how long will it take for 
    me to camp for JBoots and then move on to camp the GCS for the RLT, which 
    is better than the XYZ, but I also want an ATR."</p>
  <p align="left">Merchants -- These people are interested in buying and selling 
    items. You can identify their posts by the fact that they never have text, 
    only a subject, which is usually, "Where can I get rubicite for my level 35 
    dwarf warrior?" or "Selling account, Lvl 35 dwarf warrior."</p>
  <p align="left">Jokers -- Most of their posts are jokes or parodies of EQ. You 
    can never read them, because within 10 minutes, the threads have 600 replies 
    of "LOL!" The best people, really, especially The Cackling Klaknak.</p>
  <p align="left">Bulk of the players of EQ -- Don't post at all, because they 
    don't have Internet access from work. </p>
