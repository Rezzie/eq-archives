  <p>Swimming and Diving - by Valor</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Fortunately, i seem to have made no newbie mistakes (dont ask 
    me how). Ok, i start up the game, make my dark elf thief, hooray! After about 
    level 12, i start getting bored as half my features arnt implemented yet and 
    i can no longer solo anything. My friend says his girlfriends monk can kill 
    will'o'wisps at level 8 by herself ("girls play EQ?!?" i ask in disbelief). 
    Human monk, here i come.</p>
  <p align="left">Turns out, you need magic gloves, and about level 10, so i have 
    a few deaths due to that, no big errors so far. Level 12 finds me on "Wisp 
    Island" on the ocean halfway to Erudin. I'm having fun killing wisps left 
    and right, making hordes of cash and lightstones. Time to sell i say to myself. 
    Hmmm, player market for selling the stones isn't very good on site, neither 
    do the cat people offer very generous sums. Off to town. Lucky me, boat zoning 
    isnt stable at this point. I hit the zone border and get booted back to windows. 
    Close internet connection, recconect, run EQ, login, choose server, choose 
    character and appear! I find myself back on the boat, headed to Qeynos. Curses! 
    Oh well, I get better prices in Qeynos anyways. Hit the zone border, POOF! 
    Windows. Relog asap. YES! I'm still in the Qeynos zone. Crap! The boats moving! 
    Quick, jump off! LOADING PLEASE WAIT... (now i'm really cursing, out loud, 
    very loud) SHOCK! The game doesnt crash! (This seems to get me even more mad 
    though).</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, boat appears, I appear, boat isnt moving, it's waiting for 
    other passengers to appear. Quick, jump off the boat and zone into Qeynos 
    harbour, it's not that long a swim to shore.... Apparently, the oceans are 
    only accessible and escapeable by boat (or teleport). Hooray for me, i spend 
    20 minutes swiming along the zone edge before i figure that out. A nice GM 
    teleported me out of there after another 30 minutes of treading water. By 
    the way, in case you didnt know, you dont automatically drown if you run out 
    of stamina while swimming. Which turns out to the only high point in my story 
    of water safety ignorance (aside from my swim skill maxing out for level 12).</p>
