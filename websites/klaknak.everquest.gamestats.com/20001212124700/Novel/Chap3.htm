  <hr>
  <p align="left">&quot;Freeport, City of Humans,&quot; said my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">I was off in a corner throwing up.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I didn't realize you were seasick,&quot; said my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">I coughed and wiped my face.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I'm not,&quot; I said. &quot;It's this blasted nubile 
    food.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Newbie. It's called &quot;newbie.&quot;&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Whatever,&quot; I said. &quot;It tastes like radishes, 
    peanut butter and mayonaisse.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Need I remind you the whole reason you are here is because 
    you ate a rice and salad sandwich?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">He had me there. Um ... it had me there.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What gender are you, sandwich?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Don't impose your belief system on me,&quot; it replied.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Fine,&quot; I said and began perusing my surroundings. 
    I was near a large gate guarded by two guards and swarming with all kinds 
    of strange looking people and crazy critters. A tiny little woman named Giblet 
    ran by with a floating ... tornado? ... moving effortlessly behind her. That 
    would have surprised earlier, but ...</p>
  <p align="left">I don't know if it was my recent vomit or a new sense of peace, 
    but I was slowly getting used to the idea that I was stuck where I was stuck 
    until I did something about it. Somewhere in the back of my mind a jolly little 
    leprachaun was spreading the news to all my synapses and cells that what I 
    was experiencing was in fact NOT a hallucination but was a new kind of reality. 
    My synapses seemed happy with the news, eager to begin transferring new juices 
    and establishing new connections, and even my cells (with the exception of 
    the Golgi apparati, who were on strike) seemed to look forward to the adventure.</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact, I began looking forward to the adventure 
    a little bit. Even though I was loathe to admit it to any of my friends, I 
    had played a few computer games when I was younger, and here I was planted 
    right in the middle of one. Perhaps it was time to have a little fun. Again, 
    I don't know if this was the vomit talking, but I felt ... pretty good ... 
    and I felt my old self slowly returning to my body.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;So what do I do now?&quot; I asked. &quot;Where is this 
    Lady Vox?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;First things first,&quot; said my sandwich. &quot;You 
    will need a bind, so that if you die, you won't end up being teleported back 
    to Kelethin.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok, whatever you say, sandwich.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">A sleepy guard looked at me warily.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Could someone bind me please?&quot; I yelled.</p>
  <p align="left">First, there was silence. Then, like a rumbling freight train 
    of schizophrenics crashing into a talk radio station, noise:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I wil binr you at WWest Gat e for donation.s Meet me at 
    est Gate&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I, sire, thou bindest you.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Use auction, you idiot.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I will bind for donation. 1 plat. And selling 5 FGT for 
    10p&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I will beind for donation plaerse.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I will bind.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">All of this clamored in my mind. It was worse than Kelethin. 
    I started screaming and running in circles.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Make it stop! Make it stop!&quot; I screamed at my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Tell them you have no money ... which is true.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I have no money!&quot; I shouted.</p>
  <p align="left">Imagine, if you will, an atomic blast. Then, run the audio backwards. 
    That is how quickly the noise ceased.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh, thank you sandwich. Thank you.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Again, the guard eyeballed me.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Sure thing,&quot; said the sandwich. &quot;But you really 
    do have no money.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">He had a point there. But I have been there before.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No problem,&quot; I said. &quot;Is there a hospital here? 
    I can go donate some platelets or semen or something. Cystic Fibrosis, heart 
    disease, and Chronic Body Failure (CBF) runs in my family, but there is no 
    history of baldness on my mother's side, so I usually make mint donating semen.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No hospitals,&quot; said my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Damn,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">Crickets chirped in the vacant hall of my mind.</p>
  <p align="left">No money. No bind.</p>
  <p align="left">So for the next ten days, my sandwich and I sat at the West 
    Gate of Freeport waiting for a bind. The guard continued to look at me warily, 
    so I began looking at him warily. Soon, we had some kind of &quot;staring 
    warily&quot; contest going, but I forget the result.</p>
  <p align="left">Then, one day:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I will bind you,&quot; said a short female dwarf with 
    a beard.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Excellent!&quot; I said, and I jumped up.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Excellent!&quot; someone else said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Join my group,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Um, ok,&quot; I replied. Soon, I felt like I was a member 
    of her group. It was a very odd feeling, not unlike being in love, but more 
    like being stuck on a plane with someone for 18 hours.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok,&quot; someone else replied.</p>
  <p align="left">The dwarf sat for a few minutes and then stood up again. She 
    began chanting and then she waved her arms about. Soon, all these little sparkly 
    things began crawling up and down my body, caressing my skin and groinal area. 
    It was very nice.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Thanks!&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;That will be 1 plat,&quot; she said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;But I said I had no money,&quot; I told her.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What?&quot; she said. And then she noticed a human of 
    some kind standing behind her.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Fdsc!&quot; she said. &quot;I bound the wrong person.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;But I really have no money.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Well thanks for using up my mana, you fsdf!&quot; she 
    snorted, and then turned towards the other guy. I no longer felt like I was 
    a member of her group.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;But I can change,&quot; I said ... out of instinct, really. 
    &quot;I will start picking my socks up off the floor.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">But she ignored me.</p>
  <p align="left">Sighing, I turned towards my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok,&quot; I said. &quot;I am bound. What now?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Now,&quot; my sandwich said. &quot;We go kill rats.&quot;</p>
