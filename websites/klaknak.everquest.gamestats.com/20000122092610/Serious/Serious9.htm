  <p>Gaming Girls: The World's Sexiest Woman</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">As part of my continuing attempt to educate as well as entertain, 
    I will talk about a few more absolute truths and then bring these truths together 
    to argue that gaming girls are the world's sexiest women.</p>
  <p align="left">In an earlier essay, I mentioned that generalizations are stupid. 
    For example, I go out into the world and see 3 or 4 hypocritical Christians. 
    I therefore conclude that all Christians are hypocritical.</p>
  <p align="left">Clearly, this is wrong. Such overgeneralizations lead to the 
    false belief that there are absolutes in the universe. Universal truths do 
    not exist (except, maybe, for the fact that Computer Fishing Games suck).</p>
</div>
<p align="left">What does exist in the universe is probability. Everything in 
  the universe is based on probability. So, you can never really say all Christians 
  are hypocrites even if you think they are because there always may be a nonhypocrite 
  just around the corner. Instead, you may say (with increasing certainty but 
  never absolute certainty) that a certain percentage of Christians are hypocrites.</p>
<p align="left">So, what the fuck does this have to do with gaming girls? Plenty, 
  but let me digress a little more.</p>
<p align="left">Every person is also made up of probabilities and you can pick 
  up on these probabilities by putting together clues about a person. To use an 
  extreme example, if you see someone with a laptop, the probability is extremely 
  low that he is a ditchdigger.</p>
<p align="left">Or, to use an example closer to the topic at hand, if you are 
  a gamer guy and you see a woman with a neat leather handbag, you will never 
  score. Don't even try.</p>
<p align="left">Why is that? Because that Eddie Bauer handbag has attached to 
  it a string of probabilities that correlate with it. For example, she is probably 
  some accountant wonk at a big corporation and thinks blow jobs are kinky. She 
  is probably looking for a man with a neat haircut. Granted, none of this is 
  a certainty ... nothing ever is (which was the point of my preceding ramble). 
  But, if you start putting together that handbag with her expensive make up and 
  her beginner model BMW, you can become more and more certain that she will not 
  have a thing to do with you.</p>
<p align="left">And I don't care how hot she is ... I don't care how desperate 
  you are ... ultimately, that just flat out isn't sexy. She can be sexy in the 
  sense that she is physically attractive, but for me, nothing shuts down the 
  main pipeline faster than seeing a physically attractive woman with the charisma 
  and attitude of someone who is contrary to everything I believe in including, 
  but not limited to, the dating of me. Call her hot, call her fine, but she is 
  not sexy.</p>
<p align="left">Enter the gaming girl. Today, are model is the incredibly cute 
  PsychoCat from <a href="http://www.gamegirlz.com/interact/psychocat.shtml">Gamer 
  Girz</a>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../Images/psychocat.gif" width="150" height="213"></p>
<p align="left">PsychoCat is ... a gaming girl.</p>
<p align="left">Now, what is it about a gaming girl that is so sexy? It is this: 
  whenever you meet a girl who plays computer games, you are opening up a whole 
  realm of interests and activities that ... gasp ... mirror your own.</p>
<p align="left">What? Is it possible to have sex with someone who actually enjoys 
  doing what you enjoy doing? Yes, yes it is. And it is incredibly sexy. Now, 
  I have to be nice because the lovely PsychoCat is married and pregnant, but 
  someone like PsychoCat is simply someone I would love to meet because it is 
  likely that with a gaming girl, I will get the following much sought after attributes:</p>
<p align="left">1. No fucking cosmopolitan magazines in the bathroom.</p>
<p align="left">2. No kooky pro-conservative philosophies (aka Pat Buchanan wonk 
  debates).</p>
<p align="left">3. An avid interest in gaming.</p>
<p align="left">4. If an RPG fan, a probable interest in fantasy literature, sci 
  fi, Magic: The Gathering and other RPG things.</p>
<p align="left">5. Intellectually superior to her nongaming sisters.</p>
<p align="left">6. That whole tomboy thing. While times are changing, meeting 
  a girl who loves games is still like meeting a girl who can recite Brett Favre's 
  QB rating.</p>
<p align="left">7. Cool clothes.</p>
<p align="left">8. Tattoos.</p>
<p align="left">9. The appeal of having sex with someone who enjoys disemboweling 
  aliens with rail guns.</p>
<p align="left">10. A really good, usually off beat personality (and this is a 
  good thing, stop making fun).</p>
<p align="left">11. A greater probability she will expose a nipple and send it 
  to you via email or MIRC.</p>
<p align="left">Face it people, this is sexy. When you meet one of these women, 
  the sexual tension is as palpable as holding a killer MTG hand, because deep 
  down, below all her cuteness, the gamer girl is utterly and hopelessly COOL.</p>
<p align="left">Compare her to a normal woman. This is what you get with a normal 
  woman (and here come the overgeneralizations, true believers):</p>
<p align="left">1. Cosmopolitan surveys</p>
<p align="left">2. Taking her to an expensive restaurant because you have to, 
  not because you want to.</p>
<p align="left">3. Boring conversations about banking and/or &quot;the relationship&quot;</p>
<p align="left">4. Having to wear Eddie Bauer to please her.</p>
<p align="left">5. Begging her to have sex in the school library or car or at 
  a dinner party.</p>
<p align="left">6. Seeing pre-engagement psychological counselors and working 
  with Meyers Briggs workbooks.</p>
<p align="left">7. Watching .... (the Klaknak screams)...</p>
<p align="left">8. Watching ... (the Klaknak screams)</p>
<p align="left">9. Watching Ally McBeal there I said it (the Klaknak passes out 
  from the effort).</p>
<p align="left">10. Discussing Ally McBeal and how it applies to &quot;the relationship&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I dont care HOW sexy the woman may seem to be, but let me tell 
  you from personal experience. You can date one of the most beautiful women in 
  the world, but once the sex loses its appeal, you are in deep deep shit. And 
  if you happened to get married ... oh boy.</p>
<p align="left">So let's talk about and sing praises of the gaming girl. The gaming 
  girl is the sexiest and most desirable girl on the planet. She is the sexiest 
  and most desirable girl on the planet not because she is the only one who will 
  go out with us but because she is the only one who is capable of living at our 
  level (whatever the hell that is). She understands us because she is us.</p>
<p align="left">I have talked with both normal girls and with gaming girls over 
  email, and I can tell you hands down that gaming girls are by far more interesting 
  and ... heck ... smarter than the other girls out there. Email a gaming girl 
  and you will see. Instead of talking about bullshit you don't want to talk about, 
  you will probably find out that you have a ton of similar interests because 
  ...</p>
<p align="left">returning back to my long, dry philosophical account above ...</p>
<p align="left">A gaming girl is more likely to have the same interests as you. 
  And whether you are seeking meaningless sex prior to meaningless gameplay, a 
  relationship, or marriage, you don't need to fill out surveys or go to bars 
  ... you simply need to scour the gaming world for the greatest women on earth.</p>
<p align="left">Ode to the gaming girl!</p>
<p align="left">Sing her praises!</p>
