      <p>(Note from Sarzec): </p>
      <p>I saw this at the eq casters realm Necromancer/General forum: <br>
        There is a HUGE argument about who is an idiot... I dunno, I lost track 
        of who was talking about who... but anyway, this follow-up post was funny, 
        and you dont need much background in the topic string to appreciate it. 
        Here it is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Whew! I havent had so much fun reading a topic thread in soo long... 
          Well anyway, I would agree with everyone out there who says STOP *****ING!! 
          Oh, and I'd like to apologise in advance to everyone I'm about to talk 
          about. </p>
        <p>To Vexis:<br>
          What do you hope to accomplish by calling everyone else a foolish child? 
          I dont know what is going trough your mind (or lack-thereof)when you 
          post this stuff, but all you're getting is flame. Unless of course you 
          are posting these follow-ups just to get a good laugh at all the saps 
          that reply. If this is the case, then I salute your literary skill! 
        </p>
        <p>To Necro: <br>
          See above comment about "saps."</p>
        <p> To Delron: <br>
          You, my friend, are a riot. I have found much enjoyment in your posts 
          because... well, they are damn funny. I havent the slighest as to the 
          validity of your claims, or anyone elses for that matter, but I do know 
          that you are all *****ing and whining about something that none of you 
          can change, so I ask, "whats the point?" All you people do is prove 
          to everyone else how smart you are not. Delron, I am sorry you feel 
          that Necros whine. I am sorry that Necros whine. But what can one intelligent 
          mind do in a sea of ignorance other than drown? </p>
        <p>To Xennon:<br>
          I dont remember who it was that said you are a moron for spelling "Xenon" 
          wrong (and I dont care enough to go back and find out), but you can 
          rest assured that if what Darwin said was even marginally correct, that 
          person has been killed by natural selection by now. Also, I know many 
          people not from English speaking countries, and I sympathise completely.</p>
        <p> To everyone else:<br>
          WTF?!? I'm sorry, but I could only read so much! You people have degenerated 
          to the point of insulting grammar?!? I dont believe you! Good lord! 
          I feel like I'm standing in a playground watching little children-- 
          , little retarded children fight over the right to piss in the tanbark. 
          I haven't seen so many people (some adults, some children, most mentally 
          challenged) just sit and wash the walls with testosterone in a loooong 
          time. So I suggest that you all go and take a cold shower, put on new 
          diapers, and ask mommy to put you to bed (dont forget your retard safety-helmets!) 
          before you hurt yourselves by trying to think too much. </p>
        <p>And as for Everquest, just play the damn game! Nothing any of you say 
          here is going to change jack ****, so why bother? It's time for bed, 
          children. </p>
        <p>Again, my apologies to all that these words do not apply to. I just 
          couldn't help myself. </p>
        <p>As for grammar... I have better grammar (and spelling) than any of 
          you, so you can all shut up. </p>
        <p>Now, I'm sure that everyone who reads this will be thinking "fresh 
          meat!" and try and flame me at your nearest convenience, and to this 
          I say, "Bring it on!!" As I said before, I enjoy watching you all piss 
          on the wall in an effort to prove your mental superiority. Of course, 
          every insult you fling at me will only further illustrate my point and 
          give me another laugh.</p>
        <p> Sarzec <br>
          (not telling what server for fear of being KS'ed/spammed by you people 
          for the rest of my gaming career)</p>
        <p> P.S. I am well aware of the irony in stooping to your level in order 
          to insult the level you have all stooped to. Remember, one must always 
          talk as a child in order to communicate with one. (substitute "moron," 
          "retard," or "idiot" for "child" for better accuracy) </p>

      <p>What I am proposing is that Verant implement a simple web browser into 
        the EQ client. It could be restricted to everquest.com and station.sony.com 
        only, and would use a very small subset of HTML. They could then format 
        things like the Producer's Letter, or the Network Status pages with the 
        very simple HTML, and people could view them without having to log out 
        of the client. Ta-da, Internet-enabled application. </p>

      <p>Some of you morons amaze me. The game is the peoples game, period! If 
        you don't believe me, see what happens if Verant takes their game and 
        plays it by themselves. Which is what they do any way. That is why I quit 
        and will not come back until those assholes figure out what a customer 
        really is. Go to hell Abashi!</p>
