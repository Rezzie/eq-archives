  <p><font size="4">Basketball - reviewed by Derrick W.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">This sport COULD drag you away from Everquest were your computer 
    or brain permanently damaged. But just barely.</p>
  <p align="left">Why do I say so? Well, this is coming from someone who devoted 
    four years of his life to the sport in High School. It... um... like taught 
    me life lessons and stuff and made me a stronger person and... Okay it sucked... 
    No, I'm actually kidding, I DID get alot out of basketball. But to compare 
    it to EQ? Thats just crazy talk! Lets break it down, shall we?</p>
  <p align="left">If you STOP playing basketball, your skills begin to atrophy. 
    If you stop playing basketball in order to play everquest, your MUSCLES begin 
    to atrophy. This is bad when you try to play again. You may find that, whereas 
    before your shots toward the basket actually clanged off the rim (WOO HOO! 
    wait, why is everyone chanting 'brick'?), your shots now fall, light as a 
    feather, into the arms of the 8 foot bohemeth standing beneath the rim. Everyone 
    knows, though, that you can stop playing EQ and come back to it with almost 
    all skills relatively intact. (lets camp for rubicite!)</p>
  <p align="left">While playing Everquest, you are frequently forced to group 
    with scantilly clad female wood elfs. Darn! The monsters you fight are tough, 
    but they never get TOO close to you... and until Microsoft perfects Smell-o-vision 
    (coming in DirectX 8!) you don't actually smell them. In basketball, you group 
    with people who sometimes have only the most rudimentary understanding of 
    the human language ('dish the rock!' 'pardon?' 'THROW ME THE DAMN BALL!' 'Why 
    didn't you just say that?'), and you are thankful when they are NOT scantily 
    clad (I don't care if we ARE skins, I'm wearing my damn shirt!). The people 
    you fight are just as intense upon your destruction, but... they touch you. 
    They get their sweat on you. You have to rub up against them. It is a health 
    hazzard (ed note: sic. Not to be confused with &quot;duke of&quot;]. They 
    also have a tendency to smell (especially Mr. 8 foot bohemeth), and that tendency 
    requires no special hardware for you to get the full effect.</p>
  <p align="left">In Everquest, you can TRY to roleplay. Sure, some people may 
    not be receptive (kewl, dood, we got sum rolplay putz). But you can seek out 
    those of like mind. Ever try roleplaying on the hoops court? 'Pardon me, but 
    wouldst thou pointest me the way to The Hole... my holy quest is to deliver 
    this magic orb there!' You'd be lucky to walk out alive.</p>
  <p align="left">The only UP side to playing hoops over playing everquest is 
    the relative lack of equipment needs. Say you are a warrior type. You lose 
    your gear in Everquest, you are basically screwed. You lose your ball while 
    playing hoops, you can easily get another, or ask someone else to bring it 
    next time! If your a mage type, don't even walk in the gym. They could smell 
    you coming. </p>
