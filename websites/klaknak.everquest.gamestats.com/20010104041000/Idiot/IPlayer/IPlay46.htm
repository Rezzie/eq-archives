  <p>Level 50 Idiot - by Janalee</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">This goes in the &quot;level 50's can be idiots too&quot; file</p>
  <p align="left">Normally as an enchanter I'd never have a pet in a dungeon. 
    Our pets<br>
    are uncontrollable, and can be great train-starters when they get off on<br>
    a rampage and can't be called back. But in Permafrost doing the Ice<br>
    Giant Diplomat with just one caster buddy, a pet is a must since neither<br>
    of us can tank and the IG is notorious for resisting unless you're<br>
    within melee range. Plus, my level 49 pet can clear the entire dungeon<br>
    of gobbies itself, so I don't feel too nervous having a pet in Perma.<br>
    Anyway, there we were, hanging out near the Goblin King spawn site<br>
    waiting for the dip to pop again. We were bored, and as friends often<br>
    do when bored we began goofing off, jumping off ledges, running in<br>
    circles, climbing everything in sight, etc - just killing time.</p>
  <p align="left">Now I should mention a couple of things here. First, behind 
    the king<br>
    spawn in Perma is what looks like giant ice cubes poking through the<br>
    wall. It's fairly common knowledge that right behind that wall is Lady<br>
    Vox and her retinue of Ice Giant guardians (one can even target Vox<br>
    through that wall and can hear her casting when she's there). Second,<br>
    my friend is a halfling and as such, is pathetically short (and funny<br>
    looking if you ask me). Me being a lithe, willowly high elf<br>
    enchantress, I began to see how high up on the &quot;cubes&quot; I could climb,<br>
    and to my delight I discovered I could get all the way to a little ledge<br>
    up there. My half-sized companion with his stubby legs had no hope of<br>
    following me up. I noticed that the ledge seemed to lead to a small<br>
    opening into the next room - too small to climb through, but definitely<br>
    connected. I was about to stand on the lip of the ledge and proclaim<br>
    myself Queen of All Permafrost (and make my diminutive friend jealous)<br>
    when I was greeted by the message every enchanter dreads seeing in a<br>
    dungeon: TAUNTING ATTACKER MASTER.</p>
  <p align="left">ACK! I'd forgotten about my pet and it had obviously followed 
    me up to<br>
    the ledge and, being smaller, had obviously somehow scooted through the<br>
    opening and into the next room where it set off..............OH MY GOD<br>
    GATE GATE GATE FOR THE LOVE OF MARR GATE, I shouted to my companion.<br>
    Too late for me, within seconds I was teleported somewhere deeper in<br>
    (you have been SUMMONED, the terse message read) and found myself<br>
    surrounded by no less than five Ice Giants all pushing and shoving for<br>
    an opportunity to play Eat the Enchanter. My poor pet was piercing and<br>
    kicking for his life but there was little he could do against all five<br>
    (he did continue to gamely report to me that he was TAUNTING ATTACKER<br>
    MASTER). I have no idea how, but I managed to survive long enough to<br>
    run back to the King Room before I was turned into so much red and<br>
    oracle-robe blue mush.</p>
  <p align="left">The kicker is, Vox had been taken down on my server the night 
    before.<br>
    If she hadn't......... &lt;shudder&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Janalee,<br>
    Server withheld due to embarassment</p>
  <p align="left">P.S. My halfling buddy lived and had an enormous laugh over 
    my<br>
    misadventure</p>
