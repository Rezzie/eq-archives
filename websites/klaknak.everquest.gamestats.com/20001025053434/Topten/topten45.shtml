  <p align="center">Top 10 things you would hear if they were old people in EQ 
    - by Puck</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">10. I remember when I walked 15 zones to get to the boat and 
    wait 4 hours to try to get on the boat just to get dumped in the ocean. </p>
  <p align="left">9. There was a day when you could sell a rune totem staff for 
    30pp! That was a lot in my day, which was good enough for a full set of leather! 
  </p>
  <p align="left">8. All you little whippersnappers with your "plane raids" and 
    "dragon raids". In my day we were happy if we didn't die in Blackburrow 4 
    times in one day! And let me tell you something, Blackburrow was the only 
    place to hunt! </p>
  <p align="left">7. We were scared to leave our protected newbie zones! Rumors 
    of Treants and Hill giants kept us away from the evil Karanas. </p>
  <p align="left">6. I remeber a day when there were only 30 people in Oasis at 
    any one time, and that was during peak hours! </p>
  <p align="left">5. We didn't know about muffins and milk, we ate iron rations 
    and water just because we didn't know what iron rations were! </p>
  <p align="left">4. We didn't have to wait to get into a group with all these 
    "lists" and whatnot. We walked into the zone, shouted our class and level, 
    and if we got a group we stayed. If we didn't we moved on to somewhere else! 
  </p>
  <p align="left">3. The PGT was the best weapon! </p>
  <p align="left">2. And blacksmithing was almost a possible trade skill! None 
    of this bronze or quest armor. It's all poppycock!</p>
  <p align="left"> 1. We said poppycock and we liked it!</p>
