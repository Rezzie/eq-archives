  <p><font size="4">A Day in the Life; if Cyanna Was Me in RL - by Cyanna</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I wake up to the sound of a buzzing alarm clock. "Ack. Stupid 
    noise" I fumble around for my maul, forgetting that I left it by the front 
    door.</p>
  <p align="left">"Crap"</p>
  <p align="left">I smash it with my fist instead, stopping its annoying sound 
    forever. Yawn. I stretch and slowly stumble to the bathroom. I hop in the 
    shower making sure I set the water temperature to freezing. "Ahhh. Now that 
    is the way to wake up". After the shower I look in the mirror.</p>
  <p align="left">"Beautiful as ever."</p>
  <p align="left">I get out my makeup case and do my makeup which consists of 
    painting half my face light blue. I dry my raven tresses and put on my headband. 
    I go to the closet to pick out an outfit. "Hmm. Silver banded, black chain, 
    or red plate? I think I'll go with the silver banded today." After dressing 
    I head downstairs.</p>
  <p align="left">The hubbie is sitting at the table waiting for breakfast. "Hi, 
    hon, what's for breakfast?" he says. I whip up some black bread and water 
    and sit it in front of him. "Black bread again? Can't you even toast it?" 
    I scowl at him threateningly, ready to attack, and he runs for the zone.</p>
  <p align="left">I feed Verbantik and take him for a walk. I hop in the car and 
    head for work. Just as I get on the highway I hear that Verbantik hits himself 
    for 32000 points of damage. Stupid dog. Oh, well, he'll be back when I get 
    home. I get stuck in traffic.</p>
  <p align="left">"This sucks. This is more crowded than Blackburrow on a Friday 
    night"</p>
  <p align="left">I hop out of the car, cast SOW and start running. "Looking for 
    a druid or wizard to teleport me to work. Will pay. Give me a tell" I shout. 
    I finally get to work. I walk through the door and say hello to the security 
    guard. He looks at me indifferently and does not respond. "Stupid guards. 
    They never do anything until you forget your badge and then you become KOS."</p>
  <p align="left">I head up to my desk and turn on my computer. I am suddenly 
    bombarded by tells from my e-mail. Attend this meeting. Need this report. 
    Can you give me SOW. Sigh. I respond to the tells and start to work. Just 
    when things are going well, the customer from hell spawns next to my desk.</p>
  <p align="left">"Can you help me? I can't find the 'any' key."</p>
  <p align="left">I get out my maul. Cyanna hits a customer for 39 points of damage. 
    Customer hits YOU for 1 point. Cyanna hits a customer for 38 points of damage. 
    You have killed a customer. I loot him but all he has is a blue pen, some 
    paper, and 2 dollars. I sit back down to work. I meet my friends and group 
    for lunch. We go to a dungeon called "McDonalds" and we camp the Big Mac spawn. 
    My friend gets one but all I got was some fries and a salad.</p>
  <p align="left">Just when I zone back to work I get a tell from my boss. "Can 
    you come in here? I need help to [send e-mail]." Grrr. I zone into his lair. 
    I hail him. "Ah, hello Cyanna. I typed it in but I do not know how to [send 
    e-mail]." I con him and he is green. Crap.</p>
  <p align="left">No exp and probably no loot either.</p>
  <p align="left">"Just hit the send key". No response. Sigh. "Hit the send key 
    to send e-mail" "Thank you Cyanna. Here is your raise."</p>
  <p align="left">I hate doing these quests. Almost no exp and the loot sucks.</p>
  <p align="left">Finally quitting time comes and I head home. I forgot I left 
    my car somewhere and starting running around looking for it. "Anyone seen 
    my car?" I shout. I finally find it and drive home. I summon Verbantik back 
    and feed him and take him for a walk. The hubbie gets home. "How was work, 
    hon?" he says. "The same as it is every day. You know how repetitive it is. 
    It is just a big hunt for loot and exp. I can't wait to retire when I hit 
    50. Maybe then we can make a new character that I can twink."</p>
  <p align="left">He smiles and says, "Why wait till 50. Let's work on it now." 
    I carry him up the stairs to bed. And so ends my day.</p>
