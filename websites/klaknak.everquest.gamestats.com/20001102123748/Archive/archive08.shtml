      <blockquote> Hello peoples, I am back!<br>
        <br>
        These last several weeks have been somewhat exciting, so I thought I would 
        pass the goodness around. <br>
        <br>
        As some of you know, I now work for a gaming company and guess what! All 
        the whiners are right! Gaming companies are out to screw the customers 
        every chance they get. My job is to hit on gamers' wives, girlfriends, 
        and legal age daughters. My supervisor is Satan himself, which is cool, 
        because he doesnt mind if I smoke cigars in the men's room. Anyway, we 
        just had a meeting yesterday and we were yelled at for not screwing the 
        gaming public hard enough, so I promise I will try harder today. <br>
        <br>
        Last week was stressful, though. I now spend quite a bit of time in Asheron's 
        Call and pretty much do nothing but die nonstop, although my online honey 
        (bwahahah) Pali manages to keep me company and laugh at my mistakes. She 
        has a level 20+ Ranger in Prexus and pretty soon I will start working 
        on my barbarian so I can continue bringing the kind of choice everquest 
        nuggets of goodness you have all grown to love and thirst for like the 
        infotainment hungry dogs you are. <br>
        <br>
        Oh, last week. Yeah, so I started my new job last week. So, I now have 
        this on my plate: 
        <blockquote> 1. Gaming job. <br>
          2. Social work job.<br>
          3. Filming Pornography. <br>
          4. The Cackling Klaknak <br>
          5. Asheron's Call</blockquote>
        Ouch. But I make up for it by coming in drunk to work. I dont think anyone 
        has noticed yet. I think they think I am merely eccentric. <br>
        <br>
        But on top of the madness last week, I also had to ... sigh ... visit 
        my brother and parents in Atlanta. This is just a quadruple double whammy 
        to the nuts for several reasons: 
        <blockquote> 1. I fucking hate flying.<br>
          2. I just started a new job and I was already stressed.<br>
          3. My Grandmother "You Are Too Fat" Maris was going to be there. <br>
          4. My Parents "You Need to Stop Fucking Up Your Life" Mariseses were 
          there. <br>
          5. My brother informed me that he would not be able to find a loose 
          woman for me this time. *sigh* </blockquote>
        Dad then informs me that he wants me to stay for FOUR days and I just 
        nearly just about died. <br>
        <br>
        But my brother and I stayed drunk for most of those days (Grand Marnier, 
        Newcastle Ale, and Maker's Mark, baby) so it was bearable. My grandmother 
        is pretty cool when I am drunk, it turns out. <br>
        <br>
        Anyway, so on the way back, my plane experienced turbulence the entire 
        freaking trip back. I felt like I was going up and down in an elevator 
        (at the speed of light) for about 2 hours and it took a couple days before 
        I didn't feel like a World War I mustard gas veteran. That was, in all 
        seriousness, one of the most hellish experiences of my life. <br>
        <br>
        Until I returned to work ... my supervisor started yelling at me right 
        when I walked in the door.<br>
        <br>
        "Did you break up any gamer marriages this weekend?" he asked. <br>
        <br>
        "No, Mr. Satan, my grandmother was ..." <br>
        <br>
        "You are demoted to Obscene Phone Caller (aka Customer Service)." <br>
        <br>
        *sigh* <br>
