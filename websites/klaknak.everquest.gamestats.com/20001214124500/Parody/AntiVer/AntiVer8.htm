  <p>EQ Glossary - by Awynder of Tunare</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> EQ Glossary Bind - n. The spell that sets where your character 
    reappears after death. By default this will be the furthest possible point 
    from wherever it is you feel like hunting at that particular moment.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad McQuaid - n. Head of Verant and chief designer of EQ. Has 
    a level 113 ranger wielding a paladin-only superweapon. Can’t understand for 
    the life of him why the masses think the game has problems. See also Marie 
    Antoinette</p>
  <p align="left">Camping - v. One of the truly lovely aspects of EQ. The process 
    of making your virtual character sit on his virtual butt for up to 100 hours 
    of online time waiting for a virtual frog/goblin/gnoll/etc to spawn so your 
    party can kill it and begin squabbling over whose turn it was to loot the 
    rare item. In the end most people forgo camping and simply buy the item off 
    of Ebay. The people from whom they buy these items are those who make camping 
    their profession. This means camping and selling the items on Ebay is the 
    only trade skill in EQ known to work at this time. Verant is currently in 
    negotiations to buy Ebay so they can nerf this process</p>
  <p align="left">Con - n. An NPC’s or MOB’s level relative to your own, color 
    coded for easy and fast determination of your chances against it in battle. 
    Cons go from green to red like thus: Green - Probably will kill you Blue - 
    Very likely will kill you White - LOADING, PLEASE WAIT Yellow - LOADING, PLEASE 
    WAIT Red - LOADING, PLEASE WAIT</p>
  <p align="left">Firey Avenger - n. Rumored holy sword that can only be obtained 
    by: slaying all six dragons (four of whom don’t exist in-game yet) - three 
    of them solo and unarmed, memorizing the names and stats of every character 
    on every server, mowing Brad McQuaid’s lawn once a week, and successfully 
    making a class 3 steel-shafted blade-tipped arrow with a fletching skill of 
    1. The last part of the quest (believed to be impossible) is to successfully 
    find the Drunkard in Kelethin and finally shut up all the shouting newbie 
    idiots. Rumored stats are unknown, but my brother’s friend’s nephew’s next 
    door neighbor once heard a guy say that he saw on a web site it’s 1H slash 
    500 dam / 10 delay and casts ice comet every round. A paladin-only sword. 
    Also wieldable by rangers provided they run very large gaming companies.</p>
  <p align="left">Guard - n. A special type of NPC that stands around alternately 
    glowering dubiously at some players and smiling warmly at others. The job 
    of these level 45ish characters in full plate armor is to protect their cities 
    from being invaded by giant skunks and wasps and to kill newbie bards who 
    just bought Chords of Dissonance and forgot to turn it off. Have a nasty habit 
    of being AWOL when a player needs help with some pissed-off MOB on his tail, 
    only to appear suddenly ten miles from nowhere to "save" you from a yellow 
    con you had down to 5HP.</p>
  <p align="left">Infravision - n. An attribute possessed by some races in the 
    game whereby they can see in the dark almost as well as a legally-blind real 
    life human with one glass eye wearing a blindfold in a closet. Races without 
    infravision do not have this helpful ability and suffer a bit during the game’s 
    night periods.</p>
  <p align="left">Kill Stealer - n. Any caster that successfully kills a MOB, 
    anywhere, any time, even if he/she is the only one in the zone.</p>
  <p align="left">Kite - n. A combat tactic that allowed certain classes to succesfully 
    kill MOBs, something Verant apparently is against. Has been nerfed.</p>
  <p align="left">LD - n. Linkdead, crashed, went offline, lost connection suddenly, 
    etc. Usually happens in one of two situations: 1) camping really tough rooms 
    just as three level 35 mobs spawn (usually in this instance it’s all five 
    of your group mates that go LD) and 2) just as your character is running for 
    the zone border with a hill giant on your heels. Verant has now added a thoughtful 
    "So-and-so has gone linkdead" message when your group mates drop, so you no 
    longer have to wonder if they’re really LD or if they’re just standing around 
    watching while you solo those two spectres.</p>
  <p align="left">Loot - n. Money, weapons, magic items, etc. that can be found 
    on the corpses of MOBs. Unfortunately, MOB corpses are not just lying around 
    - you have to manufacture them yourself (see con). v. To acquire loot from 
    a MOB’s corpse. This often requires an agreed-upon order beforehand to avoid 
    arguments over who has the rights to the goodies. Many parties use the alphabetic 
    system, which is why you see so many characters nowadays named Aaaaaamandarn 
    and Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaandrielle. Some parties use a random process. In either 
    case, as soon as the rare loot appears, it is the job of one person in the 
    party to loot it out of turn, and offer "Hey, I haven’t looted anything in 
    ten minutes!" as an excuse.</p>
  <p align="left">MOB - n. Generic term for monster. Singular. It is believed 
    to be mandatory that everyone use this term even though no one can begin to 
    explain what it means.</p>
  <p align="left">Nerf - v. The act of reducing the effectiveness of a class or 
    skill when it becomes apparent people are succeeding at it. This process happens 
    to every class and every skill at some point. It is believed that by the year 
    2003 all the classes will have only hand-to-hand combat and no spells except 
    Identify Item, and will be able to use Sense Heading only, at which point 
    the game will be declared perfectly balanced. After the following patch, in 
    the name of game balance, Identify Item will be removed from all spellcasters.</p>
  <p align="left">NPC - n. Non-player character. Can be distinguished from player 
    characters by the fact that NPCs will actually appear to speak and spell correct 
    English much of the time.</p>
  <p align="left">Powergamer - n. Term used with derision to describe anyone who 
    levels faster than you do.</p>
  <p align="left">Trade Skill - n. A "career" that a player can take up in-game 
    to earn money. The moment the player discovers a trade skill that allows him/her 
    to make money, the skill is nerfed and the process starts over.</p>
  <p align="left">Train - n. A flock of angry MOBs chasing some poor character 
    to the zone border. The group of monsters picks up others along the way until 
    an entire line of them is chasing the poor sap. The "trainer" may or may not 
    warn his unsuspecting fellow players (the "trainees") at the zone border of 
    the oncoming slaughter via a /shout (don’t bet your life on it). Some zones 
    in the game are so frequented by trains that most of the MOBs are permanently 
    at the border, making the depths of the dungeons often the safest places to 
    be for some peace and quiet. See Unrest, Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Runnyeye, 
    Crushbone, Befallen, Guk, Najena, Solusek, Permafrost, Blackburrow </p>
  <p align="left">Twink - v.. The act of giving newbie characters, usually the 
    twinker’s own, very high-level equipment or armor for the express purpose 
    of allowing those characters to level quickly to the point that they can go 
    get more of the same armor to give back to the original character (or something 
    like that). Also a character wielding weapons/armor he/she is too low or lazy 
    to get for him/herself. See also Brad McQuaid</p>
