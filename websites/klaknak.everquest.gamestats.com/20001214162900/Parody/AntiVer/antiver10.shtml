  <p align="center">Alt.games.everquest Takes Over EQ Management! - by the Cackling 
    Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The scene: The offices of Everquest. </p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Folks, today I want to talk about rebalancing the different 
    beers in the game. As you know, Dwarven Spirits get people drunker faster 
    than any other brew and this bothers my sense of balance and fair play. Any 
    comments? </p>
  <p align="left">Spoon: Well, for one, I ... </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;A loud scuffle is heard in the adjoining hallway. A secretary 
    enters&gt;</p>
  <p align="left"> Ms. Muffin: I am sorry, Mr. Brad. These men just forced their 
    way through ... </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;A horde of scruffy overweight philosophy majors force their 
    way into the boardroom&gt;</p>
  <p align="left"> Lord Biscuit: Ok, Brad. Your days of screwing up our game are 
    over! </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Yeah.</p>
  <p align="left"> Frank Root: Get out before I kick you in the head! </p>
  <p align="left">Brad: But, what is this? Who are you? I have always tried to 
    do the best I can but ... </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: This is a coup. And we are members of the great 
    newsgroup alt.games.everquest, where reasonable people meet to discuss the 
    problems in EQ. Now get the hell out! </p>
  <p align="left">Brad: We have always tried our best to ... </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Uh! Uh! My finger is on the killfile button ... 
    KILLFILE!!!! I KILLFILED YOU!!! Bwahahha! </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: You are KILLFILED! But before I killfile you, I 
    should tell you you are an idiot! That is why I am killfiling you! Uh! Killfile! 
    Bwahhaah. </p>
  <p align="left">Frank Root: I killfiled you too! Ha ha! What do you think of 
    that? </p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Um ... this is real life, not the newsgroup. </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Who said that? Was anyone talking? Well, if this 
    person who is not there really was there then I would tell him that in the 
    world of the newsgroup, we create our own reality! Bwahahah. If we don't agree 
    with you, we end your existence, therefore creating our own perfect world 
    where reason, not idiocy, triumphs! </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Vive de' ... uh ... evolucionis! </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Now, let's get down to business. </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;Frank Root, John Smack and the other horde mutter agreement 
    and sit down&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: First of all, we need to elect a president. I 
    elect myself! </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Why do you get to be president?</p>
  <p align="left"> Frank Root: Yeah, why? </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: I have been on the boards the longest and have 
    played EQ since beta. </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Ah, I see. According to the newsgroup by-laws, that 
    means your arguments trump anyone else's arguments no matter how idiotic your 
    argument is. </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Exactly. </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: All those in favor of Lord Biscuit, say Aye. </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;a chorus of Aye's reverberates through the room&gt;</p>
  <p align="left"> John Smack: All opposed, say Nay. </p>
  <p align="left">Klaknak: Nay. </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Killfiled! </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Killfiled! </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Excellent. Heh heh. I wish I could killfile my 
    girlfriend sometimes ... </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: You have a girlfriend? </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Silence! First order of business ... I am hungry. 
    Let's buy a pizza! </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;The horde cheers&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: I vote for Dominoes.</p>
  <p align="left"> John Smack: No, I think Papa John's is a better pizza </p>
  <p align="left">Alien Ballz: I prefer Pizza Hut. The hut! The hut! Heh heh. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Ok, well, let's open this up for debate. I prefer 
    Papa John's pizza because ... </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: But you said you liked Dominoes.</p>
  <p align="left"> Lord Biscuit: Silence! Or I will killfile you! My hand is hovering 
    over the killfile button ... it is hovering over the killfile button ... </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Yes master. </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Anyway, I like Pizza Hut pizza because all the 
    toppings are perfectly balanced. You see, most places think that you should 
    put an equal amount of toppings on the pizza. However, they fail to understand 
    that certain toppings are a priori stronger than others. So, for example, 
    if you put equal amounts of onion on a pizza with onions and pepperoni, the 
    onion will overpower the pepperoni. So, to counter this, you must put a smaller 
    amount of onion on the pizza. Papa John's does this, and that is why I prefer 
    Dominoes pizza to all of the others. </p>
  <p align="left">John Smack: Ok. Well, I disagree. Why bother ... </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: You have been killfiled! But before you disappear, 
    I want to tell you you are an idiot. That is why I killfiled you. </p>
  <p align="left">Alien Ballz: This sucks, man. Why did you killfile him, man? 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: My finger is over the killfile button ... hmmm 
    ... should I killfile Alien Ballz? Hmmmm ... is he being an idiot? Hmmmm ... 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Alien Ballz: Look, I am just saying that ... </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: I have been playing EQ since beta! I have been 
    on this message board since the beginning! Have you? No, I didn't think so. 
    Therefore, I am left with no other choice but to declare you an idiot and 
    killfile you.</p>
  <p align="left">&lt;Lord Biscuit looks around the room&gt; </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: You know what? I don't need any of you people. 
    None of you is as smart as I am.</p>
  <p align="left">&lt;Lord Biscuit killfiles the entire room including a potted 
    plant.&gt;</p>
  <p align="left"> Lord Biscuit: There. Finally, a perfect universe ... no one 
    here but me. </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;a harried programmer enters the room&gt;</p>
  <p align="left"> Tom Programmer: Who are you?</p>
  <p align="left"> Lord Biscuit: I am Lord Biscuit! Who are you? </p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: I am the chief programmer. Where is Brad? </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: I have taken over the development of EQ!!! </p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: Ok ... um ... so ... what do you want to do 
    with the new patch code? </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Code? </p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: Yes, we are prepared to update the servers but 
    we need you to approve the code. </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: What code? No one gave me a code. Do you need 
    it to enter the building after hours? </p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: One moment, sir ...</p>
  <p align="left"> &lt;Tom exits.&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: I wonder if I will get Brad's old parking place? 
  </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;Tom enters&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: Good news, sir! Verant has now teamed up with 
    Valve in order to make Everquest the best game in the world! </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Excellent, excellent news. Where do we start? 
  </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;Gordon Freeman enters the room&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Lord Biscuit: Hail, sir. Who are you? </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;As music swells in the background Gordon pulls out his combat 
    rifle and seconds later billions of Lord Biscuit giblets splatter across boardroom.&gt; 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: Thanks Gordon. We are about to eat some chicken. 
    You want to stay? </p>
  <p align="left">Gordon: No thanks. I have a job to finish at Origin Systems. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Tom Programmer: Ok, good luck! </p>
  <p align="left">&lt;The music swells to a crescendo as Gordon walks into the 
    sunset fighting for truth and justice world over.&gt;</p>
