  <p align="left">Here's one to add to your files: </p>
  <p align="left">A friend of mine is an enchanter of th 24th level. Being bored 
    he was making some jewelry one night. Made a silver ruby veil and was very 
    happy sold it for a lot of money. Took the money to go buy the stuff to make 
    another. </p>
  <p align="left">Puts all the stuff in jewelry kit clicks combine and it says 
    "Those items do not combine in those quanties to make anything" He is very 
    puzzled now. He knows for sure that he put the right items in the kit. At 
    this point he petitions and gets a guide involved. After explaining it to 
    the guide the guide decides to look in to it. Next thing he knows the guide 
    is asking him are you SURE you have your jewelry kit on you? He responds: 
    Of course I do. Just to humor the guide he checks his inventory, and to his 
    surprise no jewelry kit. But his spit sure is in his inventory.</p>
  <p align="left"> 100pp poorer and quits for the night.</p>
