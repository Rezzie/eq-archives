        <p>Here's a song written at a real GEB raid when I was bored to death. 
          Its almost accurate. <br>
          - Balgair, Mage of Xegony
        <p>&nbsp; 
        <p> On a dark night in SOL B, <br>
          Sulphur in my hair <br>
          As we strode forth so boldly <br>
          Through Nagafen's Lair 
        <p>Up ahead in the distance <br>
          Saw a terrible sight <br>
          Three big imps at the lava pool <br>
          Guess there'll be a big fight 
        <p>There they stood in the doorway<br>
          As I cast my spell<br>
          I was thinking to myself <br>
          This could be easy or this could be Hell
        <p> Then we jazzed up the battle <br>
          And we blew them away <br>
          There were voices in the corridor <br>
          And I heard them /say 
        <p>Welcome to the Golden Efreet Boots Camp <br>
          Such a deadly place (Such a deadly place) <br>
          It's a spawn time race <br>
          Plenty of imps at the Golden Efreet Boots Camp <br>
          Anytime of year <br>
          You can find imps here. 
        <p>New guy is definitely twink-ed <br>
          Ykeshas in his hands <br>
          He got a lotta sixty level guys <br>
          He calls friends 
        <p>And he claims he's not looted <br>
          His seventh boots yet <br>
          He camps all for Ebay <br>
          He camps to pay debt 
        <p>I sent a tell to the Raid Boss <br>
          As he began to whine <br>
          Boss said, this guys been on this raid <br>
          Since last month, on the 9th 
        <p>And still his whining keeps coming <br>
          From far away <br>
          Irritates all the members of my group,<br>
          I can hear them say 
        <p>Welcome to the Golden Efreet Boots Camp <br>
          Such a twinked-out place (Such a twinked-out place) <br>
          It's an Ebay base <br>
          Plenty of twinks at the Golden Efreet Boots Camp <br>
          Anytime of year <br>
          You can find twinks here.
        <p> Fought past the lava pool<br>
          'Crept by on the right <br>
          Raid Boss said <br>
          All casters can meditate here<br>
          This is our last fight 
        <p>Into Lord Djarn's chambers <br>
          We charged in for the beast <br>
          Stabbed him with our steely knives<br>
          Until Lord Djarn was deceased
        <p> Last thing I remembered <br>
          The Twink stole a pair of boots <br>
          Tried to run through passage back <br>
          And ninja off with the loot 
        <p>He's Dead said the Boss man <br>
          That's the last time he'll deceive <br>
          We can port out anytime we like <br>
          But he can never leave. 
        <p>(Guitar Solo with sounds of Imps tearing the ninja ranger apart as 
          he tries to run to zone)
