        <p>Hail, here is one of my own idiotic incidents that may be worthy of 
          posting amongst the others. I was having a very difficult time pluggin 
          my way through level 19. I had died 15 times during that level (don't 
          ask) and after many, many hours just recouping my experience, I decided 
          to move to the Arena tunnel in Lake Rathe to solo Aviaks to finish my 
          level. After several more hours of work, I finally heard that mystical 
          "DING!" sound we all long for. I sat down, thinking to myself "Oh boy, 
          finally level 20, new damage spell!", and scribed my spells. By the 
          time I had finished doing this, another Aviak had appeared. I was feeling 
          proud of myself and I wanted to test out my new spells, so I quickly 
          attacked. <br>
          <br>
          Wouldn't you know it, this would be the one bird that could eat my soul. 
          I ran like a scared farm animal for the zone, screaming "NO, MY NEW 
          LEVEL, DAMN YOU CHICKEN MAN!" the entire way. I actually made it across 
          the zone, panting, with 2 hit points left. Still a bit dazed, I decided 
          to bandage myself to 1/2 life before resting. I targeted myself and 
          hit the 2 key. However, in my daze, I had forgotten to switch my hotkey 
          set from Set 1 to Set 2, so instead of bandaging myself, I promptly 
          blew myself up with my new spell before I realized what was happening! 
          After all that work to make my level and running to keep it, I was the 
          one to commit suicide and take it away from myself!</p>
