  <p align="center">Qeynos Hills Television Network - by Cleckmoon Montisple </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Announcer: You are watching, the Qeynos Hills Television Network. 
    Serving the greater Qeynos area since the year 3252. We hope you enjoyed the 
    documentary, "Oggok", where the camera crew and jeep were sacrificed to The 
    Plaugebringer. But now, we present our new anchor and co-anchor, Cleckmoon 
    Montisple the Anthropomorphic Hare, and Hobbes the Parakeet. </p>
  <p align="left">*Opening music plays, but it has an eerie similarity to the 
    EverQuest opening theme. The news room is shown. Cleckmoon looks very disgruntled, 
    and Hobbes is wearing the cutest little tie* </p>
  <p align="left">CM: *Cleckmoon grumbles something about the ATF and predigest 
    against anthropomorphism, and then looks up at the camera* Uh, hi, I'm Cleckmoon 
    Montisple.</p>
  <p align="left"> HP: And I'm Hobbes the Parikeet. Tonight, we bring you a breaking 
    news story. A drunken Cros Treewind has killed Holly Windstalker. Unfortunately, 
    She spawned again, only this time in the middle of Blackburrow as a result 
    of Brad McQuaid's new innovations on random spawning. As of now, Blackburrow 
    population has been flattened by the vengeful woman. Cros is being taken into 
    custody, and brutally tortured just for the hell of it. On a related note, 
    Bear and wolf killings have gone up 75 percent since the incident. </p>
  <p align="left">CM: Now, lets go to our NEW weatherman, Hydralisk Harry. </p>
  <p align="left">*Harry is on screen, wearing a tie and cool sunglasses* </p>
  <p align="left">HH: Growr hissp grrr. Grow razz grr hiss gurgle rumble snarl 
    growl. </p>
  <p align="left">*Harry begins to motion at the weather map behind him, full 
    of strange symbols* </p>
  <p align="left">HH: Growr grrr hiss hiss snarl growl. Grrr hiss murmur growl. 
    Growr grrr razz hiss hiss grunt growl. Grr grr salami mutter grrr hiss hiss 
    muddle snarl razz growl. Growlg Cyanna upkilt scandal, graxx.</p>
  <p align="left"> *What looks like a huge, mother of Andrew hurricane, is animated 
    on the screen, heading right for Odus* </p>
  <p align="left">HH: Growwwl grrr fizz grrr graxx grr gripe growr grrr hiss rumble 
    hiss snarl growl gripe snarl snarl buzz. </p>
  <p align="left">*Harry frantically motions all over the map, growling and hissing. 
    His huge claws slice into the map, and soon, the whole continent of Odus is 
    nothing but a tattered hole in the map*</p>
  <p align="left"> *Back to Hobbes and Cleckmoon*</p>
  <p align="left"> HP: Whoah, looks like trouble on the Erudite front. </p>
  <p align="left">CM: Who gives a crap! You wanna know how many of those city 
    born idiots thought I was a Kobald and/or a Kerran? Ugh!</p>
  <p align="left"> HP: Uh, right. Lets go to another story. </p>
  <p align="left">CM: In other news, Squire Banes has escaped from the West Karnas 
    Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation center. His whereabouts are unknown at this 
    time, but if anyone had any information, please contact the center. There 
    is a twenty platinum reward if his remains are found. If he is still alive, 
    don't bother, and wait for the nearest lion, treant, or other mob to kill 
    him for you. This has been a message from QHTV. </p>
  <p align="left">HP: Oh god. </p>
  <p align="left">CM: That brings us to our next story. Religion controversy is 
    sweeping the land. Basically because no one seems to give a crap about what 
    religion they pick when they first start adventuring. Then, as they advance, 
    lots and lots of shitty things start happening. My advice? Kill Brad McQuaid 
    and all of Verrant. Save 989 Studios, because they produced "Cool Boarders 
    3" for Playstation, and that is a cool game. </p>
  <p align="left">HP: Any other words on that, Cleck? </p>
  <p align="left">CM: Yeah, let Idol Minds take over the design. I wanna snow 
    board in Everfrost and Permafrost. At least their snow has TEXTURE. And how 
    funny would it be to see the barbarians slipping up on patches of ice? </p>
  <p align="left">HP: And with that final report, we close our newscast. Until 
    the next time Cleckmoon, Harry, and I are forced to do community service, 
    we hope you have a safe evening. </p>
  <p align="left">CM: Whoo hoo! Lets go kill some rabid grizzlies. I need some 
    exp.</p>
