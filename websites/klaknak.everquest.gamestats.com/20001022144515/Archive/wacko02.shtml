      <p>The only reason I want bad things to happen to the developers of Eq is 
        cause they gave us players (oh yeah except the ass kissers, they're always 
        happy about everything and anything just to keep a good name for EQ) the 
        shaft with all these stupid nerfs and continual nerfs which they always 
        use their excuse of 'balance' LOL. Oh and another ROTFLMAO about how they 
        say--A game will always need balancing. That's the most unintelligent 
        comment of the millennium.</p>

      <p align="center">Warning: This post has a LOT of profanity</p>
      <p>Ok, this is unbelievably retarded, I'm on Rallos Zek, in Grobb. I'm spending 
        forever trying to find somebody to bind me. Finally I see an ogre with 
        a hammer (obviously a shaman) and he cons red to me. (I'm 16) I ask the 
        guy for a bind, he just sits there like a fucking retard. I wait a minute, 
        and ask him in a tell, oh wow that certainly got his attention, he replied 
        with a whole "what?" I ask him in big words, "CAN YOU BIND ME?!" he replies 
        with an ever so intelligent, "yes" I wait a minute or so, I realize he's 
        just fucking masturbating or doing some stupid shit. And i scream at him 
        "HELLO YOU BINDING ME OR NOT?!" and then he goes "yes hold on" I wait 
        another few minutes, and finally I give up and start screaming all sorts 
        of crazy shit at him which is obviously too overwhelming for a fucking 
        idiot like him so he leaves. Next up I ask another shaman for a bind, 
        he takes forever to fucking answer me, like the previous fucking retard. 
        But he agrees to. After waiting 3 fucking minutes for this idiot to hurry 
        up and do it, he finally says "gimme shinies" so i give the whore 2 platnium 
        and invite him to join a group (for bind to work), he fucking sits there 
        looking at me for fucking 5 minutes! Then the fucking whore decides to 
        cast bind, but he never accepted my group offer! So it didn't work! I 
        fucking tell him, "k dumb ass, you have to be in a fucking group you stupid 
        shit, that's why i fucking asked you to join my group, now i fucking gave 
        you money, now do it for christ's sakes cause i'm tired of stupid fucking 
        whores like you wasting my fucking time!" then he goes "no" and runs off. 
        Then giving up, I ask one last time, "Anybody with some fucking brains 
        wanna bind a frustrated and tired soul?" My hero, a wizard arises and 
        says "yes" he groups with me and binds me in a total of 20 seconds. Now 
        was it really that fucking hard to do? The thing that pisses me off about 
        fucking whores like the 2 above is they have NO character whatsoever. 
        I'm polite with them and ask them nicely, and the fucking whores just 
        answer me with little shit answers. Fucking idiots like them should NOT 
        be playing this game if they don't know how to interact properly. For 
        fuck's sakes it's a MULTIPLAYER RPG, as in you INTERACT with other people, 
        as in NOT quake or some fps. I'm fucking tired of stupid whores who type 
        super amazingly fucking slow and give the most bland boring and shitty 
        responses. I want all those fuckers to cancel their accnts, or learn how 
        to interact with other people or just kill themselves in real life so 
        I don't have to deal with stupid fucks like them.</p>

      <p>Problem: Twinking. <br>
        The majority of twinking is done by high level characters buying/giving 
        their newly created characters high end stuff. A minority of newbies are 
        twinked by strangers for no other reason then to be "nice". These twinked 
        items usually are bronze items and fine steel and low level (easily obtained) 
        loot items. Solution: One character per Server. This creates the problem 
        of people already having up to 8 per server now. Solution. /move we know 
        it works.With this solution if the level 50 is bored he/she can create 
        another character on another server, there are 28 of them. This will alleviate 
        the overcrowding in the high end areas to an extent. comments?</p>
