  <p>Idiots with Slots - by Hairlip Carooe</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> The idiot in question was my short-lived, level nine Human 
    Magician, Austin... I had saved diligently since my character's creation and, 
    thanks to a higher level friend of mine, managed to get a hold of a Dragoon 
    Dirk. I was so proud of my new toy that I decided to try it out on some Gnolls 
    in Blackburrow…</p>
  <p align="left">After around an hour of hunting, I decided that I should also 
    keep my 2H Blunt skill maxed out too, as I was very close to levelling. So 
    I stuck the Dragoon Dirk in my Ranged Weapon slot so I could save its magical 
    benefits, and I equipped my staff… Things were going peachy until I saw a 
    Gnoll with holding a large staff…</p>
  <p align="left">Now, anyone who fights Gnolls for a living knows that there 
    are two types of staffs: The Worn Great Staff (sells for around 1-2gp) and 
    the Cracked Staff (sells for a whole platinum!).</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, determined to get the money, I ran with the intent to 
    slay the vile beast… Unfortunately, it looked like someone was going to beat 
    me to him. So, still for some odd reason in Paladin playing mode, I slammed 
    the Ranged Weapon key so that I could fire my bow at the Gnoll. This would 
    draw him towards me so I could collect my platinum… </p>
  <p align="left">If you've been reading carefully, you can guess what happens 
    next… "All right, here he comes… WTF?! Where's my dirk… Ohhh… DAMN IT!!!"</p>
  <p align="left">I cried myself to sleep that night…</p>
