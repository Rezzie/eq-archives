      <p align="left"><img src="angry.jpg" width="155" height="115"><font size="1">The 
        Klaknak after the nerfing of player trade skills.</font></p>
      <p align="left">I was born in 1971, the by-product of an unholy union between 
        a vienna sausage and a nerf football. My life is long and storied, so 
        here is a useful FAQ:</p>
      <p align="left">1. Klaknak, I have noticed that your site is full of drug 
        references. Do you do drugs?</p>
      <p align="left">Yes and no. I love scotch. Scotch is alcohol. Alcohol is 
        a drug. Ergo, yes I do drugs, but in reality all I do is drink a glass 
        of scotch every week or so.</p>
      <p align="left">As for real drugs, I hate to disappoint, but I don't do 
        them. I don't do them because I don't really like them. I experimented 
        (along with 99.99% of the population and presidential candidates) in college, 
        but it never really took.</p>
      <p align="left">2. Are you high right now?</p>
      <p align="left">Indeed. I accidentally slept late (and missed work), took 
        my daily regimen of Rogaine, Xanax, and stress tabs, ate a few italian 
        sausages and posted a lot of great stuff on the site ... so ... I am high 
        on life.</p>
      <p align="left">3. When did you start playing RPGs?</p>
      <p align="left">In the 70's (80's?) I played Dungeons and Dragons for about 
        a summer or two. Then, my friends and I discovered that HBO showed skin 
        flicks in the middle of the day. Ask me about the time my friend's drill 
        seargent father caught us.</p>
      <p align="left">4. What happened?</p>
      <p align="left">He yelled at us.</p>
      <p align="left">5. Um ... have you played any other games?</p>
      <p align="left">I played the Ultima serieses until I graduated from high 
        school. Then I went to college and discovered that if you join a fraternity, 
        you get to drink a lot of beer and sleep with girls. I didn't pick up 
        gaming again for 6 or 7 years. Several years ago, I bought a new computer 
        and then bought Daggerfall. Since then I have played nearly every RPG 
        offered, including the dreadful Battlespire (shudder) game. I have also 
        provided technical aid for various hintbooks by Prima.</p>
      <p align="left">6. What online RPGs have you played?</p>
      <p align="left">I played Gemstone for about a year and loved it. I think 
        the Temple of Voln concept is something that all current ORPGs lack. Unfortunately, 
        Gemstone's servers sucked big large juicy eggs, so I had to quit. I then 
        picked up Ultima Online. Ultima Online is nearly a perfect game except 
        for two HUGE utterly HUGE flaws: PKing and low spawn. I now play Everquest 
        and not much else.</p>
      <p align="left">7. What do you do for a living?</p>
      <p align="left">ARGGGG!!!!! (CK runs screaming from the room).</p>
      <p align="left">8. No, really.</p>
      <p align="left">Oh. I am sorry, I thought you said &quot;tool.&quot; Well, 
        presently I am a counselor for mentally retarded adults. I used to work 
        in a psychology lab, but I quit that just a few days ago. As for what 
        I plan to do, let me give you a wish list:</p>
      <p align="left">a. Design computer games (utter pipe dream)</p>
      <p align="left">b. Write for a computer games mag if it pays over $100,000 
        (utter pipe dream)</p>
      <p align="left">c. Get my PhD in clinical psych specializing in mental retardation.</p>
      <p align="left">In all seriousness, I would love to somehow be involved 
        in the gaming industry (like everyone else), but I honestly feel the work 
        I do with MR people is important as well. What will probably end up happening 
        is that gaming will be a hobby and I will have a very satisfying career 
        helping out people who really need it.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="nose.jpg" width="125" height="113"><font size="1">What 
        the Klaknak really does for a living.</font></p>
      <p align="left">9. What happened yesterday that is so damn special?</p>
      <p align="left">A few weeks ago, I looked after this woman's cat. She gave 
        me a bottle of 12 year old scotch as a thank you present.</p>
      <p align="left">10. Why did you start the Cackling Klaknak?</p>
      <p align="left">When I played UO, I posted several humorous tidbits on a 
        bulletin board. I thought about starting a UO humor website then, but 
        my desire to play UO was quickly waning. When I bought EQ and played it 
        for a few weeks, I knew I had to make a humor site dedicated to it.</p>
      <p align="left">11. What is the best thing about the website?</p>
      <p align="left">The best thing is that a majority of the submissions are 
        awesome. When I first started, I was afraid that I would get tons of idiotic 
        email containing fart jokes and whatnot. But I think I scared off these 
        guys by referring to Hume a lot.</p>
      <p align="left">12. Why are you interviewing yourself?</p>
      <p align="left">I have a HUGE ego.</p>
