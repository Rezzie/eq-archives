  <p align="center">Losing My Experience - by Jonathon C.</p>
  <p align="center">(probably based on REM's 'Losing my Religion' - CK)</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">These mobs are bigger<br>
    They're bigger than you<br>
    And you are grouped with me <br>
    The buffs that I would get you <br>
    The distance we can kite with sow <br>
    Oh no, he resisted your spells<br>
    He's attacking me </p>
  <p align="left">That's me on Karana <br>
    That's me with the rogue guy <br>
    Losing my experience <br>
    Trying to keep ahead of you <br>
    And I don't know if I can do it <br>
    Oh no, I've died too much <br>
    The orcs haven't died enough <br>
    I thought that I went unconscious <br>
    I thought that I heard you ACK <br>
    I think I thought you saw me die</p>
  <p align="left"> Every minute<br>
    Of every freaking hour I'm <br>
    /Shouting for resurrections <br>
    Trying to keep an eye on clerics <br>
    Like a naked guy bound in Steamfont <br>
    Oh no, I've died again <br>
    Damn minotaur <br>
    Consider this<br>
    Consider that <br>
    Consider playing another class <br>
    Consider that! <br>
    My last slip up had me <br>
    Stunned in place and spinning <br>
    What with all these festering hags<br>
    Come flailing around <br>
    Now I've lost my level <br>
    I thought that I went unconscious<br>
    I thought that I heard you ark<br>
    I think I thought you saw me die </p>
  <p align="left">But that was not a dream <br>
    Wish it was just a dream</p>
  <p align="left"> But that was not a dream<br>
    Die, cry, why? *sigh*<br>
    Wish it was just a dream <br>
    Just a dream, just a dream<br>
    Dream</p>
