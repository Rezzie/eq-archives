  <p>Barnacle Brain - by Ierin Woodblade</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Ok, i was going to get the blue barnacle breastplate, cause 
    i heard it was blue and you could get it at level 10 and I wanted to look 
    good. My druid was level 23 then so i got to Allakazam web page, get the quest 
    instraucitons, print them, and log in to everquest. Ok, I go to erudin, travel 
    to qeynos. So now I have to kill a diseased shark. Sinch, so I wait about 
    10 minutes, killing his baby fishes in the process. He spawns, and i kill 
    hgim quick and easy. get his shark skin, then while reading the rest of the 
    instructions for the quest, i had not noticed that I was still underwater. 
    Well I looked up, saw my life bar, tried to get air, but was too late. So 
    I was sent back across the world to kelethin. And I scrolled up to see exactly 
    what happened, and a shark that is like level 7 or so was biting me for abuot 
    3 damage so I lost a half bubble of exp cause of a level 7 shark. Then later 
    on i found that I couldn't even wear the breastplate... </p>

    errors, spelling errors, etc. but I thought doing so would somehow detract 
    from the overall effect.</p>
