  <p><font size="4">Might and Magic vs. Baldur's Gate - by the Cackling Klaknak</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">[Editor's Note: (dons his flame retardant dungaroos)]</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Let me start off with my thesis statement: Might and Magic 7 
    is more fun than Baldur's Gate.</p>
  <p align="left">Caveat: But Baldur's Gate is a better game.</p>
  <p align="left">So: Let me explain.</p>
  <p align="left">A little while ago, back when CRPGs were still struggling to 
    emerge from the RPG dark ages of the early 90's, two cheesy looking games 
    from New World Computing emerged to plague my days: Heroes of Might and Magic 
    2 and Might and Magic 6.</p>
  <p align="left">For someone who has not played these games, it is a little difficult 
    to convince him of how fun these games really are. Many people (including 
    one of my close friends) look at the cartoon style interface of Heroes of 
    Might and Magic 2 and just can't overcome their 3-D bigotry. Other people 
    (including some of those above) look at the (horribly) dated graphics of Might 
    and Magic 6 (and therefore 7) and can't play long enough to realize how completely 
    addicting the game is.</p>
  <p align="left">In the end, however, if you give these games a chance, they 
    are a lot of fun. I won't discuss the Heroes series now (since it already 
    receives well deserved praise) but I do want to turn your attention to Might 
    and Magic 6 (and therefore 7) to you and suggest that it is a lot more fun 
    to play than Baldur's Gate. I will do this by pointing out what makes an RPG 
    an RPG (for me) and show how Might and Magic 6 (7) wins on the fun level even 
    though Baldur's Gate is a technically more sophisticated and better game.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Story</b></p>
  <p align="left">Baldur's Gate: What story? Baldur's Gate is elegant but it is 
    without a soul. It is like a shiny clean robot whereas Might and Magic is 
    like a very ugly, but gregarious dog.</p>
  <p align="left">Might and Magic 6...? It is true that Might and Magic 6 lacked 
    something of a story, but for those who have played the Heroes series and 
    some of the earlier Might and Magic series, the lack of a game specific story 
    was not so marked in the context of the overall mythology. And Might and Magic 
    7's story is a huge improvement, both over MM6 and Baldur's Gate.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Statistics</b></p>
  <p align="left">Baldur's Gate: I know this is blasphemy, but ADD rules doesn't 
    transfer very well to solo playing. When you are doing pen and paper, the 
    fact that you can spend months on a character to get to level 3 is tempered 
    by the fact that you are involved in a very interactive, dynamic system of 
    play. When you play by yourself, however, the hard core, almost tyrannical 
    ADD style rules set is oppressive and tedious. When you play solo games (or 
    multiplayer games, for that matter), levelling plays a primary role in invigorating 
    the player.</p>
  <p align="left">Might and Magic: Might and Magic gives out levels and statistics 
    like a champ. It is just flat out fun going to the training ground and finding 
    out you have levelled once again. It gives you a lot more flexibility to muck 
    around with your character instead of being terrified that one tiny mistake 
    could wreck months of work (see Baldur's Gate).</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Spawn</b></p>
  </div>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left">Baldur's Gate: BG's spawn rate is absolutely adequate and its 
    monster AI is very good.</p>
  <p align="left">Might and Magic: The monster AI is weak, but ... damn ... there 
    are monsters EVERYWHERE. Everywhere, man. You can't walk 10 feet in any direction 
    without being clobbered by something. With this many critters, your enemy 
    can have the AI of Pong and still provide adequate challenge.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Spells</b></p>
  <p align="left">Baldur's Gate: The spells are absolutely superior.</p>
  <p align="left">Might and Magic: The spells are the weak link, I think.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The X factor</b></p>
  <p align="left">Baldur's Gate: By the time my party finally arrived in Baldur's 
    Gate, I was sick of the game. I don't know, Baldur's Gate just eventually 
    came to be a chore for me. If a game is to be primarily a solo game, its physical 
    size needs to be limited by the game system's ability to sustain enjoyment.</p>
  <p align="left">Might and Magic: When I first played Might and Magic 6, I was 
    pretty skeptical until I noticed that I spent most of my waking hours thinking 
    about it or playing it. It has become one of my favorite games to play for 
    reasons totally unknown to me. It's cool, man.</p>
  <p align="left">I wish I could write a long, well written, logically clean thesis 
    on why I think MM6 and 7 are more fun to play than Baldur's Gate, but I think 
    the bottom line is that it is a personal thing. Baldur's Gate was incredibly 
    important and is essentially the Quake of the RPG genre, but something about 
    it just left me feeling a little empty. Instead of a spark, it only provided 
    me with a cool, methodical example of a well designed game. In the age of 
    game slop, this is not an unimportant detail, but in the end, I want something 
    that keeps me up a night. Might and Magic does that for me (oh yeah, and *(%$ 
    Everquest). </p>
