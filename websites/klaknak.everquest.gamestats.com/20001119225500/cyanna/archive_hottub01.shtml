      <p><i>&quot;Recently, I have been hunting the realms with a long-time friend, 
        Ms. Briolique. Things always went well, and we worked very well together 
        (she is a gnomish cleric, and I am a hafling warrior). We have hunted 
        quite succesfully together all across Norrath, from the Aviaks in Lake 
        Rathetear, to the undead in the Estate of Unrest. </i></p>
      <p><i>However, as of recently, her sister (who I will call "Stormmy") has 
        been tagging alone. Oh, she works great in the group, she's a wizard, 
        really balances things out with that whole generic D&D thing. She also 
        has a way of getting anything that she asks for, and I mean ANYTHING. 
        FBR's, Staffs of Writhing, you name it, and she's got it for free.The 
        problem is though, is that she just won't be quiet! She talks constantly, 
        talking about things that she obviously knows nothing about. She shouts 
        rather than tells across the zone to talk to her high level friends, just 
        so everyone knows that yes, Stormmy knows high level people. She butts 
        in on things that she knows she has no business in. Worst of all, she's 
        started calling me in real life asking me for rides to places!</i></p>
      <p><i> My problem is, I want to tell Stormmy to bugger off, but at the same 
        time I don't want to upset Ms. Briolique. Any help? </i></p>

    <p align="left">Dear Helpless Halfling </p>
    <p align="left">It seems you have 2 problems here, one in game and one in 
      RL. As far as the game goes, I have a possible solution. I’ll take Stormmy 
      off your hands. I would love to hang with someone who could get me high 
      level loot for free and had high level friends to powerlevel me. Or, you 
      can do what I used to do with my brother and pay people to play with him, 
      thus keeping him out of my hair. (Sorry, bro). Which brings me to an interesting 
      point. Stormmy sounds like a youngster by her immature acts (and the fact 
      that she can’t drive). I have never met a pair of young siblings that did 
      not get on each others nerves. My brother and I fought all the time. Maybe 
      you should say something to your friend. I bet Stormmy tagging along both 
      in RL and in a game, must be too much for her too. As for the RL problem 
      of hitching rides, I have a possible solution. I used to car-pool with my 
      brother, and he would get on my nerves from time to time. I knew that he 
      absolutely HATED country music. So every time he was in the car I blasted 
      country music until he refused to ride with me anymore (sorry again, bro).

    <p align="left">Dear Solo, </p>
    <p align="left">I must admit I am a bit confused. One of my best friends in 
      EQ is a druid and she has no problem with people liking her. She even stays 
      anon most of the time because people are constantly bombarding her with 
      requests for SOWs, binds and teleports. And I must admit, as a warrior, 
      I would want a druid over any other class if I could pick one adventuring 
      partner. I am so freaking slow I almost have to have sow and teleports to 
      get anywhere. Plus they can heal, the damage shields are great, and evac 
      is a must. So I would suggest finding some slow-ass, beat to hell, warrior 
      who would find your unique abilities a godsend and the two of you will kick 
      some serious butt. Believe me, for a 2 person group a warrior would be nuts 
      to pick anything but a druid or shaman. And you eventually get regen too 
      which is the clarity crack for warriors. Once you get a taste of regen you 
      cannot live without it. I suggest hanging out near a dungeon and saying 
      ‘Casting Regen. First hit is free.’ BTW can I get a port to North Karana?

    <p align="left"><i>Dear Cyanna, <br>
      I have a little matter of love I was hoping you could help me with. I'm 
      a Half-Elf Druid, born and raised in Surefall Glade, and I have the HUGEST 
      crush on Holly Windstalker, but whenever I try to talk to her, she just 
      tells me that if I so much as look at one of her "animal friends" sideways, 
      she'll cut my throat. Is she "into" those animals, is it the fact that I'm 
      Half-Elf and she's human, or is it something else? Help! </i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>- Qickin' it in Qeynos </i></p>
    <p align="left">Dear Qickin’,<br>
      I would be a bit wary around Holly. She is quite the black widow, having 
      slain more than one suitor over the years. And if her ‘animal friends’ take 
      a dislike to you, it spells a one way trip back to your bind point. As for 
      her bad attitude, who would not be cranky after not getting laid for years? 
      But my advice to you is this, cast wolf form on yourself, or get a friendly 
      druid to do it for you, and start humping her leg like a crazed weasel. 
      What woman could resist that?<br>

    <p align="left"><i>Dear Cyanna:<br>
      I have unfortunately met someone who is smart, intelligent, and funny in 
      EQ, but she has this cool exterior that is impossible to break through. 
      I have tried everything from stalking to ... well, I have pretty much stuck 
      with stalking ... NOTHING HAS WORKED! What am I to do?</i></p>
    <p align="left"><i> - Sincerely. a klaknak in a moustache disguise </i></p>
    <p align="left">Dear CK…umm…I mean, total stranger, <br>
      Have you tried an ice pick? Seriously (yeah, right), although stalking works 
      in some cases, it usually results in criminal charges and restraining orders. 
      Let’s for the sake of argument, say the object of your affections is a gnome 
      necromancer. I suggest, my favorites, flattery and gifts. For example, say, 
      ‘You know you look beautiful under the dim red glow of a fire beetle eye’ 
      or ‘Your eyes are like pools of water filled with piranha’ or ‘I love the 
      stench of death you are wearing’. And if you are on a tight budget, expensive 
      gifts can be replaced with sentimental ones. Nothing says I like you, better 
      than a stack of bone chips and a bottle of Kwalish. If that does not work, 
      you can always try and get her drunk. Or as a final act of desperation you 
      can try honestly telling her that you like her. I would take her to Highpass 
      to the inn called the Tiger’s Roar. It is a beautiful place with a nice 
      view of the waterfall. Buy her a couple of drinks (preferably the expensive 
      ones from upstairs), and then tell her. And if things work out, there are 
      rooms for rent right upstairs. Trust me, it works.</p>

      *have* told me I'd be good to eat, but I think they are just being polite.)

    <p align="left"><i>Yours, Can't Think of a Clever Nickname in Kelethin </i></p>
    <p align="left">Dear Clever,</p>
    <p align="left"> It may be you to some degree. I have adventured with a another 
      female friend of mine before. She is very nice and can be a bit helpless 
      at times and men that we group with seem to fawn all over her. I on the 
      other hand try to roleplay my barbarian persona probably a bit too much. 
      Men see a 7’ tall barbarian with a strong personality and a maul the size 
      of an elf and it seems to curb their hormonal impulses. </p>
    <p align="left">However, I have played characters of all races and even when 
      I play my dark elven warrior dressed in chain mail lingerie, I have never 
      been subject to sexual harassment, only unsolicited gifts. I think it is 
      just like the kewl dood stuff I always hear about. They are just like smart, 
      attractive, rich and sensitive men. I have never seen one but they are rumored 
      to exist. I think wood elf harrassment is the exception rather than the 
      rule. So I do not think it is you. I am sure you are just as good looking 
      as the other thousands of wood elfs that you exactly resemble. However, 
      I try not to just give advice, but to also fix problems. So I’m sending 
      over Psychlowombat, a master of sexual innuendo, to follow you around and 
      ask you for a topless brush job. </p>
