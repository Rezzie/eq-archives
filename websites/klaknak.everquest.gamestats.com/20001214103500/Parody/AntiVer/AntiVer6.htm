  <p>Petition for New Class: Pets - by Jamilyn Skyheart</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> To Verant, A Petition for a New Class Brought to you by S.T.O.O.P.I.D. 
    (So That Our Odd Pets' Intelligence Drops).</p>
  <p align="left">We here at S.T.O.O.P.I.D. wish to bring forth a petition for 
    a new class, in accordance with Feedback Code 187.69. As you also know, we 
    worship Brad McQuaid, so we are assured our prayers . . . ermm . . . petition 
    will be answered in a positive note.</p>
  <p align="left">We ask that a new class, the pet class, become available to 
    your customers. We constantly seek enjoyment in EverQuest, but we feel that 
    to truly enjoy this game, this new class is needed. Please find our detailing 
    of this class, along with explanations where needed, below. </p>
  <p align="left">Class Type: Pet</p>
  <p align="left">Races Available: All. -- There are stupid people who show characteristics 
    like that of the pet already in every race. It couldn't affect the delicate 
    balance of EverQuest.</p>
  <p align="left">Genders Available: Both. -- A long, lengthy debate went on at 
    the S.T.O.O.P.I.D. headquarters last week, discussing this very topic. Many 
    felt that males should be the only gender, others women. Some said they should 
    be unisex. To appease most, we decided to let things sit as is, at least for 
    now.</p>
  <p align="left">Names: MUST be randomly generated, with occassional corny names 
    appearing in the name generator (such as Konann and Loser). -- This feature 
    is already implemented with the pets in the game.</p>
  <p align="left">Deities Available: Aradune Mithra, god of All. -- How could 
    they worship anyone else? Heathens if they did!</p>
  <p align="left">Base STR: 90 -- Pets need to be strong, as they are tanks, but 
    they also need to be fairly weak, so that no one could solo with them. After 
    all, this is a massive multi-player online game. We can't have people trying 
    to be non-socialable.</p>
  <p align="left">Base STA: 1000. -- If a current pet can float half-way across 
    the zone, snag 20 orcs, bring them back without getting stunned, and still 
    fight, so can the new pet class.</p>
  <p align="left">Base AGI: 60.</p>
  <p align="left">Base DEX: 60. -- They can't hit too often, or be missed too 
    often. Again, see the note under strength about soloing.</p>
  <p align="left">Base WIS: 5. -- This gives a pet enough mana to cast one spell 
    until it reaches full mana again, without meditate (because they cannot meditate), 
    just as the pets in the game do. Base </p>
  <p align="left">INT: 1. -- There are two reasons for this incredibly low stat. 
    1) Pet's spells must be near completely useless. This gimps the power of their 
    spells. 2) Pets are dumb. Plain dumb. It doesn't matter how many times you 
    tell it to kill this, not that, or how many times you tell it to follow you, 
    it will still not comply, because it isn't smart. It doesn't understand. This 
    is one of the main features of this class as well. No one can blame you for 
    pulling the whole dungeon to the zone, or for being so weak. You're programmed 
    that way.</p>
  <p align="left">CHA: 10. -- Some people like pets. Most people don't. In addition 
    to this stat, we ask that factions with all NPCs be lowered to dubious, and 
    that factions with NPCs such as orcs, gnolls, and frogloks be lowered to the 
    lowest available.</p>
  <p align="left">Skills Available: None. Pets cannot go up in any skill.</p>
  <p align="left">Weapons Available: For elven pets, none. For human pets, only 
    the appearance of one. For evil races, all weapons are available, but disappear 
    forever upon death.</p>
  <p align="left">Armor Available: None.</p>
  <p align="left">Spells Available: A random, level 1 spell.</p>
  <p align="left">Home City: Anywhere, but the first choice available will be 
    the closest dungeon to the chosen race of the pet. We believe that you will 
    find the new pet class extremely satisfying for game play. Please take this 
    into review.</p>
  <p align="left">Your friends at S.T.O.O.P.I.D.</p>
  <p align="left">Attachments: $10,000,000 and it's equivalent in platinum.</p>
