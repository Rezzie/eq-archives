  <p>What is a Girl? - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Falling in the category of &quot;Sad but True,&quot; many of 
    us believe that Women are mystical, mythical creatures created by game designers 
    in order to &quot;mix things up a bit.&quot; For all of you lusting after 
    Lara Croft or the Everquest Wood Elves, here is the good news: Women are real! 
    And here is even better news: They are not polygonal! But now, the sad news: 
    Those things are fake.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><img src="../Images/Girl.jpg" width="303" height="217"> </p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2">Elisabetta Sirani (1638-1665, Italy) Porcia 
    Wounding Her Tight 1664</font></p>
  <p align="left">Item 1: This, my friends, is a girl. Most do not have numbers 
    on them. Instead, I have used this numbering system to explain to you what 
    a girl is and is not. If you ever date a woman, you can ask her if she will 
    put numbers on her until you get acquainted with her, but I wouldn't hold 
    my breath.</p>
  <p align="left">Item 2: This is a girl's head. Here is an interesting secret 
    that many newbie men do not know: there is an organ in there called a brain. 
    That's right, a woman is NOT a creature for you to pet and love and treat 
    like a toy. A woman, much like you (but omigod, so much unlike you (Klaknak 
    drools)), has a brain. What does this mean? A woman, my friends, is a person 
    ... a human being. If you ever forget this, not only will you probably get 
    the shit kicked out of you, but you will probably never be able to spend more 
    than five minutes with a girl except when stuck in a Hurricane Mania line 
    at the local supermarket.</p>
  <p align="left">Item 3: These are a girl's eyes. Another interesting secret 
    that most newbie men do not understand is that girls can control men with 
    their eyes. Many newbie men become so fixed with Items 5 and 7, that they 
    never fully experience what it means to be caught in the Vulcan Mind Grip 
    that is a woman's gaze. Beware. It is deadly and is as addictive, if not more 
    so, than Everquest.</p>
  <p align="left">Item 4: This here is a woman's lips and they are the proper 
    center of the universe, the axis mundi of the miserable male existence. First 
    of all, there are sounds that come out of her lips. When sounds start coming 
    out, you damn better listen or you will get the shit kicked out of you. A 
    woman's lips are also softer than a baby's bottom and if you are one of the 
    rare gaming men invited to touch them with your own scaly, dorito stained 
    smackers, you have an immediate ticket to worldly paradise. And finally, there 
    is this little thing called fellatio ... but that is for men who have law 
    degrees or sailboats, not gamers.</p>
  <p align="left">Item 5: Breasts. Some women are embarrassed by them. Other women 
    cut one of them off to improve their archery skill (now THAT is powergaming!). 
    What are they? I am not really sure, but it is possible that they are proof 
    of a divine presence in the universe. Here is a tip: Some women spend thousands 
    of dollars to get their breasts enhanced. Ignore these women. Their breasts 
    feel like really bad chiropractic mattresses. Instead, actively seek out women 
    with natural breasts. It says a lot about their soul. If you happen to date 
    a woman with small breasts, she may feel very conscientious about them, so 
    tell her they are sexy because ... because they really are. </p>
  <p align="left">Item 6: Hands. They are just these wonderful, miniature, incredible 
    little ... (Klaknak falls over in a dead faint).</p>
  <p align="left">Item 7: Babies do not come from an id expansion pack. They come 
    from here. In order to make one, you need to quit gaming. Also, some men reportedly 
    venture down here to engage in cunnilingus, but I think you can only do this 
    if you can score some coke.</p>
  <p align="left">Item 8: These shoes are made for walking. Enough said. Unlike 
    games, you cannot sue a woman because she won't work for you.</p>
  <p align="left">Item 9: What the hell is going on back here?</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, I hope this brief anatomy primer has convinced you that 
    women are not mythical creatures but are real, living beautiful people who 
    will forever change your life. And I will ask you not to point out that my 
    model is a painting. Women are real, I swear!</p>
