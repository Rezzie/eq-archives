  <p align="center">Stanford Internet Study: The Sticky Substance that is Truth 
    - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <div align="center" class="klakstyle">
    <p align="left">As many of you have heard with ever increasing impatience, 
      I have a background in psychological researchology (in the area of cognition) 
      and so am more than qualified to reach ridiculous (but well formed) conclusions 
      about yet another silly internet study. For those new to the mind of Joe, 
      please remember that while I tend to ramble, it will all tie up neatly in 
      the end. If it doesn't, I have included a sedative at http://[attorney's 
      note: deleted] for your benefit.</p>
    <p align="left">If you want to read an article on the survey I trash below, 
      please go <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/000216/bmc.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">There is this thing in the world called &quot;reality&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">No, I am not going to get metaphysical ... I am uninterested 
    in whether we are self-fulfilling entities or brains in a vat in a New Jersey 
    basement ... no, no, no, I want to talk about everyday reality.</p>
  <p align="left">All of us, everyone, feel that, for the most part, our impressions 
    of the world are reasonable. We look back at the days of pre-enlightenment 
    mumbo jumbo with scorn and raise our malt liquor in a toast to our well formed 
    society.</p>
  <p align="left">But the truth of the matter is, all of us, everyone, take a 
    lot of stuff on faith alone. All of us have certain impressions that we feel 
    to be basically true, yet we have absolutely no idea where these impressions 
    came from. Sure, we try to tell ourselves that we have created these impressions 
    ourselves, but the fact of the matter is that society has created a lot of 
    these impressions for us. Here is a short list:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Women can't have sex without love.</p>
  <p align="left">2. If you go out in the cold rain bare foot, you will catch 
    a cold.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Sitting too close to the TV damages your eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">Trust me, there are billions of impressions like these swirling 
    in our heads this very minute.</p>
  <p align="left">But where do these impressions come from? Well, they come from 
    all over the place, but in our age of enlightenment, a lot of them come from 
    these pernicious things called &quot;studies.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Let's take the television example listed above. There is not 
    an American (or perhaps a Canadian) alive who has not heard this. I have absolutely 
    no idea if tv damages the eyes or if this is merely a myth, but I do want 
    to use the example to make a point about &quot;studies.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Let's go back to the 1950's for a moment. Television was a new 
    media and, with every new technology, it no doubt created a lot of suspicion 
    and eagerness in the eyes of young professors seeking tenure. Let me make 
    up an article to make my point:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;In a recent study, scientists have discovered that tv 
    damages your eyes!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Wham! A myth is born. The populace gets excited and there is 
    a mass movement of sofas away from the satanic glare of the tv screen.</p>
  <p align="left">Of course, it may just be that when you look at the study closer 
    (which no one actually does), you will find some interesting caveats:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;In a recent study (by the Institute of Institutional Institutes 
    in a Hut in Belize), scientists (men with PhDs in theological nutrition and 
    sports atrocities) have discovered (by taping mice face forward into television 
    sets) that tv damages your eyes (if you put your eyeball directly on tv)!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Whoa! This changes everything completely! This study is a total 
    fraud!</p>
  <p align="left">And yet, the damage is already done. A myth is born!</p>
  <p align="left">[note: remember, I am just making this stuff up to make a point. 
    TV could very well damage your eyes, I have no clue.]</p>
  <p align="left">[note: I am well aware of the irony of me making up stuff to 
    criticize people making stuff up.]</p>
  <p align="left">So, as you can see, our &quot;reality&quot; may not be as grounded 
    in fact as we all wish it could be.</p>
  <p align="left">***</p>
  <p align="left">Now it is time to trash the Stanford study. Let's work through 
    the article linked above.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb 16 (Reuters) - As Americans spend 
    more time on the Internet they are not only seeing less of their friends and 
    families, but also spending less time stuck in traffic, shopping in malls 
    and watching television. &quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Ok, here is problem number one. The media. 
    I would have felt a lot better if the opening paragraph had started out with 
    &quot;According to a Stanford study ...&quot; Instead, the first paragraph 
    is presented as a fact. This may seem like a small point, but remember that 
    many people do not bother to get into the heady details of the actual study. 
    They read this paragraph and already start assimilating it into the fabric 
    of myth without giving it much thought. TV outlets like CNN, NBC, etc. no 
    doubt pick up on this too and send Tom Brokaw out to smirk to the world that 
    the internet is, factually, making people little isolated wonk monkeys.</font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;A new study on the Internet's impact on society released 
    Wednesday reached the conclusion that the more time people spent online, the 
    less time they spent with real people. But it also revealed some possible 
    benefits, including a reduction in the time spent on some of life's other 
    drudgeries and mindless activities.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Real people? In scientific studies, there 
    is this thing called an operational definition. If you are going to study 
    the effects of chocolate on sexual desire, for example, you need to operationally 
    define desire so that it can be measured quantitatively. The same goes here. 
    What, exactly, is a &quot;real person&quot;? What does this mean? If I am 
    talking to someone on ICQ, is this not an interaction with a real person? 
    Admittedly, I am parsing words that Reuters, and not necessarily the study, 
    presented, but I have read several articles about this study (I cannot find 
    the study myself) and all of them seem to make this distinction of &quot;real 
    people&quot; versus ... gosh, &quot;fake people&quot; I guess.</font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Despite these trends, the study, by the Stanford Institute 
    for the Quantitative Study of Society at Stanford University, found that the 
    majority of people who use the Internet still have not seen a significant 
    change in the way they spend their time. About two-thirds of the Internet 
    users surveyed said they spent less than five hours a week online.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Ok, here is the KEY paragraph that most 
    readers, journalists, mutants, dogs, cats, etc. will skip over and not remember. 
    This is very very key: the study found that the majority of people have not 
    seen a significant change. However, as you will soon see, this key fact will 
    be totally ignored so that journalists and scientists can start leaping to 
    some mighty large (and unfounded) conclusions.</font></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;But as Stanford Professor Norman Nie noted, the percentage 
    of heavy Internet users is growing, and will likely increase as a portion 
    of the overall population as the Internet continues to reach new households.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Oops, here we go. The professor has moved 
    from scientific data to the realm of opinion. Lock up the kids, a Stanford 
    professor has said heavy internet usage may go up! We are all heading for 
    moral decline!</font></p>
  <p align="left">``The Internet could be the ultimate isolating technology that 
    further reduces our participation in communities even more than television 
    did before it,'' said Nie, who was the chief investigator in the study. </p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">This is just totally and completely irresponsible. 
    This statement right here absolutely pisses me off. He takes his data (which 
    we will look at in a minute), completely misinterprets it (to fit his somewhat 
    Luddite tendencies) and then starts leaping to these totally irresponsible 
    opinions, comparing the internet to tv (like comparing apples to oranges). 
    Any beginning statistics student would get an F for saying unfounded shit 
    like this.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Another key finding of the study was that the more years people 
    have been using the Internet, the more hours they tend to spend online. In 
    addition, sixty percent of regular Internet users say the Internet has reduced 
    their TV viewing, and one-third spend less time reading newspapers. </p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Ok, here is some data. The study found 
    that 60 percent OF HEAVY INTERNET USERS WHICH A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT!!! 
    PLEASE SEE THE QUICKLY FORGOTTEN PARAGRAPH ABOVE watch less tv. Is this a 
    bad thing? What, is television now seen as some sort of wholesome community 
    activity? The study also found that one third OF HEAVY INTERNET USERS WHICH 
    A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE NOT spend less time reading newspapers. The implication 
    here, of course, is that the intelligent act of reading a paper is being supplanted 
    by the evil internet. I suppose the study did not consider that people actually 
    read fucking news on the internet (I know I do) therefore eliminating the 
    need to buy a paper.</font></p>
  <p align="left">One activity that tends to increase with increased Internet 
    use is work. While a small fraction -- about four percent -- of those surveyed 
    -- said they cut back their hours at the office after gaining Internet access, 
    16 percent said they were working more hours at home without cutting back 
    at the office. Another eight percent reported increases in time spent working 
    at home and at the office. </p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Sixteen percent of people now work more 
    at home!!! What?!?! Lock up the children! No one points out, however, that 
    a lot of things correlate with the internet. Are they working more at home 
    because of the internet, or is it that because of the internet driven economy, 
    more companies are pushing their employees to work harder to bring their companies 
    into the internet revolution? I dont know, man. This is pretty fishy to me. 
    </font></p>
  <p align="left">Several Internet companies were quick to issue their interpretation 
    of the study, and point out that by shopping and planning trips online, people 
    should actually have more time to spend with other people. </p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Let me rewrite this:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Several evil Internet companies with their 
    own self-interest in mind were quick to scurry around to cover their butts.</font></p>
  <p align="left">The online shopping site Brodia.com even offered some tips on 
    making Internet surfing a less isolated activity. ``It may boil down to where 
    your computer lives in your home,'' Brodia said in a statement, advising people 
    to place their computers ``in a communal room or high traffic area.'' Doing 
    so, it said, would help ``create an environment where family may flourish 
    in all the same ways it did when everyone ate dinner or watched TV together.''</p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Hey, I have no problem with that, but 
    do you see what has happened? When TV started hurting people's eyes, I posited 
    above, sofas were moved all around the country. Now, based on a bunch of very 
    very iffy data used to jump to large conclusions, a company is suggesting 
    people rearrange their house, totally ignoring that A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE 
    ARE NOT EVEN COVERED BY THIS STUDY!!!!</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">Bah.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">This study is totally irresponsible and 
    Stanford should be ashamed. Even if all Americans were spending less time 
    watching TV, reading newspapers, etc. (and this is NOT what the study suggests), 
    it is still grossly irresponsible to ignore the fact that the internet, by 
    its very post-defense-network existence, is EXACTLY a community. That is the 
    whole freaking point. I probably communicate with 20 times the number of people 
    I communicated with before the internet revolution. Bah! This is crazy stuff!</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">But the studies will keep on rolling. 
    Why? Because newspapers need copy and professors need tenure.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">But before you start rearranging your 
    furniture, please remember my favorite phrase when dealing with perceptions 
    of reality:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000066">caveat emptor</font></p>
