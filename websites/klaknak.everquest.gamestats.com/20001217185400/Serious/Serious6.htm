  <p>Shootings - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The number one purpose of this site is humor related to Everquest. 
    The number one purpose of this serious section is to give me (and you) a place 
    to talk about serious stuff, whether it is related to Everquest or not. I 
    really hesitated to post this here, but I really felt like I needed to clarify 
    my own thoughts and to give you some of my opinions on this issue. If you 
    need humor, go back to the main site!</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">What causes these shootings?</p>
  <p align="left">Before I give you my answer (which is: &quot;everything&quot;), 
    let me tell what is wrong with our discourse.</p>
  <p align="left">Whenever an issue creeps up in America (and possibly everywhere 
    else), there is a tendency to believe that every effect has a single cause. 
    There are two reasons for this:</p>
  <p align="left">1. human nature - Back when I spent more time in the psychology 
    lab than I do today, I studied human reasoning, and if there is one near certainty, 
    it is that people are sloppy thinkers. Whether this is due to our inherent 
    stupidity (some people's view) or our inherent ability to maximize mental 
    efficiency due to limited space (my view), people are prone to take complex 
    issues and distill them into easily digestible, but overly simplified clumps. 
    So, with the shootings problem, many of us believe that there is a single 
    cause.</p>
  <p align="left">2. politics - Politicians, pundits, activists, etc. know us 
    better than we do. They know that people make decisions based on nuggets of 
    overgeneralization. So, the conservatives come on board and say the shootings 
    are the result of a godless country. The liberals claim they are the result 
    of an out of control society of guns. What the shootings really are to them 
    (to overgeneralize a bit myself) is a battlefield on which to continue to 
    wage their war against the opponent. The arguments are always the same, but 
    they continue to wage anyway, because if they started to consider more complicated 
    solutions, they would lose their soundbites (see Media Criticism below).</p>
  <p align="left">Now, I think that a lot of sensible people DO realize that the 
    shootings are a complicated issue, but I think it took a string of shootings 
    for us to figure that out. As sad as it is, I think it took several shootings 
    by a wide variety of people under a wide variety of circumstances for people 
    to finally sit up and say: &quot;Whoa ... dude. Like, that guy in Atlanta 
    didn't play Doom. Maybe it isn't just video games.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">So, let me say that EVERYTHING causes these shootings and the 
    causal attribution is probably different for each shooter. But let me break 
    down some of these probable necessary (but not sufficient, true believers!) 
    causes of shootings from which we get to choose before assigning blame.</p>
  <p align="left">(in no necessary order)</p>
  <p align="left">1. The Christian Church as Seen on TV. Back when I was more 
    atheist than not, I used to think that all Christian churches were bastions 
    of hypocrisy. Never in my life have a made a more woeful and idiotic overgeneralization. 
    Through my work in the community with mentally retarded adults, I have found 
    that some of the best, most kind people in the community are devout Christians.</p>
  <p align="left">But then you turn on the TV. And believe it or not, I am not 
    talking about big haired yo yo's on the Christian channels, but I am talking 
    about the well coiffed yo yo's that appear on the news whenever any issue 
    comes up. I am talking about the Falwells and the Reeds and the ... cackle 
    ... Quayles and Buchanans.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, stick with me here, but I am going to digress a little 
    bit and then come back to prove a point (I hope).</p>
  <p align="left">There is no absolute moral truth.</p>
  <p align="left">Those who believe there is an absolute moral truth are extremely 
    dangerous.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, you may disagree strongly with my initial premise (there 
    is no moral truth), but there is something very very scary about these yo 
    yo's and their belief that only a Christian God can provide the absolute moral 
    answers to all of us whether we are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, 
    athiests, Wiccans, or whatever. And the fact that they plan on carrying these 
    issues through into the making of public policy positively turns my hair white 
    at night.</p>
  <p align="left">What does this have to do with the shootings? Plenty:</p>
  <p align="left">a. When they say that the shootings are the result of a Godless 
    society (sorry Jews, Muslims, etc.), they are not providing an answer. They 
    don't really have an answer. Or, if they do, their answer doesn't make any 
    sense. Let's break down what they are saying:</p>
  <p align="left">(1) The shootings are the result of a Godless society.</p>
  <p align="left">(2) Therefore, the shootings can be eliminated by transforming 
    the country into one of total Christianity.</p>
  <p align="left">I really don't think this is an overgeneralization folks. I 
    have been listening to these guys for years, and I honestly feel that this 
    is what they want to do. Scary, especially if you aren't a Christian. And 
    since this is their solution, and since it is absolutely ludicrous to believe 
    it is obtainable, this &quot;solution&quot; is a non-solution. It is a preachy 
    rant and nothing more.</p>
  <p align="left">b. I am a Christian and I think the Christian faith has great 
    value for those inclined to listen to it (by their own personal choice). But 
    I think that the yo yo's are doing more damage to the Christian Church than 
    good by being ... by being yo yo's. Maybe if those Christians in our society 
    were stronger Christians, maybe (maybe) our society would be less susceptible 
    to the woes we experience. But I think a vast majority of the lukewarm Christians 
    out there (including myself) are not more involved in their own faith because 
    of the yo yo's. Nuff said.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">2. Mental Illness. Gawd, I could talk for years about this, 
    but let me be quick:<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">(a). Awareness of and treatment for mental illness is getting 
    better, but it is still extremely bad (especially for people in the low socioeconomic 
    status category).</p>
  <p align="left">(b). Self-help books. If we took all the money spent on producing 
    bullshit self-help books and spent it on trying to find real solutions to 
    the really hard core psychological problems and the education of people about 
    these problems, our society would probably be a little better off.</p>
  <p align="left">(c). Get the psychologist yo yo's off television! They use their 
    faulty studies (correlation does not mean causation, you psycho freaks) to 
    argue their personal agendas as outlined in their twenty four dollars a book 
    self help manifestos.</p>
  <p align="left">I think psychology as a profession suffers from the same problems 
    as Christianity, so I will ask you to review my Christian rant above and insert 
    &quot;Psychology&quot; into all the appropriate places to see how these tidbits 
    fit together.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">3. Guns. </p>
  <p align="left">a. I hate to say it (as a life long liberal) but the NRA has 
    a point when it says that we should prosecute laws already on the books. If 
    we run out of prisons, we can turn Idaho into a penal colony.</p>
  <p align="left">b. The NRA is wrong if they think we can allow people to self-regulate 
    themselves at gun shows and flea markets.</p>
  <p align="left">c. No one (and I mean no one) needs a machine gun for personal 
    use. Are you a gun collector? Tough. A sportsman? What about &quot;sport&quot; 
    don't you understand? Unless you are hunting a platoon of Iraqis for sport, 
    you don't need a machine gun. Tough. Sorry. Tough.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">4. Media. Whoa Nellie, this is my favorite topic, but I will 
    try to control myself and keep it short. Yes, I do believe that whenever a 
    massive shooting occurs, the media should report it. This is a vital part 
    of public discourse.</p>
  <p align="left">But the Columbine shooting coverage was way out of control. 
    And I am going to be extremely cynical, but I have to say it:</p>
  <p align="left">Why did the ratings go up, encouraging all the major news outlets 
    to cover every inch of the tragedy? Was it because the tragedy was so large? 
    Partly. Was it because the OJ Simpson tragedy and the Princess Diana tragedy 
    raised the bar on coverage? Partly. Was it because the teenager demographic 
    is one of the most highly sought after advertising groups in television.</p>
  <p align="left">Hmmmm. </p>
  <p align="left">Nah, that is too cynical. I sound like a yo yo myself.</p>
  <p align="left">Maybe.</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, the coverage of the Columbine shooting was so overblown, 
    it just begged for copy cats. Is there anything scarier than a screwed up 
    teenager feeling that his feelings of low self esteem won't be assuaged until 
    CNN covers his actions 24 hours a day for a solid couple weeks? It keeps me 
    up at night, let me tell you.</p>
</div>
<div align="center"></div>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">5. Video Games.</p>
<p align="left">a. Parents who let their 10 year olds buy Carmaggedon should be 
  taken out back and shot. If there is any legitimate argument about the dangers 
  of computer gaming, it would have to be that games like Carmaggedon could seriously 
  maladjust young kids who are not old enough to really appreciate that it is 
  just a game. And I am not making this up ... I have seen yo yo parents buy all 
  kinds of extremely violent games for kids who didn't come up to my waist. No. 
  This is bad.</p>
<p align="left">b. People who play lots of video games and then go out and shoot 
  people would have gone out and shot people anyway. This is what I think.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">6. Television/Movies. See Video games.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">7. Parents. I think bad parenting should take some blows for explaining 
  what is wrong today. Here are some parenting tips. When I say &quot;child,&quot; 
  I mean &quot;child&quot; ... someone who is pre teen. I dont know what I think 
  about teens yet:</p>
<p align="left">a. Don't beat your children and expect them to grow up adjusted.</p>
<p align="left">b. Don't call your child &quot;cocksucker&quot; or &quot;a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">c. Don't buy your child Carmaggedon.</p>
<p align="left">d. Don't let your child freely surf the internet without supervision.</p>
<p align="left">e. Don't get married unless you are serious.</p>
<p align="left">f. If both parents work, make sure it is necessary. Hey, dads. 
  You can be a stay at home mom too, yo. If it bruises your male ego, tough.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">8. Schools.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers should be paid more than doctors.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Gah, there are so many other causes, but my rant is losing steam 
  and I am hungry. Let me sum up.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">There is no single cause of these tragedies. Just look back on 
  your own actions and try and understand why you do certain things. It is really 
  really hard to do. Why should we believe that it is therefore simple to take 
  a lunatic with a gun and explain his actions in one clean swoop? It boggles 
  my mind.</p>
<p align="left">None of this means, of course, that we shouldn't do anything at 
  all, so here is something all of us can do:</p>
<p align="left">If you have a television, turn it off and play with your kids.</p>
<p align="left">If you don't have a television or kids, go have some good protected 
  sex.</p>
<p align="left">And if you are too young to have sex, you shouldn't be on my website. 
  Go away.</p>
