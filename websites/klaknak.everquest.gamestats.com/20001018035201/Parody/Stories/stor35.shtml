      <blockquote>
        <p> Ok, I learned something today..... using my phone at work here, I 
          pick up the receiver, press "drop", press "function" and press "3"... 
          the 3 is for redial. If you do this repeatedly, it can be performed 
          using either the right or the left hand in rapid succession, you are 
          likely to find that .03 second gap between other callers and thusly 
          avoid the dreaded busy signal. </p>
        <p>Using this very method (similar to the already patented 3-finger salute 
          so aptly named for re-booting a computer), I managed to connect to Zomax. 
          I followed the prompts and then one of the prompts was "To find the 
          status of your order, press 1". Ok, like the fool that I am, I press 
          1 and I received the message "Zomax is pleased to announce that the 
          majority of the Runes Of Kunark were shipped April 22". It then hung 
          up. Ok.. I was thinking... humm... let's play this fun lil game again! 
        </p>
        <p>After many many many many many many many many many redials, I manage 
          connect again. Going AGAINST my instincts (my instincts were the same 
          ones that felt I wouldn't receive the game on Monday), I follow the 
          same prompts and I get the same message, I also get the same Click sound 
          at the end of the message. I was feeling frustrated, but also very pleased 
          and happy that Zomax was pleased and happy that the majority of the 
          expansions were shipped out on the 22nd. </p>
        <p>Ok, feeling lucky now, I decide to try this yet one more time, and 
          the Race Is On!(Tm) </p>
        <p>Again I place my weary and cramped fingers into the proper position 
          for maximum speed and effect. </p>
        <p>After many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          *inhale* many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many *inhale* many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many *inhale* many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many many many many many many many many many 
          many many many many many many redials, I manage to connect yet again. 
          The going sense of triumph begins in my toes and slowly spreads upwards 
          and brings my poor cramped calloused fingers back to life. </p>
        <p>This time, I did follow my instincts and I carefully, ever so carefully, 
          listened to the prompts until I got one that mentioned "All other requests, 
          please press 2". Ok, I think I am on something here, so I press two, 
          and Lo And Behold(c) I manage to Almost connect to an operator. Seems 
          that for some very odd reason, all operators are currently busy... I 
          think she was just in the bathroom. Whilst I was pondering my current 
          dilemma and that poor Cuban boy and all of the other news-worthy events 
          that have happened, and were currently happening, the same operator 
          that was on a pee-break decided that I have waited long enough. I think 
          the re-dials and the holding was simply a test... a test to weed out 
          those weaklings who were only curious as to the status of the order 
          the place, paid for and were waiting for to only have those die-hard 
          losers with no Life (Tm by Milton-Bradley) and who would not simply 
          hang up in frustration. I passed the test, barely. While I was performing 
          this test of stamina and endurance holding the phone with my withered 
          fingers against my now burning ear, the operator said, in a very pleasant 
          voice "Zomax, how may I help you?". That question could have been answered 
          in a multitude of different answers, each one getting successively worse. 
          I answered her "You can help my by shipping out my fucking game you 
          puss filled whore"... not in those exact words.. well.. my exact words 
          were "I was wondering if you could help me, I want to know if you received 
          my order for the expansion yet". Ok, so I sugar-coated it a bit, but 
          I didn't want to play the redial game again. I am now burning with curiosity... 
          whilst playing this Fun Game, I received perhaps, oh, 3 calls. I didn't 
          answer them, they were most likely work-related and would have interrupted 
          my camping of the Zomax Operator. </p>
        <p>I gave her all of my most personal and intimate details about me and 
          my life and those close to me... I wooed her and called her pretty names. 
          She then caved into my most insidious method... the "Whore Falls For 
          It" whereby a lady will listened in rapt attention to my every word, 
          breathlessly waiting for the next pearl of wisdom to sprout forth from 
          my beared face. In anticipation of the secret, I performed a ritual 
          not many know of, I increased the volume on the phone lest I miss The 
          Secret. She divulged a guarded secret, guarded in such a way others 
          can find the secret nuclear weapons the USA has hidden in the farms 
          in Nebraska more easily than the secret she revealed to me. In hushed 
          tones, she spewed forth my Tracking Number. A hushed silence fell across 
          the room... through the phone I heard a lady scream and grown men cry. 
          I have met the challenge I have prevailed! Against all odds, I have 
          received the Information! Only now did she realize her mistake... I 
          laughed at here.... I taunted her and called her names! She has fallen 
          for the oldest trick in the game.... the "Redial many times, stay on 
          hold a long long time and be really really nice until they give you 
          an answer" trick. </p>
        <p>Triumphant and singing out of tune, I promptly hung up the phone (after 
          thanking her). Ok... I now have the Tracking Number, I only need to 
          find the key to unlock its lethal force. I searched and scoured the 
          net, looking for something, anything that I can use to call to see where 
          "The Expansion" is. I sifted through web site after web site, message 
          board after message board. Then, in all I can say was Divine Intervention, 
          the three letters that will forever be emblazoned in my mellon........ 
          UPS. Wham! Bang! Crash! I plowed to the UPS website. There, in small 
          letters, almost taunting me, was the caption "Tracking". With shaking 
          fingers and weary eyes, I clicked on the icon. What did I see? I'll 
          tell you... with tears in my eyes and a heart full of trepidation, I 
          saw a box... an glorious empty box... a box designed for me.. a box 
          whose sole purpose was to enter a tracking number. With a growing sense 
          of dread in my heart, I entered the Tracking Number, the Zomax Secret, 
          pilfered in a mid-morning assault they will not soon forget. </p>
        <p>I clicked Submit. What will I see next? Has Zomax duped me and given 
          me a false number? Is my Expansion now sitting in Moscow? The globe, 
          it swirls and twirls, not releasing the prize most sought after. It 
          spins and whirls.. and I wait.. my heart is beating rapidly.... will 
          it release what I have longed for.. sought after and fought for? Or 
          will it only say "404 Error, page not found"? </p>
        <p>I waited in breathless anticipation. The screen... it changed. I sobbed 
          aloud. Scroll damn you weak fingered right hand.. scroll like you've 
          never scroll before! I scrolled down... and there, in print no different 
          than any other print on the screen... was the key.. the key to ever 
          lasting life, the key to all I hold most dear... the expansion is sitting 
          in my home town. </p>
        <p>Now begins the guessing game.. when will the UPS guy deliver the game? 
          That is an answer not even I can tell you. </p>
