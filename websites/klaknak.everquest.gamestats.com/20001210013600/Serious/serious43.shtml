          or Disease Ridden Puss Filled Rat Meat?</font></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p>I went to Babbage's the other day. 
        <p>As soon as I walked passed those large pillars that I had previously 
          thought to be security devices, I felt a peculiar "twing" in my brain. 
          A few minutes later, solely against my own volition, I walked out with 
          a purchased copy of Daikatana. 
        <p>This is not going to be a review of Daikatana (ok, here it is: it is 
          not as bad as everyone desperately wants it to be). Instead, I want 
          to talk about this little game feature (seen in Daikatana) called a 
          "Save Gem."
        <p> Back in the era when side scrolling games were king, the save point 
          was the extremely annoying court jester, seemingly there for only the 
          king's amusement. Whenever you took your little character through a 
          level (let's call him "Sonic the Hedgehog"), if you died before you 
          reached a save point, you had to do the whole blasted level over again. 
          This led to what Stanford physicists have called The Mario Rule which 
          states:
        <blockquote> 
          <p> "The probability of your dying is inversely proportional to the 
            distance between you and your save point." </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I have never been sure why console games remained obsessed with save 
          points, but I have always secretly believed it had something to do with 
          either the gaming code or a marked causal relationship between game 
          development and sadism. 
        <p>When what are now "traditional" computer games began to take their 
          rightful place alongside the console side scrollers, the save point 
          philosophy began to decline. Whenever a game attempted to use a save 
          point system instead of a "save anywhere" system, the save point way 
          almost always became a Con in the reviewer's pro/con summary. When Galapagos 
          came out several years ago, the save point lasted maybe two weeks. The 
          first patch issued by the company immediately implemented a "save anywhere" 
          window with their apologies. Damn straight. 
        <p>So imagine my surprise when I opened Daikatana and discovered that 
          it used a "save gem" feature. I couldn't have been more surprised if 
          Glenn Miller had popped out of the box and started playing a brass instrumental 
          version of Murder Was the Case by Snoopy Doggy Dogg.
        <p> As I sat their seething and cursing the secret "buy me now!" brain 
          manipulator that Romero had somehow placed in my brain, I developed 
          a theory as to why this cursed feature was placed in the game. 
        <p>Anyone who is familiar with the BBS of an FPS has probably seen a post 
          like this: 
        <blockquote>
          <p>"You l00zers! I completed Half-life in 2 hours, without saving, with 
            both arms tied behind my back while freebasing Clorox."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Certain gamers take a great pride in going through an entire level 
          without saving and the debate between savers and nonsavers is kind of 
          like a mini-FPS version of the eternal PK vs. nonPK RPG debates. 
        <p>But I think the argument against save gems or save points or save whatevers 
          is clear and I will back it up with a story. When I worked at another 
          company, I worked with a woman whom I will call Nelda. Nelda was a very 
          small, very quiet woman who could stand under the business end of a 
          rocket booster during launch and declare quietly that there is a "chill 
          in the air" while pulling her sweater closer around her. 
        <p>As such, there was always a huge debate during the summer months. Most 
          of us wanted to have the AC cranked up really high, while Nelda and 
          a few of her minions wanted it off because it made the office too cold. 
        <p>My argument always was this: If you are too cold, you can put on a 
          sweater. If you are too hot, you can't just start taking off clothes 
          while working in an office. 
        <p>Anyway. 
        <p>What does this have to do with the save game? Lots. If you revel in 
          running through each level of the game without saving, you can do that 
          with the "save anywhere" feature. Just don't save. However, if you like 
          to save your game before, say, trying to jump on that tiny radioactive 
          ledge with a 5000 pound Gargantua on it, you should be able to. Using 
          a "save anywhere" feature encompasses all players, whereas the nasty 
          little "save gem" feature caters to only a small subset of players.
        <p> So, to answer the age old question, are save gems puss filled sores 
          or disease ridden puss filled packets of rat meat, I would have to answer 
          a most definitive yes. <br>
