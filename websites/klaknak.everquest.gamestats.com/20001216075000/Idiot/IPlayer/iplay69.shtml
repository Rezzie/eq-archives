        <p>Okay, bear with me. I wish I could have lived for the screenshot to 
          this one! 
        <p>Like so many others I decided to make an Iksar as soon as I got my 
          disk (a week late, but who's counting? After all, Ultima 9 was 4 months 
          late!). I'm a casual player who's gotten a ways up the tree, so it's 
          been a while since things as small as scorpions were a problem, but 
          I got back into the swing of newbiedome with relative ease. 
        <p>So here I am, hunting scaly wolf pups (who always seem to attack in 
          packs) and collecting scorpion claws when I see an Iksar skelly in battle 
          with some lizzy monk. All the newbies are doing their "wow!" thing as 
          the monk repeatedly smashes the undead in the low teens when they can 
          hit for 6 with a splintered club. It looks like he's got it under control 
          when: 
        <p>(name withheld) yells for help from to the left and in front of you! 
        <p>The monk starts shouting curses as everyone just stands there and watches 
          him die. I had never seen a Scalebone Skeleton before, but apparently 
          it was a monk, too! Now there are two dead monks, but one is standing 
          over the other. A message pops up to explain the situation to him: 
        <p>(name withheld) says, out of character, "that's what you get for powerleveling 
          in a newbie zone!" 
        <p>But that was only the beginning of this idiotic screw-up. 
        <p>The Scalebone nails the nearest newbie, who starts running without 
          sending out a shout or ooc (because he really WAS new)... the skelly 
          kills him in a few blows. But there are over 90 new Iksar in the Field 
          of Bone, and the Scalebone starts slaughtering them all as it follows 
          its prey toward the zone! 
        <p>This part was unreal... I laughed so hard I almost bust a gut, even 
          though I had to die to experience it. 
        <p>The Scalebone was now standing in the exact spot that newbies appear 
          when they die! The guards just stood there as literally dozens of newbies 
          died seconds after they appeared! I watched my screen in awe: 
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>You have been slain by a Scalebone Skeleton! 
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>You have been slain by a Scalebone Skeleton! 
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>You have been slain by a Scalebone Skeleton! 
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... 
        <p>You have been slain by a Scalebone Skeleton! 
        <p>And so on... 
        <p>I died at least 6 times, and the pile of bodies got so dense it must 
          have caused the crash that took me out of the game! At least the Scalebone 
          was gone when I rebooted!<br>
