  <p>Computer Gaming: In Search of Satan</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><img src="../Images/Joesatan2.jpg" width="314" height="234"></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="1">The Klaknak summons a Satanic Plastic Penguin 
    to tear your soul apart.</font></p>
  <p align="left">Once upon a time, if you had sex or if your neighbor's child 
    came down with the measles, you were burned at the stake. In the modern error 
    (sorry, I meant to type &quot;era&quot;), we as a society are more advanced. 
    Now instead of burning people at the stake, we merely make outrageous claims 
    about their activities (kinda like I am doing now). One of the more outrageous 
    claims made by lunatics out there is that computer gaming is the result of 
    Satanism run amuck amuckst our people. And so, the Cackling Klaknak dons his 
    priestly robes and stuffs a copy of Sammy Davis Jr.'s &quot;I Can&quot; into 
    his pocket and bravely scours the internet for ... Satan.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">First of all, the eternal question: Yahoo or Hotbot? Well, since 
    Yahoo is down (again), it is time for Hotbot. So, let me type in &quot;computer 
    games satan&quot; and see what we get. (By the way, I am not making any of 
    this up).</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">DIRECTORY RESULTS  248 Matches  1 - 5  more >></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2">1. Sports/ Golf/ Computer Games </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">Hmmm. This one threw me for a loop. Even if I 
    did expect computer games to come up, I certainly didn't expect Golf computer 
    games to come up ... mainly because of the inclusion of &quot;satan&quot; 
    in the search argument. I couldn't have been more surprised than if I had 
    used &quot;computer games fun&quot; instead.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">So, I clicked on the link and here is what I 
    got. Nothing. Another hotbot page popped up which described a few websites 
    in more detail. I used the FIND SATAN command, but the engine found nothing. 
    A dead end.</font></p>

  <p align="left">Well, I dunno. Let's see what these have to offer. Again, nothing. 
    It then occurred to me that perhaps Hotbot was listing every single category 
    with Computer games or Satan in them. Bah, I could be here all day. I wish 
    I knew more Boolean arguments than &quot;We don't need a map, honey, I know 
    where I am!&quot;</p>

  <p align="left">Apparently, there is a lot I dont know about using a search 
    engine properly. This URL simply took me to Webcrawler. On a lark, I typed 
    in Satan using the Webcrawler engine and found a few useful sites on satan 
    but none that combine satan with computer gaming.</p>
  <p align="left">Incidentally, did you know that Satan is Santa? Check out this

  <p align="left">Whoa. This one threw me for a loop too. What do we have here? 
    At first, I thought I had hit another dummy site until I saw the link: &quot;Learn 
    how Intel built its billion dollar e-Business.&quot; Satan! Satan had to be 
    behind it! But when I clicked on the link, Intel's server timed out which 
    probably sums up their e-business quite nicely. I was about to give up when 
    I decided to enter Satan into their Search Directory. This is what I got: 
    &quot;Your search of All Intel Sites matched zero documents. &quot; Yeah, 
    right. Oh well.</p>

  <p align="left">Again, nothing. I viewed the Source file of the page, did a

    to give Yahoo another try. Oh, but before we leave Hotbot, I have to show

  <p align="left">Bwahaha. Anyway, onto Yahoo.</p>
  <hr width="80%">
  <p align="left">Well, when I did a search on Yahoo using &quot;computer games 
    satan&quot; I came up with three seperate things:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Quake clan sites.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Intel, Microsoft, etc.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Something about a firewall.</p>
  <p align="left">It then occurred to me that I had read something about this 
    thing called SATAN somewhere long ago and that this may explain (may explain) 
    why I was picking up sites like Intel and Microsoft. Clearly, I had to find 
    a way to find the prince of darkness without finding server software.</p>
  <p align="left">I wasn't sure what to do, so I decided to take a different approach. 
    Since Christians know more about Satan than most people, I decided to search 
    for &quot;christian satan computer games&quot; to see what I would get.</p>
</div>
<p align="left">Jackpot.</p>
<p align="left">There, in beautiful search engine blue, was a wealth of information, 
  even though most of the sites didn't work (thanks Yahoo, you suck). However, 
  I did manage to come across a little snippet about AD&amp;D by Al Gore's wife 
  &quot;Tipper&quot;:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;The game is based on occultic plots, images, and characters 
  which players "become" as they play the game. According to Mrs. Pat Pulling, 
  founder of the organization Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons, the game has 
  been linked to nearly fifty teenage suicides and homicides.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Of course, I immediately sent an email to Pat Pulling asking her 
  how many suicides and homicides have been the result of breaking up with a boyfriend 
  or girlfriend, or the result of someone being a full blown psychopath, but I 
  didn't receive a response.</p>
<p align="left">Still, there wasn't too much Satan here. I mean, sure ... murder 
  can be wrong (unless you are the government) but does that really mean it is 
  Satanic?</p>
<p align="left">I continued to search.</p>
<p align="left">Another site linked was one called: Game of Satan - the two-handed 
  sword of vengeance against the Satan-worshipping roleplayers!</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately, I couldn't connect. Satan's power is immense, it 
  seems. </p>
<p align="left">Instead, I linked to a site called &quot;Religious Tolerance&quot; 
  that quoted from the aforementioned site. Assuming what they quoted was true, 
  here is what the Game of Satan had to offer us for our search:</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">He warns that RPG players will "become satan worshippers 
  and cultists who practice black magic, ritual sacrifice, homosexuality, bisexuality, 
  transvetitism [sic], voyeurism, semitism, communism, necrophilia, sadism, masochism, 
  domination, marxism, darwinism, child pornography...flag burning, fetishism, 
  atheism, islam...demonology, necromancy, jewishness, bondage, spiritism, fascism, 
  anal sex, neo-nazism, ritual cannibalism, occultism, pagan religions, sorcery, 
  sin, arson...satanism, witchcraft, shamanism, incest, adultery and sodomy, feminism, 
  also they drink human blood, listen to heavy metal and rock music, promote evolution 
  theory instead of creationism, use hard drugs and try to summon real demons...All 
  of these victims eventually commit suicide or live rest of their lives in a 
  mental hospital. Satan has taken their soul and they will burn in HELL for eternity!"</font></p>
<p align="left">At the risk of pissing off Gamestats for wasting too much space 
  on this subject, let's break it down and see if I qualify for being a son of 
  satan:</p>
<p align="left">1. black magic - I have never played Magic the Gathering with 
  an African American.</p>
<p align="left">2. Ritual sacrifice - I did have to choose between playing Everquest 
  and going to work the other day. I chose going to work. Sad, I know.</p>
<p align="left">3. Homosexality - I have gone to a homosexual bar before, primarily 
  because it is the only bar in town that doesn't play honkey tonk or the Screaming 
  Cheetah Wheelies.</p>
<p align="left">4. Bisexuality - I dated a bisexual once. But I think it was just 
  a fad for her. Like reading Prozac Nation or recycling.</p>
<p align="left">5. Transvestitism - My mom used to dress me up like a girl and 
  beat me. Bwahah. Just kidding folks. Seriously, tho, um ... next subject ...</p>
<p align="left">6. Voyeurism - Guilty as charged. </p>
<p align="left">7. Semitism - I commonly espouse semit views. I have a few friends 
  who are semits. And who doesn't have &quot;The Mischievous Semit&quot; in their 
  M:TG tourney packs?</p>
<p align="left">8. Communism - I admit it. I read Terry Eagleton in college. I 
  have also desperately tried to gain membership in the local Tantric Sex Commune.</p>
<p align="left">9. Necrophilia - I am totally against keeping dead people in phials, 
  even if it is tastefully done.</p>
<p align="left">10. Sadism - I love Santa.</p>
<p align="left">11. Masochism - I can't change my own oil, so I rely on masochists 
  all the time.</p>
<p align="left">12. Domination - My website is the best EQ humor website on the 
  web.</p>
<p align="left">13. Marxism - Sigh. Terry Eagleton, again.</p>
<p align="left">14. Darwinism - Monkeys are our ancestors? No way! Too bad Darwin 
  never said that.</p>
<p align="left">15. Child pornography - I won't let my child read pornography 
  until he is 14.</p>
<p align="left">16. Flag burning - Never leave an American flag near a bug zapper.</p>
<p align="left">17. Fetishism - This is an &quot;ism&quot;? Cool! Maybe I can 
  qualify for some Xanax.</p>
<p align="left">18. atheism - Guilty as charged. I do not believe in theism. I 
  do believe in God, tho. Does that count?</p>
<p align="left">19. islam - Ummm. What about islam exactly? </p>
<p align="left">20. demonology - How can I be an atheist and a demonologist? I 
  am confused.</p>
<p align="left">21. necromancy - Ok, I admit it. I don't mind if people keep their 
  loved ones in phials.</p>
<p align="left">22. jewishness - I do not espouse jewishness, really. I am more 
  of a jewfulness kind of person.</p>
<p align="left">23. bondage - Everyone who visits my site must submit to the fact 
  that my site is the best site on the internet. Is that so wrong?</p>
<p align="left">24. spiritism - Um. What the hell is spiritism?</p>
<p align="left">25. fascism - I am totally against fascism of any kind.</p>
<p align="left">26. anal sex - oh mama.</p>
<p align="left">27. neo-nazi - Hell, no. Those young yippersnappers don't know 
  squat about good wholesome genocide. </p>
<p align="left">28. ritual cannabilism - Nah. I am more of a Pentacostal cannibal.</p>
<p align="left">29. occultism - I belong to a religion where I eat this guy's 
  flesh and drink his blood every Sunday. Then I go home, eat fried chicken and 
  watch Matlock reruns on TNT.</p>
<p align="left">30. Pagan religions - I celebrate Easter with my family. </p>
<p align="left">31. Sorcery - I prefer control or white weenie decks.</p>
<p align="left">32. Sin - Nah. It is in the bargain bin at the computer store.</p>
<p align="left">33. Arson - I enjoy setting my cigarettes on fire. </p>
<p align="left">34. Satanism - hey, wait a minute. How can Satanism be proof that 
  you are involved in Satanism? Isn't that circular logic? Oh wait, I am sorry. 
  You are probably a member of the Christian Coalition so you are excused.</p>
<p align="left">35. Witchcraft - I dated a Wiccan once. But I think it was just 
  a fad for her. Like reading Prozac Nation or recycling.</p>
<p align="left">36. Shamanism - Nah. Shamans may get Spirit of the Wolf, but Barbarians 
  don't have infravision and Trolls are evil.</p>
<p align="left">37. Incest - No way, man. Incense is fine, tho.</p>
<p align="left">38. Adultery - I refuse to have sex with anyone but adults. What 
  is wrong with that? What are my options here?</p>
<p align="left">39. Sodomy - Sodom is fine but I prefer Gamorrah.</p>
<p align="left">40. feminism - I dated a feminist once. But I think it was just 
  a fad for her. Like reading Prozac Nation or recycling.</p>
<p align="left">41. drink human blood - Ok, ok. One time I accidentally cut my 
  finger and I sucked on it to ease the pain.</p>
<p align="left">42. Listen to heavy metal - YEAHHHHH! Me-tall-ica! Me-tall-ica! 
  (Free bird!) Shut up, you.</p>
<p align="left">43. Promote evolution theory instead of creationism - Oh come 
  on now. Who in their right mind would have created an echinda?</p>
<p align="left">44. Use hard drugs - Oh. So in order to go to heaven you have 
  to use syrup instead of pills? Ok. I can do that. What about gel caps? Has there 
  been a papal bull administered on the subject?</p>
<p align="left">45. Try to summon real demons - No need with guys like you around.</p>
<p align="left">Hmmm ... well, if anything else, at least I know I worship Satan. 
  That is a relief. Now whenever Door to Door Christians come to my house, I have 
  the right to scare the shit out of them.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<hr width="80%">
<p align="left">Still, that guy complained about AD&amp;D, but I have yet to find 
  out anything more (especially about computer games). I also am not convinced 
  that this guy's site is for real. It is just too crazy. I smell a parody.</p>
<p align="left">I did a search for BADD (&quot;Bothered by Dungeons and Dragons&quot;) 
  but all the search engine came up with was Color Me Badd fan sites (which aged 
  me a couple years).</p>
<p align="left">In the end, in one final desperate cry, I sent an email to Satan@gamestats.com. 
  My guess was that he was not the real Satan, but I was at the end of my rope 
  in an attempt to find the link between computer games and Satan.</p>
<p align="left">He didn't reply. Either he is too evil to care or he is still 
  at work. In any event, I have come to the end of this essay empty handed.</p>
<p align="left">As one final gasp, I went to Excite and searched for Satan. I 
  was rewarded with <a href="http://www.satansbreath.com/" target="_blank">Satan's 
  Breath</a> - a site dedicated to Cajun food as seen on PBS (further proof for 
  the conservatives that public broadcasting is a liberal whore). I will have 
  to settle for that.</p>
<p align="left">I guess I will buy some and pour it on my hard drive. I do not 
  know what else to do.</p>
<p align="left">Thanks.</p>
<p align="left">The Cackling Klaknak.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Update: Shadis, who with his header submission and his EQ Porn 
  submission I am seeing more and more as a god, sent the following link to me:</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/games.htm">http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/games.htm</a>.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, Satan has been unleashed. Let's take a look at a few 
  excerpts from this well thought out website:</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Computer games used as a tool to praise Satan By 
  Andrew</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Satan has been using many different devices and 
  contraptions in order to lure the already lost closer to a Christless eternity.</font></p>
<p align="left">Ah yes, who can forget Menudo.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"> While some Christians agree that a few of Satan's 
  methods are rock music, "Christian" rock, movies, and television, one of the 
  ones that can often be forgotten is computer games.</font></p>
<p align="left">Ah, so true. I agree with Pat Buchanan that &quot;I am a tool 
  of Satan&quot; sticker should be placed on every gaming box.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">I have had some gaming experience in my life, and 
  if you look carefully, you can pinpoint Satan's tricks of the trade quite easily.</font></p>
<p align="left">Fair enough.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">I will display some of these a little later.</font></p>
<p align="left">I want them now!</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Satan knows he's already been judged by the Lord 
  Jesus and is going to Hell for eternity, so before he gets tossed into the lake 
  of fire, he will attempt to get as many people as he can to fall in the ditch 
  with him so they will burn up with him  FOREVER (Revelations 12:12).</font></p>
<p align="left">I call top bunk!</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">In computer games (and any other medium), he knows 
  that it is important to desensitize man to his bidding, so he's got to make 
  them tolerate the material, then accept it, then finally imitate it. In this 
  article, I'm trying to focus on how Satan uses these games to help increase 
  the population of Hell.</font></p>
<p align="left">So, satan is kinda like HUD. Cool.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">One of the first things that I thought of when 
  deciding to write this article were the occultic symbols that can be found in 
  some popular games. Doom, by Id Software, is considered by many to be the greatest 
  game of all time.</font></p>
<p align="left">No, I think that mantle has passed on to Half-Life.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Its graphics and eerie sounds and music are probably 
  the creepiest on the market. But why are there so many satanic symbols found 
  in the game??</font></p>
<p align="left">I know! I know! To get people to worship Satan!</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">In the first episode "Knee Deep in the Dead", some 
  pentagrams can be found. Click here to see a sample. At the last level of the 
  first episode, Phobos Anomaly, the hero of the game, a stranded space marine, 
  must step onto a platform with the symbol of a goat behind a pentagram in order 
  to exit the level. In the first level of the second episode "The Shores Of Hell", 
  an inverted cross can be found right near the beginning. In the third episode, 
  called "Inferno", more pentagrams can be found on the ground in one of the levels. 
  Teleporters, which move the player to different areas of the level, have pentagrams 
  on them  some are different than others, for example, one of them has a 6 on 
  it, but they are still there, and that's what matters. Click here to see a sample 
  screen. When exiting the shareware version of the game, you will see a screen 
  with more info about what is in the full registered version. Here's what a section 
  of it says: " Sure, don't order DOOM. Sit back with your milk and cookies and 
  let the universe go to Hell. Don't face the onslaught of demons and spectres 
  that await you on The Shores of Hell. Avoid the terrifying confrontations with 
  cacodemons and lost souls that infest Inferno. Or, act like a man! Slap a few 
  shells into your shotgun and let's kick some demonic butt. Order the entire 
  DOOM trilogy now! After all, you'll probably end up in Hell eventually. Shouldn't 
  you know your way around before you make the extended visit? "</font></p>
<p align="left">Ok, wait a minute. Clearly, the goal here is to kick some demonic 
  butt. Isn't this what Jesus is going to do when the End comes? Aren't we emulating 
  Jesus? I mean, come on. What are you going to do when the End comes and Jesus 
  hands you a rail gun?</p>
<p align="left">You: What is this?</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: It is a rail gun. Let's go defeat Satan.</p>
<p align="left">You: But I dont know how to use one.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: I gave you Quake, what else do you want?</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">This is a good example of how Satan, working behind 
  the curtains, likes to make himself subtle and put into the ranks of Santa (Satan?) 
  Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy.</font></p>
<p align="left">Wow. That makes perfect sense. &quot;And Satan then did take the 
  Teeth and made Satanic dentures for his minions (Revelation II)</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">But if possible, Satan would rather have himself 
  worshipped ( Isaiah 14:14 ).</font></p>
<p align="left">Certainly. I mean, what if the Tooth Fairy became jealous of Satan's 
  power? Would the tooth fairy be cast down into another hell? Or would he be 
  cast up to Heaven? An interesting theological question.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">According to Revelation 13, the whole world will 
  worship the dragon (Satan).</font></p>
<p align="left">Will the Buddhists worship the Dragon? Oh right, yes, of course. 
  The Buddhists are Chinese and in Chinese restaurants there are pictures of dragons. 
  Chinese buffets are Satanic tools!</p>
<p align="left">... &lt;snip&gt; ...</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">In some games, there is an "invincibility mode", 
  which makes the player invulnerable to enemy attacks, so the player will not 
  die. However in recent years, it seems the industry is changing the term "Invincibility 
  mode" to "God mode". I think that this is another way Satan wants people to 
  think that they are gods, when they are really not (Genesis 3:5).</font></p>
<p align="left">And neither are you, hambone.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">But there is only one God (Mark 12:32). Nowadays, 
  more people are worshipping their friends or their favorite music stars, and 
  are calling themselves gods and goddesses. It won't be long before they all 
  turn their attention on the Antichrist, and later, gnash and wail their teeth 
  (Matthew 13:42) in the lake of fire (Revelations 20:15).</font></p>
<p align="left">How exactly does one wail their teeth? And, will there be towel 
  service? </p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">This article is only scratching the surface. Each 
  year more and more games come out, and satanic influences in computer games 
  are gradually becoming more and more visible. But it won't be long before Satan 
  loses the battle.</font></p>
<p align="left">What do we win?</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">I have to tell you. I was despairing this weekend that I hadn't 
  found enough information on Satan. But true to form, the readers came to the 
  rescue. And, oh yeah, Satan replied to my email.</p>
<p align="left">For those of you who do not know, one of the affiliates at Gamestats 
  is ... Satan. Yes, it is true. I received an email from him that said Satan@gamestats.com, 
  so if that is not proof enough, I don't know what it is.</p>
<p align="left">So I sent him an email asking him if he was responsible for enslaving 
  our children in a circle of lust, despair and Pokemon. Here is his response:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Damn you Christian bastards with all your wild accusations. 
  Do you really think I could be responsible for computer games? I mean marketing 
  tobacco to children? Sure! Feeding them cherry flavor Prozac? Why not? Allow 
  another Britney Spears CD? Of Course! But turn the nations children into chinless, 
  pale faced, sniveling misfits? Come on folks even I have to draw the line somewhere! 
  The computer gaming industry is obviously controlled by some ancient evil that 
  has no name. That's all I'm going to say until my lawyers are present. Satan&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Personally, I am not convinced. We all know that the ancient evil 
  with no name is Linda Tripp and I am pretty sure she has nothing to do with 
  the gaming industry. Clearly, this is Satan's attempt to trick us as he has 
  tricked many others including Hannibal Lecter, Jack the Ripper and the Arizona 
  Diamondbacks. </p>
<p align="left">So, the search for his malevolence continues.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Despairing that Satan simply did not control us through computer 
  games, I decided to take the advice of one of my readers (Philip B.) and check 
  into the rumor that the Force (from Star Wars) was a tool of Satan. Since the 
  marketing plan masquerading as a movie The Phantom Menace forced a legion of 
  mediocre products and games down our throat, it soon became clear that perhaps 
  this was the link between computer games and Satan.</p>
<p align="left">So I visited the following <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Lot/9202/">link</a> 
  and this is what I found:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../Images/yodasatan.gif" width="159" height="147"></p>
<p align="left">Ahhh ... the plot thickens. Let's examine some of their arguments 
  closely:</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">R2-D2 is the mute false god Baal who children are 
  told is "cool". Is it so cool when God strikes you down where you stand? I don't 
  think so! </font></p>
<p align="left">You know, when I was dating a woman (whom I will call The Jackal) 
  oh so long ago, I made a similar claim. We were making love on the Blue Ridge 
  Parkway (because the asphalt is so warm) when suddenly I sat up and said: &quot;Holy 
  shit! R2-D2 is the mute false god Baal!&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;I am sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I will try to be more 
  careful.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;No, no,&quot; I said. &quot;The god Baal! I was an idiot 
  not to notice it before. R2-D2 is mute. The idols of Baal were mute. Ergo, R2-D2 
  is Baal! I have been an unwitting tool of Satan every time I put on my R2-D2 
  underoos!&quot;</p>
<p align="left">The Jackal sighed, turned back over, and was hit by a Shenandoah 
  Pride ice cream truck. I clothed myself, rubbed ashes on my chest and began 
  telling tourists at the local Visitor's Center that R2-D2 was a tool of Satan. 
  Remarkably (altho, I WAS in the South), it took some five hours before I was 
  arrested.</p>
<p align="left">So I am glad others share my views. Now if I can only tie together 
  Satan, Star Wars, Star Wars Merchandising and computer games ...</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">More evidence has come in via email. I thank everyone involved 
  for their help. We must find Satan and discover if we really are unwitting tools 
  in an evil game of Life (Satan aint Art Linkletter, baby).</p>
<p align="left">First of all, the search for Satan and its influence on gaming 
  has been struck a near fatal blow. Apparently, one of the sites was a parody! 
  Oh, my soul is reaved, my annihilation is total and my Zork is II. Here is a 
  letter from the author posted on this <a href="http://www.co.jyu.fi/%7Enp/rpg/DnD/answers.html">website</a>: 
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Here is a little story: Once upon a time, for reasons 
  I can't remember, I decided to write a little funny page called "Game of Satan" 
  which condemned everyone that plays roleplaying games to hell. I made the page 
  look like a totally fanatic, insane fundamentalist christian had written it. 
  It should have been obvious that the page was satire. I didn't think anyone 
  would take it seriously. I didn't advertise the page at all, just added a link 
  into it on my roleplaying pages. Then someone found the page - probably by searching 
  "satan and roleplaying" from the net. That person took the page seriously, didn't 
  check what other pages I had, and posted a flame and the URL into the newsgroup 
  rec.games.frp.dnd. Thousands of people then read the page, and a few percent 
  of them apparently took it seriously. They started to e-mail me, and I started 
  collecting the e-mails. I have over 5 megabytes archive of them, with the headers 
  and sender identification stripped, of course. There isn't enough disk space 
  available for that archive. I "enhanced" the page by adding the most outrageous 
  and ridiculous claims I could think of, I added deliberate typos, many contradictions, 
  and silly links, hoping that even the most ignorant person would immediately 
  realize that the page is a joke. Finally, everyone who did just about anything 
  - besides praying alone in seclusion - was condemned to hell by the page. I 
  advertised this page a bit, because I thought no one could ever take the improved 
  page seriously. It didn't help. There seems to be an endless supply of ignorant 
  readers in the US. More hate mail kept coming no matter what. Most of it came 
  from aol.com and hotmail.com. I didn't want to add a big "THIS IS A JOKE" text 
  on the page, it would spoil the layout. But I added a clear notice into the 
  source code of the page as a comment, and changed the background picture to 
  say "YES: THIS IS A JOKE". The blinking <blink>This is</blink> not <blink>a 
  joke!</blink> has always been there. And you probably guessed: it didn't help 
  at all. No one bothers to read the source code, and most people don't seem to 
  look at the background at all. They should: even the angle of the pentagram 
  is a clear hint about the nature of the page. Recently I changed the pages to 
  preach love and not the flames of hell, because that seemed to be the most infuriating 
  thing about the page. The old page is still available, behind warning pages. 
  Doesn't seem to help much. Now they are already flaming the new, improved pages.</font> 
</p>
<p align="left">Ah, how was I duped? How could I possibly think this website was 
  real? I think we all know the answer to that: because it is so easy to imagine 
  someone really holding these views ...</p>
<p align="left">But my attempt to restore my ego must fail. I was duped. And, 
  worse yet, Satan has eluded me once again.</p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Gamanin tried to console me by pointing out the dangers of <a href="http://www.dhmo.org/">dihydrogen 
  monoxide</a>, but I was inconsolable. I mean, what is dihydrogen monoxide compared 
  to the relentless evil that is Satan? </p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Thankfully, Matt S. came to the rescue with a series of excellent 
  links.</p>
<p align="left">First, even if we are unsure how Satan is using gamers to spread 
  his unholy creed, it is a fact that we are in for deep shit when the Second 
  Coming comes. Thankfully, the following <a href="http://www.666now.com/desc.htm">site</a> 
  has provided an instructional kit to help us prepare.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">The "666 NOW!!! Survival Kit" will teach the whole 
  truth regarding the Antichrist Beast, 666, and the Mark of the Beast along with 
  many other misunderstood topics. The following is a description of the items 
  included in the Survival Kit. Remember, the Kit is 100% guaranteed to be the 
  truth!</font></p>
<p align="left">That's a relief. </p>
<p align="left">But still, I would rather not wait for Satan to come. Can't we 
  do something about it now?</p>
<p align="left">I am in despair.</p>
<p align="left">Is there anyone out there who can detail to me exactly how games 
  like Everquest, Worms Armageddon and Pro Fish Hunting 3-D are tools of Satan?</p>
