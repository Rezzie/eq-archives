  <hr>
  <p align="left">For those of you who don't know, there is a quest in Rivervale 
    where you kill the Large Piranha in order to aid the fisherman who is constantly 
    bitching on the docks.</p>
  <p align="left">So, I jump into the water with my tender, poor Gniblet and immediately 
    4 Piranhas start chomping on her. Now, swimming in that little pond can be 
    very tricky (especially for short players) because there are few places where 
    a character can successfully jump out of the water and those places must be 
    swam into just right or it won't work.</p>
  <p align="left">Gniblet almost died as she continually ran into the wall of 
    the pond trying to find the right place that would enable her to jump out. 
    When she finally got out, she noticed that the fisherman was walking on the 
    dock, so she decided to talk to him. Here is a transcript.</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:27 1999] You say, 'hail Fiddy Bobick'</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:27 1999] Fiddy Bobick says 'Guards! Guards!</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:27 1999] You try to pierce Fiddy Bobick, but 
    miss!</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:27 1999] Fiddy Bobick hits YOU for 74 points 
    of damage.</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:27 1999] You have been slain by Fiddy Bobick!</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:29 1999] Returning to home point, please wait...</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:06:30 1999] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:07:11 1999] You have entered Rivervale. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Right. So, in case you haven't figured it out, I still had my 
    autoattack on.</p>
  <p align="left">Ah, but it gets juicier because I didn't realize my autoattack 
    had still been on. Therefore, and here is where the true idiocy comes in, 
    I petitioned a GM.</p>
  <p align="left">About 2 seconds after I petitioned the GM, my peanut sized brain 
    figured out what had happened and I tried to petition again to ... remove 
    the petition. No dice. Here is a transcript:</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:13:41 1999] Eliria (GM) tells you, 'Hail Gniblet. 
    I am guide Eliria. Are you sure you have not attacked the fisherman by accident?'</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:13:41 1999] You told Eliria, 'Thanks for replying. 
    It is possible now that I think about it. I was just fighting the fish. I 
    feel like an idiot for calling you. Thanks'</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:13:56 1999] Eliria tells you, 'Hehe, no problem 
    )'</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:14:12 1999] You told Eliria, 'Long day. Heh. 
    Thanks again. :)'</p>
  <p align="left">[Thu Sep 09 00:14:26 1999] Eliria tells you, 'Okay, good day 
    then )'</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">I am an idiot. I had wanted to become a guide myself, but I 
    think my ambitions have been squashed.</p>
