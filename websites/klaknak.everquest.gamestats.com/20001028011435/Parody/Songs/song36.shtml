        <p>('Straight out Compton' by NWA)</p>
        <p>Straight outta Freeport, crazy Priest named Discord <br>
          From the gang called NPC's With Attitudes<br>
          When I'm called off, better back off <br>
          Swing my fist , and bodies are hauled off <br>
          You too, boy, if ya try to attack me <br>
          The GM's are gonna hafta come and get me <br>
          Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out<br>
          For the PC's that's showin out <br>
          Newbies start to mumble, accidentally hit 'a' and then they in trouble<br>
          Punch em and Kick em and kill em all like Rambo<br>
          Goin off on a newbie like that <br>
          With a punch that will kill yo ass <br>
          Or with my boot <br>
          Ain't no tellin when I'm gonna attack you<br>
          Here's a thought to keep you backin <br>
          Goin on a murder spree like Lord Nagafen <br>
          Punchin for 350 is the tool <br>
          Don't make me punch and kill you <br>
          Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe <br>
          I'm knockin newbies out tha robes, daily<br>
          yo weekly, monthly and yearly <br>
          until them dumb ass newbies see clearly <br>
          that I'm down with the capital P-O-D<br>
          Boy you can't attack me <br>
          So when you gimme your book, you better look<br>
          Coz the POD will kill you quick <br>
          As I leave, believe I'm stompin<br>
          but when I come back, boy,</p>
        <p> I'm comin straight outta Freeport </p>
        <p>Chorus: <br>
          [City of Freeport, City of Freeport] </p>
        <p>[Slate] Yo Naggy <br>
          [Naggy] Whassup? <br>
          [Slate] Tell em where you from! </p>
        <p>Verse Two: Naggy </p>
        <p>Straight outta Lava, dont think I cant see ya <br>
          More PC's I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger<br>
          I'm a bad red dragon and you know this <br>
          But the idiot PC's don't show this<br>
          But I don't give a crap, hear the bones snap<br>
          If not from the kills, from breakin they backs <br>
          When I see you run, the definition is 'trainin' <br>
          And if you cant make it, you scream 'evac'in'<br>
          Kill a dumb ass newbie in a minute<br>
          I find a good group to slaughter, and then they finished <br>
          So if you're tank, and on the front row <br>
          I'm a kill and call you a warrior_00 <br>
          You'll probably get mad like a newbie is supposed to<br>
          But that shows me, newbie, you're composed to<br>
          a powerleveler from the trees <br>
          Attitude legit cause im killin your clique <br>
          Naggy controls all the tactics <br>
          For any dumb PC that wants to start static <br>
          I kill the tanks and the healer itself<br>
          every time they pull me, im gonna cause hell<br>
          I always hit for maximum and that's a law <br>
          N-A-G spells Nag, but I'm NAG <br>
          See, coz I'm the big Red Dragon <br>
          The definition is clear, you're the reciever of a killin<br>
          that's takin place without a clue <br>
          And once you're in my sight, your ass is through <br>
          Look, you might take it as a trip<br>
          but a dragon like Nag is on a Killin tip </p>
        <p>Straight outta Freeport...</p>
        <p> Chorus: <br>
          [City of Freeport, City of Freeport] </p>
        <p>[Nag] Slate is his name and the boy is comin... </p>
        <p>Verse Three: Slate </p>
        <p>...straight outta Commons<br>
          is a soldier that'll steal your kills<br>
          and make ya think you get exp<br>
          PC's always camp me to hell <br>
          And if I ever kill 'em, they scream and wail<br>
          See, I give experience, that's the problem<br>
          I see a newbie pc I don't dodge him <br>
          But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while <br>
          And when I see a guard kiter pass, I smile<br>
          To me it's kinda funny, the kewl dood druid runnin' <br>
          but don't know where the hell he's going, just kitin <br>
          lookin for the one they call Slate <br>
          But here's a flash, they'll never kill me <br>
          Ruthless! Killin elves I've seen like a shadow in the dark<br>
          Expect me to unload, see I got over my hesitation<br>
          and laugh at the scream of the one who got the last penetration <br>
          Slash PC's with a sword for 99 and they're jettin <br>
          But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin<br>
          So what about the druid who got killed? Fuh-get him! <br>
          You think I give a damn about a PC? I ain't a sucker! <br>
          This is the autobiography of the Slate, and if you ever camp me <br>
          You'll get taken<br>
          by a crazy ass soldier like no other </p>
        <p>Word to all my Brothers. </p>
        <p>Straight outta Freeport </p>
        <p>Chorus: <br>
          [City of Freeport, City of Freeport] </p>
