  <p align="center">Aren't we rangers wonderful? - by Kaeleb Shadowmoon</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I, Kaeleb Shadowmoon, as a lvl 15 wood-elf ranger, had just 
    gotten my amazing new spells, therefore, the evil curse of ego overcame my 
    stupid-ass hybrid self. I thought killing some stone guardians might be a 
    real good idea, so, I quickly ran through Nektulos with my brand new and seriously 
    amazing spell...Camouflage! I just as quickly got myself bound in Neriak, 
    thinking Hey, what could hurt me? I'm level 15, and God with Camouflage! So, 
    after liberally tipping the binder 2 gold, and getting a just as kind gesture 
    in return, zoned out and camouflaged my way to where the Stone Guardians romp. 
    I turned and saw an Iron Guardian heading towards me, conning a bright, pretty 
    yellow! I figured, hey, I'm god, I've got my lvl 15 spells now! So, I run 
    up and attack it. It resists my godly lvl 15 bursts of fire, and quickly punches 
    me into oblivion. I think, hey, no problem, I'll just spawn back in in Neriak, 
    and camo, then grab my stuff. So, I spawn back in, and see some more bright, 
    pretty yellow...you have lost your level. Not so godly anymore, eh? I think 
    again, hey, no problem, I'll just get a guildmate to come out here and invis 
    me, and I'll grab my corpse and go, right? I grab my corpse, loot, get reinvised 
    and start running for East Commons with my wizard friend from my guild. As 
    we approach the bridge, I see my little eye-icon flashing. I tell my friend 
    "Hey..my invis is going...I'll make it across the bridge." Before my friend 
    can stop me, I'm stuck in the middle of the bridge with 4 neriak guards surrounding 
    me, one of which is a dragoon. I'm quickly torn apart, and spawn back into 
    Neriak. My friend, who survived the deadly attack, dragged my corpse to the 
    zone line, and came back to re-inviso me. We start running, running...pass 
    the bridge <whew> and the EC zone is almost in sight, if this damn forest 
    wasn't so dark. Hey...there's a skeleton. I bet I can beat it down with my 
    fists! Muahaha! I'm a ranger! I suck! The skeleton starts whomping on me with 
    his scimitar, just as another one of Neriak's Finest begins whacking me with 
    his long sword. My friend screams at me to keep running, and with the luck 
    of Tunare, I make it to the East Commons. Aren't we rangers wonderful?</p>
