  <p><font size="4">Ellecil's Cleric Guide</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Dear Subscriber Garg Guide:</p>
  <p align="left">Me like thank Ellecil for majik guide. Me add comment when me 
    want.</p>
  <p align="left">Garg. </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">1. You are NOT always in demand. People who say this are delusional. 
    There are more than enough clerics to go around because everyone who reads 
    this believes this. Therefore, don't go in thinking you can log on and be 
    inundated with requests for you to assist people. Unless you are a GM, in 
    which case you can ignore them and pretend to know nothing because you don't 
    feel like taking time away from your early hunting in the Air plane.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Do NOT heal people for free! They will NEVER return the favor. 
    You will probably never see 99% of them again. And, they really aren't SO 
    bitter about paying you a few gold for a much-needed cure that they will bitterly 
    refuse you help one day.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Going around healing people is a waste of time and mana. 
    And time is mana. Ha ha ha.</p>
  <p align="left">4. You don't need a ton of armor to be useful in a group, because 
    no matter how much you have, you're going to die fast if you piss the sand 
    giant off.</p>
  <p align="left">5. The time you spend building up 1H AND 2H blunt could have 
    earned you enough to seriously upgrade in just one of those had you been actually 
    hunting.</p>
  <p align="left">6. Make no mistake, you'll be a walking band-aid at your mid-30s 
    for sure. What the other guides don't say is to the rest of the world, you're 
    a walking Band-Aid from level 1. Because germs don't stick on you.</p>
  <p align="left"> 7. You will never get the fancy hammer you want until you're 
    at least 15 levels above when you should have gotten it because you buy it 
    at inflated prices from somone who has no life and can afford to camp for 
    48 hours for an item.</p>
  <p align="left">8. Your heal spells hurt the economy. They will be replaced 
    immediately with summon bandages spells. Well, not really...but don'tput it 
    past the Bradopoly.</p>
  <p align="left">9. Yes, I'm sure Aorn Sheperd and the like look really cool 
    in screenshots, but they're just like you in real-life. Except they're successful. 
    And they have a lot more time to play than you.</p>
  <p align="left">10. It doesn't matter how many times you save that tank's life, 
    if he dies, he'll still go aggro on you (verbally, of course), so just give 
    up this bitter existence and quit your damn cleric. If enough people do this, 
    you WILL be in demand! It's such a vicious cycle. You quit because you're 
    unhappy and you're unhappy because you quit! No...wait...that doesn't make 
    sense... </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Garg's Response:</p>
  <p align="left">Me not agree.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Translation:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Most people play a cleric with the wrong expectations. When 
    they realize Clerics can wear armor, their greedy little eyes light up and 
    they begin powergaming like crazy. What they don't realize is that eventually, 
    assuming their cleric is even strong enough to wear high end armor, their 
    &quot;damage power to withstand damage power&quot; ratio is inequitable at 
    best. If you want to play a Cleric, forget the armor bit and accept the fact 
    that you perform best in a group. A few people swear they solo their higher 
    level Clerics to great effect, but either they are lying, they have twinked 
    their ass off, or they unload all their spells on one creature and then sit 
    and rest after every single battle. Boring.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Most other players don't ask for clerics because they do 
    not fully understand the range of a cleric's power. There have been countless 
    occasions where my cleric has joined a group and became an instant success 
    because of the very impressive buffs, healing powers, and decent offensive 
    damage. Higher level clerics can buff tanks up a couple levels in HPs and 
    stats. There is nothing more impressive than an Ogre warrior buffed on several 
    Cleric spells.</p>
  <p align="left">3. And if the group plans on tackling an undead dungeon ... 
    forgetaboutit ... clerics rock! They have great damage and utility spells 
    to aid the group in an adventure through Befallen or wherever.</p>
  <p align="left">4. As far as people paying you goes, you are probably going 
    about it all wrong. The best way to make lots of plat and receive nice items 
    is to go into a very dangerous place filled with upper level characters and 
    perform free services for them. Sure, some of the time people will ignore 
    you, but I have received some very decent plat and items doing this. If you 
    stand around Freeport all day healing people, you are right not to expect 
    to much in return. Low risk, low return.</p>
