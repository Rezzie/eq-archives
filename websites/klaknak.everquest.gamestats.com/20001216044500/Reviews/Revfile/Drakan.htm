<p align="center"><font size="4">Drakan - by Jamilyn Skyheart</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left">I love dragons. What can I say? So when I bought Drakan, two things 
  ran through my mind:</p>
<p align="left"> 1) Dragon. Drool. </p>
<p align="left">2) Great. It's a Tomb Raider style game. I probably won't play 
  it long.</p>
<p align="left">I was in for a long night. Not only did I not play EQ that night, 
  I stayed up later than I would have had I been playing EQ. Graphically, the 
  game is stunning. The characters and environment is completely 3D, designed 
  so that each bit of it could be viewed from ANY angle -- ground or air. Or flying 
  upside down in the air, for that matter.</p>
<p align="left">Sadly to report to the few men who really DO care about it, Rynn 
  is not Lara Croft. She does not have huge polygonal breasts, she wears armor 
  that does not reveal much at all, and her clothes do NOT hug her body like a 
  ill-fitting bathing suit. The levels are fairly big, and lead into each other 
  quite smoothly. If it wasn't for the "Loading Level..." text popping up between 
  levels, you would never know that you had moved up a level. It's much like zoning 
  in EverQuest.</p>
<p align="left">The game has a main story line (girl loses brother to raid, girl 
  meets dragon, dragon and girl find out things are really big, dragon and girl 
  save the world); but also has small side quests to complete, if you find them. 
  There are also TONS of secret areas to find and explore, if you're observant 
  enough. The combat system, though not as simple as EverQuest's, is still fairly 
  simple. Rynn (the girl) has her basic moves, her special moves, and her free 
  look, all of which come into play.</p>
<p align="left">Fighting on Arohk (the dragon) is a bit harder, and takes quite 
  a bit of practice, but is as fun as hell when you get it down. Of course, I 
  died in the matter of minutes, because I've been de-reflexed by EverQuest. Now, 
  I play EverQuest trying to jump, dodge, crouch, and sneak -- WHILE fighting.</p>
<p align="left">Admittedly, this game lacks the open exploration and interaction 
  that EverQuest has. Multiplayer mode only has deathmatch options, which I personally 
  don't care for. But the environment is stunning enough that you're going to 
  want explore every inch of it that there is -- for looks, and to make sure you 
  didn't miss anything.</p>
<p align="left">And as for interaction -- hells, screw interaction. You got a 
  dragon to fly. This game is dangerous, folks. I've been able to still play EverQuest 
  -- but to a limited extent. And while I play it, I talk about Drakan. Constantly. 
  If you love EverQuest -- truly love EverQuest -- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. That 
  is all. Rating -- 4 of those little black men running away</p>
