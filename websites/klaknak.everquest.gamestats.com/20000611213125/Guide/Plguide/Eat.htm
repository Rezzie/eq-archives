  <p><font size="4">Ellecil's How to Eat Guide</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Dear Subscriber Garg Guide:</p>
  <p align="left">Me like thank Ellecil for eat guide. Me like eat elfies and 
    dirt. </p>
  <p align="left">Garg. </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> It keeps saying I'm hungry and thirsty and out of food and 
    drink, so...HOW DO I EAT?!?!</p>
  <p align="left">How many times have YOU, the newbie, said this?</p>
  <p align="left">Well, Verant understands. We're very good at doing things for 
    newbies to screw high level players, so let's begin with what this patch will 
    add. Eating is now a much more viable skill, much like Sense Heading. You 
    can now improve your "Eat" level, at which time you will be better at eating 
    in an incomprehensible way, much like when you improve your Tracking skill. 
    To Eat, which everyone must do or else you will not do any damage, your mana 
    bar will never return, we'll charge you more every month, and you will get 
    no loot from monsters, you must get several items you must keep on you at 
    all times:</p>
  <p align="left">-Picnic Kit</p>
  <p align="left">-Plastic Utensils</p>
  <p align="left">-Napkins</p>
  <p align="left">-Plastic Cup (Dwarves may use Shotglasses)</p>
  <p align="left">-Disinfectant Wipies (Even Bertoxxulous followers)</p>
  <p align="left">-Little Hard To Open Sauce Packet</p>
  <p align="left"> Once you have all of these, which must be purchased from potters, 
    smiths (with a new quest involving Jum Jum Stalks), jewelers, tailors, and 
    alchemists and will all be items that even at skill of 200 in the trade skill 
    will only succeed once in fifty tries, or you cannot eat.</p>
  <p align="left">To make a Picnic Kit, you must buy a Paisley Cloth from a tailor 
    first. Paisley Cloths are made from Blackburrow Gnoll Skins and Evil Eye Optic 
    Nerves. Then, you must buy a Picnic Basket and a Picnic Handle from a smith. 
    The Basket is made from a Jum Jum Stalk and the Handle is made from a Jum 
    Jum Stalk. Combine these together to get a Picnic Kit.</p>
  <p align="left">That is one example of how to get the items. Now, you must get 
    a baker to sell you three square meals. Here is an example of a mix of vegetarian 
    and omnivorous breakfast foods, which provide you with a brief period of flatulence 
    every time you consume them by right-clicking the picnic kit when your character 
    gets whiny and hungry.</p>
  <p align="left">Breakfast (Consumed between 4 AM and 9 AM game time)</p>
  <p align="left">Example</p>
  <p align="left">-20 Tasty Snake Eggs (Found only on the sea serpent in Lake 
    Rathe)</p>
  <p align="left">-3 Kobold Hinds (found only on kobold shaman in Nagafen's Lair)</p>
  <p align="left">-Two ripe foraged oranges (Found only in the Feerrott when foraging)</p>
  <p align="left">-Treant Bark (Found only on Xanusus or whoever, Hook named him, 
    don't bug me)</p>
  <p align="left">-Miniature Oven (Found only on saccharine commercials for little 
    girls)</p>
  <p align="left">Combine these to get a Kobold Bacon, Poached Egg, Orange Juice, 
    Bark Toast Breakfast. Once you've eaten your three square meals, your character 
    will sometimes grab his stomach and hunch over, usually after going down the 
    ramp in East Commonlands with Spirit of Cheetah on. If this happens, you must 
    wait and watch while he vomits up the meal. Please do not turn Particles "Off" 
    under options so we can make you lose your desire to eat a meatball stromboli.</p>
  <p align="left">We have added a new trade skill to go along with this, called 
    "Toiletries" for after your character consumes too much food and MUST use 
    the "Squat" skill, learnable only by doing the Aradune quest for the Holy 
    Mace in the Fear Plane. To use the new "Squat" skill, your character must 
    find a quiet place, like an NPC household, and hit "Squat" when you get the 
    message:</p>
  <p align="left">You are sickly. </p>
  <p align="left">ou are bloated.</p>
  <p align="left">You really need to go.</p>
  <p align="left">And your character starts dancing around on screen uncomfortably. 
    After you finish, you consume one to four Toilet Papers and one to four Disinfectant 
    Wipies [Druids and Rangers can use Foraged leaves], depending on how long 
    you held it. If you don't have Toilet Paper (which looks like Bandages and 
    can be used as them to lesser effect, but not vice versa), you will lose 50 
    CHA and 130 AGI until you buy some. If you have no Disinfectant Wipies, you 
    will contract the Necromancer's highest level disease spell and it cannot 
    be cured until you buy Disinfectant Wipies, so the Clerics, Druids, and Shamans 
    don't mess up the economy by curing you. You will usually get the message 
    during dangerous fights with enemies, and when you can't use the command because 
    you're out in the open. Also, if you wait more than four minutes after getting 
    the message, you are informed:</p>
  <p align="left">You are obviously mentally incompetent!</p>
  <p align="left">You need a change of clothes!</p>
  <p align="left">At which point your Waist and Leg armor, and any Robe you have 
    equipped, will become "Soiled Mess" armor, and has AC 0, Weight 56.8, and 
    CHA -450.</p>
  <p align="left">That's all for this patch message. Next patch we'll be adding 
    the new lanuage, "Ye Olde Sign Language", which, unlike many players believe, 
    will NOT include the /gesture command.</p>
