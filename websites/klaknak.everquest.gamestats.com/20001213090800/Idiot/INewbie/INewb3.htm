  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I have seen pretty many of the different fatal newbie errrors, 
    and I have done them myself too, like the "How do I exterminAte the pixies?" 
    approach. I have had many errors I dont recall seeing anyplace though, and 
    I would like to mention them, because they all came back to me just now.</p>
  <p align="left">I had major problems deciding on what race and class i should 
    choose. I knew from other class based games that I could not do the "Clerics 
    usually suck" approach, so I decided to let fate choose for me. I would try 
    a combination, and if I died fast with that race/class combo, I would try 
    another comination. I had not counted on EQ's hundreds of newbie death traps. 
    As you might imagine, I continued trying different combinations throught the 
    rest of the weekend...</p>
  <p align="left">One of my first characters was a Half Elf Ranger starting out 
    in Surefall. I hailed every NPC I met and I was told from one of them, there 
    was a huge bear in the caves behind the waterfall called Mammoth and that 
    he was kind to Rangers, so I wanted to meet him. I entered the caves and started 
    scanning the caves for the bear. "His den must be deep within it all, possibly 
    though a secret entrance", I thought. I found a lake inside the caves and 
    started swimming. And, as I had thought, an underwater tunnel! I have found 
    him, hehe! Okay, lets go for a dive. You have become better at swimming (1). 
    Cool! My swimming raises! (2) (3). Jeez, this tunnel sure was long! I am past 
    half my air so it is too late for turning back, I bet the surface is real 
    near now. You have become better at swimming(4). (5). (6). LOADING, PLEASE 
    WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, I hate water. I want to get as far away from it as i can... 
    underground! I will choose a gnome now... lets try rogue. Ok, deity... hmm 
    this Bertoluxxous guy sounds sick, I think I will choose him. You have entered 
    Ak Anon. Ok... my guild note says Mines of Malfuction. (Walks far into Ak 
    Anon). Far away from water, my ass. (slip, splash) Argh! I guess I will just 
    have for swim for shore, I refuse to dive. (Tries to climb out of water and 
    gets stuck partly inside the shore.) Hit by non melee for 372 damage! YOU 
    were injured from falling.</p>
  <p align="left">Next character: Enchanter in the desert area of Freeport. (Checked 
    my map to make sure) Heydude walks up to me and says "Hey, dude! Did you know 
    you could go to Guk and get free great mage Armor there from looting corpses, 
    without being in danger? The frogs arnet kos!" "Guk? Where is that? And what 
    is kos?" "Just go south, dude. Cross the Ro desert and you will get there, 
    man. Seeya." So I head south, and get to the Desert of Ro. I take a nice elf's 
    advice and follow the shore. (Argh, more water!) I zone into Oasis and continue 
    my march across the zone. A Troll stops me by the dock and tells me I should 
    get the hell away from here, since there is a Spectre train right by the shore 
    island. "What is a spectre train? What island?" The trolls runs away. A spectre 
    begins to cast a spell...</p>
