      <p align="left">I am broke. I am incredibly broke. </p>
      <p align="left">Contrary to what many of you may think about me, I am, primarily, 
        a principled person. As such, I indulge myself in that most unAmerican 
        pasttime which is The Great UnAmerican Search for a Job that Makes Me 
        Happy. </p>
      <p align="left">America, of course, is essentially a Puritan nation. Many 
        Americans (the older ones especially) see work as a duty to God Family 
        and Country: the more painful, the better. Those who don't view work in 
        this way participate in the other Great American Pasttime: Working in 
        Jobs You Hate to Pay for Shit You Dont Need. </p>
      <p align="left">If you think I am looking down my nose at you, I am. But 
        I am also jealous. And I hate you. </p>
      <p align="left">Because for whatever reason ... be it fate or some sort 
        of deep Freudian mind fuck from years past ... I simply CANNOT work in 
        a job I hate. I can't do it. I have tried, desperately hard, to work in 
        a job I hate but these excursions into normalcy have caused more damage 
        than any drug could possibly muster (with the possible exception of Robotussin). 
      </p>
      <p align="left">I remember, with great fondness, seeing a therapist while 
        I worked at a large publishing company and after many months of poking 
        and prodding, both the therapist and I agreed on one fundamental issue: 
        The job ... not my mother, not my father, not the unfortunate Yak incident 
        ... the job was the source of the unhappiness. </p>
      <p align="left">And so I quit the job. And I became happy.</p>
      <p align="left"> However ... </p>
      <p align="left">Money is still necessary. I am not one of these people who 
        feel I should shirk my responsibilities to my debtors because I seek happiness. 
        I am, as I have said, principled. </p>
      <p align="left">So, after quitting that job, I looked for others. And I 
        continued to look until I found jobs that made me increasingly more happy. 
        I still managed to make money to pay the bills and I saw my happiness 
        quotient slowly rise. </p>
      <p align="left">And my happiness quotient continues to rise everyday, overcoming 
        by leaps and bounds the small anxieties that emerge from being ... more 
        or less ... broke. </p>
      <p align="left">But April, my friends, is the cruelest month. </p>
      <p align="left">For the last several months, I have worked incredibly hard 
        on this site, at Region Ten (as a relief person) and working on computers 
        for fun and profit. I was almost, I dare to say, no longer broke.</p>
      <p align="left">But April, my friends, is the cruelest month. And so, for 
        this month at least, I can say that my happiness quotient has temporarily 
        dropped. </p>
      <p align="left">Who is to blame? </p>
      <p align="left">The two last great evils in the universe: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1. Insurance Companies.</p>
        <p> 2. The government. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">In spite of the fact that my car is a piece of crap and 
        probably wouldnt sell for $1000 bucks on the market, the insurance company 
        obviously thinks it is worth a helluva lot more, based on my recent insurance 
        bill. </p>
      <p align="left">I am really not sure I understand how the insurance companies 
        work, but here is my very uninformed, but spirited, opinion: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>a. The insurance company uses some sort of insurance industry blue 
          book to estimate the worth of my car. Judging from my bill, I have come 
          up with the following formula: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Joe's car worth = actual value X 100 + money insurance company needs 
            to pay lobbyists in order to raise insurance rates</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> b. They then take this money of mine (I have a near perfect driving 
          record) and invest it in an economy that is returning about 100000000000000% 
          on investment.</p>
        <p> c. Then, when the economy tanks (or even if it doesn't), the insurance 
          company loses tons of money due to questionable investments on margin 
          and just questionable investments period. They then blame those damned 
          trial lawyers for raising their cost. They even pay their lobbyists 
          and lawyers tons upon tons of money to both prove the point and to, 
          strangely, make the point true at the same time. </p>
        <p>d. Meanwhile, if I get in an accident, my car suddenly takes on its 
          REAL worth. Woo hoo! So, when I pay car insurance, my car is worth $100,000 
          but when it gets totalled, it is suddenly worth a Happy Meal (WITHOUT 
          fries). </p>
        <p>e. And, if by some amazing luck, my car isn't totalled, the insurance 
          company mandates that I replace the old parts (upon which my car assumes 
          some of its worth) with replacement parts. My car is then reappraised 
          as if it was not built on replacement parts but is, instead, appraised 
          as if the parts were made of pure gold or signed Babe Ruth baseball 
          cards. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Capitalism at work. </p>
      <p align="left">Again, this is just my paranoid delusion of what is true. 
        I suspect that the actual truth is far far worse.</p>
      <p align="left"> However, I continue to pay the insurance because I am an 
        idiot. I paid that bill a couple weeks ago. </p>
      <p align="left">But then I had to turn to my taxes. </p>
      <p align="left">If taxes don't turn you to conservatism, I dont know what 
        will, except for the fact that conservatives love spending your money 
        as much as liberals (someone once commented that the Democrats and Republicans 
        are just two wings of the same tax happy party). </p>
      <p align="left">I was just flat out raped by the government this year. </p>
      <p align="left">Rape ... is a terrible thing. A</p>
      <p align="left">fter completing my taxes, terrified that the government 
        was going to come beat the shit out of me for not paying them on time 
        (or at all), I went to the grocery store to buy sausage. It was then that 
        I realized two horrible, horrible truths: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1. The government is insane. </p>
        <p>2. It will never be fixed.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"> I know, I know. We have all heard this before: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"The government is crazy, corrupt, unfixable, blah blah blah." </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Some of you may have heard this so many times that you may 
        no longer believe it to be true. You may think this is some sort of Great 
        American Untrue Cliche. </p>
      <p align="left">But the trip to the grocery store reminded me why the government 
        is insane:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> 1. Farmers are in trouble because ... gosh darn it ... when there 
          is a big supply of something, the price drops. </p>
        <p>2. The government therefore decides, in a move that makes Lenin and 
          Marx proud to be Americans, to prop up farmers by paying them not to 
          farm or by forgiving all their loans or by forcing them plant certain 
          crops over and over and over so that the soil is nothing more than sand 
          and tractor oil residue ... because, gosh darn it, we cant let something 
          like capitalism get in the way of our good ole unprofitable American 
          farmers! </p>
        <p>3. Food prices, therefore, are elevated by government pressure. Americans, 
          in turn, pay higher prices on these inflated food costs (und higher 
          price means higher tax!). </p>
        <p>4. Then, in a move that makes you especially proud to be an American, 
          the government pays out billions of dollars in food stamps because ... 
          gosh darn it ... food is expensive! When the hell did that happen? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">It is the great circle fuck of all time, people. Gather 
        round and lube up. </p>
      <p align="left">But wait! This is a democracy! Or, at least, a representative 
        republic. There is something we can do about this!!! </p>
      <p align="left">You would think so, but things will probably never change 
        for one very simple, never mentioned, truth:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> "People are idiots." </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">The Great Corollary of this is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> "NIMBY: Not in My Back Yard."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"> In other words, Americans want change, they want their 
        taxes reduced, they want responsible government ... just as long as it 
        doesnt affect them. </p>
      <p align="left">We need more sewage plants, the people cry. We are up to 
        our ass in shit! Just don't put them in our backyard. Put them over there 
        in those people's backyard! </p>
      <p align="left">So you just have to know that none of this will ever change. 
        But of course I .. in all my outrage .. can't get too upset about my taxes 
        because I deducted my continuing education classes just this morning. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">And you guys, yeah you, are paying for it. </p>
      <p align="left">Thanks, with all my heart.</p>
      <p align="left"> Now, I am happy. </p>
