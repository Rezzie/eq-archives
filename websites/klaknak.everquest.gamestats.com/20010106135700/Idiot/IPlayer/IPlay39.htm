  <p align="left"> On Tallon Zek the PvP teams server</p>
  <p align="left">Being a Wood Elf rogue i dont have good faction with almost 
    anyone in Kelethin my home town. A friend of mine tells me faction in Highpass 
    is easy to raise with a quest and i can get bound there (of course i get bound 
    right in the middle of the guards to be safe froma train) and get myself a 
    PGT for my second weapon. After camping for 6 hours i get one and decide to 
    head to quenyous and do a quest there to raise faction to perfect. I feeling 
    quite good about my faction and decide that i can spare some with humans and 
    give a /shout if there is a guild that no one likes. The responce The Dark 
    Coalition. I say ok and proceed to hunt down a ton of them and they are are 
    stupid i thinki made 500pp in a matter of 4 hours. Im feeling good and i zone 
    back into quenyous walk into town and head to the bank and get attacked by 
    by this weak ass NPC. I proceed to kill him only to be attacked by the guards. 
    God damn it im gonna go downstairs to get something to get something to eat. 
    While eating i get a call from my girlfriend to come over and "help" her with 
    her homework. Of course i forget to log off EQ and go over to her house for 
    2 hours. I come back home and go to my computer and see you have been slain 
    by a guard LOADING PLEASE WAIT... like 800 times and when i log back on i 
    manage to escape into the town and i check to see how much EXP ive lost i 
    mean there could hardly be a dent in me cause im a mighty lvl 19 well now 
    im a pethetic lvl 5 or 4 or where ever you stop lossing EXP needless to say 
    i NEVER logged onto TZ again</p>
