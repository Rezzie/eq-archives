      <p align="left">One day I decided to take the boat from Freeport so I waited 
        for it to arrive for what seemed like a long time so I went to get a fishing 
        pole and some bait to pass the time I go out the wrong door on accident. 
        I see the boat pull up so I make a jump from one dock to another land 
        right in the water started swimming over to the dock as the boat leaves. 
        there went (30 minutes) wasted.</p>
      <p align="left">I finally get up on the dock and wait and start fishing 
        (30 minutes) later the boat comes I walk up to it try to get on I figured 
        someone must have been blocking the way so I walked a little to the left 
        and what I fell into the water I didnt get on the boat I see the boat 
        leave as Im getting up onto the dock (Sigh).</p>
      <p align="left">I fish again a few skill points and some fish later (30 
        minutes) I see the boat I RUN up to it and not knowing at the time that 
        you have to jump to get on I go running and it pushes me off to the side. 
        I get on the dock the boat already gone start fishing.</p>
      <p align="left">(30 minutes later) the boat comes I figured I would be smart 
        and get a really big running start at it I start running (with SOW on) 
        and go flying off the side into the water again (SIGH) I was not happy 
        at this moment. I get back onto the dock the boat still there this time 
        I had found the perfect way onto the dock by now I run for it and right 
        before I reached it it started going I run right off the end of the dock 
        into the water. I then shouted "Why cant I get onto the boat in FP?" Jhondoe 
        tells you: you gotta jump.</p>
      <p align="left">I fished (30 muinutes later I see the boat I run jump up 
        onto now what I noticed was a ledge. I kept running and went flying off 
        I figured must have to jump twice. I didnt make it in time for a second 
        attempt I started fishing.</p>
      <p align="left">(30 minutes) later I see the boat I jump onto the ledge 
        then jump onto the boat.</p>
      <p align="left">(FEW) I figured my troubles where over. After about a (30 
        minute) boat ride I make it there but then me sitting and meditating and 
        sense heading didnt realize this was my stop until a long time after then 
        we zoned. (Sigh) ok I figured I would stay on the boat and ride it around 
        (60 minutes) later me STANDING right by the edge waiting to get off well 
        on my slow computer we went right past the dock while I was in the zone 
        and were already almost into the next zone (Sigh).</p>
      <p align="left">I waited another (60 minutes) RIGHT BY THE EDGE WATCHING 
        FOR WHEN IT SAID You have entered the Butcher Block Mountains. Right as 
        I saw that I jumped off the boat and swam for the dock. I FINALLY shouted 
        "I made it I made it home again home again after a 6 hour boat ride hour 
        long boat ride I made it I made it". I got MANY questions that day about 
        how did you ride the boat for 6 hours? This was all TOTALLY true even 
        if it is stupid.</p>

        I died from lag death before I could bind and ended up back in Erudin.&quot;]</p>
