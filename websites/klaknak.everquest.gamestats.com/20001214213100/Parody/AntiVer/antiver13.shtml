  <p align="left">Q: Why did you make all the weapons in plane of hate for bards 
    pretty much the exact same thing except for its weapon type. <br>
    A: There were a few items added to Hate Plane for Bards. Three of them were 
    originally designed to be dropped from the same monster - the three identical 
    Bard weapons. They were made identical so that no matter which weapon a Bard 
    had chosen to train up in (1HS, 1HB or Piercing), they would have a good weapon 
    to chose from. During the tuning and testing phase of Hate, these weapons 
    got split up and placed on different monsters. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: OMG this one actually made sense!!! </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Why didn't you make the attack speed songs of bards stack 
    with other spells. <br>
    A: No attack speed spells or songs stack with each other either. Each player 
    can h ave a total of two haste effects on them - one from an item, and one 
    from a spell/song. </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: We were bored one day so we nerfed it.</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Does AC matter for a bard? <br>
    A: Yes. A better AC is always worth having. It means that you get hit for 
    less damage. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: $tUp1d /\/eWb13</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Can you PLEASE make our songs attract less mobs? I cant even 
    sing in planes during a fight because all the mobs will go aggressive on me!! 
    So I get turned into a mediocre tank. <br>
    A: We reduced the Bard song taunt factor a bit this/last patch. Sometimes, 
    however, discretion is the better part of valor. I know many Bards that leave 
    their songs playing, regardless of the situation. There are times when you 
    want to stop singing, in the same way that there are times when a Cleric may 
    not want to attract attention by Healing, or a Wizard may not want to attract 
    attention with their DD spells. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: another clever ploy to confuse the person who 
    asked this question so badly that the answer isn't important</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Our dispel magic song is a very nice song, but can you make 
    it more like nullify magic? By the time we get this song, we can't dispel 
    a lot of the buffs. Is there a reason for this? <br>
    A: Check the patch message - Syvelian's has gotten a bit more powerful. That 
    being said, all magic effects can be dispelled. Some are just harder then 
    others. The difference in levels between the caster and the person casting 
    the cancel does make a difference. What the "better" cancel magic spells do 
    is add to your effective level for purposes of the comparison. </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: nullify magic is POS </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Why do we not have the ability to play Invisibility and See 
    Invisibility songs together? Or perhaps allowing our see invisible to be played 
    on top of a casters invisible or camouflage? <br>
    A: Any effect that hits you while invisible turns you visible. We recently 
    added the See Invisible component to the Bard's invisibility song - this should 
    help the problem. (Or you can just follow the cool sparkles?) </p>
  <p align="left">editor's note: or you can join the navy!</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Can you give us some way to increase faction (when we have 
    a god) so that Guise is worth using? <br>
    A: Try using Cinda's Charismatic Carillon - the song increases your faction 
    with that of the targeted creature. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: Cuba's Communist quartet works well too</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Is Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a memory 
    blur component?<br>
    A: Nope. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: these bard songs names are really cheesy. In 
    the words of the famous Emil Zola, "Oh my"</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely trivial, 
    the enameled black chestplate from lower guk is a black plate that is wearable 
    by all the plate wearing classes except Bard. I wear an inferior black plate 
    because I like the black plate look, can this plate be made available to Bards? 
    <br>
    A: No reason. I changed it so that Bards can use it too - should be in this 
    patch. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: Interrogater slips the arch mage a 20</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Recently, the range on Brusco's Boastful Bellow (level 12 
    song) was drastically reduced, leaving bards with, for all intents and purposes, 
    no ranged attack. There are times when my bard cannot bellow a mob that is 
    actually within aggro range, because it is "too far away". <br>
    A: We didn't change it. I double checked my database just to be sure, and 
    the range is what it has always been (half the range of a Wizard style DD 
    spell). </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: wizard DD range sucks balls</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Are there enhanced effects for these songs when the proper 
    instrument is equipped? In the case of Aquatic Ayre, is the enhancement range 
    increased? For Sirens and Pixie Strike, does it increased duration, chance 
    of success, or both? <br>
    A: Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff, 
    attack speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc. </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: screw instruments, bards are supposed to sing anyways</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: If a player is targeted when the level 26 screech (area fear) 
    is started, a message is displayed that this sort of spell cannot be cast 
    on players. Is this "feature" intended? <br>
    A: All player classes lost the ability to Fear (or anything else that causes 
    the AI to take over your character) other PCs. This was, sadly, due to a few 
    people who were really abusing it. They spoiled it for everybody.</p>
  <p align="left"> Editor's note: mommy mommy! Can i have another cookie? Mom: 
    no sweety, you don't want to spoil your dinner do you?<br>
    Child: but i spoiled fear for EQ, why can't i spoil my dinner too?</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: First I would like to know why you made bards hybrids. I 
    mean I see rangers ( druid/warrior), Paladins (cleric/warrior), and ShadowKnights 
    (necro/warrior), but a Bard is a rogue/? <br>
    A: Bards are Hybrids (by classification) because they more closely resemble 
    the Paladin/SK/Ranger then any other group of classes. </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: bards have their own class, its called the screwed 
    classes. If brad has his way all classes will be in this group </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Can you explain your thoughts behind Psalm of Purity and 
    Psalm of Vitality? These songs are simply useless since any 5th level druid 
    and 4th level cleric can cure the disease and poison these songs are supposed 
    to protect from. I mean truly 39 points of disease protection for a 29th level 
    song? <br>
    A: These songs, in addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have 
    chances to remove a poison or disease effect on you. They are a mixture of 
    a cure and a resistance buff in one. </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: in the name of balance, and since we ran out of 
    corny names to call disease cures, we have melded the two into one really 
    worthless song.</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Alenia's Disenchanting Melody. It will remove all buffs/deduffs 
    except Necromancer and ShadowKnight spells. If this song gets rid of a 49th 
    level buff it darn sure should get rid of a 14th level infectious cloud or 
    steal strength. Again these spells are counteracted by 4/5th level spells 
    from a druid or cleric. Could you explain why it doesn't? <br>
    A: Alenia's Disenchanting Melody will get rid of magical effects - but it 
    will not get rid of poison or disease effects (no cancel magic style spell 
    will get rid of a poison or disease effect). For that you need a Cure - or 
    a Psalm. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: please open your hymnals to psalm 138 please</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Do you believe Dissension the Mana Draining Song is actually 
    useful against a Monster? What scenarios do you envision it being used and 
    can this actually be done in game? <br>
    A: My favorite is to use it against single, large mobs that you don't want 
    casting lots of spells. Vox is a good example - the less mana she has, the 
    less Complete Healing spells she can cast. </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: being an all powerful gm who could solo vox at 
    level 1, i think its funny to debuff her and take her around the zone a few 
    times before killing her. It was a game we played in the PoA</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: I notice that Charisma affects all of the Mind based songs 
    as far as resists are concerned. My question is what statistics affects the 
    resists of the Direct Damage and Damage over time songs. <br>
    A: No statistic effects damage songs. Charisma is special in making mental 
    based songs / spells harder to save against. One of the reasons that this 
    was done was to give an extra benefit to classes / races that have higher 
    Charismas.</p>
  <p align="left"> Editor's note: charismas isn't a word, it's highlighted in 
    red. StUpId N3w813</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: The radius on Selo's Accelerando should be doubled. <br>
    A: I agree. That should be in next patch. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: Interrogator slips the arch-mage a twenty</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: As a Wood Elf Bard, my Forage skill gets capped at 40 regardless 
    of the fact that my heritage as a Wood Elf has trained me better. Is it intended 
    to be so that as a bard I LOSE that heritage? <br>
    A: That's silly. I'll see what I can do. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: ye foul wood elves have no heritage! Down with 
    wood elves!</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Why are some 2H Slashing weapons usable by bards but our 
    skill is capped at 0?<br>
    A: Bards were never slotted to get 2H weapons. They have no ability to skill 
    in it from a Guild Master, nor do they ever actually get the skill. There 
    is a display error, however, at the Bard Guild Master which shows that the 
    skill is trainable.</p>
  <p align="left"> Editor's note: wow, someone out there really made sure to double 
    check things.</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each 
    of the following: Cinda's Charismatic Carillon, Tarew's Aquatic Ayre, Solon's 
    Song of the Sirens, Crission's Pixie Strike, and Agilmente's Aria of Eagles? 
    <br>
    A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance, none. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Translation: flutes are worthless, don't waste your money</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: I play a shaman. This is perhaps a bit off the mark, but 
    I was wondering what are the best buffs for a bard? For example, I recently 
    discovered ? that dexterity helps a bard, as does charisma. Any other buffs 
    that a wise bard should be asking for? <br>
    A: Charisma and Dexterity are the best Buffs. Most Bards that I know can also 
    always use a few more points of strength - their armor usually puts them dangerously 
    close to encumbrance. AC & HP buffs are also nice - most denizens of Norrath 
    have an inexplicable hatred of music and tend to take it out on nearby minstrels. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: And the angry mob hurled there unripe fruit at 
    the bard's guild, and the lord smiled upon it, for it was good. </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: We have one song that only affects the bard only, called 
    Jonathan's Whistling Warsong. Why haven't we seen similar songs at higher 
    levels? <br>
    A: Most Bard songs are designed to be grant group effects rather then personal 
    buffs. Jonthan's Warsong was put in to give lower level Bards a boost at a 
    time where they needed one. We could certainly add another higher level version 
    of the song, but I have a feeling that it just wouldn't be used that much.</p>
  <p align="left"> Editor's note: this interrogator forgot the twenty</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Because we can be interrupted while being attacked or experiencing 
    lag, were there any thoughts on increasing the duration of levitation/invisibility/water 
    breathing? No one in his or her right mind would ask a bard to perform these 
    songs in combat situations. A great set of group songs that need a little 
    more work. <br>
    A: This is something that I have been running some tests on recently. There 
    is a decent chance that we will add a tick or so to the duration of each of 
    these songs. It won't overpower them, but it will make them easier to use 
    in most situations.</p>
  <p align="left"> Translation: i have this cigarrette, but nowhere to blow the 
    smoke...</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: It seems the level 34 song Solidarity of Vision may have 
    a use, but its duration is to short. Do you plan to increase it?<br>
    A: I think that did receive a slight duration boost. It should be going in 
    this patch or the next one - not sure which.</p>
  <p align="left"> Editor's note: verant cares.</p>
