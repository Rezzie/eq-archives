  <p>Response to &quot;Shootings&quot; by Skyler</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Skyler, a teenager, responds.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I, myself, am a 16 year old guy, and have been playing video 
    games since I was 5, but only little ones. I didn't get Wolfenstein until 
    I was 10, which was EXTREMELY young, this isn't good. I ran around, and shot 
    people. At 14 I got 007 Goldeneye on NIN 64. This game taught me where to 
    shoot people to kill them. Never more than one shot in the head, 2 in the 
    torso should do it, 6 in the arms would really f*ck a person up.</p>
  <p align="left">Now you say "And?"</p>
  <p align="left">Well I see what's your saying as being true, I went over to 
    my cousin's house and played 007 with him, he's 10 and kicked the hell out 
    of me on 007. So I assume he plays this game more than I do, which is a LOT. 
    And this was like 3 months after 007 came out. Since then games have upgraded, 
    now we get blood, and lots of it. For example, Siphon Filter. I love the hell 
    outta them kind of games, but I realize that it is a game. Possibly it does 
    desensitise me to violence, I don't think so. But when I get pissed off, or 
    have a bad day at school, I come home and kick some ass on halflife. Is this 
    bad? Is killing pixels making me more likely to kill people? I don't believe 
    so. Maybe at a young influential age, its bad. But not for people my age I 
    don't think.</p>
  <p align="left">However my father took away 007, Siphon Filter, Metalgear Solid, 
    and Grand Theft Auto. Which in the end, I didn't really care about, but I'd 
    think it'd be better to take out my aggression on a game, or in an activity, 
    say, umm Karate or something? Better than me grabbing my shotgun, and unloading 
    it on the prayer group we have every monday and friday morning at school? 
    The media is driving this in a bad direction. Its not games, I mean it might 
    be partially, but my parents are convinced it is games that make kids violent.</p>
  <p align="left">I think its the parents. My mom and dad was both 28 when they 
    had me, and every third year for my 2 brothers and 1 sister, they were planning 
    it, were financially set, my dad stayed home, my mom worked 7am to 3pm, I 
    spent a lot of time with my parents as a young child, and as of now, i've 
    never had any sort of criminal record or anything bad at all. Worse thing 
    I've ever done was tried a cigarette when I was 12 (which no one knows, thank 
    god) I've got good grades in school, I don't work, play some everquest, look 
    at your site a lot and am overall a normal kid.</p>
  <p align="left">Bah, I've wasted a bunch of your time with this email, so I'll 
    leave now. I showed your serious section to my dad, and he read it and walked 
    off thinking about it. I just wanted to say thanks for writing this, made 
    me think, and my father too. Life isn't all jokes (too bad huh) the serious 
    section of your site is a very important one and nice of you to make it.</p>
