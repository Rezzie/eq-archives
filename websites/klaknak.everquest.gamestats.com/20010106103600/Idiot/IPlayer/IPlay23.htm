  <p>Befallen Claims Another Soul - by Sam</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Ok, I guess it's time for me to humble myself in the idiot 
    files. I don't usually play enough to be THIS dumb. And actually when I do 
    play, I only die VERY infrequently. I'm generally a careful and intelligent 
    player.</p>
  <p align="left">Last night was different.</p>
  <p align="left">You've heard of famous last words? How about "I think I'll check 
    out that Befallen place that people keep telling me about." So, I made the 
    trek from East Freeport, all the way out to Befallen. I carefully entered 
    the zone and very carefully looked around. There were about 20 players in 
    the zone and there were a few medding up at the top of the stairs in the entry 
    room. So, I decide to wander around a bit very cautiously. "Hey", I think 
    to myself, "there doesn't seem to be much here. I guess the spawns are under 
    control right now. Cool." So, I wander a bit more until I see a putrid skeleton. 
    "Hmm....green to me. Ok, I'll try elsewhere". I managed after a while to wander 
    after another player through an open door and down into the second level where 
    there still were almost no mobs.</p>
  <p align="left">"Hey. Another skeleton. Oh, it's Yellow. Ok, I'll leave this 
    area".</p>
  <p align="left">I had been /oocing to get into a group, but there wasn't anyone 
    interested. So, I decided to go back up and hope for some blues. Except my 
    way is blocked by a necro initiate and his pet.</p>
  <p align="left">"Uh oh, they're red. But look! Someone is taking them away and 
    killing them! good."</p>
  <p align="left">So, I go back upstairs and I'm about to go through the door 
    back into the main area when I realize it's locked. I had followed someone 
    else through so I didn't know that this was a locked door. No problem, there 
    still aren't any mobs about. I'll just go back and look in these rooms for 
    some blues to kill. After killing a blue skeleton and another green that jumped 
    me in the process I go to see if someone is leaving and I see a guy running 
    from a ghoul and a skeleton.</p>
  <p align="left">'Help, oh god help me!" he says as he runs by.</p>
  <p align="left">I wisely stand back and con the mobs. Red and Yellow.</p>
  <p align="left">I'd better...</p>
  <p align="left">Runningguy has been slain by a ghoul.</p>
  <p align="left">A Ghoul hits you for 63 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">A Skeleton hits you for 38 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">(Franticly trying to cast Gate) </p>
  <p align="left">Ghoul hits you for 63 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">A Skeleton hits you for 31 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">You are stunned.</p>
  <p align="left">More damage occurs.</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, no big deal. I'll go back and get my corpse. Back to Befallen 
    we go. Wander around some more and there are still no mobs to be seen. The 
    spawns are still under control. Oops, a green skeleton is hitting me. I have 
    no equipment, but I (wisely) memorized my spells and had my shield up. Nuke 
    it to kingdom come, no problem. I wander back to where I died. No corpse. 
    Uhm.</p>
  <p align="left">/shout "Has anyone seen my corpse?"</p>
  <p align="left">No answer.</p>
  <p align="left">Well, maybe I forgot where I died. I know it was in this area. 
    Wander around for 20 minutes. Open door. Walk through. "Hey, there are lots 
    more mobs here than there were before."</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">Head back to Befallen. Wander around carefully. Walk into the 
    area that I'm SURE I died. Still no body.</p>
  <p align="left">A Putrid Skeleton hits you for 35 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">Run away. </p>
  <p align="left">Putrid Skeleton hits you for 28 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">Friendly Necromancer casts a spell on the skeleton and makes 
    it run away.</p>
  <p align="left">Friendly Necromancer says, "Zone. He'll be back."</p>
  <p align="left">"But I can't find my corpse"</p>
  <p align="left">A Putrid Skeleton hits you for 32 damage.</p>
  <p align="left">Friendly Necromancer makes the skeleton run away again.</p>
  <p align="left">Friendly Necromancer says, "You'd better zone before you die."</p>
  <p align="left">"Ok. I will. I just wish I could find my corpse."</p>
  <p align="left">Friendly Necromancer says, "Oh. It's in that wall there."</p>
  <p align="left">ARGH! </p>
