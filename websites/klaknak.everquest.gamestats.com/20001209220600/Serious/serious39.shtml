        Bond's mother? The tin man didn't have a heart but man was that sex scene 
        steamy. </p>
      <p align="left">anyways, I am writing to respond to a response to a response 
        etc... respond to a response that was made by the greek guy that tries 
        to fly. I read <a href="serious34.shtml">his letter</a> and was astounded 
        at some (most) of the things that he said. I'll start by saying: </p>
      <p align="left">"Dear Cackling Klaknak, <br>
        I found your article on the pros and cons of 'ShowEQ' to be very well 
        written and well thought out. However, I would like to bring to light 
        a couple of points that I feel you have left out." (pp. 45)</p>
      <p align="left"> This is the general libertarian (sp?) start (yes, I used 
        to listen to Rusch (spII?) Limbah (spIII?)) This person starts by flattering 
        you, but then cuts to the chase fairly quickly. </p>
      <p>paragraph 1: <br>
        He starts off by saying that hackers can be anything evil. What about 
        good hackers? Now I know you are saying, "WTF are good hackers?" now, 
        but there are. These are the people who take viruses and analyze them 
        to make the internet safer for you by (passive!!) creating anti-viruses(viri?) 
        He then continues to say that ShowEQ is theft. The last I checked theft 
        meant that you take something that doesn't belong to you. ShowEQ may be 
        vandalism yes, damaging property that doesn't belong to you, but theft? 
        What kind of crack was he on? Cookie Dough ice-cream is good. Anyways, 
        this person, using blatant lack of vocabulary, has proven their response 
        unworthy of credit by saying that ShowEQ is theft. </p>
      <p align="left">Second paragraph:<br>
        He starts this paragraph like a libertarian(sp?) again. He claims that 
        your closing statement is wrong, which can be read two ways: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1: Is this a bad thing? I kind of think so. </p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p>2: Do the ends justify the means? I think so. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Now responding to BOTH of these possible meanings can be 
        a tricky thing. Why include the one when all you need is the other? Surely 
        this person wasn't thinking when they read it. </p>
      <p align="left">He then discounts vigilante justice, which in my political 
        views, is perfectly ok. Though I am an anarchist and pray to the lord 
        that my views are never put into action, (anarchy would work if people 
        weren't idiots) something that is just a game shouldn't be taken this 
        seriously. Certainly this is technology misuse, and breaks a legal contract, 
        but calling it vigilante justice is like pulling someone over for speeding 
        and adding wreckless driving on top of it. Sure they were speeding, but 
        how reckless can they be if they thought they could go so fast? Obviously 
        not very (sorry, that is how I look at things as an able, intelligent 
        person and try to think of people as the same. People who know me call 
        me dopey)</p>
      <p align="left"> Then he goes on to tell us how a few people ruined it for 
        everyone. I agree. Spending 2 and a half hours trying to get across the 
        OOT wasn't my idea of fun, especially after having to make a petition 
        that took about 3 hours to get answered (i had petitioned earlier about 
        the game crashing while I zoned) and then finally having to be teleported 
        to the damn docks after a rather rude (on my part, but who wouldn't be 
        after a 2 and a half hour boat ride?) argument with the guide. But this 
        is life, a few people (idiots or cruel and vindictive people) WILL ruin 
        it for everyone, and though it makes everyone mad, those people will always 
        be there.</p>
