      <p align="left">Hallo. </p>
      <p align="left">I read your article on ShowEQ. OK, I read it after just 
        waking up with a tremendous headache, PMS and a growling stomach (more 
        room to digest facts?), so my judgement may be a little bit impaired. 
        But I've been thinking about this for a bit, and here is my comment: </p>
      <p align="left">ShowEQ, in my opinion, is not wrong. It gives players who 
        can afford the software an advantage, just like training for a race gives 
        you an advantage. The people who are selling this are marketing a product, 
        just like Verant is doing, making money off of it and having their own 
        little business. I don't think it nerfs Rangers or Druids, since they 
        still have their abilities. It's just that I can too. Also, it may spread 
        out the population, clearing up camp sites and spawns. <br>
        So what keeps me from using it?<br>
        Fear. </p>
      <p align="left">Plain old, simple fear. I know Verant is scanning my system, 
        and all I want them to find is EQ, pictures of The Tea Party and an mp3 
        player. I do NOT want to get in deep shit for this, and simply seeing 
        that mob A gives more experience and loot than mob B will NOT make me 
        risk the wrath of Verant. Now, I have, like everyone else I assume, looked 
        at a bunch of code in my EQ file, wondered at it, and wondered if I altered 
        it a bit, would I end up with an Oracle Robe? But the same fear is preventing 
        me from doing that, fear that the great gods Verant may find out and attack 
        me. </p>
      <p align="left">So what's my smart-ass idea of dealing with this? Verant 
        should buy the rights to this thing, and market it. Simple, eh? It is 
        a product, like so much other stuff, and that product should be marketed. 
        It does good and, hey, a Ranger can still range, but my Enchanters can't 
        enchant. Fi they are so concerned with a supposed nerf to Rangers' tracking, 
        improve the tracking. </p>
