        <p>One day in the woods, I /tell my friend who I know is an idiot but 
          think who can screw up orc hill? So anyways she tells me she is grouped 
          with a wizard of the same level and they are going to lfay. Well, I 
          go to the zone and zone in before them, even though they were already 
          on their way. When I zone, they zone in behind me. We group up and go 
          into the faydark.</p>
        <p> Now comes the first idiot remark. Let's stick with the path. First 
          of all, we have a ranger who can track, and second, only big mean orcs 
          stay along the path. So we go along the path so that Ms. Wizard can 
          find her way back. Well we go along and kill about four wasps before 
          we get to an orc camp. I go and pull two wasps beyond the camp, expecting 
          them to stay there, since their connection appear to be slower than 
          8k judging by their reaction time. I even had to loot the wasps for 
          the wizard because she took so long. So I'm going back to them with 
          the two wasps when I notice that their health bars are going down. Well 
          I make it to them just in time to get slaughtered by 4 orc cents. </p>
        <p>That wasn't even the beginning though. Well, ok, so it WAS the beginning, 
          but the two-hour corpse retrieval is what makes them idiots. We zone 
          back into lfay, and the ranger goes linkdead while the wizard disconnected 
          while zoning, so I group the wizard when she comes back on and then 
          we go get her corpse. Then she gets killed by an orc and I can strafe-run 
          back to the zone. Then the ranger comes back on and runs to the lfay 
          zone. We group up and all three of us head to the camp. We make it, 
          and the corpses are between the camp and another orc. So I stop and 
          we wait for the orc to leave, and when it starts moving it comes toward 
          us and I am the only one to move. My two group members managed to stay 
          totally still for long enough so that it had a nice easy kill of them 
          before coming after me. The next few tries either the wizard or the 
          ranger got a little too close to the orcs. All the while I was telling 
          them to /consent me, since I had no doubt they would botch up /corpse 
          by getting close to the orcs. I even managed to get a high level to 
          clear out the camp, but alas, the two had wandered off and a renegade 
          orc came by and slaughtered me. When they finally /consented me I ran 
          with their corpses to the zone, this being the ONLY way that I could 
          have gotten them their corpses. </p>
