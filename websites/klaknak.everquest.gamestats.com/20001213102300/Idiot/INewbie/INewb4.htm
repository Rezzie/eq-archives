  <hr>
  <p align="left"> My RL sister plays a Human Wizard named SHalis, and recently 
    reached lvl 4. From that point on she started getting creamed by even fights, 
    and had to pick on fire beatles, and other badly spelled bugs. </p>
  <p align="left">Eventually I got concerned, she would fire her flame spells, 
    but no damage message would come up (The lvl 4 wiz DD spell is Burst of Flame). 
    One time when we went hunting, I noticed that whenever I hit the creatures 
    we were fighting, I would get badly burnt. I ased her if she knew why this 
    would repeatedly happen with pumas. She saiid "I dont know, I just keep hitting 
    them with blasts of radiation, but it doesnt seem to wor. Im sure they'll 
    fix it in the next patch."</p>
  <p align="left">I ask her what she means by "radiation." Turns out she had been 
    casting a damage sheild buff named O'Keals Radioation on the creatures we 
    were fighting. I laughed so hard a madman came and killed us both..</p>
  <p align="left">When we respawned I told her that she was helping the creatures, 
    and not to use that spell anymore. She responded "But I thought radiation 
    hurt you!" </p>
