  <p><font size="4">Revenge of the Cat People - by Serinar</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Serinar, Level 10 necro, has just been talked into going to 
    Erud's Crossing. "It will be great!" said my party member. "Greater lightstones 
    and rawhide armor = $$!" OK, so I take the short jaunt from Qeynos over to 
    Erud's Crossing. Not knowing how the cat people would react to me, I decided 
    to go invisible before I got on the boat.</p>
  <p align="left">When I arrived - I was pleased to see that invis was still intact! 
    "Great!" I think to myself. I see another necro there and ask how the cat 
    people judge him. "Amiable" comes the response. Since invis was still up, 
    I selected and conned a cat person, but of course the the result came back 
    "indifferent". OK then, time to drop invis! Realize that I was still rather 
    new at the game. Realize also that I never bothered to click a "spell effect" 
    icon on my main screen.</p>
  <p align="left">This being the case, I did not realize that, by merely clicking 
    on the "Gather Shadows" icon I could dispel my invisibility. My preferred 
    method of dropping invisibility was to cast a spell without a target. It drops 
    invis and just says "You must select a target...".</p>
  <p align="left">I think you can see where this is going... I click the Poison 
    Bolt spell. Strange...why is the casting time bar appearing...oh no! Walk 
    away - interrupt it! You regain your concentration and continue your casting. 
    (First time I remember this happening)</p>
  <p align="left">Suchandsuch Catperson resists the Poison Bolt spell!</p>
  <p align="left">Suchandsuch Catperson says "I really hate necromancers like 
    you!"</p>
  <p align="left">Othersuchandsuch Catperson says "Time to die Serinar." <continued helpless beatings by 4 different cat 
people on the dock in full view of getting off boat></p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...</p>
  <p align="left">Oh well, time to find the boat again. Several days later, while 
    discussing the incident, a friend says "Why didn't you just click on the spell 
    icon?" to which I reply "That works?"</p>
  <p align="left">Your skill in Ignorance has increased! (24)</p>
  <p align="left">Moral of the story: Always make sure you check to make sure 
    you don't unintentionally attack cat people by leaving them targeted while 
    you cast Poison Bolt to dispel Gather Shadows. </p>
