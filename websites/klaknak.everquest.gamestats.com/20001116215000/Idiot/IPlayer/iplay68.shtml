        <p>Even powerful Level 51s can be pathetic idiots too. 
        <p>I am fighting in the Castle Karnor near the zone when one of the inevitable 
          trains comes. This one is mostly a Construct of Sathir, a monster known 
          to yield any number of fine items. I am feeling lucky today, too. 
        <p>'Detain the Construct while we kill the rest!' my group yells at me. 
          So I chase this goofy golem around beating on him while he kicks a druid 
          into the ground, bowls an ogre's rotund body into the moat, and shows 
          that two bites get to the center of a wizard pop. All in all, this Construct 
          gives a a fine demonstration of just how badly level 51 creatures can 
          maul level 45+ players. After a few minutes, though, he is quite the 
          hurt little claypile, and the rest of the train is dead or fled. We 
          are fighting RIGHT IN the zone gate from chasing around all the people 
          who wisely ran from this beast. My party is a ways off, having followed 
          some runner to ensure its doom. 
        <p>'Bring him here, we cannot see him!' my party says. I run to them. 
        <p>'YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME, Thrashette!' the Construct says. &lt;blink&gt; 
          I am back at the zone gate. 
        <p>'Zone now, before you die!' my party screams. 
        <p>'MUHAHAHA', I say. I still have 850 hitpoints, the Construct of Sathir 
          has only 'Con' in red, and the zone is a skip away. I fight on. The 
          construct shows me some fine points in clawplay, and laughs a bit at 
          my pathetic Ykesha procs. He feels out the extent of some holes in my 
          armor, around the heart area. He shows me how his tail can be used to 
          riposte. Eventually I get the picture that I am not winning. I run towards 
          the zone. I run through the zone. I run around the corner behind the 
          zone into the place that nobody gets to see. I marvel that Verant actually 
          textured the area where it deadends. I realize I have been summoned 
          behind the zone gate, and that I had better turn around if I want to 
          live. I turn around and run out of the zone.
        <p> 'YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME, Thrashette!' the Construct says. &lt;blink&gt; 
          I am back behind the corner. 
        <p>'I can't see you to heal!', my party cleric yells. 'ZONE! FAST!'. 
        <p>'YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE ME, Thrashette!' the Construct says. <br>
          LOADING...PLEASE WAIT... <br>
          You have entered Firiona Vie. 
        <p>The party cleric tells the party "You better petition. I can't target 
          your body to rez you." 
        <p>/em sigh
