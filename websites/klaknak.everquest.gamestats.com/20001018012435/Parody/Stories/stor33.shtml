      <p align="left">Here's a piece I hammered out while I was, well, hammered, 
        so this may require some editorial work. This is mostly in response to 
        Abashi's numerous posts on the Everquests boards where he does little 
        to answer well-reasoned arguments, and instead picks apart the same argument 
        when it's badly costructed and misspelled. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p align="left">It was just another cold day in hell. The cigar burns in 
        the carpet and the musty smell of cheap scotch-you know, the kind that 
        comes in the big bottles with the handles so the bums freezing their cojones 
        off on forty-fifth street could still hold em and swig their antifreeze-and 
        the wads of used kleenex in the wastebasket reminded of the dame who'd 
        dropped in night before.<br>
        Me, I'm a sucker for a soft touch. Maybe that's why I dropped six bits 
        in Sammy the Geek's tip jar every afternoon when I went down to the greasy 
        spoon for my breakfast-He's a real geek, you know. Pocket protector and 
        pens. Not one of those fashionable geeks they got uptown nowdays. You 
        gotta know the difference in this business.<br>
        This dame dropped in the night before like a load of cement on my stairway-you 
        could hear the stairs creak under her. Cement stairs on reinforced steel, 
        but they swayed and bent under her like half-boiled spaghetti noodles 
        under a lumbering watermelon. Two of em. Sammy the Geek had warned me 
        about her. "Watch out for the fat broad," he whispered to me just the 
        other day, while he pushed his electrical tape-repaired glasses farther 
        up on his nose. "She's trouble." With a heave and a sigh she'd beached 
        herself on the end of my sofa that was less covered in dirty socks and 
        chinese take-out boxes. "I need help," She'd said. "I don't know who else 
        to turn to." I knew better but I asked her anyway. "What's the problem, 
        sweetheart?" "It's my husband," she'd said. "All he does is sit in front 
        of his computer and play games all day. He doesn't talk to me anymore. 
        We never have sex anymore-"<br>
        I interrupted her too late - she was trouble, all right. She'd already 
        cauterized the forefront of my brain with an image I'll never forget. 
        "Sweetheart, you got the wrong guy. I'm a P.I. I can't help you." She'd 
        looked confused. "But that's what I need, a private investigator. I need 
        you to investigate what's happened to him to change him into this-" "No, 
        sweetheart, you got it all wrong," I'd snapped. "I'm a P.I., all right-a 
        Professional Instigator. I go on message boards and troll for flames. 
        I post stupid remarks on newsgroups to tick people off. You need problems 
        caused, I cause 'em for you. You need someone to stand up and take the 
        heat while being protected by Internet Anonymity, I can do that. What 
        you need is a Marriage Counselor." She'd lunged to her feet-slowly-and 
        snarled at me, "If you won't help me, then go to hell! I'll drag you down 
        with me!&quot;<br>
        That's me, Abashi P.I. Got a mean streak a mile wide and a soft spot for 
        the dames . . and as much luck with 'em as a three-toed sloth's got chances 
        of running across a freeway in rush hour. </p>
      <p align="left">My partner, Goonga the Troll, barged in just after sunset. 
        He scratched his ass and looked around. He's always doing that-scratching 
        his ass. It bogs you down if you think about-first the scratching, then 
        the screaming, then the police knocking on your door at four in the morning. 
        I've seen it happen. <br>
        You gotta have a thick skin in this business. <br>
        "Why don't you ever clean this shithole up?" He muttered, scratching his 
        ass. "I mean, Jesus Christ, you're making me feel dirty and I live in 
        a swamp."<br>
        "Cut the crap," I snarled, and lit a cigar. He hates cigars. "What's the 
        scoop?"<br>
        "Uptown geek's been asking for you. He's paying in cash for your address. 
        He's on his way."<br>
        "On his way? How does he know how to get here if he's paying cash for 
        my address-oh, no, you didn't." <br>
        "He gave me twenty bucks. What was I supposed to say, I don't know you?"<br>
        "That's what you say whenever there's dames involved."<br>
        Goonga scratched his ass again. "Give me another twenty bucks and I'll 
        give him a different address." <br>
        I slipped him a bill. I knew he wouldn't tell this uptown geek a different 
        address, but you gotta watch after your partner. If you don't watch after 
        your partner not even the scumbags on the street will talk to you. <br>
        "I gotta split," Goonga said, scratching his ass. It was starting to get 
        on my nerves. "By the way, you know Freddy down on the street?" <br>
        "That scumbag?" <br>
        "He doesn't want to talk to you anymore. He wants you to leave him alone."</p>
      <p align="left"> After Goonga hit the pavement I checked my piece. It was 
        where I'd left it-in a carton of Wong's take-out Szechuan Chicken Delight. 
        If you're ever up on Forty-fifth Street, don't get the chicken delight. 
        <br>
        You could cut the tension in the air with a knife-like when the dentist 
        is about to do a root canal on you and you're too much of a man to let 
        him give you novocaine. <br>
        I lit the candles in the living room that I used whenever the power was 
        out. The power was out. It goes out on Forty-fifth Street every time there's 
        a storm. Last week the power company stormed my apartment, demanding payment, 
        but I hid in the closet. <br>
        You go through a lotta candles in this business. Knocking on the door-a 
        meaty fist pounding away. As soon as I heard the knock, I knew who it 
        was-it was the uptown geek. But that's not who I knew him as.<br>
        "Lemme in, Abashi," the uptown geek said from the other side of the door. 
        It was a rasping voice, like the voice of a man who would crawl down into 
        hell at Lucifer's bidding to fix the plumbing in Hell's Bathrooms. I should 
        have shot him through the door. I pulled the trigger, but my fingers slipped 
        on Chicken Delight and the piece slipped out of my hand. I heard it land 
        in a pile of moldy egg rolls and bad Chinese fortunes from bad Chinese 
        fortune cookies.<br>
        There was no way I was going in after it. <br>
        With a final shudder, the door slammed open. There he was-I'd been on 
        the run from him for years.<br>
        "Abashi," he growled. "Do you know who I am?" <br>
        I knew him, all right. Goes by the name of Aradune. He's got an uptown 
        racket-pits the Necros against the Druids, and tells everyone he knows 
        that he loves the Rangers, just so everyone will hate them. <br>
        "Let me take a guess," I snarled, just to show him I wasn't off balance. 
        "The fat lady sent you." <br>
        He laughed. It was a thin sound, reedy and wholly evil. "My organization 
        needs someone like you, Abashi," he said. "Someone who can take the heat 
        on the message boards. Someone who can keep all my subscribers so pissed 
        off that they won't realize we're robbing them blind." <br>
        "How much are you sticking them for?" I snapped. <br>
        "9.89 a month," he choked, fighting back against peals of laughter. "Why 
        me?" I asked, as I edged toward the mound of dirty underwear I kept on 
        the bookshelf. I keep a backup piece in there. "Aren't there a hundred 
        other P.I.'s within walking distance of here?" <br>
        "Yes," he said, "But they're all actually private investigators. You're 
        the only professional instigator we've ever heard of." He threw his head 
        back and cackled with glee. <br>
        I took my chance and lunged for the underwear. <br>
        The geek saw me moving and drew. By the time I found my backup he had 
        the drop on me. <br>
        "Drop it," he snapped. "You can't hurt me, anyway. I'm wearing Verdant 
        Platemail."<br>
        "Is that in the game? And what about that flaming sword you've got there?"<br>
        He threw his head back and laughed. "So far as any of the players ask, 
        of course it's in the game! They just haven't found it yet!" <br>
        "But every damn thing in EQ that can fight back is camped! How can anyone 
        not have found it if it's in the game?"<br>
        "When they ask," he said with a gleam in his eye, "Tell them that they're 
        going about it all wrong!"</p>
      <p align="left">I didn't have a choice, really. You never do when the Uptown 
        Geeks put the pressure on you-not unless you like living in a pressure 
        cooker along with a side of beef and some onions for company. Besides-he 
        offered me my dream. Hundreds of thousands of irate, screaming people 
        on message boards. Goonga never forgave me for selling my soul. But the 
        fat lady got a divorce and shacked up with him, and Sammy the Geek tells 
        me they're adopting a pair of froglocks. <br>
        At least now I can pay my electrical bill and order out Chicken Delight. 
        But the scumbags on the street still won't talk to me. </p>
