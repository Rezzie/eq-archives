  <p>Death by Fish and/or Mangler - by Kuri</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Dear Cackling Klacknak, I'm another lady fan who truely adore's 
    your wit and humor. So, I felt it necessary to express my love not in flowers, 
    but in a sad story to share with you.</p>
  <p align="left">Now Im normally a native of Cazic Thule, but some friends from 
    work asked me to join them on another server. Being the adventurous newbie 
    sort (Read: innocently stupid) I thought Id try something new. Ohh, a hafling 
    would be fun, and druids look neat! I'll try one of thoes.. Okay! Here I am 
    in Rivervale, with my note and spells.. Oh I'll just put my spells in the 
    book when I get to my guild.. I bet its just around this corner! (time passes) 
    Hmm.. I know I've been around here before, and I havn't zoned yet, so the 
    guild must be just around this -next- corner, right?</p>
  <p align="left">Oh look! There's a building I havn't seen before! Wow.. a wolf 
    in the back.. but he's got a name, and isnt doing anything.. I know! Maybe 
    its a high level druid with a nifty spell on! I'll go ask him where my guild 
    is! Wolves like druids, right? Whats the worst that could happen! Eeep! Bad 
    puppy! No biskit for you! Why are you attacking me? Lots? Hmm.. cons yellow.. 
    better not try it.. Well Im in the city, one of these merchants or guards 
    should leap to my aid any minuet.. yup.. any time now they will dash to my 
    rescue.</p>
  <p align="left">Oh golly, better run for it.</p>
  <p align="left">Help! Brave higher level than me adventurers please save me 
    from this mean puppydog impersonating a high level druid! Okay, no help there.. 
    GUARDS! Look, lots of guards! They'll save me! Ack! Why wont anyone help me? 
    Im nearly dead! AH! Salvation! I'll just jump in the water! Bet that nasty 
    old wolf cant swim...</p>
  <p align="left">... wow.. a really big fish..</p>
  <p align="left">I didnt know they had these here.. I want a closer look!</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING.. PLEASE WAIT..</p>
  <p align="left">Aaa! Okay, no problem, just need to go back to the city, and 
    fish my corps up out of the water. Im okay. Just find my guild and ZONING 
    Ahh, back in Rive...</p>
  <p align="left">Uh oh.. puppy came to greet me.. I wonder if he's still..</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING.. PLEASE WAIT.. *sniffle*</p>
  <p align="left">Stupid wolfie. Who ever heard of wolves killing newbies like 
    this? Okay, I'll just drop in the water and get the stuff from my body.. wonder 
    what killed me down there anyway? Hey! That neat looking fish again! I'll 
    just...</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING.. PLEASE WAIT..</p>
  <p align="left">*Sob* Stupid wolf! Stupid pirana.. wont let me get my corps, 
    wont let me zone, *sniffle*. Im gonna lodge a complaint whenever I find that 
    stupid guild.. lesse... /corps..</p>
  <p align="left">WHEW! Finally got it! yeay! My spells! Yeay! My.. where is it?! 
    Where is my Guild note?! I turned off the computer and cried.</p>

    it is spelled Pihrhahna or some such nonsense.]</p>
