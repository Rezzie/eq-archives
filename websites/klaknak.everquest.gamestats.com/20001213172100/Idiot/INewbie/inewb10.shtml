  <p align="center">Full circle - by Lorelei (and earlier known as Eriu, Solstyce, 
    Aherne, a whole bunch of other ones, mostly elves)</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I was a wood elf druid, since, OK, wood elves are nice and cute 
    and oh, look, druids are magical! So, little wood elf me goes skipping along 
    in Greater Faydark, oh, level, 2, level three, look at that Orc Centurion! 
    My, my, he looks almost the same as an orc pawn! My guess is they arent far 
    off. I'll just go over there and WHACK!</p>
  <p align="left"> LOADING, PLEASE WAIT........</p>
  <p align="left">OK, now I know what to do. Orcs are bad, I won't touch another 
    one ever again. But fairies are OK! Wow, look, look at all those willowisps 
    all gathered together! There must be, let's see, seven! My my, they're only 
    little balls of light! They can't hurt a big, bad Wood Elf Druid like me! 
    Let's just run over there with my newly reaquired Worn Great Staff and WHACK! 
  </p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...... </p>
  <p align="left">OK, screw Wood Elves, You can't be any good magic-user with 
    them anyway. Oh, look, I can be a Dark Elf! My, they look cool.... Oh, look, 
    I'm out of Neriak (how'd that happen?), kill kill kill in the Nektulos forest, 
    and look at that High Elf Paladin coming over here! My my, he looks of high 
    level, wonder if he might want to group with a Dark Elf Necroma........</p>
  <p align="left"> LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....... </p>
  <p align="left">Screw elves altogether. Let's go with...... Hmmmmm, Erudite's 
    look interesting, they are good magic-users and I get to be tall and inteligent! 
    OK, It's night, I completed the required first quest, let's just wander around 
    Toxxulia in the pitch black night without a lantern and....... </p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT..... LOADING, 
    PLEASE WAIT....... and so on, and so on.......</p>
  <p align="left"> OK, I'm human, I'll be a human, a barbarian, a shaman! Yeah! 
    And I'll just swim to get the heck out of Halas, I wonder if swimming's the 
    same as walking..... </p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...... </p>
  <p align="left">OK, let's see, I'll still be human, a Wizard, in Qeynos! Oh, 
    look, sewers!! I've never been in these before! Just stay away from the rats, 
    they're ugly anyway and, I wonder what this rat king guy is and..... </p>
  <p align="left">LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....... </p>
  <p align="left">OK, back to my roots as a Wood Elf. Lets see, I'll still be 
    a druid, I think I learned my lesson. Oh, look at this nice man! He's offering 
    to teleport me to the Desert of Ro for only ten platinum! I've never been 
    there before! Whoosh! Oh, I wonder what this place is! It dosen't look like 
    any desert to me, that's for sure. It says the Plane of Sky. Hmmmmm, funny. 
    But look at the pretty dragon! I'll just see if I can ride it and.......</p>
  <p align="left"> LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...... </p>
  <p align="left">You get the idea. These were the thought going through my head 
    (eek). Go ahead, laugh, it was my death....... lol.</p>
