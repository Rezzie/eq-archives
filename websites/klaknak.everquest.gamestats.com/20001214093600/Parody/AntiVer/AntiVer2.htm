  <p><font size="4">Inside the Developer's Studio - by the Cackling Klaknak</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">[Editor's Note: I posted this right after Verant nerfed most 
    of the profitable trade skills. In the cackling klaknak's estimation, Brad's 
    blind obsession with the player driven economy is EQ's potential fatal flaw. 
    I have to admit that I am extremely harsh with Brad in this parody, so I am 
    compelled to add that I think he has done an incredible job with this game 
    and he and his team are to be commended. However, his dedication to the player 
    run economy has all the intelligence of blunt force trauma.]</p>
  <p align="left">We would like to take this time to dedicate a special section 
    to Verant. Although, to our minds, Everquest has been a fairly well run game 
    to this point, we feel that the latest shenanigans in the hills of Verantia 
    have sunk ... nay ... have sunken to new lows in the annals of idiocy. To 
    wit, the editor's will provide, for the first time, an inside look into the 
    inner workings of the Verant's development meetings followed by several, special 
    idiot files.</p>
  <p align="left">[Editor's note: idiot files not included (yet)]</p>
  <p align="left"> Brad: Ok, everyone let's get to work. First, let us open with 
    a prayer, and then everyone introduce themselves. Jesse.</p>
  <p align="left">Jesse Jackson: Thank you. Brad. Let us pray. O Lord please hear 
    our cry, as we make a better game try. Be with us as we pray for Appalachia, 
    be with us as we consume pharmacopoeia. Protect us from the irate customer's 
    phlegm, for only we know what is truly good for them. Amen.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Amen. Let's introduce ourselves. My name is Brad, and 
    I serve the Dark Lord.</p>
  <p align="left">Three legged mule drunk on cheap scotch: I am in charge of the 
    player run economy.</p>
  <p align="left">A Spoon: Hi, I am a spoon. I am in charge of the trade skills.</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Buck: Hello, I am Tom in charge of marketing.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Ok, good. Now. Who brought the ether?</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Buck: Gotcha covered. <everyone snorts ether></p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Ok, first of all, as you all know, I have a huge inferiority 
    complex because .... Bwaaaaaaaaaa ... </p>
  <p align="left">Three legged mule: bwaaaaaaa ...</p>
  <p align="left">A spoon: Bwaaaaaaa ...</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Bwaaaaa ... great ...  ether, man ...</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Buck: Bwahhhhh ... <jesse jackson tries to pull his pants over head></p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Can't ... concentrate ... who ... brought ... am ... pheta 
    ... mines..</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Buck: Bwaaaaaaa ... <everyone takes amphetamines></p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Heh heh. Turnips. Anyway, as you ... no kidding, man ... 
    have you ever actually seen a turnip? It's like... heh heh ... it's like this 
    little purple man ... <brad begins to pantomine></p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Hi, everyone! I am turnip man! Heh heh. Don't eat me! 
    I'm not tasty!</p>
  <p align="left">Mule: Bwahhhh...</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Buck: Pants...</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Ok, but seriously. As everyone knows, I have a huge inferiority 
    complex because Lord British philosophically changed the face of roleplaying 
    and all I have done is create a simple hack and slash game. Now ... bwaahhhh 
    ... excuse me ... now, remember people, the key here is NOT to ensure the 
    customer has fun, but to ensure my legacy as a chief game designer.</p>
  <p align="left">Bill Clinton: Right on!</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Thanks, Bill. Anyway, without a legacy, I will not be 
    able to get angry at Verant over some silly thing and leave in a huff, taking 
    millions of more dollars from another gaming company.</p>
  <p align="left">A spoon: Oh, a turnip! Heh heh. I get it</p>
  <p align="left"> Brad: Now, since I am not very creative, I have decided that 
    a player run economy is going to be my legacy. Mule, what are the numbers?</p>
  <p align="left">Mule: Well, 98% of the customers think the player run economy 
    idea sucks.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Good... good... that means this is cutting edge stuff. 
    What do the 2% say?</p>
  <p align="left">Mule: They say it is realistic and that you are a god.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Ah, excellent. What are their names?</p>
  <p align="left">Mule: Limp Spigot and JoMamasTwat.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Excellent. Make them GMs. So....how do we make this player 
    run economy work?</p>
  <p align="left">a spoon: Well, for one thing, we need to make all trade skills 
    unprofitable.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: I see.</p>
  <p align="left">a spoon: And then ... and this is the genius part ... we make 
    it so that the only things players can make, no one wants.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: But how does that help the player driven economy?</p>
  <p align="left">a spoon: Dude, it is so clear.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Hmmm ... I need more drugs. Did someone bring anything 
    else?</p>
  <p align="left">Jesse Jackson: I brought some battery acid.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Ah, good. <everyone sniffs the battery acid fumes></p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Bwaaaaaaaaaaaa.</p>
  <p align="left">a spoon: Bwaaaaaaaaa.</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Ah, now I see ... it's pure genius. It's like, you know, 
    that new coke thing. Create a product no one wants and then sell it! Excellent.</p>
  <p align="left">Tom Buck: Pure postmodern neoSmithianism with a retroactive, 
    zero sum supply side rotisserie chicken. </p>
  <p align="left">Mule: Bwaaaaaaa ...</p>
  <p align="left">Brad: But, if we nerf, say, pottery, wont some people exploit 
    it by buying prepatch sketches and selling them post patch?</p>
  <p align="left">Mule: Yeah, so what. It's so radical, you will have other companies 
    knocking your door down to hire you.</p>
  <p align="left"> Brad: Excellent. This calls for more drugs. <the crew snorts kaleeats twinkies and free bases clorox></p>
  <p align="left">Brad: Bwahhhhhhhhh</p>
  <p align="left"> a spoon: Bwahhhhhh.</p>
  <p align="left"><a young intern runs in>intern: Sir, sir! We have asked people 
    to play on a server we are testing, but no one is obeying our command!</a></p>

    all the servers ... tell the idiots it is something wrong with ... the Cerf
