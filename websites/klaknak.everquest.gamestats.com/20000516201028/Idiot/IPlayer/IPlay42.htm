  <p>Lying is Wrong! Wrong I Tells Ya! - by Lleana</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I play a Wood elf Bard on Solusek Ro named Lleana. Most of the 
    time, I go out of my way to help people when I can, but sometimes (okay, lots 
    of times), I have to deal with some real morons. Guys that ask me to find 
    their bodies and after a hour long search, they ask if I can spare 10 pp? 
    I'm sure you've met a few. So, I've found a way to avoid them when people 
    for whatever reason have put me on their /friend list, and send me random 
    tells asking me to help find their friend's body, or they need my songs for 
    this that or the other. I was actually tickled to find that it showed up on 
    your top ten list. Whenever my group is sitting and healing or whatever, and 
    I get these annoying /tells, I usually tell them "Sorry, in a big fight", 
    and maybe add in some typos to make it look real. "sorrry, figghting..." Well, 
    one day, this guy that's been annoying me with alarming regularity sends me 
    a tell while my group is waiting on some monsters to spawn. Not wanting to 
    deal with him, I send a quick tell. "Busy, big fight.." And while panning 
    around to see how my teammates are doing, who do I see? You got it. He was 
    standing right behind me, watching me twiddle my thumbs. He sends a curious 
    tell, "Oh really?" One of my most embarrasing moments ever, I had no idea 
    what to say, but I haven't heard from him since. Thank goodness for small 
    miracles and gigantic embarrasments. Jamye (Lleana)</p>
