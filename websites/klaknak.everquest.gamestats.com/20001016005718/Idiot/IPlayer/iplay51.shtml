  <p align="center">The worst high level idiot story - by Ailisha, high elven 
    magician</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">81 people in Sol B, 92 in Lguk including those waiting. I decide 
    to head over the the OOT to see if the seafuries are camped, three groups 
    of casters and a waiting list. Hmmmmm well guess the last thing to try is 
    the butcherblock dwarves.</p>
  <p align="left"> I arrive at butcherblock, two druids kiting the four "Kaladim 
    Citizens" dwarves at the docks (I found this out when I took one only for 
    a druid to unhide and tell me he's pacing the spawns). I sigh and head over 
    to the fishing village. I counted TWELVE people waiting on three dwarf spawns. 
    Mostly druids, a few tanks and one magician. With twelve people and three 
    spawns (not including the guy who gives bad guard faction) the dwarves are 
    no longer great experience. There were also two guys sitting beside waiting 
    on a list. </p>
  <p align="left">I head over to the stones, usually the least favourite place 
    to kill dwarves since they have a long spawn time. I see a human necro there. 
    GREAT! we can share. She seems to be LD so I take one with no problem, killed 
    it in about two shots. Pet barely scratched. The necro comes back just as 
    the other one pops, she takes it on but half way through she goes linkdead 
    again. I finish it off. All this time the dwarves have been fairly easy to 
    beat (blue to 45). </p>
  <p align="left">We chat for a bit when she comes back, then another one pops 
    up. I take this one, then I lag. Now it gets worse. When my packet loss drops 
    from 70% to 20 ish, I see "You do not have a pet to command", half my hps 
    gone and a very angry dwarf pummelling me. Necro is linkdead *sigh*. I try 
    casting on it but my spells are interrupted, as I start making a run the necro 
    comes back and starts blasting it, it kills me with a sliver of health then 
    kills the necro (as she'd lost her pet). </p>
  <p align="left">I am bound in FREEPORT! I am also KOS in freeport. I bound right 
    next to the fisherman in Freeport so I quickly invis myself and walk back 
    to the docks, sit down and begin waiting for the boat. From this whole experience 
    I've realised that guards and NPC's will see your invis if you're sitting 
    down. Anyhow all of a sudden guards and olunea militin start attacking me, 
    I jump into the water and hit /q (since the guards take the long way around) 
    and avert death. </p>
  <p align="left">I relog in, invis myself, swim back to shore and repeat the 
    process. Sure enough the guards get me again as I sit down. Repeat, I avert 
    death again. I am now down to a quarter health. I limp back to the fisherman, 
    invis again, then sit down under the docks. I hear guards shouting. Then all 
    four are suddenly in front of me. I hit /q. When I come back, I am level 44. 
    *sigh*. After logging in as a newbie and asking a huge favour from a friend 
    to port me out, I finally collect my corpse. The necro is still there and 
    we decided we want revenge.</p>
  <p align="left"> Revenge! Necro positions herself behind the dwarf on the right 
    and I in front of the one one the left. We start casting, I fizzle and she 
    pulls both out of range from my spells. My pet is still on "/pet sit" and 
    has not followed me. After retrieving my pet and sending it to attack the 
    dwarves, I see the necro feign but it fails on one of the dwarves which attacks 
    her. She dies. I gate. After corpse recovery, we try again. This time she 
    positions herself to the side. She kites one away and I focus on one. My pet 
    dies again (this has never happened before tonight). We die shortly after. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">We both log out from frustration (I am now two thirds of a bub 
    from 45) and I come back several hours later and kill dwarves for the whole 
    night. With the help of an enchanter friend and another to refresh our sows, 
    I regain all of my lost experience. I gate back to Felwithe and sell all the 
    loot, a newbie I'd given bronze armor to wants me to duel him so he can twink 
    his enchanter (with cloth). Anyhow we go up to a room in the armor shop beside 
    the bank. I forget that there are thick patrols of guards outside and in their 
    eyes, there are no such things as walls. Somehow we managed to duel long enough 
    for me to kill him with my pitiful 1h blunt skill. The minute he dies, guards 
    burst into the room and start hacking away at me, I try to escape but I'm 
    met with an entire regiment at the door. I die.</p>
  <p align="left"> I am cut down in my own city, and have lost half the experience 
    for the whole night. I am now barely hanging onto 45, feeling sick and shouting 
    feebly for an exp res in Felwithe. After a few minutes of this I am tired 
    and log out. I con some merchants and the banker as I logout, they con apprehensive. 
    WHEN did this happen?? I have a sneaking suspicion I'll be KOS in my own city 
    soon.</p>
  <p align="left"> I think you can all gather the reason why if I'll be away for 
    quite a long while :(</p>
