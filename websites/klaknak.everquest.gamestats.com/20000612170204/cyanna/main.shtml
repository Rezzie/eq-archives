        My boss told me he had a new project for me. I told him ‘I already am 
        working on a project. Which is more important?’ He said 'Can you spend 
        100% of your time working on one of them and 100% of your time on the 
        other?'<br>
        <p>I said ‘Sure. All I need is a clone, a time machine, or a shift in

  <p>Hello again, all. Sorry I have not updated lately, but I have a new boss 
    so I actually have to work again. To make up for a lack of updates, here is 
    a bonus Sarcastic Quote of the Day:</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <i>I have a friend who is recently married who we will call ‘Andrew’. 
      Before he was married he was a very wild part guy. He went out with a lot 
      of women and during his dating ‘slumps’ he would fill the time with professional 
      help, if you know what I mean. After he got married, he and his wife moved 
      close to where we live and we all started going out a lot. He said he told 
      his wife about all the women he dated but that he did not tell her about 
      the prostitutes and made me swear never to tell too. It has been very hard 
      to keep this secret since I have gotten very close to his wife and consider 
      her a good friend.</i></p>
    <p><i> Last month we all went to the zoo together. While in the gift shop 
      we saw they had large stuffed animal butts mounted on the wall in a kind 
      of parody of the mounted heads you see everywhere in redneck country where 
      I live. They even had a giant stuffed elephant butt. His wife looked at 
      the price tag and she could not believe that it cost 200 dollars. Before 
      I could stop myself I said ‘That’s nothing. Andrew has paid more than that 
      for a piece of ass.’ </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For those of you who visit the Official Everquest messageboards, you will 
    notice that they are filled with horror stories of abusive GM’s. This is not 
    one of those stories. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>The other day my group was hunting in SolA killing goblins and gnome 
      clockworks (sorry fellow nuggets). Some of the clockworks do a force shock 
      that can throw you around. Since we were fighting in an area surrounded 
      by lava, this is not a good thing. After the first time I got throw into 
      molten lava, we decided it best if the tanks had levitate on them. The very 
      next battle, I was hit by a force shock. My screen went all screwy and I 
      started getting messages that I was being killed by molten lava. I tried 
      to move, but I could not. My friends cast 5 greater heals but none of them 
      affected me. In short order I died. I talked to my friends as I started 
      my run back and they all said, I never left the platform and that they could 
      all see me just standing there but no spells worked on me. Being that I 
      am in a hell level and the exp I lost was many hours worth of hunting, I 
      petitioned a GM. I had heard many horror stories so I was all set to be 
      angry. In less than 5 min, I got a response from a GM, Sparrowhawk to be 
      exact. He talked to my party members that were on the scene and saw that 
      I died from lava but my body was lying on solid ground. In less than 5 more 
      minutes, I got a res. He was friendly, fast, and nice. In all, I died from 
      a bug and was back fighting with my group in about 15 min. I want to say 
      thanks, Sparrowhawk, you are a good guy! </i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thanks everyone for the responses to the Stupid Topic. My mailbox was inundated 
    with hilarious responses and <a href="stupid.shtml">here they are</a></p>
  <p>I hate stupid people. I hate stupid inflexible rules. As promised here is 
    a story of <a href="brain.shtml">something that makes me mad</a>.</p>
  <p>This was supposed to be a timely humor piece about computer viruses, but 
    it sat on my hard drive for far too long. Oh, well. Here it is anyway. <a href="../klakboard/klak09.shtml">Everquest 
    Computer Viruses</a></p>
