  <p align="center">Snake vs. Nagafen - by BadHeat</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> My friends and myself were standing about one day at a lunch 
    break, discussing the who's and what's of various tidbits of information. 
    As usual, the conversation turned to everquest, where i began to describe 
    my hair brain scheme at the easiest way to kill Lord Nafagen with only 10 
    lvl 50's. As usual, my friends laughed and poked fun at me, Until they began 
    to see there was some valitidy to my ideas, and of course added upon them 
    (with wild saracastic and joking manners). Until we finally came up with a 
    way to Kill lord Nafagen with Behold: An enchanter, and a snake. </p>
  <p align="left">The basic premis goes as follows. A certain wandering lvl 40ish 
    player is with a group hunting near nafagen's lair. Unfortiniatly, the lvl 
    40ish player is summoned to nafagen, whom then procedes to hit him for "An 
    ungodly amount of damnage that can't be measured". Because of the fact Nafaged 
    just whooped up on some idiot player, and because he probally swipes for more 
    than 2 of the players health bars, the extra damnage had to be 're-directed' 
    throughout the game so that the server wouldn't crash. (Hey, don't look at 
    me, it's the way the programmers made it) </p>
  <p align="left">Anyhow, Somewhere in freeport, a lvl 2 bard is soloing a small 
    snake.</p>
  <p align="left"> a Snake bites YOU for 3 points of damnage<br>
    YOU slash a snake but MISS!<br>
    a Snake bites YOU for 3 points of damnage <br>
    YOU slash a snake for 4 points of damnage<br>
    a Snake bites YOU for 3425360 points of damnage <br>
    YOU have been slain by a snake! </p>
  <p align="left">Can you picture the exact moment that Nafagen slammed the lvl 
    40 through the dirt? Anyhow, the bard, bewilderd and confused, runs to his 
    corpse. After looting his equipment he asks a lvl 24 Enchater running by to 
    con the snake, and see what it says. The Enchanter replies "red" and they 
    both figure it's just a glitch. So, the bard once again engages in battle. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">AUTO ATTACK ON <br>
    YOU slash a snake for 3 points of damnage. <br>
    a Snake bites YOU for 43635262 points of damnage. </p>
  <p align="left">The enchater now standing amazed gawks at the snake. Still conning 
    red, the enchater decides to see this again. He bribes a lvl 7 player with 
    10 pp to fight that very same snake. </p>
  <p align="left">A snake bites Joytise for 7362637 points of damnage. </p>
  <p align="left">The enchanter sits,.. thinks, and then grins to himself with 
    an awsome idea. He steps from side to side, around the snake.. and when finally 
    finding a good angle, he charms it. Thankfully, the charm holds, as the snake 
    is still lvl 3, even though it hits for f*ck-load of damnage. The enchater 
    then takes the snake with him, moving from zone to zone, until he finally 
    reaches Nafagen's lair.. Of course, he is teleported in by nafagen, wherest 
    the snake follows. At the first attack of Nafagen on lvl 24 Enchter, the snake 
    bites nafagen. </p>
  <p align="left">Lord Nafagen crushes a snake, but MISSES! <br>
    a Snake Bites Lord Nafagen for 73626229 points of damnage!<br>
    Lord Nafagen Crushes a snake, But MISSES!<br>
    a Snake Bites Lord Nafagen for 37326727 points of damnage!<br>
    Lord Nafagen has been slain by a Snake! <br>
    YOU GAIN EXPERIENCE! <br>
    *ding* Welcome to level 50! </p>
  <p align="left">So, as you can see, our plan works perfectly. Muahha. Anyhow, 
    we, being loyal klacknak readers thought it would humor the klacknak to hear 
    our ramblings. And, prehaps try them ;) hehe.</p>
