        <p align="center">Day One</p>
        <p> Ok, my husband, a 30 cleric, and I a 31 druid decide to go to Freeport. 
          I port us over to WC and he's sees a Sand Giant. I decide to conn it 
          for kicks. "Hey it's Yellow!!!" and I snare it. Well after using every 
          bit of mana that both of us have AND a bit of medding in turns with 
          clarity we kill it. RAHHHHHHH our first giant. He decides to go to bed. 
          Not me man, I'm gonna kill giants. So I run around the zone looking 
          for more giants. "There's one now" Snare "Your target has resisted ensnare" 
          Huh? "Oh it's red, well no prob i'll keep trying" "Your target has resisted 
          ensnare" , A Sand Giant hits YOU for 110 point of damage, A Sand Giant 
          hits YOU for 110 point of damage, "Owwwwwwwwww" Ok I'll run and try 
          to snare. A Sand Giant hits YOU for 97 points of damage, You are stunned, 
          repeat until... </p>
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <br>
          You are now level 30. </p>
        <p>Aurgh!!!!!!! Well one kill on a Sand giant should fix that. So I port 
          back to West Commons and find a giant. (see above) </p>
        <p>Ok Tesh Mas Gnolls to get my level back *sigh* After a couple hours 
          killing Gnolls I'm 31 again and I go to bed...no need to tell my husband 
          how stupid I am. </p>
        <p align="center">Next Day</p>
        <p> Ok today I find my husband playing his 22 Necro and soloing in Unrest. 
          Cool I think to myself. If we can get him a few levels then we can go 
          kill Giants. "Want help?" "Sure" Two hours later and he is 23. Now he's 
          ready for sleep. I'll just stay up and play for a bit. Lemme see if 
          I scoot my chair fast enough I should be able to play both characters. 
          Ok first pull. A dark bone. Well that was easy. After an hour of this 
          it's time for the Druid to go sell. I'll bind here in the courtyard 
          and go sell. 2p 7g for a bronze mace...His stupid pet is fighting lawn 
          trash...1p 3g for this ringmail...I wish his pet would kill that dumb 
          thing...Hmmm, what else do I have on me to sell...Why is his computer 
          so quiet...Oh %$!@ LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. Ok I can get him his exp back... 
          This is going well, he's gotten his exp back and I'm hungry. I'll just 
          sit us both against the wall and get something to eat. Back I come hands 
          full and feeling good.</p>
        <p> LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <br>
          LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <br>
          You are now level 30. </p>
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... <br>
          You are now level 22. <br>
          LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... </p>
        <p>Oh no!!!!!!!!! I forgot both of us are bound inside. Run!!!!!!!!! Ok 
          I'll just get his level back and go to bed. Maybe he'll think I lost 
          my level being heroic and saving him. No need to tell the whole story... 
        </p>
        <p align="center">DAY 3 </p>
        <p>Back to those stupid Gnolls for 31 again. Ok that went well. Maybe 
          I should pad my level a bit this time. Hmm...I snared a giant with no 
          problems when I was 31 before, I should be able to do it now. Off to 
          North Karana I go. /shout anyone have a loc on a Hill Giant? Great! 
          I found one. Snared RAAAAA!!! Now here goes. Blast, Run, Blast, Run, 
          Blast "this Rocks!" Insufficient mana to cast that spell... A Griffin 
          hits YOU for 87 points of damage. YOU are stunned. A hill Giant hits 
          YOU for 107 points of damage. Repeat until... </p>
        <p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT <br>
          You are now level 30. </p>
        <p>Will I ever learn? </p>
