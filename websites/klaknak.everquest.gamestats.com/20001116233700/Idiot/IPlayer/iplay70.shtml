      <blockquote> 
        <p>I have a few idiot stories, some very recent, so I figure i'll throw 
          em out into the open. My main characters is a Level 24 High Elf Paladin. 
          Where to start... 
        <p>My Paladin, Aliester Silverleaf was wandering through Freeport for 
          the first time, I was so low level I didn't even know what Bind Affinity 
          was (I assumed the home point was permanent or something). I play around 
          in this big new city for a while and decide to go home to Felwithe. 
          I get lost and I stumble on the bad part of town, and get attacked by 
          a beggar because "Paladin's like you really bring the worst out in me" 
          no biggie, I con him he's blue. I proceed to beat the crap out of him 
          when the guards come and destroy me quickly. LOADING....PLEASE WAIT 
          Okay,bad idea,don't defend myself next time,just run. I get on the boat 
          > and go back to Freeport only to get my corpse and go right back home 
          (because I didnt know about poor man's teleport back then), so after 
          wandering a little I find my corpse by the beggar ,I go to get close 
          enough to drag it and I get too close to the beggar, and he starts attacking 
          again. No big deal I think, I'll just let the guards kill him, and if 
          they don't do anything he's hitting for piss damage. Next thing I know 
          "Guard Butthole hits you for too much damage Returning to home point" 
          As you can imagine this went on for a while. 
        <p><center>* * *</center></p>
        <p>Another more recent story:<br>
          My other characters I play on the side are a Wizard and a Necromancer, 
          what item does everyone want to get for their caster? Stein of Moggok 
          of course, +10 INT alone is nice, plus the other perks. A good RL friend 
          of mine is a level 12 Dark Elf enchanter, so we go to run the quest 
          together (I help with mules, and because she dosnt know the territory 
          on the west coast well) this should be easy right. As we're walking 
          to the Qeynos Hills zone in NK an Iksar necro auctions that she wants 
          to buy certain words, and I just so happened to have quite a few of 
          them. She asked to meet me near the barbarian fishing village, no biggie 
          backtrack make some bucks. Now my friend was invisible the whole trip 
          so mobs wouldnt attack, but wasnt using illusions after a while assuming 
          safety, as we get to the fishing village I go to find this necro, and 
          her invis fades before she can get away and Ulrich and company begin 
          to pound her brains out, I do the noble Paladin thing and I Lay Hands 
          her hoping it will raise her HP enough to get her speed back to normal 
          so she can run away, well she dies, and I think oh crap, she was bound 
          in Freeport, long wait... then Ulrich and the boys come back for me... 
          yes in my noble deed of blowing my LH I forgot that would aggro the 
          barbs... LOADING PLEASE WAIT... I was bound in Kelethin... shit. We 
          eventually do everything we need to do, and I make a human mule in FP 
          to lead her to Oggok (kept invis of course). As we get into Oggok after 
          this long hard trip we go to the barkeep and give him the book. And 
          I say "did you get it?" and she says "No." and I say "What the hell 
          happened!!! Did you forget to alliance him" and she replied "No... I 
          forgot the stein was a lore item... I already had one" DOH! All that 
          for nothing! 
        <p>We go make another stein attempt a few days later, and something funny, 
          not stupid just funny and bloody lucky happens. We're in Rivervale (needless 
          to say she has an illusion on) and we're standing by the bank waiting 
          for a newbie halfling to come with some honeycombs we auctioned we wanted 
          to buy, when my friend dosnt reply to something I say... so I ask the 
          question again... no reply... Kirasallee has gone Linkdead. Oh my God!!! 
          LD by the Deputies, when she logs in they'll kill her (the illusion 
          of course goes down when you zone or log). I'm waiting for the worst, 
          when out of nowhere the deputies disappear... what? run around the zone 
          a bit very quickly and notice all the NPCs are gone. Apprantly they 
          were resetting the zone without warning. Kira logged back in, noticed 
          the missing deputies and cast Illusion: Human as quick as is possible. 
          Whew, that's what you call a close one.

        <p>A final story, because this is long enough as it is:<br>
          I'd just hit level 24 fighting Icy Orcs in Everfrost in a group with 
          some people, and a few guildmembers. I'd been planning to go to Freeport 
          and play around in Upper Guk for a while (I hadn't ever been there and 
          knew the frogs wouldn't care, and I wanted to scout the place out... 
          Ghoulbane after all is in there). So I hear that DING! Kill a few more 
          orcs for the road and head off. As I'm zoning into North Karana, nature 
          calls in the worst way, so I run run run to the stone bridge at the 
          SK zone and climb pretty high up the stairs and assume i'll be safe 
          there... I go to the bathroom. I come back and notice i'm staring at 
          a wall, which I had been before... and then I notice something else 
          weird... my spells aren't memorized... and there's a message a little 
          way back saying "You have entered Halas" Doh! Something killed me somehow. 
          Needless to say I was pissed because I lost my level, I scroll back 
          a ways and see that someone trained a hill giant inside the tower part 
          of the bridge and it attacked me while the guards pounded away at him. 
          I'm very pissed, and I walk to NK again. I get the corpse and go into 
          South Karana to fight some aviaks to get the level back, easy right? 
          Well, I want the level back fast so I don't try to group, i'll just 
          solo blues. It seemed to be taking forever so I ask if anyone is willing 
          to meet me at the ramp to the city, I said i'd pay for a breeze or clarity. 
          Well to my luck a good friend from my guild was in the zone and she 
          came and breezed me. I was soloing a low blue darter when a rook spawned 
          and attacked too, no big deal, I had full mana, the darter was nearly 
          dead and I still had Lay Hands. So the darter dies, and I hop of the 
          city and back away so no more spawn on top of me. My guildmate takes 
          this as meaning I need help, so she fries the chicken and it comes after 
          her. I could have handled it I think, but wasnt sure, and she proceeds 
          to fight it. Out of nowhere another rook spawns. It starts pounding 
          her, now an enchanter can't handle being smacked around by two blue 
          cons, so I get the other off her. She nearly dies and I use lay hands. 
          She's still getting beat around pretty bad so she fears one and runs 
          to Rathe. I stay and fight the one Ihad and it dies. DING Welcome to 
          Level 24!! YES!!! I got my level back and I could sleep! She sends me 
          a tell saying run, the other one is coming back anytime. Being cocky 
          I assume I can take it, so I start fighting this rook, and he's hitting 
          me harder than a rook has ever hit me. So I go to root him... resist... 
          damn... root again... success, and I go to run he gets a hit off and 
          reduces me to the point I can't move quickly. I get away some and try 
          to heal. Out of mana... try to run... Your Root Spell Has Worn off. 
          LOADING PLEASE WAIT. You have LOST a level. You are now level 23. DAMMMMIIIIITTTT!!!!!! 
        <p>Well, that's a big batch of moronic stories for you, I've got more 
          where that came from too, just too damn tired now. Don't even ask about 
          corpse retrieval in the mino caves... does Meldrath say anything?
