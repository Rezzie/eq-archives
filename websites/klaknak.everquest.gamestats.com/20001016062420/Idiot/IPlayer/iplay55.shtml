  <p align="center">Keldeth and the 5 dwarves or How I got my corpse back - by 
    Keldeth </p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Well there I was, having finally reached level 7 on a glorious 
    Freeport morning. Feeling kind of down because things were getting either 
    too easy or still too hard, I enlisted the help of 5 dwarves. To protect the 
    innocent, (and to give my short bearded companions a laugh) I will call them 
    Dopey, Grumpy, Sleepy, Bashful and Doc. Four Dwarven Clerics and a dwarven 
    paladin. </p>
  <p align="left">We decided to do some hunting at the ruins in the East Commonlands. 
    Laying waste to skeletons, zombies and mummys (oh my!) we decided that we 
    needed something bigger, more exciting... a change of scenery. </p>
  <p align="left">Arriving at Befallen in the early evening, we went in feeling 
    confident. Killing skeletons and even taking on Skeleton Lrodd gave us an 
    even bigger boost. Level 8 was not far away for me. It was going very well. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">And then I did the incredibly stupid. I decided to take a look 
    down the well. When I realized what had happened, laying at the bottom of 
    a well, I realized that these nasty ice-boned skeletons were beating me to 
    a bloody pulp. So I did what any stalwart adventurer would do. I ran like 
    hell. </p>
  <p align="left">The next day, standing around naked in East Freeport, I shouted 
    out and found two of my dwarven friends and a couple other friends from previous 
    adventures. We set out for Befallen in an attempt to retrieve my body. The 
    plan was as follows: Go to the well, jump in, loot the corpse, and run like 
    hell to back to the top. We felt pretty good about our chances and jumped 
    in.</p>
  <p align="left"> Not a one of us survived in what had to be the biggest corpse 
    retrieval blunder of Norrath's history. Now there were 7 corpses at the bottom 
    of a well.</p>
  <p align="left"> Needless to say, my now less than thrilled saviors had friends 
    in high places, so to speak, who helped us get all of our stuff back, and 
    to them we are incredibly grateful. </p>
  <p align="left">The moral of the story: Don't go too near the well... that last 
    drop is a doozy. OR Ice-boned skeletons really don't enjoy company just dropping 
    in.</p>
