  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Answers Volume V - 2.3.00 </p>
  <p align="left">This issue of &quot;Arch-Mage Answers&quot; is all Bards, all 
    the time. Each question here was taken directly from our message boards. I 
    want to thank everyone who submitted the many hundred questions. I obviously 
    couldn't answer them all, but I think we got a pretty good sampling. And so, 
    without further ado </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: A few months after release, there was a speed cap put on 
    Selo's due to cheaters. Was this Intentional? <br>
    A: When our speed cap was put on, it was discovered that Bards with exceptional 
    magic drums were breaking the speed limit that we had set back in Beta. In 
    effect, they were moving faster then the fastest we ever planned for players 
    to move. So yes, the speed cap for cheaters brought their speed down a small 
    percentage. </p>
  <p align="left">Editor's note: we wouldn't want people to move around at a REASONABLE 
    pace, that would take the challenge out of the game.</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Charm limited to level 37 and below mobs. Our charm is already 
    very limiting, why the level limit? <br>
    A: We are very careful which classes we give charm to in EQ - so much so that 
    we actually removed the ability from some classes post Beta. Bards are the 
    only class, other then the Enchanter, which can charm all types of creature. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">We are currently kicking around another higher level Bard Charm 
    song for one of the empty level slots. If we do put it in, it will be different 
    from Solon's - but still cool </p>
  <p align="left">translation: we nerfed all the caster classes after beta, we'll 
    blow some smoke up your ass about a better charm song so that you stop annoying 
    us. </p>
  <p align="left">* * * </p>
  <p align="left">Q: A Bard's Dodge caps at 120, and they get no parry or riposte. 
    Why? (Class Balance is a fine answer, just checking) <br>
    A: Bards have much better, and much more unique, magical abilities then those 
    of any other Hybrid class. Because of this, their melee skills are not as 
    good as the typical Hybrid. Bards melee still better then any non-melee class 
    - their offense, weapon skills, hit points and two-weapon fighting are superior 
    to that of any priest or magi type. </p>
  <p align="left">translation: bards don't use mana, because of this their melee 
    skills suck ass. Bards melee better than wizards, they also get kewl fighting 
    animations.</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Using some Magic instruments, for example, the Darkwood Piccolo, 
    have no effect. <br>
    A: High Quality Instruments always bump up the effect of a song. Some songs, 
    however, don't have effects that can be bumped up - for example, Tarew's Aquatic 
    Ayre gives the ability to breathe water. Having a magical instrument will 
    not make you breathe water "better." The Piccolo, a wind instrument, has the 
    least number of songs that have effects which can be increased. Most Wind 
    songs tend to be all or nothing. </p>
  <p align="left">translation: we thought it would work, but after we spilled 
    coffee on the software for the piccolo before uploading it, we had to come 
    up with some bullshit effects fast to compensate.</p>
  <p align="left">* * * </p>
  <p align="left">Q: I have never seen a "Your target has resisted your attempt 
    to mesmerize it" while using lullaby, as per your post. When should I? <br>
    A: I believe that went in last patch. If not, it should be in this one. You 
    will see the resist message when your target resists your song. This not showing 
    was a display error - it should have been fixed long ago. It took a while 
    because when some of us (not all of us, just some) play, we use a version 
    of the client that provides more information/messaging. This lets us catch 
    a lot of bugs that most people might not see. It makes tracking down bugs 
    a lot easier, quicker, and more efficient. On the downside, it sometimes isn't 
    always easy to remember which messages everybody sees, one which only we see. 
    This was one of the few cases where too much information caused the problem.

  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Will twisting ever be coded against? I.e. is it considered 
    cheating? If it is, I definitely want to know about it now. <br>
    A: Twisting is not cheating. It won't be coded against. We are even looking 
    at putting a little something extra in to help the people with slower machines 
    twist better, while not allowing those with faster machines to twist more 
    often. </p>
  <p align="left">editor's note: the twist is my least favorite song of all time</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: The time it takes to memorize a song should be decreased. 
    <br>
    A: We put in some code last patch to help with that. </p>
  <p align="left">translation: now cheesy elevator music (previously cheesy olde 
    music) has been added to the spellbook to improve the chances of you going 
    off and doing something else while you memorize songs </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Why don't we know what instrument type songs take when we 
    look at them in our songbook? It's very frustrating when you do not remember 
    which instrument is used. <br>
    A: This is something we have planned to add for a while. New display code 
    should hopefully be going in some time soon. </p>
  <p align="left">translation: the fat guy that makes donut runs every five minutes 
    is working on it, he should be done by third quarter 2003. </p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: In the expansion, the level cap will be changed and we will 
    presumably get more songs. Will our bard singing skills have a higher skill 
    cap? For that matter, why are our bard skills capped at 200? Songs are our 
    lifeblood and an integral part of this class. <br>
    A: Almost every skill in EverQuest is capped at 200. There are, of course, 
    some exceptions - but the vast majority of EQ skills range from 1-200. That 
    being said, if the level caps go up, you can safely assume that Bard Skills 
    will increase with it.</p>
  <p align="left"> translation: those kewl wizards only get 200 EvOc, so you cant 
    get any l33t skillz either. </p>
  <p align="left">* * * </p>
  <p align="left">Q: Is there a reason why the Bard's mana song cannot be twisted? 
    Perhaps because of game balance again? <br>
    A: There is a common assumption that ALL Bard songs last for 3 "ticks." This 
    is not true. Many songs last for shorter and longer durations. The Bard's 
    mana song is one with a shorter duration. For more details, see Volume III 
    of the Arch-Mage answers. </p>
  <p align="left">editor's note: i fled the room at my cousin's wedding reception 
    when twist came on</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: While I understand the idea that Druidic and Shaman SOW effects 
    cannot be used indoors (I even understand the Journeyman boots), I don't understand 
    why the Bard running song not working indoors. <br>
    A: Game Balance. No spell or effect that speeds up a character will work indoors. 
    Period. </p>
  <p align="left">During Beta we found that indoor use of movement increasing 
    spells and songs led to trains on a massive scale. When we took out the movement 
    effect songs, the amount of trains happening in dungeons significantly decreased. 
    This was one, of many, reasons that we will never have movement increasing 
    spells or songs able to be cast in dungeons. </p>
  <p align="left">translation: if you don't have feign death your screwed</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: Denon's Desperate Dirge - is it really that "desperate?" 
    After all, the Bard does 300 damage to himself to do 300 damage to all MOBS 
    in a certain radius around him. That's really cool, except 300 damage is absolutely 
    nothing. Casters have been doing that since level 30, and Bards get a song 
    that does that at level 43. Plus, this one actually uses all the Bard's mana 
    so it's a one shot deal. <br>
    A: The 300 damage is only done if you target something near yourself - this 
    is an AoE song, and like all other AoE effects, if the caster stands too close, 
    they get hit with their own effect. Ask any Wizard. As for the amount of damage 
    dealt - Bards do not have large damage songs - their songs are more of a gradual 
    thing, dealing damage over time. This song breaks the rules for Bards - it 
    deals a large (for them) amount of damage instantly. This is why they can 
    sing it very infrequently (i.e. it takes up all their mana). </p>
  <p align="left">Bards were actually never intended to have any songs that took 
    mana. Using mana on this one was just a convenient way to mark off time for 
    how often they could use the song. </p>
  <p align="left">translation: bards should wait 30 minutes before doing 300 damage, 
    to do otherwise would be unbalancing</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: What kind of condiment taste best on Wood Elf Bards? <br>
    A: Around here, we go for barbecue sauce. To paraphrase one of the other game 
    designers, "it really brings out that nice smoky wood taste."</p>
  <p align="left"> editor's note: i'm so glad that these people don't run your 
    site </p>
  <p align="left">* * * </p>
  <p align="left">Q: You mentioned previously that adding an extra tick to bard 
    DoT songs would make them 50% more powerful. Why not simply add to the damage 
    each tick does instead? <br>
    A: Solid suggestion. </p>
  <p align="left">The reason that we did not increase the damage for Bard songs 
    is that, honestly, most Bards don't kite with their DoT songs. The Bellow 
    is an instant - so it is unaffected by movement / kiting. Chords and such 
    are good songs - but we do not want to increase the damage that they deal 
    every tick for the 5% or so of the time that movement might lower their damage.</p>
  <p align="left"> Bards are also the only class that can move and sing/cast a 
    song at the same time. Every other class must be standing still before they 
    can produce a magical effect. Increasing the damage done by Bard songs, purely 
    for purposes of making them even better Kiters, is against the spirit of the 
    reason that we put in the anti-kiting code in the first place. </p>
  <p align="left">editor's note: thou art a scurvy gnave, thou shalt repent for 
    taking away kiting!!</p>
  <p align="left"> translation: the nuggets of justice shall slay thee tallard!!</p>
  <p align="left">* * *</p>
  <p align="left">Q: In 82 days of play my most ingrained behavior is to switch 
    between weapons and instruments slowly and with the utmost care for fear of 
    dropping something. Will a yes/no confirmation window or an item drop toggle 
    be added to prevent us from dropping weapons? <br>
    A: We are looking into doing this. No promises, but, again, solid suggestion. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">BTW - 82 days? Very impressive. (And no, please don't everybody 
    e-mail me your played times - we love you all regardless of how many days 
    of play time you have). </p>
