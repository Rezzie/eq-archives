<p align="left">1. With any luck, the new POLL will be working. As you may or 
  may not know, Ralph Nike is in search of a new identity to play in Everquest. 
  He is now turning to you for help! (Ok, well, he is looking up into the sun 
  ... but ... he really is looking to you in a metaphorical kind of way.) So send 
  in them there votes!</p>
<p align="left">2. I am in the process of interviewing a GM over all this GM mess. 
  Stay tuned!</p>

  It vaguely simulates homosexual acts between a warrior and an evil priest so 
  if you can't deal with it, don't look at it. It will take a little time to load,

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">January 14, 2000</p>
<p align="left">1. I have a great many emails to wade through regarding the GM 
  thing, but I cannot promise I will get to them until after the weekend. I will 
  post as soon as I can. I need a nap.</p>
<p align="left">2. Here is something a little off-topic to keep you going. This 
  is a letter I sent to some of the guys at Gamestats about my trip to buy Half-Life 
  last night.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">Ok, I (the Cackling Klaknak) went to the gaming store. Here 
    is what<br>
    happened.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Oops, wait. First I went to Wal-mart to buy their Sam's Choice 
    peanut butter<br>
    cups. Reese's be damned, those Wal-mart things are the best food since McRib<br>
    sandwiches. I also bought a knit cap that makes my head look like an angry<br>
    red bulb.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">After Wal-mart I went to Babbage's and there, in all its glory, 
    was the<br>
    Adrenaline Pack. Here is what transpired.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">(note: I comment on a woman's butt; women readers beware)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Um, how much is this?</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Woman clerk (great butt): 69.95</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Uhhhhhh ....</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">WC: No, look. It is a great deal. You get all three. And Opposing 
    Force is<br>
    39.95 all by itself!</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Uhhh ... by that logic, you could sell me a pat of butter 
    and a scrap<br>
    of cloth for 20 bucks and claim it is a great deal because the scrap of<br>
    cloth sells separately for 18 bucks.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">WC: I dont follow.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Why the hell does this expansion pack cost so much?</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Hacker dude with Orange Hair: Dude, just get it off the internet 
    from some<br>
    sites I could give you (actual quote). The expansion is way too short. Not<br>
    worth that much. Wait until it comes down or get it off some sites.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Uhhhh ... Do you have 3-D JFK Hunter?</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">WC: No, we only have the Gerald Ford expansion pack.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Hmmmm ... Ok, I will just take the Half-Life Game of 
    the Year Edition</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">WC: Great game!</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Thanks ...</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">WC: It's cool ... (stares at me and smiles)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Joe: Ohmigod, you are only like ... 13 ... arent you? Crap, 
    I am so sorry I<br>
    looked at your butt.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">WC: That's ok. (she smiles)</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&lt;transmission truncated by FBI&gt;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the Gamestats people asked how I could have seen her butt if she was 
  behind the counter. They then, being the pigs that they are, dismissed my entire 
  story based on this _perceived_ discrepancy (hmmm ... I wonder if this is topical 
  after all?). </p>
<p>For those who know the Babbage's set-up, however, it is easy to see how I could 
  have seen her butt while she was behind the counter. See Figure One:</p>

<p align="left">1. Someone pointed out to me that it is now the year 2000. Someone 
  should have told me! And why won't my Microsoft Toaster work?!?!? And why is 
  my Microsoft Cat walking around in a turn-of-the-century petticoat?</p>
<p align="left">2. I want to compile several questions to ask a Senior Guide about 
  naming policies, GM behavior, player behavior, etc. Hopefully someone in the 
  know will answer them and I will post them here so that both sides of this whole 
  harrassment thing can be covered. So if you have a list of questions, send them 
  on.</p>
<p align="left">3. Also, a guide wrote to remind me that if you have any questions 
  or complaints about guides, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:eqcs@verant.com">eqcs@verant.com</a>. 
  You can also visit <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/">EQ Stratics</a> where Gordon 
  has posted a few comments on the recent hoopla.</p>
<p align="left">4. Verant has now clarified its naming policy, according to Gordon.

<p align="left">1. Several days ago, Patrick wrote that a GM had harrassed him. 
  Here is the whole <a href="Serious/Serious24.htm">story</a> (or as much as I 
  know). </p>

<p align="left">1. I am very sleepy right now because my bro called me last night 
  around 2am to say he thinks he is going bald.</p>
<p align="left">2. However, after I take a nap, I am going to hit this GM Harrassment 
  thing head on. I have received a lot of emails from parties who know about this 
  specific instance and I think the whole situation is a incredible microcosm 
  of Everquest as a whole. There is some good, there is some bad, and there is 
  a whole lot of ugly. Please please let me sleep and then I will update.</p>
<p align="left">3. The email should be working now! Check it out!</p>
<p align="left">4. Ok, one quick update to tide you over:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/Klakgroin.jpg" width="273" height="201"></p>
<p align="left">Thanks to Zargo! for giving me reason to hope. On a side note, 
  &quot;Zargo!&quot; is this guy's actual email name. Does anyone know if you 
  can have an exclamation point as part of your legal name? I think it adds a 
  certain profundity to a name ... it reminds people of Circus Freak Mind Readers 
  (The Great Zargo!) or laundry detergent. And that just can't be wrong.</p>

<p align="left">A few news tidbits:</p>
<p align="left">1. As you may have noticed, the site wasn't up. Allakhazam left 
  Gamestats and Gamestats removed my site because it was part of his (more a technical 
  snafu than a snub). We are now back up and I have no intention of leaving Gamestats. 
  I like Jeff and I like Gamestats. Sorry it is not more juicy than that.</p>
<p align="left">2. I have received several emails from various parties about the 
  GM harrassment. I can't post some of them because people would lose their jobs 
  if I did. They did, however, give me the authority to summarize their comments 
  which I will do in an article that I hope to post tomorrow. I think it is important 
  to remember that every person who talks about this story is doing so from one 
  perspective. This does not automatically mean that they are skewing the truth, 
  but it does mean that you should be aware of this when you read their comments. 
  I know you guys are smart, but I just wanted to pass that along.</p>
<p align="left">More tomorrow, guys. I apologize for all the crap recently.</p>
<p align="center">January 5, 2000</p>
<p align="left">Hello everyone. I'm Klaknak Twitty.</p>
<p align="left">1. I have a few off-topic things to say in the <a href="Joe/Joe.htm">Joe</a> 
  section concerning the recent gutting of a local internet business. I also get 
  all weepy.</p>
<p align="left">2. Someone sent me this (serious) <a href="Serious/Serious23.htm">story</a> 
  about their problems with a GM guide. I usually don't publish things like this, 
  but if it is true, it is just ... well, it is just one of the many reasons I 
  don't play EQ much anymore and one of the many reasons why I think MMRPGs are 
  descending into the pit of doofiness. If anyone knows anything else about this, 
  let me know. I just read Posner's anti-conspiracy JFK book and I am now paranoid 
  about evidence unless the purveyor has 5 or 6 confirmations. Heh heh. BTW, if 
  anyone wants to talk about that book, that would be cool too. I am just slap 
  happy off topic today. AND DON'T CARE. ahem. sedatives.</p>
<p align="left">3. After much cajoling (is that the right word? ribbing?) ... 
  um ... after some of my readers yelled at me, I have decided to republish the 
  <a href="Joe/Joe2.htm">page</a> my brother and I did during the Christmas holidays. 
  We partied, ate, cooked, and played some EQ one night (it was my bro's first 
  time) and here are the results. But here is a warning: IT IS NOT FOR YOUNGIN's 
  or the MORALLY STRICT. I honestly expect to get kicked off of Gamestats for 
  this one, although it is not my intention. I just hope they realize that kicking 
  people off their servers for talking about unspeaking acts and ketamine is ludicrous 
  when most of the games they praise and review involve gutting people and blowing 
  shit up. Why is it that talking about sex is immoral but talking about murder 
  isn't? Gosh, I dunno. Anyway, I am also REALLY interested to see all the hate 
  mail I will get. I hope to publish some of it, so if you don't want it published, 
  don't send it. Again, and I am being very serious here, if you are a Christian, 
  pro-Nixon, anti-drug and anti-sex you PROBABLY WILL BE OFFENDED so don't EVEN 
  BOTHER READING IT. Don't read it! I am serious! (sigh, you will read it)</p>
<p align="left">4. Here is an excellent <a href="Parody/AntiPlay/AntiPlay7.htm">submission</a> 
  by Richard S. It is .. the laws of newbieness. Great job!</p>
<p align="left">5. Geez, I had no clue how popular Ralph Nike was ... about one 
  out of every 5 emails is about it. Sigh. I am trying! Creativity is hard, man.</p>

<p align="left">For the Christmas special this evening, I will offer you what 
  Dick Clark could never offer: my drunken brother. He doesn't know much about 
  Everquest, but he understands ... life. And let's face it ... I have been off-topic 
  since day one. I refuse to be restrained by your ... nay, society's ... topic-ness. 
  And so, let's enter the realm of ... &lt;series cancelled due to lack of interest&gt;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">December 20, 1999</p>
<p align="left">1. Since I no longer speak off-topic (due to the overwhelming 
  number of negative emails on my personal views), I will not tell you about Saturday 
  night where I declared myself the Source of All Alpha Male-ness, drank tequila 
  shots with a Libertarian and a Catholic while we debated capital punishment, 
  abortion, and the IRA, and carried someone I barely knew out of the bar because 
  he was hitting on my friends' wives.</p>
<p align="left">2. Name the <a href="Phenom/Phenom.htm">phenomena</a>! Now! Or 
  else!</p>
<p align="left">3. Ahem, Zargon sent the following <a href="Parody/Stories/Stor20.htm">submission</a> 
  with this cryptic note:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Sorry about my last mail, I was a Tad bit drunk (tad as in Really really 
    : P), </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked through all of my email and couldn't find any drunken ramblings, which 
  leads me to believe that one of Zargon's ex-girlfriends received a really strange 
  email. Beware, Zargon ... they may seek judicial action. If they do, immediately 
  declare your alpha maleness and disappear into the woods in search of wild bears 
  and bongos.</p>

<p>2. Ok, <a href="Phenom/Phenom.htm">this</a> is not HA HA HA OHMIGOD I AM GONNA 
  SHIT MYSELF funny, but I think it clearly shows that for all of the wonderful 
  3-D technology out there, we still have a looooong way to go.</p>

<p>At this point I stopped because I was nearly crying in frustration. Would someone 
  please PLEASE translate this for me. Also, would someone please go over to EQ 
  Stratics and beat the hell out of them for posting such a piece of crap (note: 
  I am not commenting on the idea (whatever that may be), merely the &quot;style&quot;).</p>

<p align="left">1. Hey, here is a new thing. I need quotes of the day. All Klaknak 
  quotes of the day must:</p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p>example: &quot;Life is like a sand giant; it is big and stinky and it beats

<p>2. I have decided to try my level best to stay on topic, but there are some 
  things I must say, so I will take a page from Larry King's book and express 
  my opinion in a silly new <b>bold</b> format. Check out the <a href="Joe/Joe.htm">Joe</a> 
  section.</p>
<p>3. As I promised, more from Cyanna. Here is her Pulitzer Prize Winning short 
  story: &quot;<a href="Parody/Stories/Stor.htm">The Marxist Lovers of Simone 
  Q.</a>&quot; By the way, Cyanna's stuff really is funny as hell, doncha think?</p>

  proud of my stand but I also feel ... I dunno ... broke.</p>
<p align="left">2. As promised, EQ Porn. Now, I considered putting up lots of 
  warnings and whatnot, but instead I want you to choose what to do. I won't make 
  the moral choice for ya, babe ... it's your soul, not mine.</p>
<p align="left">So, the following ... the infamous following ... contains porn-like 
  references. If you are under 18 or if you think porn is wrong, do not read further. 
  I mean it. The next wholesome entry after the porn-like humor is a wholesome 
  picture of the wholesome Joseph Heller. Thanks to Shadis for the immortal ....</p>

<p align="center">December 14, 1999</p>
<p align="center">Today is dedicated to two very special people:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/heller.gif" width="102" height="131"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1">photo stolen from AP</font></p>
<p align="center">Joseph Heller = dead</p>
<p align="left">For those of you who think this is off-topic, forget-about-it. 
  Along with Monty Python, Douglas Adams and Ronald Reagan, Joseph Heller has 
  had the greatest impact on my humor (and the humor, no doubt, of countless others 
  who are far funnier and far more famous). Along with the people listed above 
  (and Carlin, Pryor and countless other), Heller showed a person can be both 
  intensely funny and intensely topical and intelligent at the same time. I think 
  Catch 22 (or Lolita by V.N.) may be the elusive Great American Novel. </p>
<p align="left">Anyway, he is dead.</p>
<p align="left">Here is an excerpt from his novel Catch 22:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;You mean there's a catch?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Sure there's a catch,&quot; Doc Daneeka replied.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't 
  really crazy.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified 
  that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and 
  immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. 
  All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy 
  and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions 
  and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them 
  he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had 
  to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause 
  of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;That's some catch, that Catch-22,&quot;he observed.</p>
<p align="left">&quot;It's the best there is,&quot; Doc Daneeka agreed. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/yodasatan.gif" width="159" height="147"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="1">photo of Cyanna stolen from some other site</font></p>
<p align="center">Cyanna Thunderhammer = funny</p>
<p align="left">1. The second dedication goes out to one of the Cackling Klaknak 
  stalwarts: Cyanna Thunderhammer. Even though we got off to a rough start when 
  I started stalking her through email, we soon developed a deep and meaningful 
  friendship within my own mind. It meant a lot to me. And so, without further 
  ado, some selections from Cyanna Thunderhammer.</p>
<p align="left">2. Top Ten madness (two additions): <a href="Topten/Topten.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p align="left">3. Some have claimed that the Klakboard is a haven of bitterness 
  and hatred. Anyway, here is a parody from Cyanna: <a href="Parody/Whine/Whine.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p align="left">4. I just realized that I misspelled her name in half the files. 
  But her email says Thunderhamer, I swear it. Sigh. I will fix it soon.</p>
<p align="left">5. That is all for today. Tomorrow: part 2 of Cyanna dedication 
  month and ... a little special something called EQ Porn.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">December 13, 1999</p>
<p align="left">1. Oh great, the dreaded Monday the 13th.</p>
<p align="left">2. Since I need a high paying job, I have included Stephen B.'s 
  <a href="Idiot/IPlayer/IPlay.htm">idiot</a> file. He works for ... ahem ... 
  one of the large computer empires. Yo, Stephen. Do you guys need any mental 
  health counseling and/or janitor work?</p>
<p align="left">3. Occasionally, in an attempt to maintain my not for profit status, 
  I must donate a certain amount of webspace to struggling artists. Today, in 
  the <a href="Phenom/Phenom.htm">phenomena</a> section, I feature Finbik who 
  uses dark overtones brushed lightly with pastel hues to comment on the instruments 
  of our own destruction. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">December 12, 1999</p>
<p align="left">1. A few of you have wondered if the person in the <a href="Joe/Joe.htm">Joe</a> 
  section is really me. Well, not really. As part of the new me, I have decided 
  to slowly divorce my personal life from this webspace ... so I will now be showing 
  real pictures of me from now on. Thanks.</p>
<p align="left">2. Here is a screenshot in the <a href="Phenom/Phenom39.htm">phenomena</a> 
  (doo doooo doo doo doo) <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/9991/index.html">phenomena</a> 
  (doo doo doo doo) section. It is obvious someone doctored this screenshot since 
  hammerhead sharks are mythical.</p>
<p align="left">3. Wow, that joke in #2 works on several levels. Let's study it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a. When you first read it, you say &quot;Wait, hammerhead sharks aren't mythical!&quot;</p>
  <p>b. Then you say, &quot;Oh but this is a screenshot from a mythical world, 
    so maybe hammerheads are mythical in that world&quot;</p>
  <p>c. But then you say &quot;But the comment was made in this world about the 
    mythical world. Oy!&quot;</p>
  <p>(I did spell phenomena, right?) </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">4. Whoa, the joke in #3 worked on several different levels.</p>
<p align="left">5. The following person had this to say about the taxi cab thing:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;CK- The Yellow Robe of Taxi Service is only offensive insofar 
  as it makes sweeping generalizations about a large group of people. Of course, 
  this is comedy at its best - distilling the confusion of reality into bite-size 
  chunks we can all understand. Besides, if we can't make sweeping generalizations, 
  what's the point of language? Oversimplifiedly Yours, -MB&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak responds: I never overgeneralize.</p>
<p align="left">[Special Multimedia addition: We are lucky to have with us the 
  immortal Bette Davis who will read the above letter in .WAV format. I have never 
  done this before, so please bear with the <a href="Images/davis.wav">suckiness</a>.]</p>
<p align="left">6. Someone took the time to write this excellent <a href="Parody/Songs/Song.htm">song</a>. 
  Consider this my nod to the Christmas season even though I didn't write it.</p>
<p align="left">7. Also, you might have noticed that this webpage has become a 
  little stranger. It is NOT because the website has changed authorship.</p>
<p align="left">8. I have just noticed that I have a microphone attached to my 
  computer and I simply cannot stop recording my voice. Please bear with me. This 
  phase will pass ... </p>
<p align="left">Many of you don't know that I auditioned for the part of EQ Stratics 
  DJ several months ago. Here is my unfortunate audition <a href="Images/davis01.wav">tape</a>.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">December 11, 1999</p>
<p align="left">1. As I type this, Murtough and Riggs (how the hell do you spell 
  Murtough?) just found out they were promoted to Captain.</p>
<p align="left">2. Proof once again that ... um ... crap ... just read this <a href="Idiot/IPlayer/IPlay.htm">idiot</a> 
  file. I have no wry comment to make.</p>
<p align="left">3. Brian B. wins the elusive &quot;When We Sucked&quot; award 
  for a stunning knowledge of Atlanta Braves trivia. Here is his response:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Me you and the guy sobbing over Bob Horner. You asked about 
  Claudell - didn't he play right field? Dale was in center (Did he get moved 
  from 1B?), then moved to right at some point - probably playing too much "Raiders 
  of the Lost Ark" on his Atari VCS. The only other outfielder that I think I 
  remember is Brett Butler played with us before jumping over to LA. I wish I 
  could remember all of them - Horner at second, I Don't know at Short, Glenn 
  Hubbard at Second, and Chris Chambliss at first, right? Raffy Rameriz was in 
  there somewhere but God I can't remember if he played the elusive short stop 
  or pitched. And remember Bruce - catcher I think. My first Braves game I went 
  to I thought everyone was booing him - bruuuuuuuuce (They probably were) Oh 
  and remember Paquel Perez? Mr. I-285? The Mad Russian Hobrasky (No spelling 
  points for him) relief pitcher and Mr. Knuckleball. That's about all I can do 
  - I was about 10 when I really started watching the lovable losers - so help 
  me with my walk down amnesia lane. On a game related note : Does Utlima 9 suck 
  or what? I think Origin and Microsoft got into a contest to see who could release 
  the crappiest game right before CHristmas. Cheers and Beers, &quot;</p>
<p align="left">Klaknak responds: I have a couple comments:</p>
<p align="left">a. Rameriz (cant spell) was shortstop and Bruce Benedict was catcher. 
  Pasquel Perez was an insane pitcher with some major character flaws who would 
  have never made it to the big leagues if he didnt have a 3000 mph fastball (gee 
  ... how many pitchers does THAT sum up?)</p>
<p align="left">b. Was Horner at second? I thought he was at 3rd and Hubbard 2nd, 
  but I cant remember. I was very young too. And it is not important enough in 
  life to find out.</p>
<p align="left">c. Ultima 9 sucks hard. I admire the graphics, but I hate the 
  bugs, the &quot;I am a moron&quot; interface and the dumbing down of the whole 
  series. I don't care what anyone else says (and I am sure many magazines will 
  sell out and claim it is a classic &quot;in spite of some minor bugs and incompatibilities&quot; 
  so they can kiss Garriott's ass some more (gee ... how many magazines and websites 
  does THAT sum up?).</p>
<p align="left">4. Here is a funny bit someone sent in. Is this offensive? I can 
  no longer tell:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Images/TaxiRobe.jpg" width="309" height="123"></p>
<p align="center"><i>The quest starts in Brooklyn by Hail-ing a Taxi. The driver 
  is a MOB named Mespeak Noenglish. He will tell you a sad story about how he 
  left his beloved Turban of Perpetual Meter Running in his homeland. (Might need 
  to put a couple of practice points in language skills to understand him.) You 
  will need to travel to back to his homeland (may need to buy another portal 
  spell too) to find his turban. Once you find it, return to Mespeak and hand 
  him the turban and 32d 55c (plus tip) to get the robe. </i></p>
<p align="center">Thanks to Don, who may or may not have offended me (will someone 
  PLEASE tell me!)</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p align="center">December 10, 1999</p>
<p align="left">1. Ok, some have ... ahem ... many ... ahem ... everyone has said 
  they want the klaknak back, so ... he is back.</p>
<p align="left">2. I apologize for the purple, but ... ahem ... hey look the Klaknak 
  is back!</p>
<p align="left">3. The idiot files break my heart and present me with a dilemma. 
  I want to have this popular section on my site, but I also hate to see other 
  players suffer. Sigh. Anyway, here is another ... sigh ... <a href="Idiot/IPlayer/IPlay.htm">adventure</a> 
  in Befallen (STAY AWAY FROM THAT HOLE! Listen, people, I can't emphasize this 
  enough.)</p>
<p align="left">4. Don't ever complain that my site is not informative:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;I don't know who taught your readers geometry, but beating 
  will continue until morale improves. A point has to be whatever the environment 
  is. You can define a point in 2-d, etc because a point isn't a measurement of 
  the point size, but coordinates for it's location. (ie a point exists at x,y,z 
  = 3,5,-2342 or if you took a great deal of trig just x,y = 2,5) A point has 
  no width, breadth, height, etc as it is JUST a point. I am really suprised by 
  the number of people who felt that this was wrong (and felt strongly enough 
  to write) but of course, I am writing too :) - Stygg p.s. a line also has as 
  many dimensions as defined by its environment, ie the line you drove beside 
  on the highway has a length, width, and breadth, for a line is "a string of 
  connected point" </p>
<p align="left">The Klaknak responds: Well, I was going to create a whole new 
  section based on Quantum Mechanics, but I think I will stick with what I know 
  best: porn and sleep.</p>
<p align="left">5. Finally, a message of immense sadness from one of our readers. 
  Um, nevermind. Someone sent a really sad letter about how EQ ruined his relationship 
  but I just can't post it. Here is the lesson tho: &quot;Life is like a marmot 
  in knit socks. When he walks in the mud, the socks get dirty but since he has 
  a washer and dryer, it's no big deal.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">December 8, 1999</p>
<p align="left">1. I have made a few cosmetic changes and will be reorganizing 
  over the next couple days. I am trying to get rid of some of the clutter. I 
  would get rid of the frames except that since I didn't use a template to create 
  these pages, I would need to put a links part on every document. No thanks.</p>
<p align="left">2. If anyone has something they really hate about this site, lemme 
  know now. I reorganize like this every once in a while for the hell of it.</p>
