  <p align="left"> A long time ago on a messageboard, far far away....Klakboard 
    Wars!</p>
  <p align="left">We pick up with our heroes, as they are captured by the death 
    star while trying to return the stolen rebel plans. Our heroes, Teirluke, 
    the naive young warrior who some day wants to be a knight, his mentor Olaf 
    Son Kenobi, their 2 droid companions, CKP0 and R2DP, and the lovable scoundrels, 
    Shad Solo and his furry copilot, Wombacca have just escaped their ship and 
    are holed up in a control room.</p>
  <p align="left">Olaf Son Kenobi: OK, fellas I am going to go deactivate that 
    tractor beam.<br>
    Shad Solo: How the hell are you going to do that?<br>
    Olaf Son Kenobi: I am going to beat on it with my axe. You boys stay here.<br>
    Shad Solo: Fine, I do not want to get MY ass shot off.<br>
    Teirluke: I want to go with you.<br>
    Olaf Son Kenobi: Your path lies along a different path from mine.<br>
    Teirluke: Huh?<br>
    Olaf Son Kenobi: Just stay here. I'll be back.<br>
    <i>After waiting a few minutes, R2DP starts having conniptions.</i><br>
    Shad Solo: What's wrong with him?<br>
    CKP0: I don't know. He just keeps saying 'She's hot, she's hot!&quot;<br>
    Teirluke: He must mean Prin-cy Leianna. She's the one who stole the plans. 
    We have to rescue her.<br>
    Shad Solo: My ass is staying glued to this chair.<br>
    Teirluke: We have to rescue her.<br>
    Shad Solo: No way.<br>
    <i>Teirluke thinks for a moment.</i></p>
  <p align="left">[Klaknak responds: Hey! This is a parody of Star Wars! Cool.]</p>
  <p align="left"> Teirluke: She's sexy.<br>
    Wombacca: Sexy?<br>
    Shad Solo: Sexy?<br>
    Teirluke: Yep. And she would probably sleep with you. If you rescued here, 
    the sex acts she would perform would be...<br>
    Shad Solo: What?<br>
    Teirluke: Well, more kinky than you can imagine.<br>
    Shad Solo: I don't know. I can imagine some pretty freaky shit.<br>
    Wombacca: That's for sure.<br>
    Teirluke: She'll do it.<br>
    Shad Solo: She better. My name is not the only thing that's been solo lately.<br>
    CKP0: What should R2DP and I do?<br>
    Shad Solo: Well, I heard about this thing where you sit on your hand until 
    <br>
    it goes numb then...<br>
    Teirluke: Just stay here!<br>
    <i>Meanwhile upstairs, Darth Aerynea speaks with the leader of the death star, 
    Grand Dogg Snarkin.</i><br>
    Darth Aerynea: I sense something. My ex-husband, Teirluke is here.<br>
    Grand Dogg Snarkin: Are you sure? Maybe your senses are all TAPped out.<br>
    Darth Aerynea: No, I know the smell of his imported lilac bath oils anywhere. 
    I must confront him.<br>
    <i>A button blinks on a console.</i><br>
    Grand Dogg Snarkin: Could you TAP that button for me?<br>
    <i>Darth Aerynea hits the button</i><br>
    Voice: Sir, some barbarian is smashing all the controls with an axe!<br>
    Grand Dogg Snarkin: Would you mind TAP dancing on down and taking care of 
    that?<br>
    Darth Aerynea: What is it with the TAP all the time? What the hell does that 
    mean? I am so sick of trying to figure out all this TAP stuff!<br>
    <i>Our heroes storm the detention area, killing all the guards.</i><br>
    Teirluke: I'll go get her, you guys hold them off.<br>
    Shad Solo: How do I do that?<br>
    Teirluke: Just recite your EQ Porn. They'll be laughing too hard to shoot 
    back.<br>
    <i>Teirluke opens the door and is greeted with the sight of the most beautiful 
    woman he has ever seen.</i><br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: Aren't you a little short for a paladin?<br>
    <i>She stands towering over Teirluke.</i><br>
    Teirluke: Aren't you a little big for a woman? Umm. I'm here to rescue you. 
    I'm here with Olaf Son Kenobi and I brought your droids.<br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: Well, then let's get the heck out of here.<br>
    <i>They are met by Shad Solo and Wombacca.</i><br>
    Shad Solo: We can't get out that way.<br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: This is just great. You dumbasses can't even rescue someone 
    without screwing it up.<br>
    <i>Prin-cy Leainna kicks in the wall and before anyone can protest, picks 
    them all up and throws them in. They find themselves in a garbage dump.</i><br>
    Wombacca: This place stinks!<br>
    Teirluke: Well it could be worse.<br>
    <i>Suddenly the walls start closing in.</i><br>
    Shad Solo: It's worse.<br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: Try and brace it with something. We need something long and 
    hard.<br>
    Shad Solo: Look no further, baby.<br>
    Teirluke: Shut up Shad. This is not the time for it.<br>
    <i>Teirluke gets on the comlink.</i><br>
    Teirluke: CKP0? Are you there?<br>
    CKP0: Yes, but I've been having some problems lately. I can't seem to think 
    about any funny EQ stuff. All I can do is rant about socio-political issues.<br>
    Teirluke: Shut up, CKP0! Now shut down all the garbage mashers!<br>
    CKP0: You heard him, R2DP.<br>
    <i>Our heroes escape the garbage masher and start to find their ship.</i><br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: OK. Here's the plan...<br>
    Shad Solo: Wait a second. I am the man here. I make all of the decisions. 
    You are the woman. You must be subservient to me.<br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: Whatever. And will someone get this walking hairball out 
    from under my kilt?<br>
    Wombacca: Hehe. She does not wear underwear.<br>
    <i>Our heroes meet back with CKP0 and R2DP and head for the ship. As they 
    cross the landing bay they see Olaf Son Kenobi smashing things with his axe.</i><br>
    Shad Solo: Yo, Olaf. Let's go or you're walking home.<br>
    <i>Just then a dark shape drifts from the shadows and backstabs Olaf Son Kenobi.</i><br>
    Teirluke: NO!!!!!!<br>
    Darth Aerynea: Teirluke, at last I have found you. Olaf Son did not tell you 
    about me, did he?<br>
    Teirluke: He said you killed my ex-wife.<br>
    Darth Aerynea: No, fool! I am your ex-wife. Now come with me, Teirluke. Leave 
    the light and embrace the darkness with me.<br>
    Teirluke: Umm, but you dumped me for another man.<br>
    Darth Aerynea: So?<br>
    Teirluke: Umm, but you are married to another man.<br>
    Darth Aerynea: So? I am a woman. We have the power over weak-minded men. Now 
    come with me, Teirluke.<br>
    Teirluke: OK. See you guys, later.<br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: Oh, well. Let's go guys.<br>
    Shad Solo: Umm, Prin-cy? Teirluke promised me that you would, uh, you know.<br>
    Prin-cy Leianna: Sigh. Very well.<br>
    <i>Later Wombacca finds CKP0 and R2DP playing chess.</i><br>
    CKP0: Where is Shad Solo and Prin-cy Leianna?<br>
    Wombacca: When the cockpit is a rocking don't come knocking.<br>
    R2DP: Hehe. You said 'cockpit'.<br>
    <i>And so ends this episode. Stay tuned for the next one titled, &quot;Wombacca 
    Strikes Out.&quot;</i><br>
    Wombacca: Hey, baby. Want to come back to my tree?<br>
    Woman at bar: Get lost, hairball.</p>
