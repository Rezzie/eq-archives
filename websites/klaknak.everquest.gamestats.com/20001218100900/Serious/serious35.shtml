      <p align="left">ShowEQ update: </p>
      <p>Some of the information gleaned from ShowEQ has caused a stir with some 
        of the more vocal members of Everquest. Most of the controversy surrounds 
        the widespread information (as confirmed in the Verant sponsored Everquest 
        hint book) that humans gain more experience than any of the other races. 
        As you know, this is basically one of the few advantages humans get (other 
        than being able to play a monk, I suppose). Yesterday I posted a letter 
        from one of my fans, but I will post it again here. He originally posted 
        it on the Everquest Gameplay board. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;Howdy,<br>
          I have posted on this subject before but I thought I would try again 
          to get an answer from someone official. <br>
          When I bought the game and the Hint book last April, it stated that 
          Humans level faster than other races, their only listed race benefit. 
          <br>
          So I dealt with being blind, having completely average stats, etc knowing 
          it would pay off eventually that I could obtain level 50 someday a bit 
          easier than someone who played a superior race for my classes. </p>
        <p>Now I read everwhere about this being a false statement from Verant, 
          mostly from ShowEQ type sites (which I do not approve of) but even the 
          Klaknack at in his recent ShowEQ editorial mentions it. </p>
        <p>Can we, your customers, please know if this was another incorrect statement 
          in the manual and Hint Guide? That Humans in fact level at the same 
          rate as most of the other races? That in actuality there is no bonus 
          to being human at all other than faction and even stat distribution? 
        </p>
        <p>Please respond to this so I do not have to take the word of people 
          using a third party program to determine my trust in you as a company. 
        </p>
        <p>Thank you, </p>
        <p>Brother Chuy; Solusek Ro&quot;</p>

      <p>In spite of a great deal of bumping on the message board, Gordon took 
        a long time to reply. His eventual response was less than enlightening:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>This has been bumped a number of times, evidently looking for some 
          sort of response from me. I thought I'd jump in and just remind everyone 
          that we don't comment on the validity or lack thereof of data pulled 
          by an illegal source. </p>
        <p>-Gordon </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As I have mentioned several times, I am far from being a vehement, rabid 
        critic of Verant, but this obsfucated response would put Dick Morris to 
        shame. Forgive me if I suggest that Verant's policy on responding to "illegal" 
        software sounds extremely post hoc. And likewise forgive me if I suggest 
        that this utterly fails to answer the issue at hand. </p>
      <p>To Gordon's credit, however, he did respond again on another thread with 
        a slightly less spin dried, but still unsatisfactory answer:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>I've never bothered to look at the hint book, and really am not concerned 
          with what it may or may not have said. I'll take your word for it that 
          it says what you say it does, and decline to comment further. Whatever 
          the experience requirements are, that's what they are, that's the way 
          it is, and it won't be changing. The contents of the hint book aren't 
          going to change, and neither are the experience requirements to put 
          them in line if any discrepancy exists. <br>
          As we didn't have creative control over any of this documentation, it's 
          very likely that it contains information that might not be entirely 
          correct. It is also very likely that it contains information that we 
          didn't want released. The hint book itself was written in late beta, 
          and since the game has continued to evolve after print, I'm sure that 
          there are many things in it that are obsolete. </p>
        <p>As for the question in general, there's really nothing wrong with it, 
          I just don't want to be roped into answering all of the other questions 
          that would result from it. My recommendation to you would be to kill 
          a few things and draw your own conclusions.</p>
        <p> -Gordon</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p>As I said, the truth is slowly beginning to seep out here, but I think 
        my response to Gordon pretty much sums up my feelings (and maybe the feelings 
        of others as well):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Gordon: <br>
          Thanks for the straightforward answer.</p>
        <p> I guess the sticky question is now this: </p>
        <p>If there is a rumor that most of EQ believes to be true, supported 
          by an official hintbook (that was licensed to another company by your 
          company), shouldn't you at least look into it and comment specifically 
          on it? </p>
        <p>Let's say that there was a widespread rumor that a full group gets 
          bonus experience over and above the additive value of adding members. 
          Wouldn't you want to clear that up? Didn't you do this very thing in 
          a Q and A session (not you, necessarily, but Verant you). </p>
        <p>You mention that the hintbook may contain things that are incorrect 
          because it was constructed during beta. I have no problem with this. 
          But we arent exactly talking about an incorrect AC number here. We are 
          talking about something that affects every single Norrathian human out 
          there who believed this information was true. I dont think it should 
          just be ignored as a little publishing snafu. </p>
        <p>I understand that Verant is reluctant to talk about numbers because 
          Verant believes that EQ should remain mysterious in this regard. But 
          geez, man, the cat is really out of the bag on this one. Are you willing 
          to let one of your sanctioned products (the EQ hintbook) continue to 
          mislead anyone who picks it up (do you guys get royalties on those books?)</p>

      <p align="left">Anyway, just as I explained in my earlier essay, there seems 
        to be this plague in the world of business where the truth is to be avoided 
        like the bite of a bubonic dog. In the pre-internet age, this "never complain, 
        never explain" philosophy may have worked, but you can forget about it 
        now. </p>
