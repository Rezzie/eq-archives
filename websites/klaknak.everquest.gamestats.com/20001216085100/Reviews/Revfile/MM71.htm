  <p><font size="4">Might and Magic 7 - reviewed by Thalen</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">About two weeks ago I got a copy of this game thinking, "Hmm... 
    Might and Magic SEVEN you say? Must be pretty good if there are this many." 
    Obviously, this is the first time I encountered this series of RPGs, but it 
    turns out that it isn't so bad.</p>
  <p align="left">First of all, I'm one of those people who, when they get a game, 
    immediately go on the net looking for cheats. I'll tell you this now, most 
    of the cheats and hacks for this game aren't all that great and take a while 
    to understand, so if you absolutely must cheat to have fun, turn around now!</p>
  <p align="left">Now that that's over with, back to the game itself. I'm not 
    very happy with the combat, because they made it turn based (you can actually 
    choose between turn based and real time, but controlling four people at once 
    is not something I can handle.) Turn based combat takes all the fun out of 
    it. At first, I played real-time, but I realized what a big disadvantage it 
    was after failing several times at something that should've been very easy. 
    (there are some times when its better to use real-time, like fighting dragons 
    because in real-time, you can dodge the blasts of dragon breath, while you 
    have to take it if you're doing turn-based.)</p>
  <p align="left">Compared to EQ, graphics suck. 'Nuff said.</p>
  <p align="left">I am one of those EQ players that is not completely content 
    with just running around hacking at everything in sight. M & M provides you 
    with a reason for all the hacking. You have one major quest in the game and 
    several sub-quests. The major quest takes some sudden turns, which I didnt 
    expect, but I liked having a reason to chop through the thick skull of a goblin 
    lord.</p>
  <p align="left">EQ is an online game, where you play with other people. You 
    get to interact with them and they get to interact with you, but if you're 
    getting some bad interaction you can escape it and play this game. No one 
    here is gonna run up to you and nuke the stone gargoyle you've been trying 
    to kill for a while. And better yet, no Verant enforced interaction, such 
    as (snarl) the player economy (Thalan curses it in languages he doesnt even 
    know yet). But the shopkeepers rip you off even more unless you have a decent 
    merchant skill.</p>
  <p align="left">Overall, its a pretty good game, especially once you get farther 
    into it. I doubt that you'll be playing this 24 hours straight, but it is 
    a good rest from EQ. Everything thats wrong with EQ is pretty much OK here, 
    but it isnt an online game, so it lacks interaction. </p>
