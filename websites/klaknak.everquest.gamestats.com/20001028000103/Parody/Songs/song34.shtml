        <p>A note from Marino: A song about EQ, loosely based on Weird Al's Amish 
          Paradise, which is loosely based on Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise. (I 
          know I'm pathetic for parodying a parody). Here goes: </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I walk throught the valley where I wait for the spawn <br>
          I take a look at myself and realize I'm just a pawn <br>
          Of an evil empire also known as Verant<br>
          My addiction to this game is pretty damn apparent <br>
          At 4:30 in the morning I'm campin ghouls <br>
          Grall tanks, and Serianna heals, fool <br>
          And I've been tanking and healing so long<br>
          That even Brad thinks my mind gone<br>
          I'm an elf of the land, I'm into tracking down<br>
          Got an axe in my hand and on my head a blackened iron crown <br>
          But if you clear your ice giants, and I clear out mine<br>
          Then tonight we're gonna take Vox like there ain't 5 guilds in line 
        </p>
        <p>We've been spending most our time <br>
          Playing EverQuest online<br>
          We go linkdead, we die, we whine <br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          We always go from five to nine <br>
          Playing Everquest online<br>
          Pass out at the keyboard, that's a sign<br>
          You've been playing EverQuest online </p>
        <p>A local Mob kick my butt last week<br>
          I tried to zone, but I was too week <br>
          I was running for the guards, but then it hit me and I fell<br>
          So I got my wizzie friend to blow it straight to hell <br>
          But I ain't never trained a mob unless I was dying <br>
          Wouldn't wanna leave everyone at zone crying <br>
          I don't wear plate, but I got a cool bow <br>
          And I'm a wood elf so you'd better aim low, fool</p>
        <p> There's no going back, no logging off <br>
          Not a chance to get away <br>
          It's like crack, like booze, like marijuana <br>
          You're want to get out, but your hooked and you know your gonna stay 
        </p>
        <p>We've been spending most our time <br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          No time to bath, to work, to dine <br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          Can't stop with this game of mine<br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          Logging now would be a crime <br>
          Playing Everquest online </p>
        <p>Campin lots of mobs, loot lots of plat<br>
          Killed a dragon monday, what do you of that? <br>
          I'm the kinda guy the little rangers wanna be like <br>
          On EQ, day and night, getting disowned by my wife <br>
          Think you're guy is tough? Think he's got the skills <br>
          Well I know I got you beat <br>
          Cause I use e-bay to pay my bills <br>
          So don't start trains, and don't kill steal <br>
          Or else my blade up through your chest in a duel you will feel </p>
        <p>We've been spending most our time<br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          Waiting for the spawn in line <br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          Senses starting to decline <br>
          Playing Everquest online <br>
          I think that you'll do just fine <br>
          Playing Everquest online... </p>
