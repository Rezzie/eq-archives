  <p>Utterly Confused - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The Cackling Klaknak contemplates an EQ career change and the 
    forces driving his decision.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">You could say I had a condition called &quot;New Character-itis&quot; 
    or &quot;Neopersonaphilia&quot; to use the technical name.</p>
  <p align="left">I have no character higher than level 15, and yet most of my 
    characters are a level or two within this range. I have a 13 level Dark Elf 
    Cleric, a 15 level High Elf Cleric, a 13 level Rogue and several level 9 magic 
    types of all types.</p>
  <p align="left">The other night, I experienced both immense joy and immense 
    despair at the same time when my High Elf Cleric reached level 14. I finally 
    had bind and my Expulse the Undead (and even my Smite) was dishing out damage 
    very close to 100 points. Battles suddenly became much easier. But in the 
    back of my mind, a little voice said:</p>
  <p align="left">1. You will never have SOW.</p>
  <p align="left">2. You have the worst solo class in the game.</p>
  <p align="left">So even as I revelled in frying orcs in Oasis with relative 
    ease, I knew that my soloing days were numbered. And since most trade skills 
    had been rendered useless, my alternative to soloing rested in one thing only: 
    grouping.</p>
  <p align="left">In many many ways, grouping can be one of the most rewarding 
    aspects of Everquest. But as all the (now angry) necromancers out there probably 
    know, grouping works best only under the best of circumstances, and most of 
    the time, the following things seriously hamper grouping efficiency:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Without question the hardest thing to do is find someone 
    within your level range. It really is something of a vicious circle, because 
    if you are level 15 and a level 12 group is looking for a member, they don't 
    want you because you get more experience. But if you are level 15 and a level 
    17 party is looking for a group, you lose maximum experience.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Meeting and keeping friends online can be difficult if you 
    play in different time zones or have different IRL obligations.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Staying within level range of all your friends is also difficult. 
    This is the number one problem I have with the guild I am in right now. I 
    feel like I have to powergame every waking minute to keep up with the people 
    I want to group with. I feel like I cannot even take a week off without having 
    to pay for it later by a solid week of powergaming.</p>
  <p align="left">4. Grouping, even with a decent combat party, seems to always 
    be inefficient in other ways. The more people in the group, the greater the 
    possibility that: a) someone will experience linkdeath; (b) someone will run 
    out of water or food; (c) someone's packs will be full; (d) someone's phone 
    will ring; (e) someone has to go to pick up his child or go get groceries; 
    (f) someone has to go eat or (!) sleep ... the list is endless.</p>
  <p align="left">5. And, if you are grouping with a combat party that doesn't 
    mesh well, you may end up waiting around all day as the inefficient mages 
    in your group med.</p>
  <p align="left">6. Many times, you will run into a group with one or two raving 
    leaders who don't have the foggiest idea what they are doing. You are all 
    in a group, and yet, the leader is playing a solo mentality. I run into this 
    all the damn time. The leader says: &quot;Let's go kill the commander&quot; 
    and he is off running before anyone else in the group has time to say: &quot;Um, 
    where is that?&quot; or &quot;I have only 5% mana, you idiot.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">Sure, it is easy to avoid a couple of the above pitfalls but 
    the chance of avoiding all of them is very difficult. I think it is an amazing 
    group indeed that can eliminate all of them and I honestly feel that the odds 
    of just running across a group like this randomly are nearly impossible.</p>
  <p align="left">So what does all this boil down to?</p>
  <p align="left">Grouping, somewhat like the player run economy, works well ... 
    as a theory ... but somehow it just doesn't seem to gel right for me.</p>
  <p align="left">But before I continue that thought, let me, in pure rant form, 
    sidetrack for a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">Verant seems to solve problems using an either/or type of mentality. 
    Here are some examples:</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Problem: Players are getting too rich off selling to NPCs</p>
  <p align="left">Verant Solution: Nuke most of the skills.</p>
  <p align="left">A better solution: Make sales to NPCs profitable, but significantly 
    less profitable. It really was insane how easily you could get wealthy making 
    pie tins. But instead of just toning down the margins a bit, Verant nuked 
    the entire thing and, in the process, one of the only real alternatives to 
    battle (except for enchanters and people who made enough money selling pie 
    tins to finance smithing or ... or ... um ...)</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Problem: Necromancers solo reasonably well.</p>
  <p align="left">Verant solution: Remove many of the necromancer's advantages, 
    while keeping their disadvantages and hope that people who have spent 200+ 
    hours building up their characters don't mail bomb headquarters.</p>
  <p align="left">A better solution: Ask whether it really matters if one class 
    if somewhat better than others at soloing. If you really feel like it does 
    matter, make a change that doesn't fundamentally change the classes' makeup, 
    like make it so that they gain experience at slower rates or make their spell 
    components slightly (SLIGHTLY, you bastards) more difficult to find (they 
    are already pretty damn hard, I have heard).</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Problem: Verant wanted to encourage people to group</p>
  <p align="left">Verant solution: Gear the entire game towards grouping.</p>
  <p align="left">A better solution: Make it so that only the best items/experience/loot 
    can be won by grouping.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Anyway, these are my opinions on the matter, and the last little 
    example brings me back to my problem.</p>
  <p align="left">When I created Gayfeather, the purpose was twofold:</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">1. I wanted to build a character primarily for this site.</p>
  <p align="left">2. I wanted to build a character I could eventually solo.</p>
  </div>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">But again, a few things troubled me in the back of my mind:</p>
<p align="left">1. No SOW for a looooong time.</p>
<p align="left">2. No bind ... ever.</p>
<p align="left">3. Insanely slow level ups.</p>
<div align="center">
  <p align="left">So I feel like I am already beginning to crap out on my Ranger 
    character. As always, I have considered falling back on one of the &quot;pets&quot; 
    magicians, but with necromancers being nerfed and with Verant's cavalier approach 
    to fundamentally changing a class mid game, I am a little afraid to do anything.</p>
  <p align="left">In short, I need some opinions out there.</p>
  <p align="left">1. How can grouping become effective for me, keeping the above 
    problems in mind. I realize that some of you out there may be lucky enough 
    to party with your friends who live in your hometown and who stay within a 
    level or so with each other, but what about the solo man looking for a group?</p>
  <p align="left">2. Are there still any viable solo classes out there? My criteria 
    is simple (if not unrealistic):</p>
  <p align="left">a. Bind is absolutely necessary.</p>
  <p align="left">b. SOW would be nice.</p>
  <p align="left">c. Decent melee and/or pets (especially in later levels) would 
    be nice.</p>
  <p align="left">What does that leave me with? A shaman? A soon to be nerfed 
    necromancer? A magician?</p>
  <p align="left">My mind reels and I am absolutely frustrated and confused right 
    now.</p>
  <p align="left">Any thoughts?</p>
