  <p>The Drum - by Menwein</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> My Human Bard had just made level 8. The new song for this 
    level was nowhere to be found in the Qeynos area, so I decided to move on 
    and see more of the world. I crossed Anatonica with a couple different travel 
    partners. We moved fairly quickly using the Bard song along with a drum. The 
    first partner I had stopped I asked to fight a mist wolf in North Karana. 
    As soon as it became clear that this was a real bad idea, he told me to run 
    to the guards at the tower. Of course the guards where not there, but I ran 
    to the tower. The Wolf ate well on level 7 Monk that day.</p>
  <p align="left">I made it to the Stone bridge and hooked up with a new travel 
    partner (The Monk needed to log off and was just happy that one of us made 
    it). My new partner knew the way, so off we went. The plan was "don't stop 
    running for anything". As we ran up along the river, he stopped to ask some 
    higher level people if you could swim accross and take a short cut around 
    HighPass Hold. As soon as he stopped, all of the raiders by the river attacked 
    him. He was dead before I could say RUN! I made it to the wooden bridge and 
    zoned through. I sat there and waited for him. He ran from Qeynos and looted 
    his corpse. We met up again on the bridge on the Eastern Karana side. We decided 
    to wait until daylight to make a run for High Pass Hold. I went AFK for a 
    minute, and when I came back, I was in North Karana with only a few hit points 
    of health. Someone had trained a Griffawn to the bridge. Apparently I was 
    so close to the zone that the Giffawn knocked be into it. We healed in North 
    Karana then continued on.</p>
  <p align="left">The rest of the trip was uneventfull (barring getting lost in 
    Highpass). When we reached Freeport, we went out seperate ways. I restocked 
    food and drink and caught the boat to Faydwer. After getting some general 
    directions, I made my way to the Bard guild in Kelethin. I purchased my new 
    song and scribed it. Then I thought "as long as I am here, I may as well see 
    what kind of quests there are". The only quest that sounded like it had promise 
    was to get some spider silks for one of the local Bards. I decided to go for 
    it. It didn't take long before I was hopelessly lost in the forest of greater 
    Faydark. As luck would have it, I stumbled on a zone.</p>
  <p align="left">I entered Lesser Faydark and started moveing along the zone 
    wall (to my right). After a bit, I came to a building of sorts. I highlight 
    the guy standing there and it is a Brownie Merchant. Cool! I need to sell 
    and buy food and drink. I approach the merchant:</p>
  <p align="left">A Brownie guard begins to cast</p>
  <p align="left">A Brownie Merchant begins to cast</p>
  <p align="left">YOU are hit for over half of you total HP</p>
  <p align="left">YOU are hit for 54 points of damage</p>
  <p align="left">A Brownie Guard hits you for 38 points of damage</p>
  <p align="left">LOADING...PLEASE WAIT</p>
  <p align="left">I am back in Qeynos. Naked, copperless, and no food or drink. 
    I bash enough low level critters to get 4 each food and drink and a new drum. 
    I set off again. This time alone. I am tired of people dieing around me. I 
    make it all the way to High Pass Hold. I get lost. I take a wrong turn. I 
    die (quick). Back in Qeynos, repeat the bare handed vermin slaughter to get 
    enough change for food and drink (skip the drum). I set off again. I make 
    it to High hold and ask for an escort through. Some kind sole shows me the 
    way. I run to freeport and get a bind at the dock. Beg for food and drink 
    ( I ran out), and tell my sad story. A level 7 Wizard offers to help. I decline, 
    no sense in getting us both killed. I get to Lesser Faydark and attempt to 
    recover my corpse. It took me 6 or more attempts, but I did finally get it. 
    Including the one I abandoned in High Pass, I had 5 corpse at one time. I 
    did learn to /CON everything. </p>
