      <p align="left">"All life is politics." </p>
      <p align="left">What does this mean? This means that politics is really 
        nothing more than human stupidity writ large (with colorful stickers). 
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, before you start yawning and reaching for the back button 
        on your navigator, at least consider that by understanding idiocy on a 
        grand scale, you may come to understand idiocy in your own neighborhood 
        and in your own mind. </p>
      <p align="left">And so, without any further muckety muck, The Klaknak's 
        Easily Digestible Guide to Astute Politicking (for the newbie political 
        junkie). </p>
      <p align="left">1. Read Michael Shermer's Why People Believe Weird Things: 
        Pseudoscience, Superstition & Other Confusions of Our Time. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Commentary: The obvious reason to read this book is because it is basically 
          a primer on the science of logical fallacy. When I read this for the 
          first time, I felt philosophically refreshed and began viewing things 
          with a renewed skepticism that I had somehow lost since graduating from 
          college. The not so obvious reason to read this book is to read Shermer's 
          scathing indictment of Ayn Rand and her cult of objectivists. If there 
          is anything I hate more than reading the self-righteous, hyper-defensive 
          chunky spews of a christian fundamentalist, it is reading the self-righteous, 
          hyper-defensive chunky spews of objectivists and other paragons of bubble 
          gum "rationalist" philosophy who claim that reason is capable of explaining 
          everything and yet cannot explain why reason is not capable of explaining 
          anything. Shermer really is quite the subversive, because he lures these 
          hyper-rationalists to his book by discounting UFOs, superstition and 
          the like and then he utterly destroys these soppers of unoriginal thought 
          by calling Ayn Rand the leader of a cult every bit as suspect as Heaven's 
          Gate or the most snivelling of snake handlers. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>2. Watch Inside Politics (5:00EST, CNN) </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Commentary: Inside Politics is fairly bubble gum for the hard core, 
          but it boasts some of the best talking heads in the mainstream political 
          commentating business. Here is a breakdown: </p>
        <p>Bernie Shaw: a muffin head </p>
        <p>Judy Woodruff: another muffin head </p>
        <p>Jeff Greenfield: this guy should become a high school civics professor 
          because that is all he is good for. Here is a selection from one of 
          his biting political commentaries on "the uneasiness factor": "What's 
          most intriguing is the possibility that the uneasiness factor might 
          play a significant role this year. So far, Americans have expressed 
          a level of confidence and contentment rare in recent decades. If the 
          stock market roller-coaster continues, it may make that factor the single 
          most significant element in November." This insight is akin to a geologist 
          going on the Discovery Channel and claiming that "rocks are hard." I 
          understand that CNN is trying to reach a mass audience, but jesus christ, 
          Greenfield must die. He is also a pompous ass. William F. Buckley can 
          get away with this because he is pretty goddamn smart. But a pompous 
          buffoon is one of the most tragic creatures in the known universe. It's 
          sad, really. </p>
        <p>Robert Novak: I just really like this guy. I hardly agree with anything 
          he says, but his raccoon complexion and extremely white teeth is an 
          icon of US Politics in all its horrific glory. He also has the terrible 
          habit of often being right and he is one of the few Republican pundits 
          who will admit openly that the Republicans have been fucking up royally 
          for the last 5 or 6 years. I have often wondered myself if Clinton could 
          be called a political genius when his opponents are political morons.</p>
        <p> Margaret Carlson/Tucker Carlson: Margaret is your basic knee-jerk 
          liberal. Tucker is your basic smirking, bow tie wearing conservative 
          Yalie. But when they come together, truth almost always overcomes ego. 
          Margaret will say "Bush really screwed up" and Tucker will say "He sure 
          did." And vice versa (inserting Gore where appropriate). Wow. </p>
        <p>Bill Press: He only rarely appears on Inside Politics, but he typifies 
          the kind of partisan analysis that typifies most political programs. 
          Al Gore could take a hamster and bite its head off on public tv and 
          Bill Press would defend it after proving it never happened. </p>
        <p>Bruce Morton: He is the Kuralt of politics looking for weird stories 
          and angles and often finding truth therein.</p>
        <p> I want to close this discussion with CNN's two crown jewels: Bill 
          Schneider and E.L. Dionne. </p>
        <p>Bill Schneider: Bill Schneider's Political Plays of the Week is some 
          of the most insightful commentary you will ever hear in mainstream political 
          discussion. I cannot praise this guy enough. </p>
        <p>E.L. Dionne: Dionne is a GOD. Even though he is a pretty proud liberal, 
          he is extremely fair and believes, as I do, that politics can (CAN) 
          be a noble endeavor. When commentators ask Dionne questions, he doesnt 
          start spewing verbal farts out his ass, he actually delves deep into 
          statistics and facts and does so calmly and without even the slightest 
          shred of an ego. If pompous idiots are the sum total of human fallibility, 
          then unassuming geniuses like Dionne are treasures we would be stupid 
          to ignore. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>3. Force yourself to watch one hour of a Senate subcommittee meeting 
        a week. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Commentary: If this doesn't piss you off about the impotence of our 
          political system, nothing will. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>4. Read as much Michael Moorcock as you can.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Commentary: Sure, this guy writes fantasy novels, but they are overwhelmingly 
          political. Moorcock has done more to shape my political views than almost 
          anyone else. A common theme: Most of the world's great holocausts and 
          stupidities (in both fantasy and real world realms) are the result of 
          a people's or a hero's blind, unbending devotion to a theory. In our 
          rational world, theories are so deified that they can justify the most 
          horrible acts ever committed by one man against another. Moorcock also 
          believes that human happiness and order must be a balancing act between 
          absolute freedom (chaos) and unbending doctrine (order). This may seem 
          overly obvious, but I think this is absolutely the core issue that drives 
          every single debate in America today. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>5. Watch the History Channel.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> Commentary: I would much rather you read a good book on history than 
          watch a 60 minute documentary, but I am a realist (and a trifle bored 
          with 2000 page histories myself). </p>
        <p align="center">* * * </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Finally, I want to include the three most important resources on my list. 
        Even if you don't do any of the other things, at least do one of the following: 
      </p>
      <p>6. Read P.J. O'Rourke's Parliament of Whores. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Commentary: No book best exemplifies the phrase: "it's funny because 
          it is true." O'Rourke says he is a conservative (although he sounds 
          more libertarian to me), but if you think he is one of these moralistic 
          conservatives we see running around today, think again. How many moralistic 
          conservatives would name an entire section: "Our Government: What the 
          Fuck Do They Do All Day, and Why Does It Cost So Goddamned Much Money?" 
          Here are some other chapters from his book (with subtitles). Doing the 
          Most Important Kind of Nothing - the Supreme Court Graft for the Millions 
          - Social Security Protectors of a Blameless Citizenry - The Bureaucracy 
          Defense Policy - Cry "Havoc!" and Let Slip the Hogs of Peace Poverty 
          Policy - How to Endow Privation (bwahhaha!) And finally, one of my favorite 
          quotes from his book: "(commenting on the 1988 presidential primary 
          race) And Jesse Jackson - if you listen to what he says rather than 
          the way he says it - sounds like Fidel Castro's Jiminy Cricket." </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>7. Read E.J. Dionne's Why Americans Hate Politics. </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Commentary: This book is freaking brilliant. I am in awe of this man. 
          Some people may find this book a little dry, but I have read no better 
          commentary on why absolutely nothing of any import ever gets done in 
          Washington (hint: nonexistent divisions on the issues are made existent 
          for the sake of political parlay ... woo hoo!).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> 8. Find one issue and become active. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Commentary: I am the hardest of the hard political junkies and I cannot 
          even keep up with a fraction of the stuff that goes on in politics. 
          I can only imagine how overwhelmed the politically bored must feel. 
          But surely you can find at least one issue and start studying it and 
          start acting on it. Try to avoid the big, Time magazine issues like 
          abortion, gun control, etc. if you can and look for issues that are 
          equally important but often slip beneath the radar. Naturally, if these 
          big issues are the things you are passionate about, dont let me stop 
          you, but if you think certain issues on abortion or gun control piss 
          you off, you aint seen nothing yet. These issues are out in the open 
          where politicians must be circumspect and coy. It is not until you delve 
          into the world of pork, political financing, agriculture, tort reform, 
          and other issues that you find the true source of ... christ, there 
          is not a word foul enough to describe what goes on in these areas of 
          our government.</p>
      </blockquote>
