<p align="left"><b>The presidential race (RANT!!!). (2/15/00)</b></p>
<p align="left">There is oh so much I could write about the race so far, but I 
  am sleepy, so I want to focus on one issue. Let's examine The Wacko Conspiracy 
  Response.</p>
<p>Before McCain clobbered Bush in New Hampshire, things were fine. Bush didn't 
  have to go on the offensive much because he figured he could ride the dollar 
  wave to the convention hall. Then, lo and behold, McCain not only beat Bush 
  but beat Bush like the draft dodging mama's boy that he is (oh, right ... Texas 
  Air National Guard ... whatever ... when you are poor you dodge the draft by 
  going to Canada. When you are wealthy, you get daddy to put you in the guard.)</p>
<p>Anyway, after the New Hampshire debacle, all of the wacko conversative radio 
  hosts and pundits suddenly came upon the real reason McCain won New Hampshire. 
  It wasn't because people LIKED McCain, no. It couldnt be that. They decided 
  that McCain was using a brilliant strategy that I will call the Wacko Conspiracy 
  Response. Here is how it goes ...</p>
<p>1. McCain couldn't possibly win because people like him because if people really 
  liked him, then the Republican establishment, in all of its wisdom, would have 
  picked him as their poster boy, not Bush. After all, the Republican party has 
  their finger on the TRUE pulse of the people.</p>
<p>2. So, since people aren't voting for him because they like him, they must 
  be taking part in a great left wing conspiracy.</p>
<p>3. What the conspiracists are doing is this: They will vote for McCain so that 
  the weakest Republican will go up against Gore in November and Gore will defeat 
  him in a landslide. McCain is that weak Republican.</p>
<p>I will point out to you in a moment why this conspiracy theory is INSANE, but 
  before that, I should point out that Bush is now proposing this EXACT SAME THEORY. 
  He has claimed in recent speeches that democrats are voting in the republican 
  party without any intention to vote for the party's nominee. The underlying 
  message, of course, is that those accursed democrats are trying to blow the 
  election for the republicans.</p>
<p>Now, Bush has bought into the Wacko Theory! I can't believe it!</p>
<p>And why is it wacko? I will give you two reasons. The first reason is a good 
  basic argument against any kind of conspiracy (the &quot;which is more likely?&quot; 
  argument). But the second argument ... oh mama ... just proves how big an idiot 
  these wackos are.</p>
<p>1. This conspiracy theory pretty much assumes that all citizens who vote are 
  just as politically astute, cruel and evil as the politicians themselves. It 
  assumes that farmers, bankers, housewives, etc. sit around in their house and 
  conspire against members of the other party. What these theorists dont realize 
  is that most of these people DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS about the internal machinations 
  of party politics. They don't give a shit, generally, what party wins as long 
  as the person who holds their views wins the election. Granted, most people 
  belong to certain parties because those parties share a lot of their views, 
  but your average Joe Bloe owes much more allegiance to the welfare of his job, 
  his family, etc. than he does to some ass sucking corporate political party.</p>
<p>So, which is more likely?</p>
<p>a. Dairy Farmer Joe, scheming amongst his cows, voted for McCain because he 
  can't wait for Gore to beat the shit out of him.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b. Dairy Farmer Joe thinks McCain will be the best president for the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Ok, maybe that doesn't convince you. But I know this will. Consider this 
  little tidbit of information:</p>
<p>If the presidential race in November is between McCain and Gore, McCain will 
  beat the ever living shit out of Gore.</p>
<p>If the presidential race in November is between Bush and Gore, it is a toss-up.</p>
<p>Have no doubts about it, people, and you can take this to the bank. McCain, 
  a loud mouthed, anti-establishment, ill tempered war hero will walk up to the 
  schmoozy, scandal plagued &quot;no controlling legal authority&quot; Gore on 
  debate night and rip Gore's eyes out and feed them to him. McCain will CRUSH 
  Gore and Gore knows it (and the polls &quot;prove&quot; it). Hell, I bet Gore 
  will vote for Bush in the primaries to better his chances in the fall!</p>
<p>So, keeping this in mind, why oh why would the great left wing conspiracy vote 
  McCain into November since they all know (and they all know it) that McCain 
  will wipe the stage with Gore's pasty white carcass?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they are not. There is no great left wing conspiracy. Gore is scared 
  to death of McCain; and, lo and behold, the voters in New Hampshire (and elsewhere) 
  have voted and will vote for McCain not because he is the pawn in a democratic 
  power play, but because they think McCain KICKS ASS.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>(Oh, by the way, I still think Bush is the odds on favorite for the nomination, 
  mainly because many of the states are closed primaries and caucuses and because 
  many social conservatives like McCain less than Bush, but I believe that if 
  you threw away the parties today and held a three person general election, McCain 
  would win in a landslide. People are sick of the Clintons (ergo Gore) but they 
  are also wary of putting mama boy Bush (who, interestingly, sounds a lot like 
  Clinton with all that compassionate baby slobbering crap) into office. Enter 
  McCain. Americans, as a rule, love big round balls).</p>

<p align="left"><b>The contest.</b></p>
<p align="left">Ok, so my hometown rag is sponsoring a fiction contest. I will 
  never win for two reasons:</p>
<p align="left">1. The stories that always win are some sort of despairing suburbanite 
  story involving two paragraph long descriptions of an oppressive vagina and/or 
  father figure. Or they will be a long diatribe about how ironic the author feels 
  it is for him, a one time progressive, to own a SUV. The story will be called 
  &quot;Snot Wheels&quot; and will make clever references to Ken Kesey and the 
  Penthouse forum.</p>
<p align="left">2. I don't take myself way too fucking seriously.</p>
<p align="left">Ok, so this inability to win gives me a wonderful sense of freedom.</p>
<p align="left">But here is the rub: The story must contain the line &quot;Love 
  is an untamed bird&quot; somewhere in the text.</p>
<p align="left">I have thought long and hard and I think this will be the basic 
  outline of the story (these are my ideas! Stay away from them!):</p>
<p align="left">a. The scene opens with the hero in a waiting room. Ever since 
  the beginning of Spring, a crow had been roosting near his home, attacking him 
  whenever he exits. The hero think his sole remaining tuft of red hair on his 
  otherwise bald head may be responsible.</p>
<p align="left">b. While in the office, the Hero sees a pamphlet called &quot;Are 
  you Suicidal?&quot; and he puts it in his pocket.</p>
<p align="left">c. The doctor tends his wounds.</p>
<p align="left">d. When the hero comes home, a TV news crew is waiting on his 
  doorstep. The nosy neighbor had told them about the bird and thought it would 
  make a great human interest story. The hero refuses.</p>
<p align="left">e. The next morning, the hero awakens to find several news crews 
  on his front lawn. They all begin offering large sums of money to get him to 
  leave the house with cameras rolling.</p>
<p align="left">f. While inside, he reads the pamphlet, takes the quiz, and realizes 
  he is, in fact, suicidal. He decides to commit himself.</p>
<p align="left">g. He leaves the front door and the bird tries to attack him but 
  is knocked cold by a wayward boom mike.</p>
<p align="left">h. He drives to the local institution and while inside, he flips 
  through a copy of Reader's Digest. Inside are the winners of the Annual Children's 
  Poem contest. The winner is a poem called &quot;Love is an untamed bird.&quot; 
  The poem upsets him.</p>
<p align="left">i. A Christian outreach woman comes up to him and tries to convert 
  him by saying &quot;Jesus loves you.&quot; He punches her out cold.</p>
<p align="left">j. He is committed and charged with assault. The papers pick up 
  on the story. </p>
<p align="left">k. Several months later, the hero is discharged and goes door 
  to door selling magazine subscriptions as part of a Felon Rehabilitation Program.</p>
<p align="left">l. The end. The title of the story will be: &quot;Sinners in the 
  Hand of an Angry God.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">Update: Hmmm .. I have thought about it for a bit and I wonder 
  if it would be better this way: As he walks into the clinic to commit himself, 
  he sees a local renowned crazy dressed in a white dove costume (with a strip 
  of kudzu stapled to the beak). The dove crazy person hands the hero a pamphlet 
  that says: &quot;Hell is HOT HOT HOT!&quot; The hero punches her out. I am not 
  sure where I can fit the &quot;love is an untamed bird&quot; in.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Something of interest has happened in my little community that 
  all stock market users may be wise to research. Value America, an online shopping 
  mall that sold everything from computers to dehydrated soup, has laid off hundreds 
  of employees in an attempt to make itself profitable. It has also decided to 
  stick with selling electronics only. Value America lost close to 50 million 
  dollars this last year and with the market already glutted with computer vendors, 
  one could reasonably expect it may lose the remaining 80 million in its bank. 
  Analysts predict that at current trends, the company will be bankrupt by July.</p>
<p align="left">But that isn't really the interesting thing. Here is the interesting 
  thing. The two owners owned all of the shares of stock when the company went 
  public. The public, IPO delirious and technology hungry, bought shares bringing 
  value of the stock to 70 bucks (bought from the owners, of course). The two 
  owners continued to sell stock throughout the year and the shares are now worth 
  5 bucks. The last massive share sell off came only a month before the mass layoffs. 
  One local paper here is accusing the company of breaking insider trading rules, 
  altho (to be fair), this progressive newspaper (winner of a Cornell journalism 
  award) tends to believe all business is inherently evil, so caveat emptor.</p>
<p align="left">Whether these owners broke any rules or not, it does raise an 
  interesting question (one that more business savvy people may already know): 
  what the fuck? With the stock market as delirious as it is right now, the owners 
  of a business really shouldn't care if their business fails or not. The two 
  owners of Value America are multi multi millionaires. They started an online 
  company, the stock market went nuts, they then sold a huge portion of their 
  shares, laid off close to 600 employees and then ... and here is the good part 
  ... they resigned. They now live on several hundred acres of prime real estate 
  in the horse country of Virginia.</p>
<p align="left">Hmmmmm ... Will this be a trend of things to come? Or is Value 
  America merely an aberration? I honestly don't know the answer but it has me 
  concerned.</p>
<p>On a completely different note, did anyone watch the 100 hours of millenium 
  coverage on CNN? I am one of CNN's harshest critics, but I actually got warm 
  fuzzies watching the millenium being celebrated all over the world. In all honesty, 
  the world became much smaller for me that day. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">***</p>
<p align="left">Today I went out and bought <b>Unreal Tournament</b>. I have always 
  avoided first person shooters in the past because I have all the reflexes of 
  a <b>three legged mentally handicapped mule on jumbo ether</b>, but ... well, 
  someone told me there was a nuke in it. There is something about a nuke that 
  seems to undermine the need for dexterity.</p>
<p align="left">Speaking of <b>nukes</b>, how many of you out there are worried 
  about <b>Y2K</b>? I am, but not for the reasons you expect. I am scared by Y2K 
  because I have absolutely no plans and am terrified that for the rest of my 
  life when people ask me where I was on December 31, I will have to tell them 
  that I was at home scratching myself, drinking <b>Cream Soda</b> and watching 
  the 24 hour MASH marathon on channel 19. Y2K also frightens me because of all 
  the idiots out there.</p>
<p align="left">I am also pleased to announce that <b>Gamespot</b> gave the idiot 
  driven <b>Ultima Ascension</b> a bad review. I applaud Gamespot for having the 
  guts to deflate the overhyped balloon that is the Ultima series. I now wait 
  for the <b>whoring PC Gamer</b> to call it Game of the Year. For those of you 
  who do not know, Ultima Ascension really would have been a great game, but unfortunately, 
  hardware and software technology refused to sit still for 5 years so that the 
  genius programmers at Origin could program a game that would work.</p>
<p align="left">Speaking of pushing the envelope, I was interested to read that 
  the developers of <b>Shadowbane</b> (Wolfpack Studios) are creating an online 
  <b>RPG</b> that will return to <b>MUDDING's</b> roots by not relying so much 
  on fight, sit, fight, sit. Hmmmm ... where have we heard that before? Interestingly, 
  when asked how players will gain experience and advance, the Shadowbane guru 
  said characters will have to ... <b>fight</b>. Thank God a developer finally 
  has the balls to sit on its <b>ass</b> and let a genre stagnate.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, who out there is ready for the game <b>The Sims</b> to 
  come out? I definitely am. I am eager to replicate my life on the computer and 
  see where it is headed. If I play a game and learn that people won't come to 
  my house because a <b>pizza</b> has been left on the floor for 3 years, I will 
  consider it $49.95 well spent.</p>
