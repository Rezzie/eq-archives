  <p align="center">The next series of enhancements - by Tom G.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I'd don't so much mind that Verant does things that 'balance' 
    the classes. The funniest thing is the backdoor slight-of-hand way the put 
    them in. It's like their giving you such a good reacharound, that by the time 
    you realize... well, you see where that's going. </p>
  <p align="left">A great example of this is from last weeks patch: Druid's Skin 
    Like Nature has had a damage shield component added to it! Sounds good, except 
    they fail to mention that this was done at the cost of the 2 point regeneration 
    component it used to have. </p>
  <p align="left">Luckily, my sources at VI have smuggled to me what the next 
    series of enhancements will be, and what the behind the scenes effects will 
    be. I will share them with you now, in hopes that you will allow others to 
    be enlightened by this knowledge. If I get any further information, I will 
    share it at that time. </p>
  <p align="left">Rouges Poison skill is now resisted half as often! (It also 
    taunts 8 times as much). </p>
  <p align="left">More research formulas added for pure casters! (Spells over 
    level 12 are no longer available at guilds). </p>
  <p align="left">Monks may now carry 10% more weight! (However, if they go over 
    it, items randomly disappear).</p>
  <p align="left">Druids/Rangers Ensnare now has a predicatable duration, like 
    Snare, and its resistability has been greatly reduced! (The duration is 9 
    seconds. Snare no longer works on anything but bixies, giant bats, and goblin 
    whelps). </p>
  <p align="left">Dyllin Starshine (for the Testament of Vaneer quest) is no longer 
    a timed spawn, he is triggered! (He has a placeholder thats a level 49 Shadow 
    Knight). </p>
  <p align="left">More mobs now drop the fishbone earring! (Innoruk and Cazic 
    Thule). </p>
  <p align="left">Warriors have been given a slight ATK bonus! (Mobs have been 
    given a huge ATK bonus). Warriors have been given 10% more hitpoints! (They 
    no longer heal naturally). </p>
  <p align="left">Bandages heal 20% more hitpoints! (They now cost 40pp each. 
    The mage summon bandage spell now requires a black pearl as a component). 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Casting time on Evac spells has been greatly reduced! (There's 
    now a 50-50 shot for each person in the group to be left behind). </p>
  <p align="left">Mobs pathing has been fixed so that they no longer teleport 
    away when fleeing! (They can now teleport on to you if you aren't in melee 
    range and you begin casting a spell). </p>
  <p align="left">Fennin Ro server has been split into two! (Players were distributed 
    randomly. Most weren't lost). </p>
  <p align="left">Spirit of Wolf is now 10% faster, and last 20% longer! (It is 
    negated by any healing spell, and does not stack with regeneration or chloroplast). 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Manastones are now available via questing! (The quest requires 
    rare drops off of Nagafen, King Xorbb, and LORE pelt from a rare invisible 
    mist wolf in West Karana that shows up on track as 'a mist wolf'. The pelt 
    looks invisible in the loot screen unless you right click on it. You need 
    200 skill in jewelcraft, baking, pottery, and brewing. You also need 3 Black 
    Sapphires and 4,200,000 copper, which must be given to a rare spawn in Kedge 
    that swims at cheetah speed, never stops, doesn't respond to hails. The guest 
    giver is on the 7th island in the plane of Air. Manastones now only work in 
    BlackBurrow and CrushBone). </p>
  <p align="left">Kunark has been opened, you can get there via boat or a new 
    druid and wizard gate spell! (All other races are KoS to Iskar, and the boat 
    docks in downtown Iskarville, where the Necromancers guild has a parade every 
    game hour. The druid gate is simlar to the one in Butcherblock in that it 
    has nothing but undead around it. Instead of dwarven skeletons, however, they 
    are Revenging Knights. The wizard gate is naturally in the wizard's chamber 
    in a 45+ dungeon). </p>
