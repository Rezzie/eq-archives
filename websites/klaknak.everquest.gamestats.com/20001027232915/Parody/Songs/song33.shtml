        <p>A tale is told of Moggok's Stein <br>
          A journey long and full of time. </p>
        <p>To seek an Ogre by the name of Clurg <br>
          Beyond the swamps you'll hear his dirge.</p>
        <p> Of a book he lost in a distant land <br>
          Near the ocean, in a city of man.</p>
        <p> A book that's full of Exotic drinks<br>
          The Bartender's Compendium or so he thinks.</p>
        <p> To Freeport you go to start this quest <br>
          Look in east and not in west. </p>
        <p>To seek the man, Gregor by name <br>
          He'll tell you his tale, now you must play his game.</p>
        <p> Four things he needs before he gives you the book <br>
          Across all Norrath is where you will look. </p>
        <p>In the Ocean of Tears is the Kiola Nut <br>
          Sold by Sisters in a little grass hut.</p>
        <p> Now on to Rivervale, to buy Honey Jum <br>
          Watch out for those Kneebiters, they're greedy bums.</p>
        <p> Now look for Kizzie in her halfling home <br>
          With 30 gold pieces and three honey combs. </p>
        <p>Give her the stuff, you'll get a Honey Jum jar<br>
          But you're not done yet, you still must go far. </p>
        <p>Now on to Erudin you must travel with haste <br>
          A long journey ahead, there is no time to waste.</p>
        <p>Across hills and cities, across a sea of despair<br>
          Watch out for the Kerrans, that like to dwell there. </p>
        <p>When you reach Hawk's Inn, you will be out of breath <br>
          Just throw down some silver for Innoruuk's Kiss of Death.</p>
        <p> To the Erudin Library you must take the drink <br>
          To Sinnkin Highbrow, on the top floor you think.</p>
        <p> Give her the drink and Erud's Tonic you'll get<br>
          Now just one more item and then you'll be set.</p>
        <p> Now back across Erud's Crossing you go<br>
          To the Temple of Life in the city Qeynos.</p>
        <p> There you must kill a Koalindl Fish <br>
          And finding it's corpse is your fondest wish. </p>
        <p>With caution and care, beware now your life <br>
          For you have just angered the God Rodcet Nife. </p>
        <p>Now if you're smart, don't run back just gate<br>
          Unless you are anxious to meet your fate. </p>
        <p>Go back to Freeport to the bar by the sea <br>
          And look for Gregor, to finish this deed. </p>
        <p>Give all the items including the Jum<br>
          And Gregor will give you the Compendium. </p>
        <p>With the quest almost over, you've but one place to go <br>
          Back down to Ogguk, Way south of Ro.</p>
        <p> In search of the city, through the Feerott you run<br>
          A gloomy place with no light or sun.</p>
        <p> You enter Ogguk and head to the bar <br>
          You can taste it, the end is not far. </p>
        <p>You walk up to Clurg to show him your find <br>
          You give him the book, he says "Here is da Stein".</p>
