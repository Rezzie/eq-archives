      <p align="center">Death story number 1:</p>
      <p align="left"> I was walkin through the west commonlands one day with 
        my enchanter, bored off my arse. I passed the well known derv camp there, 
        and decided to make some trouble. </p>
      <p align="left">I sat down with all the hordes of people waiting for the 
        spawn, and then as soon as the camp respawned I stood up and charmed on 
        of them. Now, at my level, most people don't know about charm, so I ran 
        around in cirlces shouting "Help! Help!" People blasted the thing through 
        and through, but still it wasn't dying. People tried to attack it, but 
        they couldn't. So I ran around, the thing "chasing" me, chaos reigning, 
        when someone nearby said "Run!" </p>
      <p align="left">Now, of course, I thought this was pretty silly, becuase 
        I was running. I was about to make some snide comment, when the next thing 
        I new a hill giant stepped on me. I think I deserved it. </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">Death story number 2: </p>
      <p align="left">I was in Unrest with my halfling warrior, fighting away, 
        having a grand ole time, when I accidently pulled a train. It's Unrest, 
        trains happen, no big deal. I ran and ran, but I was hopelessly far away 
        from the zone, so I used my hat. </p>
      <p align="left">Now, I think I should tell you about my hat. To get this 
        hat, you have to get four skins from all around the world, and a dragoon 
        dirk. I had to walk around for a very long time, spent forever campin 
        the damn alligator skin, paid upwards of 100 plat in expenses (75 pp dirk, 
        10 pp teleport, 1 pp bind, etc etc). After finally spending hours doing 
        this, I finally got it. The hat has 7 ac (or was it nine?) +5 str, +5 
        agi, +5 sv magic, and +10 cha. It also has one charge of "Ring of Commons" 
        (which I think should be renamed to "Save yer Ass"). </p>
      <p align="left">Anyhoo, as I was saying, I used my hat, which mircaulessly 
        wisked me away from the large amounts of undead trying to kill me. I pop 
        not at the druid circle, but at the conveneatly places "Safe Area" that 
        is in every zone. These areas never have bad guys around them, and usually 
        teleport you there when you zone with very little life. Unfourtunely, 
        this Safe Area was also located about 50 feet above the ground. I fell, 
        took 99 damage, and died. This what it looked like</p>

      <p align="left">Anyhoo, I of course petitioned, Guide Neophite of course 
        told me he couldn't help me, but he would have been able to if I had /report'd 
        myself. Luckly, I had a cleric friend nearby who res'd me and arranged 
        for a tp back to Unrest. But still...*grumbles* </p>
