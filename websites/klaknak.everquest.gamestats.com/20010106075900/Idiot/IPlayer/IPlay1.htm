  <p><font size="4">G-String - by James S.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Happily hunting in Blackburrow with 2 other male companions, 
    we are just about to make the climb to the snake pit when a streaker comes 
    zipping past us. 'A streaker?!?!', I thought - not in EQ! So I turn around 
    in time to see a half-naked elf running towards the bridge. Just as I am thinking 
    'Damn, that elf looks like she has a g-string on', the leader of our group 
    says, 'Damn. Did you see that?'. Not liking to slip out of character too often, 
    I merely reply with 'I can't believe they would program a chararcter to look 
    like that!'</p>
  <p align="left">Then our mighty leader decides that he is going to ask the elf 
    if she needs help. So running up to her, we start to describe her to each 
    other in that oh so delicate way that we do when it's just 'the guys'. Being 
    completely sucked into this little gawking episode, I run around behind her 
    to see if my first impression was correct. Yep, looks like she has a g-string 
    on.</p>
  <p align="left">Being that I have such a firm grasp of the english language 
    and wishing to share my thoughts with my companions, I begin to type 'I dig 
    her ass'. I finish typing the second 's' and just as my pinky finger lashes 
    out to strike the 'enter' key - thus making my eloquent thoughts known only 
    to those privileged enough to be in my group - I see the message 'Soandso 
    joins the group' (Soandso being this remarkably garb female elf). I then notice 
    - much to my dismay - that somehow, the message telling me that 'Soandso had 
    joined the group', appears right above my descriptive message.</p>
  <p align="left">Immediately after noticing this detail, I get a /tell from the 
    leader of the group saying 'Dude, she's in our group!' The next thing I see 
    is a group message from Soandso - 'I'm not a sex object'.</p>
  <p align="left">Oh man!!!, says I. But always quick on my feet, I react with 
    blinding speed.</p>
  <p align="left">I turn tail and run.</p>
  <p align="left">As I am running, I hit the disband key - convinced that I will 
    soon get a message from one of the local Gm's that I am going to be kicked 
    off the server. Well, the message doesn't appear, I'm still here, and my face 
    is still red. I send about 30 /tell's to Soandso, apologizing profusely for 
    my inappropriate behaviour.</p>
  <p align="left">Eventually I crawl back the group and throw myself into the 
    task of finding her corpse - desperate to redeem myself. We never did find 
    her corpse because about that time a train of about 15 gnolls comes blazing 
    through the area we are standing in and unceremoniously slaughters everyone 
    but me - I jumped in the water.</p>
