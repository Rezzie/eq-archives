  <p><font size="4">Diary of Cyanna - an EQ &quot;woman&quot; </font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Hiya, CK. This is my series that I posted on your message board. 
    I know you probably cannot publish this on your website since it is a bit 
    racy at times, but I wanted to send it to you in its entirety for your cackling 
    pleasure. It is a bit long, but enjoy! And thanks for all the laughs! Cyanna 
    Thunderhammer </p>
  <p align="left">[Cyanna: Fellatio. Tickler. Al Gore. Ok, the site is officially 
    racy. Post away.]</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, Well, I went home to Halas this week and had lunch 
    with my mom. I had hoped for a quiet lunch of summoned black bread and water, 
    but it was not to be. As, usual she brought up the subject of marriage. Of 
    course she brought up that bimbo, Valkyrie Icemaiden from next door. “She 
    married a very successful doctor”, she said. “Yeah, a WITCH doctor, mom”. 
    “When are you going to settle down, get married and have some kids?” she asked. 
    I told her the closest I have come to settling down is camping for rubicite 
    for 36 straight hours, the closest to marriage is grouping with a really nice 
    monk for a couple of days, and the closest to kids is some low level characters 
    I twinked. I left as soon as I could, but her words stayed in my mind. I am 
    35 level and I still have not found the right man. And I am not getting any 
    younger (unless I go back to Lower Guk). All of my relationships end in a 
    couple of hours, or a day at the most. I resolved to do something about it. 
    I was going to find a man somewhere in Norrath. </p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I met a very nice Wood Elf druid yesterday hunting 
    Aviaks in South Karana. His name was Sylvin. He was dressed simply in leather 
    armor and for a second I thought he was a lost newbie. We met when someone 
    yelled for a SOW and we both came to help. We laughed a bit and talked about 
    our spells. We hit it off pretty well, and hunted for awhile, me tanking and 
    him nuking. Then he asked me out for some foraged berries and water. How could 
    I refuse? He teleported us back to his place in Kelethin. After dinner, we 
    talked for hours. The issue came up about my people wearing polar bear heads 
    for hats and how he was against killing animals for exp. Rather than start 
    a fight, I kept my mouth shut. I should have left right then but he was so 
    darn cute when he was riled. Well, one things led to another and things were 
    getting pretty hot and heavy. That was when he asked me if I had ever done 
    it doggy style. Well, diary, I am always one to experiment so I said no but 
    I was willing to try it. Little did I know what he meant. The next thing I 
    knew he had turned into a dog and started humping my leg and drooling all 
    over me. I quickly cast levitate on myself and jumped off the platform. I 
    heard him howling my name as I gated back to Halas. Sigh. And he was so darn 
    cute, too.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I know what you are going to say, but hear me out. 
    I met a troll shadowknight while running for the zone in Lower Guk. His name 
    was Gristle and he helped me break up a train of rabid frogloks. I thanked 
    him but I noticed he kept staring at me with those big red eyes. “You look 
    good. Gristle want you for dinner” Well, he was a little forward, but I thought, 
    what the heck. He had a huge cucumber like nose and you know, diary, what 
    they say about the size of a man’s nose. He was wearing steel plate armor, 
    so he must have money, too, even if it looked like the greaves were chaffing 
    him a bit. As we headed back to his place I did most of the talking. He was 
    a man of few words, which I liked. Now I am used to men drooling over me but 
    not quite so literally. And his eyes never left me, scanning me up and down. 
    It was kind of a turn on so I was looking forward to getting him back to his 
    place and getting him out of that armor. When we got to his hut in the swamp 
    he drew a nice hot bath for me. Now this is the kind of man I have been looking 
    for. I took off my clothes and as he watched, he licked his lips. I lowered 
    myself into the tub and waited for him to join me. He left the room and came 
    back later with some of those little soaps in the shape of vegetables and 
    dropped them in the tub. He started licking my neck and I started really getting 
    hot. “You taste good”, he rumbled. “Me want to eat you”. I moaned with delight 
    and spread my legs for him. Then he stuck an apple in my you-know-what. “What 
    the heck?”, I thought. Then when he got out the Grobb Cleaver I finally realized 
    what was happening. I rooted him, grabbed my stuff and gated home. I guess 
    what they say about those trolls is true.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I went shopping for spells yesterday in Oasis. While 
    I was talking to the vendor I noticed a large ogre also buying spells. I said 
    hello, and we started talking. He was also a shaman. We talked for a while 
    and although he never said a single word more than one syllable I started 
    to like him. His name was Lugg and for an ogre he was pretty nice. We went 
    out to the dock and sat down, talking about spells, whether 1h blunt or 2h 
    blunt is better, the nerfing of our DOTs and why the hell they are getting 
    rid of rubicite. As we talked I started to look behind his hideous visage 
    and see a kind, gentle, if somewhat stupid, being. Not to mention that fact 
    that I could see the enormous bulge in his banded pants. Just as I started 
    to ask him to come over to my place someone yelled “TRAIN TO ZONE BORDER”. 
    I got up to run and as I turned to see if he was following, I saw him get 
    squished by a sand giant and then ripped to pieces by specters. Sigh. Another 
    one bites the dust.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I was selling my cured silk armor that I had made 
    in Qeynos yesterday. I got a yell from a customer and I headed to a Crow’s 
    Tavern to meet him. Well, I was unprepared for what I saw. The man was gorgeous 
    and what a body. You could do your laundry on his washboard stomach. I knew 
    monks took training seriously but I did not expect this. I stammered a hello 
    and he introduced himself as Marko. After the trade we stayed for drinks. 
    That jerk Crow would not sell to me, but luckily Marko’s faction was good 
    enough. We talked for awhile, but I could tell we were from different worlds. 
    I talked about Halas, and my training as a shaman, but all he talked about 
    was himself and his strict training regimen. I knew we had nothing in common 
    but I hoped at least for a one night stand with this Adonis. I started to 
    turn the conversation around to sex, but it seemed to make him uncomfortable. 
    I pressed on regardless, since it had been quite some time since my last roll 
    in the hay . Finally, I could not take it any longer and just bluntly asked 
    him if he wanted to come back to my place. He jumped up and started punching 
    and kicking the air and I began to doubt his sanity. I heard a voice say “Marko 
    has fallen to the ground” and with that he collapsed on the ground. I used 
    my shaman training and healing spells to revive him but he did not move. Damn. 
    I finally meet a really hot looking guy and he dies on me. Oh, well. Back 
    to the drawing board.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I was hanging out in Felwithe when I heard about 
    a concert going on. A high elf bard named Thelindira was performing. Well, 
    I like music as much as anyone so I headed over to the tavern. There was a 
    huge line of people waiting to get in. I cast Frenzy and pushed my way in. 
    I could not get near the front but since everyone was about 3 feet shorter 
    than me I had no problem seeing the stage. Needless to say the concert was 
    great and Thelindira was a real hotty. And he could sing and play like no 
    one I had ever heard or seen. I just had to meet him. I waited out behind 
    the tavern after the show with a couple dozen other women. Most of them were 
    high elves too, so it only took a couple swings of my ogre war maul to disperse 
    them. Well, when he walked out that stage door, our eyes met and it was electric. 
    He walked right up to me and my heart swooned. I think I said hello, and he 
    smiled and asked me to a party he and his band were having back at the inn 
    he was staying at. I could only nod my head, totally dazzled by his smile. 
    We headed to the inn and up to his room which was already packed with people. 
    The Elven wine was flowing like water and everyone was getting really drunk. 
    Luckily I am a master in Alcohol Tolerance, and I was able to keep my wits 
    about me. I sat on the couch trying to talk to Thelindira, struggling to hear 
    over the booming dance music. Finally, realizing we could not hear each other 
    he pulled me up to the makeshift dance floor. He started doing this goofy 
    white-boy dance hopping around like a chimp on jumjum and I could only watch 
    in horror. He may be able to sing and play, but he had no skill in dancing 
    at all. Unable to watch him caper about any longer a picked him up and carried 
    him to his bedroom. I began to undress him but when I got down to his loin 
    cloth he stopped me. You will not believe what he said, Diary. He actually 
    told me he performs best in a group and wanted to invite 4 other people to 
    join us! Well, I am not an exhibitionist so I told him to get lost. I cast 
    SOW on myself and headed home. My mother always told me not to date musicians.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I was in Rivervale yesterday, buying some small 
    patterns and molds for a friend when I ran into little halfling rogue who 
    introduced himself as Beaner. He was a friendly fellow and after talking a 
    bit about Rivervale he asked me to have a drink with him at the Casino. Well, 
    I am not really into short men, but I figured, “What the heck?”. We went to 
    the bar and he ordered up a round of JumJum Juice. This was my first time 
    drinking it, but I grew up drinking Halas Heaters, so I figured this was nothing. 
    From the size of his jiggling belly, it looked like he was just as well versed 
    in drinking JumJum. Well, we talked for hours, drinking JumJum juice all the 
    while. My vision started getting fuzzy and my speech began to slur. I warning 
    sign in the back of my mind told me that he was trying to get me drunk, but 
    he was quite the charmer, so I let him. Eventually, we were both drunk off 
    our asses and we could hardly walk. He asked me up to his room and with some 
    difficulty we made it. I plopped onto my back on his bed, which creaked with 
    protest. I thought I was going to pass out any minute. Beaner clambered up 
    onto the bed with me and started undoing the buckles on my armor. I tried 
    to stop him but I could not make may arms move. He rolled me over on my back, 
    said “Rogues do it from behind”, and lifted my kilt over my head. I guess 
    the Jum got to him too, because just as he got his pants down around his furry 
    ankles, he barfed all over my back and passed out with a thump on the floor. 
    The next thing I remember is waking up the next morning with a sticky back 
    and listening to his thunderous snores. I went to the bathroom, cleaned myself 
    off and gated home. Important note, Diary. Never again drink JumJum with a 
    halfling.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, The other day I was medding at the zone point in 
    mistmoore. Seated next to me was a cute little gnome Magician named Gyzmo. 
    He was medding to, and since we did not have anything better to do than stare 
    at our spellbooks, we started talking. He was a sweet, shy little guy, if 
    a but old for me. But I have always been attracted to older men. He was also 
    very intelligent, something I do not normally find in men. Although I had 
    no formal teaching back in Halas, he did not overwhelm me or try to impress 
    me with his intelligence. We heard a shout of “TRAIN TO THE ZONE” and we both 
    zoned out. On the other side, I asked him if he lived around here. He said 
    he had a little hut outside Ak’anon. I asked him if I could stop in for a 
    while and have a drink. He told me he still lived at home, but that his parents 
    were away hunting rogue clockworks. I found his shyness and vulnerability 
    very charming. We went back to his house for some milk and . We sat down in 
    the living room and started talking some more. I could tell he was nervous, 
    so I took the initiative. I started stroking his bald head and he cooed in 
    delight. I slowly began to undress and he started sweating and stammering. 
    I then proceeded to take his clothes off and he was shivering with excitement 
    and fear. It was then he confided he had never done anything like this before 
    and did not know what to do. I told him to stick the longest thing he’s got 
    into the hairiest thing I’ve got. He stuck his nose in my armpit.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I was shopping for clothes the other day in Erudin. 
    They have the best clothing stores there and I had heard they were having 
    a sale. I was looking for a nice red dress to go with my new rubicite, when 
    I saw a tall dark and handsome man also looking at the gowns. I figured he 
    was shopping for his girlfriend or wife and went back to my shopping. He came 
    over and introduced himself as Argond the Enchanter. I noticed his pet attacking 
    the saleswoman and pointed it out to him. “Dammit, Jokkobil. Stop. No attack. 
    STOP!” Once he finally got it dispelled he came back over to talk to me. We 
    talked about Erudin and clothes and he was very fun to talk to. I asked him 
    if he was shopping for someone and he said no. Warning bells should have gone 
    off then, but he was quite charming and he had a real eye for fashion. I asked 
    him if he wanted to shop with me. He agreed and we spent the rest of the afternoon 
    shopping. It was wonderful. I had so much in common with him, and I had never 
    met a man who liked clothes and shopping so much. Once we became encumbered, 
    I cast spirit strength on us both and we headed to a local tavern to rest. 
    We talked for a while longer, laughing and just having a really good time. 
    I was really starting to become attracted to him and I began to wonder what 
    he was hiding under that robe. Just then, I saw an old friend of mine from 
    Halas, a barbarian warrior named Hauskald. I called him over and introduced 
    him to my friend, Argond. We asked him to join us, but he said he was meeting 
    some one for some crafted armor. I bid him farewell, and returned to talking 
    to Argond. I noticed he kept asking me questions about my friend, Hauskald. 
    It was then I realized that we had something else in common. HE LIKED MEN! 
    Crap. Another good one wasted. I am beginning to think I will never find a 
    man, Diary.</p>
  <p align="left">Dear Diary, I was hanging out in Najena camping for the Jboots 
    yesterday. My group and I had been camping for hours with no luck, so they 
    all decided to call it quits for the night. Well, I was not prepared to give 
    in, so I yelled for someone to group with. My call was answered by a handsome 
    dark elf in a black robe. He introduced himself as Krezzdin the necromancer. 
    He had an evil grin, and a wicked sense of humor. I had always liked the “bad 
    boys” and this dark elf was especially attractive. I could see in his fiery 
    red eyes he was thinking the same thing about me. He asked me back to his 
    place for some pleasure and pain. Swept up in his dark embrace, I agreed. 
    The whole way back he talked about how he was a master in the use of his Staff 
    of Writhing and I could not wait to find out if he was right. We got back 
    to his dark and somber abode. He snuffed what little light was available and 
    I had to cast serpent sight just to see him. He started to slowly undress 
    me and I started getting really hot. He laid me down on his bed and started 
    to lick me all over. I was moaning and begging him for more. He then got up 
    and pulled a pair of handcuffs from his nightstand. He laid me out spread 
    eagle on the bed and locked my hands and feet to the bedpost. I was really 
    getting turned on and I told him to take me now. He then asked me if I was 
    into “petting”. “Yes”, I purred. He smiled evilly then and conjured up a skeleton! 
    “This is my pet” he said and handed it a barbed leather whip. They both advanced 
    on me and I snapped out of my fantasy. This is getting out of hand, I thought. 
    I easily snapped the restraints meant for those scrawny dark elf females, 
    grabbed my stuff and cast SOC. Now I know why mother always told me to stay 
    away from bad boys. Well, that is the end of my part of the story. Will I 
    ever find TRUE LOVE? Can someone else right a happy ending for me? </p>
