      <p align="left">Dear Gordon: </p>
      <p align="left">Some may say that I have played too much Everquest, but 
        it has occurred to me that since you work on issues involving the game 
        Everquest, you could also work on issues involving my life. The logic 
        here is simple, really. Everquest is my life. Everquest = Life. You work 
        on Everquest, ergo, you can work on my life. Here are some of the issues 
        I need you to work on. If you do not fix them, I will initiate a sit-in 
        on Fennin Ro ... or at my local Blockbuster Video store. </p>
      <p align="left">1. Loot - I work hard at a local video store everyday. I 
        work 8 hours a day and only get paid minimum wage. Bill Gates works the 
        same amount of time, but he is a billionaire. We both work equally hard, 
        so why does he get paid more than me? Please fix this. </p>
      <p align="left">2. Guard kill - Whenever I am in EQ, I like to kill guards. 
        The other night, in the "real world," I was pulled over for lewd driving. 
        When I attacked the police officer with a ****, I was arrested for assaulting 
        an officer with a lewd object (a misdemeanor in all states except Texas 
        where assaulting people you don't like is a constitutional right). Pllease 
        fix this. </p>
      <p align="left">3. Play nice - I was at work the other day (ok, so I really 
        don't work at a video store) and there was only a little coffee left in 
        the coffee pot and it smelled pretty bad. So, I dumped the coffee, cleaned 
        the pot meticulously (just as mother taught me, yes mother) and then made 
        some more coffee. As the coffee was percolating, this woman came up to 
        the pot and stood there waiting for the coffee to brew. When I told her 
        I had dibs on the coffee, she said "I have a meeting, dear, it will only 
        take a second." This is not fair. I went to all of the trouble making 
        the coffee, so I should be able to drink it first! </p>
      <p align="left">4. Name policy - I work with someone named John. This is 
        an obvious reference to the Beatles' John Lennon ... in direct violation 
        of Verant's naming policy. Change it. </p>
      <p align="left">5. Class balance - I was working out at the gym the other 
        day and noticed that this guy named "adiddas" (according to his shirt) 
        could lift more than me. This is not fair. When women see him, they say 
        "ooo, nice butt." I want a nice butt. Either give me a nice butt or nerf 
        his. Otherwise, classes won't be balanced.</p>
      <p align="left"> Thank you for taking the time to address my grievances. 
        I know have to go get my free samples of Clozaril.</p>
      <p align="left"> Sincerely, </p>
