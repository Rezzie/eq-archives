  <hr>
  <p align="center">Superior AI</p>
  <p align="left">Our computer-controlled characters boast artificial intelligence 
    second to none. You will witness guards exhibiting emotions ranging from laziness 
    to apathy as they stand around idly while hostile creatures roam freely about 
    the cities. Monsters know precisely how do defeat you each and every time: 
    once their health is down to 50%, they will flee. You won't be able to follow 
    them, because they will utilize Verant's patented "lag evasion" technique, 
    disappearing into thin air. Ten minutes later the same monster will return, 
    at full health, and slay you while you're sitting to rest.</p>
  <p align="center">Massively Multiplayer Means Massive Human Interaction</p>
  <p align="left">You will be immersed in a world populated by thousands of other 
    real, live people. Whether they play a Human, a Gnome, or an Ogre, you will 
    experience the thrill of witnessing the poorest spelling and grammar and the 
    coarsest profanity of people all across the globe. Thanks to the /shout, /auction 
    and /ooc functions, being miles away from someone speaking will not prevent 
    you from discovering that "Alanon is gay" or "Macros steals kills."</p>
  <p align="center">More Realistic Than Real Life</p>
  <p align="left">In order to provide a worthy challenge for even the most seasoned 
    adventurers, our realism exceeds the real life properties defined by God Himself! 
    Experience being attacked through walls by monsters. Witness the awe of super-intelligent 
    bats, rats and spiders which are capable of opening doors. Want to run for 
    days? No problem. You'll never get tired! Want to swim across the ocean? You 
    can do that, too. Take a trip on the boat across the sea and amaze your friends 
    by walking up through the floor!</p>
  <p align="center">Three Huge Continents and Dozens of Meticulously Detailed 
    Zones</p>
  <p align="left">Marvel at the snowy peaks of Everfrost. Wonder at the magical 
    woods of Faydark. Slosh through the vile swamps of Inoruuk. Each of the three 
    continents of Norrath features dozens of zones (except for the Erudin continent, 
    which only contains two!). Ludicrous load times between zones will allow you 
    ample time to eat, since you won't be doing much of that once you become addicted 
    to EverQuest!</p>
  <p align="center">Breathtaking Graphics</p>
  <p align="left">With the proper hardware, you will enjoy all that EverQuest 
    has to offer - two layer 3D skies, awesome particle effects, mediocre rendered 
    lighting and fancy weather conditions (note: "proper hardware" excludes video 
    cards that were designed earlier than the February, 1999).</p>
  <p align="center">Play Any of 12 Races and a Wide Variety of Distance Classes</p>
  <p align="left">With the exception of the High Elf and Wood Elf races, which 
    are essentially the same races with different skin textures, each of the 12 
    races are more or less unique. Play any character from a Halfling to a Barbarian! 
    Many class differences are so cleverly subtle that people may not have any 
    idea what class you belong to! The classes are also well balanced, except 
    for enchanters, who got the shaft. Good luck trying to solo with your enchanter, 
    losers! We even went so far as to force you to choose a deity to worship. 
    If anyone meets another player who even remembers what deity they chose when 
    creating their character, we (Verant) will pay that person $5000!</p>
  <p align="center">A Multitude of Possibilities</p>
  <p align="left">Be a fisherman, a tailor, or a blacksmith. It's wide open. (Note 
    that you will have to devote a very large portion of your life to EverQuest 
    to become even slightly proficient in any of these skills.) Thirsty? How about 
    some water? Or maybe some milk, if that suits your fancy! The possibilities 
    are limitless! You can play on Rallos Zek, our PvP server (on which every 
    single player in the game will slaughter you for no reason) or one of the 
    other servers (on which mortal enemies such as Dark Elves and High Elves are 
    forced to coexist in perfect harmony). Players who have invested 500+ hours 
    into a character will be rewarded with a character powerful enough to obtain 
    unique clothing, so that you may distinguish yourself from every other member 
    of your race and class!</p>
  <p align="center">A Living Game</p>
  <p align="left">In our valiant haste to make this groundbreaking game available 
    to the general populace, we were forced to overlook certain issues. Enchanters, 
    don't plan on enchanting anything items anytime soon; necromancers, don't 
    expect to concoct any potions through alchemy. But rest assured that we've 
    thought about all that! Every Monday we'll update the game at midnight; we'll 
    also make numerous other alterations during the rest of the week to repair 
    any serious glitches that might have been caused by the update on Monday. 
    Don't worry, we promise by the time EverQuest II is released we'll have EverQuest 
    I pretty much complete! You're In Our World Now!(tm)</p>
  <p align="left">[Note- this was posted after a particularly fustrating night 
    in which Kropdekoms was slaughtered by prisoners in High Keep and the guards 
    didn't lift a finger to help him. He almost deleted his character and canceled 
    his account, but we were able to intervene -- Mark V.]</p>
