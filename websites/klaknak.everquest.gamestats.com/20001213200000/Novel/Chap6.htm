  <p><font size="4">Drunken Monkey Love</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I mentioned before the three stages of drunkenness. Let's reexamine 
    them:</p>
  <p align="left">1. Drunk - There is no subtlety to Drunk. After the first couple 
    beers, you are overcome with this sense of tiredness as if to say &quot;I 
    am really tired&quot; or &quot;Boy, I am really tired.&quot; But soon the 
    tiredness gives way to a sense of overall happiness, especially if you are 
    doing tequila shots or have some beautiful woman listening to your tirade 
    on how to reform sexism in America. This sense of happiness seems as if it 
    will last forever and you begin to wonder if heaven is nothing more than a 
    trip to the local bar.</p>
  <p align="left">But soon, with the hammer-like strength of Thor on PCP, you 
    are hit by The Wall (never ever think you hit The Wall, it hits you). Athletes 
    out there know all about the wall. They are running the best race of their 
    life, miles ahead of the person beside them, when suddenly they feel extremely 
    tired and fall on their face stone cold dead.</p>
  <p align="left">A similar thing happens during the latter stages of Drunk:</p>
  <p align="left">Ralph: So, you see, baby, if men and women, could like, you 
    know, just like LOVE each other, man, then sexism would like ... If men could 
    just love women, babe, because you are so pretty huh huh ... ah ... Gawk!</p>
  <p align="left">Can you pinpoint the exact time where I hit the wall?</p>
  <p align="left">Around the word &quot;because&quot; I am suddenly and without 
    warning hit with the worst case of Spins in the history of drunken thought. 
    As fear begins to grow in my belly like a cancerous motorcycle with weedwhackers 
    on its wheels, I desperately attempt to make the killing blow with the woman 
    I have been speaking with, but soon I am ...</p>
  <p align="left">2. Sober - I am not sure why this Sober stage occurs, but it 
    does. I think it may be because even though you know you are spinning because 
    you are drunk, the ancestor monkey brain deep inside your limbic system thinks 
    you are spinning wildly in the jaws of a Wooly Mammoth and is pumping your 
    body full of adrenaline. The adrenaline overcomes your drunken state and you 
    are left staring at the woman you have been talking to for the past ... (looks 
    at his watch) ... holy cow! 3 days?!?! ... um ... you are left staring at 
    the woman you have been talking to with the dumbest look on any man's face 
    since Eve asked Adam if he remembered to pick up his socks.</p>
  <p align="left">It as this time that you think you can drive home with the blood/alcohol 
    content of .98. Luckily for society, you soon reach stage 3 before you can 
    pay the tab, let alone reach your car ...</p>
  <p align="left">3. Unconsciousness. Here our story continues.</p>
  <p align="left">I awoke on a boat to somewhere. In front of me, men and women 
    of all colors and stripes (seriously, all colors and stripes!) were disappearing 
    and reappearing in front of my eyes. A white mako shark hovered above the 
    head of a man named &quot;Euthanazi.&quot; I didn't have a lawyer sitting 
    beside me, but I was sure, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that if he reappeared 
    I WOULD tell him about the bats because it was the 90's for chrissake.</p>
  <p align="left">I sat up quickly (there is no other way to do it in this accursed 
    game) and immediately fell back on the fish gut stained deck floor. Nearby, 
    several warriors spoke:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I think Kirk is sexier.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You are so provincial. Picard's butt is rock hard. Did 
    you see him on Saturday night? He said, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen ... Salt 
    and Pepa! He said it, like, in his Shakespeare voice.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh, be nice!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Was I still in Norrath? I couldn't be sure.</p>
  <p align="left">One thing I was sure of was that my bladder was about to explode 
    so I carefully pulled myself to the side of the boat hoping my instrument 
    was long enough to prevent me from having to stand up.</p>
  <p align="left">I fumbled for a few moments and realized that I did not have 
    a groin. It was not that I was missing any valuable pieces, it just wasn't 
    there. I ripped open my pants, and pasted on the asexual bulb that represented 
    my groinal area was a sticker proudly claiming &quot;Courtesy of Ralph Reed 
    and the Center for Agroinality in Computer Games.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I began to feel dizzier as the import of this sticker slowly 
    sank in. The world began to swirl around my head and all the warriors on the 
    boat started cackling at me:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Bwahah!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Bwahah!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The mako shark put on a top hat and a monocle and asked:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I say my dear fellow, do you have a groin I can borrow?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The warriors fell over laughing and began clutching their stomachs.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No!&quot; I screamed and began to stand up, clutching 
    my groinal area to my chest.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ralph,&quot; the shark said. &quot;I am your groin.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The world continued to swirl.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No,&quot; I said. &quot;That's unpossible!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The shark smirked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Search your feelings, Ralph,&quot; he said. &quot;You 
    know it to be ... heh heh. I can't do this. Bwahahaha.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The shark vanished.</p>
  <p align="left">The entire ship vanished.</p>
  <p align="left">I passed out.</p>
  <p align="left">***</p>
  <p align="left">When I awoke, I was lying on a single plank of wood in the middle 
    of a vast sea. I reached down to touch my groin and found that it was still 
    gone. I began to cry.</p>
  <p align="left">Visions began mixing in my tears and I realized that I had been 
    here before.</p>
  <p align="left">No, it was not me ... and yet it somehow was me.</p>
  <p align="left">I had many names ... the somewhat anemic Elriccc of Tamborine, 
    the slightly mad Von Cleft Lip the Lesser, the charmingly irritating Chad 
    of the Mumble People, the ignoble Sir Cheetsalot ...</p>
  <p align="left">But were these men really me? Was I really part of some kind 
    of eternal quest through the dimensions fighting in the cosmic battle between 
    ... what? Good and evil? Tasteful and tacky? Kirk and Picard?</p>
  <p align="left">More names rushed into my head ... Nixon of Whittier, Joe of 
    Fitzgerald, John Prosper the Hero with Hands Out to His Sides Waiting for 
    a Chance to Use Them?</p>
  <p align="left">Again, the world swirled around me and I felt as if I would 
    pass out. As the light dimmed along the corners of my vision and began to 
    creep towards the center, I heard a faint swishing sound, as if a boat was 
    drawing near or an elephant was swatting mosquitos with a large pamphlet.</p>
  <p align="left">Just before I lost consciousness, a large man with incredible 
    mustaches peered down at me from the edge of a small rowboat.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I am the Warrior in Brown Slacks,&quot; he said. &quot;And 
    I am hear to help.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I passed out.</p>
