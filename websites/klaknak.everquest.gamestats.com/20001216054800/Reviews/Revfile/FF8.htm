<p align="center"><font size="4">Final Fantasy 8 by Gavin Sith</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Final Fantasy 8 Review I got FF8 on 9-8-99 (Babbage's is the ultimate 
  gaming store, they get everything a day early), and I have been dying to do 
  a nice, lengthy review for it. Well, I concede to you, O Amazing-Klaknak-Whose-Comments-On-Satanic-Computer-Games-Had-Me-Sprawled-Out-On-The-Floor-Laughing, 
  please publish this review of FF8, for we must warn everyone of the dangers 
  it brings (dangers such as eating away your EQ'ing time <shudder>).</p>
<p align="left">Anyway, as I said earlier, I am writing a lengthy review, and 
  those who don't want to read it all can immediately scroll down to the bottom 
  for my two word review. If I don't forget that is, see, this will take me a 
  little while to write this and I most likely will forgot everything I said up 
  here, but we'll see. </p>
<p align="left">Now, onto the game itself. Personally, FF7 was my second favorite 
  console game ever (Metal Gear Solid was my first). I loved the materia system, 
  the story, the characters, the battle engine, everything about it, and I am 
  happy to report that FF8 both improves on FF7 and innovates and creates many 
  new features that I think everyone will love. First, I'll start with the story, 
  as in necessary of every review in existence. You play Squall Leonhart, a student 
  at a place called Garden. There you learn about combat and train to be a mercenary. 
  If you pass your field exam where you actually are sent on a mission, you become 
  a SeeD, a person who can be contracted to do mercenary work. I don't want to 
  spoil it so I'll about leave it at here, but along the way you meet many colorful 
  characters as well as the woman who captures your heart. One quick note though, 
  I love the story much more than FF7 or nearly any other RPG (Xenogears and FF8 
  are about equal storyline-wise). It has a very military theme with the mercenary 
  aspect, and it appeals to a much more mature audience, in my opinion.</p>
<p align="left">Anyway, with that aside, on to the game! Second, the graphics. 
  Wow! Amazing! Fantastic! Great! Incredible! I'd say more but I have a crappy 
  thesaurus and my mind works better thinking of synonyms for words and phrases 
  such as "inkie," "foul beast," and "corrupt militia." Anyway, the graphics are 
  great. I think they are the best pre-rendered backgrounds on PSX (for the un-technically 
  enlightened, those are the backgrounds that look real pretty, and they don't 
  move because they just stay there, which is why they can be so pretty), and 
  while the polygonal characters are great, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver has to 
  set the new standard for 3D graphics on PSX. Back to the polygonal characters 
  for a sec, though. Guess what? Squall, Seifer, Rinoa . . . they look like HUMAN 
  BEINGS! Amazing, ain't it? Gone are the super-deformed heads, short bodies, 
  and hair two times the actually height of the person (the subject of many of 
  my nightmares)! It also makes the story much more believable, because I can 
  understand the sorrow, love, and real human emotions that people who look like 
  human beings could be facing. On the other hand, when you look like you just 
  came out from being under an iron, it's much less serious.</p>
<p align="left">Then there are the FMV's. Squaresoft is the FMV master. An FMV 
  is obviously a priority to them, and it shows. Bah to those who don't think 
  FMV is immersive! I think it is MORE immersive! I stare at the TV with my mouth 
  gaping open, and if it is a particularly long RPG, a puddle of saliva is usually 
  at my feet. When it is an in-game cut scene or I am doing it, I actually have 
  to think about what I am doing, and sometimes I feel it detracts from the experience, 
  I can't concentrate what's at hand. While discovering the story through dialogue 
  is wonderful, I still love FMV as much as the next gamer.</p>
<p align="left">Third, the sound. Pretty well done. I'm not going to stay on this 
  topic long. Some music I really like, other I hate. I liked FF7's music much 
  more though.</p>
<p align="left">Fourth, gameplay. Ah, the real meat of the game. This will keep 
  you interested for a long time. We all have different descriptions of what this 
  is, and for me it is the battle engine, control, magic system, etc. The battle 
  engine is the basic combo of real-time/turn-based. You can't cast, attack, use 
  item, etc. until your little bar fills up. Sometimes I would revert to my other 
  RPG's and concentrate on a well-thought out attack plan when an enemy attacks 
  and I go "Huh? What? Oh, right, this is FF8." I like both systems a lot, though, 
  and a happy medium of both is nice. The magic system, now THAT is something 
  I like! While the Draw System (brief explanation: magic is treating as an item 
  basically. You get magic from enemies: use the draw command and get a random 
  number [up to 9] fires, thunders, cures, etc. depending on what you chose to 
  draw or get magic from a draw point) is pretty nice (just stack 100 of everything, 
  by the way, 100 is max capacity, and you can usually find monsters that you 
  can draw the basics [cure, fire, thunder, blizzard, and fire] from between each 
  mission), I still miss the amazing customization of materia. Though I do enjoy 
  never running out of MP and having to use an Ether in the middle of a boss fight 
  . . . as long as I have some magic stocked up, I'm fine.</p>
<p align="left">Now what I really like is the Junction System. Let's take a character 
  and I'll explain. How about . . . Squall. Your basic Squall can attack. That 
  is it. No other commands. But if you junction a GF (stands for Guardian Force, 
  they are basically summons) to Squall, many new realms of possibility open up. 
  You are allowed to set ability commands (item, draw, GF, and magic), which brings 
  up a tough question, since you can only set 3 commands. Do you want draw, magic 
  (having draw and magic is a must), and item, or draw, magic, and GF. Really 
  does make you wonder what is necessary. So, with this GF junctioned to Squall, 
  I can also do other stuff. I can junction magic to certain things. Def, Atk, 
  and Mag. Def increased HP, Atk makes you do more damage, and Mag (I am not positive 
  though) makes your magic stronger. If I junction fire to Def, it will give me 
  a little HP, if I junction Cure to Def though, my HP will go up a lot. Same 
  as putting Fire, Thunder, Blizzard, etc. on Atk makes you attack much better 
  then putting Cure on it does. </p>
<p align="left">Also, if you have enough GF's (you can junction more than one 
  GF to someone), you can do elemental attacks and defenses and status attacks 
  and defenses. If I junction Fire to elemental attack, then I get a percent and 
  that is the chance I have of my attack being an attack that is fire-based. Basic 
  fire might increase the percent a little, where is Firaga (an upgraded Fire) 
  will make the percent go up more. Same thing works for elemental defenses, junction 
  Firaga to it, and you could half every fire hit you take. If you get it to 100%, 
  you take no damage, and any higher than that and you will absorb every hit you 
  take of that type. Same with status attacks and defenses. Junction blind to 
  status attack and you have a percent chance of your attack put the effect blind 
  on them. Same works for status defense. It's customization, and I love it.</p>
<p align="left">But that's not all! Your GF's can also learn abilities. Set the 
  GF Shiva to learn SumMag20%, and when she learns it, when you summon Shiva, 
  she will do 20% more damage than the base Shiva would. GF's learn abilities 
  by gaining AP (ability points). After each fight, you usually get some AP. A 
  basic battle with a crappy enemy will garnish 1 AP, a boss fight might get you 
  6. These abilities are pretty varied too. You can learn commands that let you 
  add another ability to your ability list (*groan* more decisions . . . item 
  or card . . . hmm). There are also abilities that let you take items and refine 
  them into magic. Use the RF-Fire (not the right letters, I know) ability and 
  use up 1 Magic Stone (or something like that) and you have 10 Firagas. The Junction 
  system is great and I wish Square kept some of their old systems in each new 
  FF game.</p>
<p align="left">Fifth, replay value. I personally don't have the time to play 
  a 40+ hour RPG more than once. But plenty of things along the way can make this 
  40+ hour RPG into a 60+ hour RPG. There is the obligatory raising of chocobos 
  from all FF games, as well as the mini-game "Triple Triad" that is a card game 
  which is a constant theme throughout the whole game, and because it IS the mini-game, 
  it is complex and comprehensive, unlike the multitude of simple mini-games in 
  FF7. If you have the free time though, go for it and you will probably replay 
  the game two or three times.</p>
<p align="left">Sixth, Limit Breaks. Well, the gameplay section was so huge I 
  thought that I just make a section for Limit Breaks. For those who played FF7, 
  you will remember that when you got beat-up enough, you could fight back with 
  a super-attack that essentially "layed the smackdown" on either a single or 
  all enemies. Limit Breaks are a bit different this time around though. You can 
  only do a Limit Break when you are in the yellow (not sure what the exact percent 
  and below of HP that is), and they all involve player input. For Squall's, you 
  have to hit the R1 button at the right time to use the "trigger" on his Gunblade 
  weapon. For Zell, you have to input commands like a fighting game because he 
  is a hand-to-hand kind of guy. For Rinoa, you teach her dog (named Angelo) tricks, 
  and they restore health, revive KO'ed guys, damage the enemy, etc. I actually 
  like them more than the FF7 limit breaks. They are more of a last resort this 
  time, which is what I think they should be.</p>
<p align="left">Final Verdict? This is an absolutely amazing game and most likely 
  will become my Number 1 console game as I get further into it. I have heard 
  lots of complaints about no innovation and that this is FF7 1.5, but I don't 
  know what they are talking about. I see FF8 as a completely new game with new 
  innovations, magic systems, and very few things borrowed from FF7. The other 
  complaint is too many random fights, but I think that's a basic part of RPG's 
  we'll always deal with. I give FF8 a 99% because I think no game is in a sense 
  "perfect," and the 1% off is for too many random fights, which I agree with 
  to a sense. </p>
<p align="left">Oh yeah! The running guy thing (by the way, who remembers Running 
  Man with Arnold Schwerzanagger (major, major, major sic), didn't that movie 
  rock) . . . umm, I give it a 4, and if EQ is down and you go to play it, it 
  gets a 5 because once you start playing you WILL forget about EQ until your 
  power goes out right before the save point <grumble> stupid hurricane <grumble>. 
  Two word review (I didn't forget): IT RULES!</p>
<p align="left">Send all comments, questions, spam, d00dish replies (i.e. U SuK! 
  Ur ReVeW Iz CrApY!), flames, and porn ads that make me think I have 30 e-mails 
  when it is really just 3 to GavinSith@aol.com Adrak, level 20 bard of the Rathe 
  Server.</p>
