      <blockquote> 
        <p>I work at a large insurance company in the IS department. Recently 
          we got a memo saying that our company had been purchased by Verant. 
          All of the executives were let go and the big three, Brad, Smed, and 
          Gordo took over. The memo then went on to discuss changes that were 
          going to be made to bring the company in line with the new Vision ™. 
          Here is a copy of that memo.
        <p> Patch Update: July 17th, 2000.<br>
          Greetings all! We want to welcome all of you to the Verant family. We 
          know rumors have been circulating about the recent take over and we 
          want to assure everyone that nothing bad is going to happen and that 
          we take care of our employees just like we do our customers. However, 
          the old management was based on ideas and rules that do not conform 
          to those of the Verant Vision ™. So we will be making some changes as 
          follows: 
        <p>1. We are doing away with specific cubicles. This will encourage people 
          to get out and explore the building more. Terminals and phone will be 
          placed all around the building and people can log on and use them wherever 
          they are. The exception to this will be IS people. They can only log 
          onto specific terminals placed in out of the way places and they cannot 
          log on themselves but must ask a coworker from another area to log on 
          for them. This will encourage people to socialize more, thus increasing 
          morale. 
        <p>2. Since this company is new to the Verant family we are going to reduce 
          all salaries across the board. However, companies previously under the 
          Verant umbrella will not be affected by the salary decrease. We have 
          no justification for this except we like to screw with you.
        <p> 3. All departments will now have factions. If you are working on a 
          project that requires the aid of another department, you must do quests 
          for that department to build up faction before they will help you. For 
          example, if you are in Accounting and you need IS to make some changes 
          to one of your reports, you must go to the appropriate programmer and 
          give them donuts until they view you warmly. This will also have repercussions 
          for lowering faction. In the above example, if you persist in calling 
          the network admin because you forgot your password for the hundredth 
          time you may become KOS (i.e. “You idiots bring out the worst in me. 
          Prepare to die, A_Stupid_User01”). One note, Auditing will be KOS to 
          all other groups. 
        <p>4. All office supplies may be ordered through the new company store. 
          The store will be on the Intranet and supplies can be ordered from there. 
          The store will be up for 5 min, during which we will lose all of the 
          orders placed at that time. After that, you must purchase all of your 
          own supplies with your own money. No ETA on when the store will be back 
          up.
        <p> 5. Design documents for new projects will no longer be available from 
          the users. They can only be obtained from high level executives who 
          you must find and then beat the design specs out of them. However, only 
          about .0000000001% of the executives will actually have the specs. It 
          is best to corner them in the following zones: “Country Club”, “Board 
          Room”, “Golf Course”, and “Mistress’ Bedroom”. 
        <p>6. We have decided to redo the promotion process. If you apply for 
          a promotion and you do not receive it, you will actually be demoted 
          to a lower salary grade. This adds fun and excitement to the process 
          since you never know if you apply for that supervisor job, whether you 
          will get it or wind up plunging toilets. 
        <p>7. Just to show that we can be bastards to everyone equally, we are 
          going to restructure the executive level positions. Formerly an executive 
          would get a raise every year if they performed their job at a satisfactory 
          level. Under the new plan, every high level executive will only get 
          a raise every 2 years at first and then increase a year thereafter (i.e. 
          first raise at 2 years, next raise at 3 years, next at 4 years, etc). 
          This saves us money and makes sure they keep working since they cannot 
          afford to retire. 
        <p>8. We understand that due to staffing problems in the past, certain 
          people were “cross trained” to handle multiple tasks. We felt this was 
          not fair to the people who are too stupid to learn new things so we 
          felt we had to balance the situation. If you are capable of doing your 
          work plus someone else’s, you will now be penalized by having to work 
          twice as many hours for the same amount of pay. So those “hybrids” will 
          be slaving over their work, while the incompetent morons head out to 
          happy hour. 
        <p>9. We found that too many people where making enough money to retire 
          early. This is unacceptable. We have instituted a new rule such that 
          you only get raises every four years, followed by a two-year period 
          of no raises. Again, this saves us money and keeps the employees working. 
        <p>10. We have noticed there are 2 kinds of employees, those with social 
          lives and those without. In the past, preference was given to people 
          with spouses, children, and social obligations, but no more. Unless 
          you have the time to work for days on end without stopping for sleep, 
          food, social interaction, etc, you will never get a raise, bonus, or 
          recognition of any kind. Also, we are switching out everyone’s computers 
          with IBM XT’s with 640K of RAM and changing our current network server 
          to an Atari 2600. This insures that unless you can devote at least 20 
          hours a day to your job, you will never get any projects finished. 
        <p>11. It has come to our attention that certain individuals are working 
          so efficiently that they accomplish their tasks without the aid of coworkers. 
          This is unacceptable since we want people to have to rely on their lazy, 
          ignorant, incompetent coworkers to get anything accomplished. These 
          people will undergo a “brain nerf”. Where applicable, you will be notified 
          of the time and date of your surgery. The Auditing department is exempt 
          since everyone hates them anyway.
        <p> 12. We have decided to replace all managers with lazy, uncaring, sadistic 
          bastards. These new managers will ignore all your pleas for help or 
          information, and never let you call in sick, since all employees are 
          lying, lazy jerks anyway. However, if you happen to belong to the Payroll 
          department or any other large, powerful group, you will be given special 
          perks, like bonuses, parties, and the key to the executive washroom. 
        <p>13. In the past, whenever there was a disagreement between coworkers, 
          or groups of coworkers, a manager would step in and resolve the conflict. 
          As stated above, the new managers will be too lazy and apathetic to 
          do this anymore, so all conflicts must be resolved among coworkers. 
          The exception are those employees who belong to the large groups discussed 
          in #12 above for whom the manager will step in and give them anything 
          they want, including firing the offending coworkers. 
        <p>14. All paychecks will be given out by a single person in payroll named 
          Joan Smith. Joan only works for 1 hour a week and her schedule is secretly 
          changed every week. Anyone wanting their paychecks must wait outside 
          her office until she arrives and even then she only passes out a few 
          of them if any. 
        <p>15. We realize the company has been growing and that there is a shortage 
          of office space. We have decided to open a new subsidiary in another 
          state to help ease the overcrowding. A bus will be available to shuttle 
          employees back and forth, but it will break down at least 95% of the 
          time. The new subsidiary will offer many advancement opportunities, 
          but the salaries will be below the industry and company averages. We 
          expect people to flock to the new area.
        <p> 16. We have decided to change the IS policies and procedures to match 
          those of Verant’s. Therefore, all testing is banned, interoffice communication 
          is to be stopped, and all software changes will be done with making 
          things as inconvenient to the users as possible in mind. 
        <p>17. In order to make your jobs as exciting as possible we have decide 
          to institute random firings. High level executives will roam the cubicled 
          halls firing people on a whim. We feel that this will add fun to your 
          job, and with the also mentioned salary cuts, make the risk vs. reward 
          of this company a place you want to work. 
        <p>18. We realize that there may be some problems with these policies. 
          If you have any questions you can either be ignored by your lazy, apathetic, 
          manager, or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:autodelete@verant.com">autodelete@verant.com</a>. 
        <p>Thanks and remember, “You are working for our company now.”
