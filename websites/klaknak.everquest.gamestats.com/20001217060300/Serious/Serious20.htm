  <p>The Art of Not Being Funny - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Where I help Machiavelli reconcile his pro-republic sentiment 
    with his need to keep his job, meet my true love, and explain why I haven't 
    written anything Everquest related in a while.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left">I had been waiting for the last couple weeks for the first criticisms 
  to come rolling in and finally, yesterday, they appeared on the message boards. 
  Let me quote some:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;You suck!&quot; - Dan Danson</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Ummmmm.. just checking, Im not sure if anyone else has noticed 
  this, but CK seems to be directing his humor to other venues... Don't get me 
  wrong, his work today "A Nonpartisan Takeover of the Cackling Klaknak" had me 
  in tears. I really want to know where the heck he finds these quotes, they are 
  killing me... =) I kinda miss the story... the guy with the sandwich... I miss 
  the stuff he used to do about the game... Ok.. so I quit EQ cause I got tired 
  of it being "EverCamp: A game of sitting on your ygg waiting for one givling 
  thing to happen"... I still thought his humor to the game was hysterical... 
  I think possibly I should not make waves, but I figure at this rate maybe CK 
  would be bored... CK... your humor kills me... You have insights that boggle 
  the mind how your mind works to achieve them... I guess what Im asking is what 
  are YOU looking at doing then?&quot; - Taib</p>
<p align="left">First of all, Taib ... you are banned from the site.</p>
<p align="left">Second, he has basically summed it up nicely.</p>
<p align="left">I try my best to update the webpage every day (except on weekends 
  when I am working like a dog), but sometimes I simply don't have the muse on 
  my side. This has been especially true since my love for Everquest has dissipated 
  somewhat. Of course, I still have a wart on my fanny about a lot of other things 
  (politics, the Christian Coalition, flavored coffee), so whenever I cant think 
  of something funny to say about Everquest, I simply jump to other topics.</p>
<p align="left">I don't feel really bad about doing this, but I do feel a trifle 
  guilty. I don't think, even on a theme page, that the author should necessarily 
  be confined (confin-ation being the death of all creativity), but I can understand 
  if people coming for EQ humor are a little put off when I start ranting about 
  Ralph Reed.</p>
<p align="left">So let me explain a little bit why I have fallen off the EQ wagon. 
  I have tried to overcome some of these issues, but so far I have failed.</p>
<p align="left">1. Character creation. It is simple, really. I am really tired 
  of playing a spellcaster but I cringe at the idea of not having gate or bind. 
  I don't use gate or bind (usually) to escape monsters; I use these spells so 
  that 80% of my limited playing time is not spent travelling to and fro. This 
  drove me absolutely nuts when I was in a guild. I would come on and everyone 
  would be in Befallen. So I would travel to Befallen. Then I would not play the 
  game for a couple days (or even one day). When I came back, everyone was in 
  Paw. Or the Gorge. Or Freeport, wherever. I found that I was spending all my 
  damn time running back and forth so I could group with people. That is just 
  flat out boring. So what character should I choose? I dunno. I want to whack 
  things with some serious authority, but I don't want to spend all of my time 
  running everywhere.</p>
<p align="left">2. Grouping. I hate grouping. There, I said it. The traditional 
  RPGer inside of me wants to say: &quot;Oh, hey this is neat ... it encourages 
  comradeship, etc.&quot; But it is time for me to be honest. I hate grouping. 
  I am a rugged individualist and I resent having to group with people against 
  my will. I want to have the choice. Of all the characters I have considered 
  playing next, the Ranger has been top of my list because I think the Ranger 
  represents what I want my character to be all about. But please see #1.</p>
<p align="left">3. Player Run Economy. I have already beat this horse into the 
  ground, but let me just say it again. The player run economy is stupid.</p>
<p align="left">So there you have it. I am really kinda down on Everquest right 
  now and am trying desperately to rekindle some kind of flame. We will see what 
  happens.</p>
<p align="left">Also, as you all know, Asheron's Call is coming out, but I wonder 
  if my problems with Everquest are going to be found there too. In truth, I wonder 
  if my problems with Everquest are really problems with the multiplayer genre 
  in general. It just seems to me that all the craziness and stupid code changes 
  that come about are not due to the ineptitude of the designers but are due to 
  the greedy idiocy of players.</p>
<p align="left">Yeah, that's right, I said it. I am beginning to wonder if Everquest 
  and its ilk are nothing more than experiments in crowd control. It just has 
  to be so very hard to create a game based on creative choices when you have 
  thousands of people trying to do everything they can to screw the system.</p>
<p align="left">So shame on you! </p>
<p align="left">heh heh.</p>
<p align="left">CK</p>
<p align="left">P.S. If you are also disillusioned with EQ, send me an email. 
  Perhaps tomorrow I will post a long submission from all of you guys. Also, if 
  you think EQ is still an awesome game, send your hints and tips along. I will 
  post them too. Save the Klaknak ... and save yourselves! </p>
<p align="left">Heh heh. I really am an egomaniac.</p>
