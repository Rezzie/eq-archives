  <p><font size="4">Gotta Maintain</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">&quot;Welcome to Everquest,&quot; my half-eaten rice and salad 
    sandwich said.</p>
  <p align="left">Ok. Fine. I gotta maintain. Just maintain until the effects 
    of Zoloft, 3 year old beer, 3 year old pot and 10 year old car carpet wear 
    off.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Gotta maintain,&quot; I repeated out loud.</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich snorted in derision.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok smart ass,&quot; I said, scolding my sandwich. &quot;What 
    exactly is Everquest.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">A beautiful voice chimed in my head.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;EverQuest&quot; she said, &quot;allows thousands of gamers 
    from all over the world to adventure solo, at great peril, or join forces 
    with online allies to fight off enemies together. The Station@sony.com is

  <p align="left">&quot;I see,&quot; I replied.</p>
  <p align="left">For the first time I noticed that the City of Elves was built 
    across a series of gigantic trees.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;And what is this place again?&quot; I asked. But the voice 
    was gone.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;This is Kelethin,&quot; my sandwich said. &quot;City of 
    the Wood Elves.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I took a deep breath and began rummaging in my pockets for some 
    cigarettes. Without surprise, I noticed that I had no pockets and was wearing 
    some sort of form fitting cloth thing.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;And why am I here?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You are now a Wood Elf,&quot; my sandwich said. &quot;You 
    are a Wood Elf Ranger in the city of Kelethin.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I see,&quot; I said. I began looking around nervously, 
    ready to run in case the Lenin Leprachauns tried to sneak up on me.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;By the way&quot; my sandwich said. &quot;Your name was 
    rejected.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Eh?&quot; I asked, desperately searching the side of my 
    pants for some cigarettes, wary of the leprachauns.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Your name ... Ralph ... it was rejected. You are now known 
    as Gayfeather.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok,&quot; I said. &quot;Gayfeather, fine.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Secretly I cringed. But then I remembered what Jim had said 
    several months earlier after I had hallucinated riding a single prong fork 
    across a moon prairie:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Never try and interpret your dreams, man&quot; he said. 
    &quot;It will freak you out, guaranteed. Just go with it.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Gotta maintain,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">Something was chafing my back. I reached back and found that 
    I was wearing a small animal skin pack, so I flung it off my shoulder and 
    began rummaging around in it. It contained several small chunks of yellow 
    food, a skin of water, a sword, a scroll and a book.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Gotta maintain,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Look,&quot; said my sandwich. &quot;I realize this must 
    be hard for you, but I think it is important you realize how lucky you are 
    to be involved in such an amazing adventure. I mean, Everquest is overseen 
    by Sony, for christ's sake.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. &quot;I guess ... Is Everquest a game 
    of some kind?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yes it is,&quot; said my sandwich. &quot;It is an online 
    multiplayer universe.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I rummaged again for some cigarettes.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Why don't you try foraging,&quot; my sandwich said. &quot;You 
    are a ranger after all.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I began rummaging around on the ground. I found some worms.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You have foraged some fish grub!&quot; my sandwich said, 
    with great excitement.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ah,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">When I was 18, some friends and I ate some peyote buttons and 
    sat around eating off a huge block of chocolate all day. When we came out 
    of the trip, our couch was gone. Perhaps this fishing grub was a dehallucinator 
    or something. I ate them.</p>
  <p align="left">There was no effect.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok,&quot; I said, wiping some goo from my lips. &quot;So 
    what do I have to do to get out of this game?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Simple,&quot; my sandwich said. &quot;You must kill the 
    Lady Vox.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My stomach grumbled.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Excellent,&quot; I said. &quot;Will we be done in time 
    for dinner? I'm hungry.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No,&quot; it said. &quot;It will probably take you a while 
    to do that.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok, what do I need to do?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">My sandwich was suddenly very excited.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok,&quot; it said. &quot;First you need to deliver this 
    note to your guild master. His name is Maesyn Trueshot and he is in Faydark's 
    Champions straight ahead. Let's go.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Guildmaster, right&quot; I said. If there was one thing 
    I had learned after several years of abusing my body, it was to go with the 
    flow. If I just relax, and let the world come to me, everything would be just 
    fine. So I picked up my pack, put it on my back and walked inside the guild 
    hall.</p>
  <p align="left">Inside, several people stood around casting spells and there 
    was a beautiful butterfly looking thing in the corner. This was more like 
    it.</p>
  <p align="left">I also noticed that there were names floating over the heads 
    of the &quot;elves.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Go with the flow,&quot; I said. &quot;Go with the flow.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I found Maesyn.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yo, G, what up?&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Um, Roger?&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yes, sandwich.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You may be a wood elf, but you are still white.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh, right&quot; I said. &quot;So how do I talk to this 
    guy?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Just say Hail,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ok. Hail Maesyn!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Maesyn's voice boomed inside the small guild hall. I nearly 
    had a heart attack.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;'Welcome to Kelethin Gayfeather,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
    am Maesyn Trueshot commander of Faydark's Champions. We are the finest marksman 
    in all of Norrath. With our trusty Trueshot Longbows we can miss no target 
    no matter what the distance or the conditions.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ask him what a Trueshot Longbows is,&quot; my sandwich 
    said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What is a trueshot longbow?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">Maesyn stood silent, staring into the distance.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No, ask him what a Trueshot Longbows is. Use the plural.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; I said. &quot;What is a Trueshot Longbows?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Maesyn again exploded giving me another near fatal heart attack.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;&quot;The Trueshot Longbow,&quot;&quot; he said. &quot;is 
    created by my famed father, Eldin Trueshot. It is quite accurate and takes 
    a rangers skill to wield. We use our new recruits to gather materials needed 
    by my father. We shall soon begin to release it's formula to all good elves 
    so all may fletch such a bow.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Tell him you will gather materials,&quot; my sandwich 
    said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I will gather materials,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;'Take this pack,&quot; he boomed. &quot;You will go to 
    Kaladim and find Trantor Everhot and ask for Dwarven Wire. Then go to Freeport 
    to meet a Jyle Windshot, search the inns, ask him for Treant Wood. Then collect 
    some Spiderling Silk from spiderlings and Finally in Steamfont, we have the 
    permission of the dwarves to use any Micro Servos we find while destroying 
    rogue spiders. Combine them all and return the pack to me.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh that won't be too hard,&quot; said my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">A sarcastic sandwich. This was a world class hallucination.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Now give him your letter,&quot; my sandwich said and I 
    did, but I was feeling very impatient and hungry and started feeling that 
    emotion known in the Crayola box of emotions as Low Blood Sugar Surly.</p>
  <p align="left">'Hail Gayfeather, and welcome..&quot; said Maesyn.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yeah, yeah ... hail. Ok, give me something,&quot; I said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I am Maesyn Trueshot, leader of Faydark's Champions.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No shit, really? Is that why you have that name floating 
    over your head?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;I will teach and train you, as I have done for many others.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I can be a Jedi, Yoda. I know I can! I can do it!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;Let's get started.. here, put this on..&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Shove it up your ass.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;It'll help protect you against the elements.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ooo, a shitty green shirt. Thanks, master.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;You look pretty bright..&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I'm so bright, my parents call me son.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"> &quot;Train hard, and I'm sure you'll do well.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yeah, right back at you fruitcake.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Maesyn smiled. I gave him the bird.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Let's go,&quot; said my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Where are we going,&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;The hell out of here,&quot; said my sandwich. &quot;This 
    place gives me a headache.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">It was then that I noticed for the first time the incessant 
    chatter filling the air. Grabbing some of the yellow globules of food from 
    my pack, I listened more closely as I stuffed my face.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Providing binds for phoney tuff and the crazy brave at 
    the POD&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Small PW / tattered armour for sale. caps, sleeves, gloves, 
    boots - 3ac - 3gp. shoulders - 2ac - 2gp&quot;</p>

  <p align="left"> &quot;Yeah zmog you want a fs two hander?&quot;</p>

  <p align="left">&quot;Bless the le people and the medium craces of norrath that 
    fury footed halfling is a true man&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Let's get the hell out of here,&quot; I said. &quot;I 
    am starting to freak out.&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;We're off to Freeport,&quot; my sandwich said.</p>
  <p align="left">And so we were. After several days of wandering around, my sandwich 
    and I finally found the elevator down to the forest floor and we ran through 
    various &quot;zones&quot; until we found a dock in the land of the dwarves. 
    Freeport was the city of humans, according to my sandwich, so I felt confident 
    I would be able to buy some cigarettes and porn there to help me sit the hallucination 
    out. I was in good spirits.</p>
  <p align="left">If I only knew then what I knew now ...</p>
