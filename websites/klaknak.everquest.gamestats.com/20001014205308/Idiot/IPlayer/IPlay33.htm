  <p>Guard! - by Tayee</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I've just made 20th level Wizard. "Cool!" I think to myself, 
    "time to head back to town from Guk and begin my specialization in Evocation". 
    Ok made it heh, I go to the guild and figure I'll only put a practice point 
    into Evocation until I hit 50 skill, then I'll spend a point on the rest, 
    good plan so far. Great the point is in!</p>
  <p align="left">Now to start on zapping myself to no end until I raise the skill 
    to 50. Guess I'll do it near the Freeport bank since my friend Saria (the 
    enchantress) is going to enchant a whole bunch of silver for me, so that I 
    can work on my Jewlering. "Things are good!</p>
  <p align="left">*smile*</p>
  <p align="left">The following scenario ensues....</p>
  <p align="left">Press F1 target self, don't want to get any guards into a tizzy 
    =)</p>
  <p align="left">You begin to cast a spell</p>
  <p align="left">You have been struck by frost</p>
  <p align="left">Your skill improves in Specialized Evocation</p>

  <p align="left">You have been struck by frost</p>
  <p align="left">Your skill improves in Specialized Evocation (2)</p>
  <p align="left">Tayee (that's me btw) thinks to herself: "it hurts but easy 
    and fast " =)</p>
  <p align="left">...time passes..</p>
  <p align="left">Saria says: here, I've finished 10 of the bars. (target changes 
    to Saria due to the trade)</p>
  <p align="left">Tayee says: cool only 30 more to go, lmk when you have more 
    ready I'll be here a while doing this self mutilation. :P</p>
  <p align="left">Saria says: ok cool.</p>
  <p align="left">Press F1 again to target self, don't want to get the guards 
    all over me, not many hp left from all this painful practice =) ...time passes...

  <p align="left">Tayee says: great, time passing quickly since I'm preoccupied 
    : )</p>
  <p align="left">Saria says: Ok, half way there I'll start on the others now.</p>
  <p align="left">Tayee says: Great! I'll be here, need to raise the skill another 
    20 points or so still. (so bored at this point, feel as if brain is beginning 
    to decay)</p>
  <p align="left">Saria says: Doing well hehe. ...</p>
  <p align="left">"That was the beginning of the end, If only I had known X( "...</p>
