  <p align="center">Brad went down to Freeport</p>
  <p align="center">(To the tune of The Devil went Down to Georgia)</p>
  <p align="center"> by Jim, AKA Branlar</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> "Aradune went down to Freeport, he was looking for a class 
    to nerf. He was feelin mad, cause we'd hacked him bad, and soloed on his turf. 
    When he came across this dark class soloing and soloing well, and Brad jumped 
    up on the city wall and said "I'll nerf your class to hell." "I guess you 
    didn't know it, but I'm a PK too, and if you'd care to take a dare I'll make 
    a bet with you." "Now you soloed them guardsmen pretty well boy, but give 
    the Devil his due, I'll bet a class that works against your spells that I'm 
    better than you". The boy said: "My name's Jhosef, and it might be a crime. 
    But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, cause I'll PK you every time." 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Jhosef use your harm touch, whoop him good, beat that twinkie 
    hard. Cause hell's broke loose in Freeport and groups always favor bards. 
    And if you win you get a class that solos well, but if you loose then Brad 
    will nerf you to hell... </p>
  <p align="left">Well Aradune opened up his spellbook and said "I'll start this 
    show," and fire flew from his fingertips as he made his armor glow. And as 
    he pulled his sword out of its sheath it made an evil sound, and a band of 
    GM's joined in and they knocked Jhosef to the ground. </p>
  <p align="left">When the game Gods finished, Jhosef said "Well, you're pretty 
    good asshole. But now you're gonna die just like a rooted gnoll."</p>
  <p align="left"> Charm spell on Aradune, run boys run <br>
    Jhosef's gonna PKeveryone <br>
    Brad can't help it he's killing GMs<br>
    Jhosef's gettin ready to finish him.. </p>
  <p align="left">Aradune bowed his head, because he knew that he'd been beat, 
    and he laid that solo class on the ground at Jhosef's feet. Jhosef said "Just 
    come on back if you ever want to try again. I done told you once you son of 
    a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been."</p>
