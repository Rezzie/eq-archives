  <p>Christian Comments</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Ok. I have lampooned Christianity long enough. Against all good 
    common sense, here is my take on the Christ guy. I am no theologian, and no 
    doubt some of my rant may contains some inaccuracies (since I dont read much), 
    but this is my take on things for you to take or leave.</p>
  <div align="left"></div>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"><b>1. Why some Christians irritate me.</b></p>
  <p align="left">I could ramble on about this for days, but let me touch the 
    core issue.</p>
  <p align="left">Some Christians (particularly the CNN Christians) enjoy nothing 
    more than using the Bible to promote their cause. And let's face it, for all 
    the wisdom the bible contains, it also contains thousands of tiny little aphorisms 
    that can pretty much back up everything you want to argue. We have all heard 
    the arguments against homosexuality, abortion, etc. so I won't go into them 
    here. I also won't point out the fact that Christians rely a little too heavily 
    on the old testament to support some of their arguments (capital punishment 
    is a big one) considering one of Jesus's main points was to establish a new 
    covenant and throw away the old law books from the Jewish canon.</p>
  <p align="left">But what really really irks me is that with all of their selective 
    viewing, they missed one of the primary messages of Paul which breaks up into 
    two parts:</p>
  <p align="left">1. We all suck.</p>
  <p align="left">2. No amount of good works will alleviate the fact that we all 
    suck.</p>
  <p align="left">In the early days of the church, there were two basic camps 
    (well, this is an oversimplification but bear with me, people): 1) those who 
    believed that salvation could be attained by doing good works and 2) those 
    who believed that only God could do the saving, thank you very much.</p>
  <p align="left">Let me break it down in logical terms:</p>
  <p align="left">Group 1: Cause: Good works ... Effect: Salvation</p>
  <p align="left">Group 2: Cause: God ... Effect: Good works and salvation</p>
  <p align="left">See where I am going here? It is called justification by faith, 
    I think, which basically means this. We all suck and there isn't a damn thing 
    we can do about it. Only God can pull us out of the shit sandwich and only 
    when that happens are good works the result. </p>
  <p align="left">I think the reason why Group 2 (Paul, Augustine, etc.) won out 
    is fairly simple. If it was true that humans could achieve salvation by simply 
    running around doing good things, it really takes away from the benevolence 
    and kindness of God. I mean, hell, this would basically make God into a big 
    Santa Claus. If you were naughty, you weren't saved. If you were nice, you 
    were saved and you would receive a b.b. gun.</p>
  <p align="left">So this is what really bothers me about the CNN Christians. 
    They believe that by doing good works (abolishing abortion, forcing prayer 
    in schools, killing criminals, etc.), Americans will be saved and will become 
    a country of God. For me, this pretty much contradicts everything Paul was 
    about. Sure, go ahead and quote the little passages on homosexuality and whatnot, 
    but I will quote you the entire last half of the new testament which reminds 
    Christians over and over again to be humble because, when it comes down to 
    it, Christians suck.</p>
  <p align="left">In short ...</p>
  <p align="left">Why do CNN Christians irritate me? Because they are not humble 
    and they presume to understand the will of God. Now, I won't presume to understand 
    what the Big Guy thinks, but assuming there is a sliding scale of sin (and 
    there isn't according to the Bible ... all sin sucks), I would be a lot more 
    pissed at someone who presumed to know what I was thinking than at someone 
    who gains physical pleasure from kissing someone of the same sex.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><b>2. Why Christ is cool.</b></p>
  </div>
<p align="left">For me, the real tragedy of what the CNN Christians have done 
  to Christianity comes down to this ... the Dalai Lama (who admittedly seems 
  pretty cool) is seen as some sort of new savior for the Evian water crowd. In 
  many ways, I think, he is seen as a kinda new anti-Christian guy for all the 
  WASPS who are tired of the CNN Christians jerkifying Christianity.</p>
<p align="left">This really is a tragedy, because I think Christ the person was 
  pretty cool. Another reason I dislike some Christians is because they have taken 
  one of the most beloved people in history (for me, anyway) and have defiled 
  him with their petty political agendas.</p>
<p align="left">I won't quote you scripture, but I will just make up a little 
  passage to explain to you why I think Christ is cool:</p>
<p align="left">&lt;Scene: People stoning a prostitute&gt;</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: Whoa, ho, what is going on here.</p>
<p align="left">Angry Man: We are stoning a whore.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: Why?</p>
<p align="left">Angry Man: Because she is a whore.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: I see. She is a sinner.</p>
<p align="left">Angry: Damn right.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: But, well, I don't mean to be impolite, but you are a sinner 
  too, right?</p>
<p align="left">Angry Man: Yeah, I guess. But I ain't no whore.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: Yeah, ok, fine. But don't you think God sees all sin as 
  bad?</p>
<p align="left">Angry Man: Gosh, I don't know, probably.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: Ok, then. Let's try something new for a change. Instead 
  of killing everyone who breaks one of the laws, why don't we try loving them 
  instead. That's what God does for us, so don't you think we could return the 
  favor. </p>
<p align="left">Angry Man: Ok, man, that's cool.</p>
<p align="left">Jesus: Rock on, man.</p>
<p align="left">Angry Man: Rock on, Jesus.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Sure, I am paraphrasing, but this is Christ in a nutshell, man 
  (at least for me). </p>
<p align="left"><b>3. Does God exist?</b></p>
<p align="left">Several years ago, I was an atheist. It was inconceivable for 
  me that a God could exist. But then I stumbled across a little bit of scripture 
  from Job. Again I paraphrase:</p>
<p align="left">Job: Yo, G, why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p align="left">God: How dare you question me? Did you create the moon and the 
  stars and Joe's incredibly attractive supervisor?</p>
<p align="left">Job: No, you are right. Rock on God.</p>
<p align="left">God: Rock on Job. Here are some wives and cattle for your patience.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">How does this prove the existence of God? It doesn't. Nothing 
  ever will. For me, the debate over the existence of God from a logical point 
  of view is absolutely idiotic.</p>
<p align="left">But what this passage told me was this:</p>
<p align="left">How can a race of people who can't program VCRs feel confident 
  they can prove God or disprove God either way?</p>
<p align="left">Let's face it, we are idiots. And if there is a God up there who 
  created everything, chances are he is a little smarter than we are.</p>
<p align="left">I realize this won't convince the nonbelievers, but in all honesty 
  this is why I believe in God. It makes absolutely no sense, I know, but to hell 
  with it. </p>
<p align="left"><b>4. Why Christianity is worthwhile.</b></p>
<p align="left">Let's assume the atheists are right for the moment. Let's assume 
  that once you are dead, you are dead. Is Christianity worthwhile? Absolutely.</p>
<p align="left">Take the mentally retarded guys I work with. You may think that 
  my inability to date my really attractive supervisor is tragic, but what is 
  really tragic, especially in an atheistic universe, is that these people have 
  been born into a potentially terrible existence with nothing waiting for them 
  except annihilation. Many of us (ALL of us who use computers) are living in 
  a paradise. Even if we do live in an atheistic universe, our existence is basically 
  good.</p>
<p align="left">But for millions of people on the planet, their existence flat 
  out sucks. It really does bother me to the depth of my soul that by sheer luck 
  alone I am happy and these people are SOL.</p>
<p align="left">What Christianity does, I think, is provide a useful guide to 
  help these SOL people have better lives. For this reason alone, Christianity 
  is worthwhile, especially if you follow a little closer to the spirit of it 
  (as opposed to following the spirit of the CNN Christian canon). Christianity 
  teaches us to reach out to the SOL people and give them a hand. This, folks, 
  is one of the coolest things in the universe. This core philosophy rocks.</p>
<p align="left">Is Christianity the only religion that does this? Hell no. But 
  it is one of them, and this is cool.</p>
<p align="left">The second reason Christianity is cool is because it is based 
  on the fundamental idea that we all suck. In the modern day of self-esteem movements, 
  this may strike us as callous, but I think there is a fundamental wisdom to 
  an ethos that promotes humility.</p>
<p align="left">&lt;WARNING: SAP COMING&gt;</p>
<p align="left">One of my favorite quotes of all time comes from Shakespeare and 
  it is this:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Sweet are the uses of adversity ...&quot;</p>
<p align="left">It is my favorite quote because I believe that the only way we 
  can better ourselves is to struggle constantly against adversity. Many of us 
  (myself included) often become knocked over by hard times and some of us never 
  get up. But for those of us who do get up, there is a certain nobility to going 
  through life, taking our hits, but going on anyway ... especially when we wake 
  up in the middle of the night wondering if when we die, we are dead and there 
  is nothing else but just simple annihilation.</p>
<p align="left">There is wisdom in this, people. This constant struggle against 
  complacency and pride. And this is what Christianity can do for us. Christianity 
  is inherently a struggle. It says to us all: You suck, get with the program.</p>
<p align="left">This is a good thing. </p>
