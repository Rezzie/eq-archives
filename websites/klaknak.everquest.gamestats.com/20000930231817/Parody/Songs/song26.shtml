  <p align="center">Crushbone Anthem - by Ranolyen<br>
    (to the tune of "The Distance" By Cake)</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Reluctantly crouched at the zoning line, <br>
    Sword arms pumping and thumping in time. <br>
    The green light flashes, the spells go off. <br>
    Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup. <br>
    They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank, <br>
    Magic burning fast on an empty tank. <br>
    Reckless and wild, they pour through the trees.<br>
    Their prowess is potent and secretly feared. <br>
    As they speed to the monster, the swords flash down. <br>
    The orcs get up and they get out of town. <br>
    Crushbone is empty except for one man,<br>
    Still slaying and flaying as fast as he can.<br>
    The sun has gone down and the moon has come up,<br>
    And long ago somebody left with a bump. <br>
    But he's running and jumping and hugging the turns. <br>
    And thinking of some loot for which he still burns. </p>
  <p align="left">Cause he's hoping for distance.<br>
    He's hoping for speed. <br>
    He's all alone (All Alone!)<br>
    In his time of need. <br>
    Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, <br>
    He's fighting and biting and wishing for a horse, <br>
    He's hoping for distance. </p>
  <p align="left">No trophy, no flowers, no loot and no wine, <br>
    He's hunted by something we cannot define. <br>
    Bowel-slaying spearpoints of Crush at his worst, <br>
    Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force.<br>
    In his mind, he's still driving, still using his blade. <br>
    She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.<br>
    Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course,<br>
    He's fighting and biting and wishing for a horse. <br>
    The sun has gone down and the moon has come up, <br>
    And long ago somebody left with a bump.<br>
    But he's running and jumping and hugging the turns. <br>
    And thinking of some loot for which he still burns. </p>
  <p align="left">Cause he's going the distance. <br>
    He's going for speed. <br>
    She's all alone<br>
    In her time of need.<br>
    Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course, <br>
    He's fighting and biting and wishing for a horse horse. <br>
    He's racing and pacing and plotting the course, <br>
    He's fighting and biting and whishing for a horse.<br>
    He's hoping for distance. </p>
