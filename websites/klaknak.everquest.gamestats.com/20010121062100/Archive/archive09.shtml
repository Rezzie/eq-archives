      <blockquote> 
        <p>"Dear Denizens of the Holy Klaknak: <br>
          It has been a while since I have posted anything of any substance, so 
          I would like to take this opportunity to talk about what has been going 
          on.</p>
        <p> 1. Everquest. <br>
          As we all know by now, I have a very deep love/hate relationship with 
          Everquest and I think I am still a little bit in hate mode right now. 
          The Nuggets of Justice was an absolute riot but then I hit level 16 
          with my necromancer. Level 16, for whatever reason, seems to be a very 
          hard level for me to pass. I think it is at this time that I start getting 
          really frustrated with the kill, sit, kill, sit, kill, sit thing. Anyway, 
          I hit level 16 and found myself just kind of staring at the screen a 
          lot. This was complicated by the fact that my dear Aunt Pali was spending 
          more time with her Ranger on Prexus than with her Necro on Luclin. </p>
        <p>One day, I decided to create a Barbarian shaman so I could eventually 
          team up with her Ranger and run around killing everything. </p>
        <p>Through a not so atypical series of events, that turned out to be the 
          straw that broke the camel's back. </p>
        <p>First of all, I absolutely hated being a newbie again. I realize that 
          level 16 is not exactly the pinnacle of EQ accomplishment, but compared 
          to being a level 1 nitwit again, it is nirvana. </p>
        <p>Anyway, on one particular Saturday, I decided I would start powerlevelling 
          my dude. </p>
        <p>Whether through accident or design, Verant was in the throes of getting 
          Kunark online and, whether causal or not, the servers were jumping and 
          lagging and dying at an alarming rate. I think I lost connection that 
          day close to 10 times. On top of this, some high level jackass was completely 
          farming the newbie area killing pretty much everything in site. As any 
          barbarians out there know, the barbarian newbie area can be quite perilous 
          and a level one guy needs to pretty much camp as closely as possible 
          to the guards to keep the deaths down under 3 or 4 an hour. Well, thanks 
          to jackass, that wasnt possible, so I ended up having to venture way 
          out in the wild. With a combination of level-one-ness, disconnects, 
          lag and mobbing polar bears and wolves, I was dead more than I was alive. 
        </p>
        <p>I became completely fed up and nearly uninstalled EQ from my computer.</p>
        <p> Instead, I started playing Asheron's Call. </p>
        <p>2. Asheron's Call. <br>
          I had tried playing Asheron's Call when it first came out, but a few 
          things kept getting in my way. First of all, the learning curve can 
          be a little daunting. Granted, it is not too hard, but for someone playing 
          casually (as I was), it took a while to understand the optimal way to 
          create a character, learn new spells, etc. etc.</p>
        <p> Second, the graphics really do kinda suck.</p>
        <p> But after a while, I totally fell in love with the game and I am still 
          in love, as far as that goes. The big reason for this is the total absence 
          of idiots. Or, rather, the mostly total absent of idiots with freedom 
          to completely avoid them (nay, to completely avoid the entire society 
          of fellow gameplayers if need be). Asheron's Call is good at a number 
          of things, but first and foremost it is utterly utterly utterly huge. 
          The time it takes to run from West Freeport to Qeynos in EQ would maybe 
          cover an inch of map territory in Asheron's Call. Huge. What this means 
          is that you can always find a place to hunt that is completely free 
          of people. And it's not like you are going to be missing out on awesome 
          special items either. At the lower levels at least, I have found some 
          really kick ass weapons and armor just killing random critters in the 
          wilderness. Oh so nice, my friends.</p>
        <p> 3. Employment. <br>
          For a few months there, I was very broke and I am only now realizing 
          how extremely taxing that was on my ability to function as a human. 
          Last night I paid all of my bills and still have money in the bank and 
          money to use for food. That is a good feeling.</p>
        <p> The new job is going really well, in spite of the fact it is a nine 
          to five job. I think a lot of this is because a) I am playing games 
          and 2) my bosses aren't jackasses who use their positions of "power" 
          to meet the needs of their fragile egos. I think too many of my earlier 
          bosses in other 9 to 5 jobs took out their feelings of inadequacy on 
          their employees. In fact, I now wonder if our entire American corporate 
          culture - with all the buzzwords, idiotic policies, and bullshit - is 
          nothing more than a kind of passive aggressive neurosis writ large. 
          I dunno. </p>
        <p>Anyway, as I said, the new job doesn't have this bullshit, so that 
          is cool. </p>
        <p>4. Women. <br>
          The women thing hasn't been going well at all, but again I am beginning 
          to understand that being broke had a lot to do with this. While visiting 
          my brother in Atlanta and going to various parties and whatnot here, 
          I had ample opportunity to try my wooing skills, but with very mixed 
          success. To sum up, I think I was just really fucking frazzled the whole 
          time and my confidence was therefore kinda shaky. I would start talking 
          to someone and my mind would just start wandering. Every beer I bought 
          created stress akin to buying a home because I simply didn't have money 
          to buy beer. </p>
        <p>Also, as I have mentioned, a friend of mine is going through a separation 
          with her husband and that has just really depressed me. Divorce just 
          sucks. It has a way of weighing on my mind when in rutting mode. It 
          just makes me wonder if all relationships, no matter how happy in the 
          beginning, can eventually just grind down into nothingness. I am kinda 
          down on that shit right now. </p>
        <p>5. Daikatana.<br>
          Speaking of nothingness, I bought Daikatana. </p>
        <p>6. Thief.<br>
          But I also bought Thief and I am really enjoying that right now. I have 
          also been playing some Nox. Nox is a surprisingly addictive game. It 
          is incredibly linear but I think I am actually enjoying it more than 
          I enjoyed Diablo when it came out. That is blasphemy, I know, but there 
          ya go. </p>
        <p>7. Humor. <br>
          Humor will once again spring from my head, but I think it is obvious 
          now that my humor output is directly tied to how much I am enjoying 
          EQ at the time. I have always thought I would eventually make CK into 
          a larger humor site (covering more games) and eventually I will (with 
          the help of others), but with my new job and some pretty stringent contractual 
          obligations, I have a lot of crap to work through first. </p>
        <p>Woo hoo! Keep up the good fight! </p>
        <p>- CK </p>
