  <p><font size="4">Befallen (nuff said) - by Brellium</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Brellium, Gnome enchanter and master illusionist, walks smartly 
    into Befallen. "I have slain hundreds of goblins, tens of Minotuars, and even 
    more of those evil willow wisps" he thinks as he walks in the entrance of 
    of the crumbling palace "This place can not be any harder than any of those 
    events, I even spent time in the Gnoll stronghold, downing those silly gnolls 
    left and right. How silly it was for them to come running out of the pit, 
    into our well set trap time and time again." He continues thinking to himself 
    on how he should hunt in this place.</p>
  <p align="left">"I've got it, first I shall find myself a good place to bind 
    myself, for one never knows when tragedy will strike." The small gnome walks 
    to a small passage jutting out of the wall and decides this shall be the spot. 
    He then starts chanting and feels the familiar tingle of a successful bind. 
    Jacobar shouts "Giving away all the keys to the befallen!" Brellium turns 
    around and sees Jacobar red in the face after shouting. Brellium pokes Jacobar. 
    Jacobar waves a Brellium. "Hail! I have just arrived at this place, are those 
    keys needed?" the white haired gnome says. Jacobar says "Yes they are"</p>
  <p align="left">Jacobar gives Brellium the keys.</p>
  <p align="left">"Thank you" Brellium says as he bows. Jacobar bows and heads 
    out. Brellium thinks to himself "Well now that I have these maybe I will have 
    a look around." as he unlocks the the door in the back of the hall. He walks 
    in then summons a pet to guard him. The yellow robed figure walks around and 
    finds a suitable target, his vile nemesis, a willow wisp. The willow wisp 
    attacks the enchanter, the enchanter steps back, and his pet engages the willow 
    wisp. The pet hits the willow wisp, the willow wisps takes off down the hall. 
    time passes time passes The gnome then realizes the pet has vanished, and 
    begins to summon another as five figures come running down the hall. After 
    seeing this the enchanter runs off. makes it to the door, but alas he can 
    not find his key....... time passes time passes even more time passes The 
    gnome is now at the small passage wearing just his plain clothes, with his 
    equipment on the other side of the door.</p>
  <p align="left">Brellium walks to the door and starts chanting, after a short 
    moment his belongings are resting below him. He picks up his equipment and 
    after a short chuckle walks over to the alcove, and memorizes his spells. 
    Schimley shouts "Ahhhhhhhh" The gnome looks up only to see everyone leaving, 
    and he is alone, with a number of undead. time passes time passes even more 
    time passes</p>
  <p align="left">The unlucky gnome then picks up his items again. "I know what 
    I need, a group, so someone else can get hammered by these things." Brellium 
    shouts "Gnome enchanter looking for a group!" Schimley says "We need one more 
    for our group" Brellium turns around and notices Schimley. Schimley waves. 
    "But one thing first," Schimley says "I need to retrieve our corpses." The 
    gnome nods knowingly. time passes time passes even more time passes Schimley 
    says "Thank you for helping us get our corpses, sorry about the ghoul"</p>
  <p align="left">The gnome says "Well it happens" The party heads out to the 
    lower levels. A willow wisp pokes at Brellium, he reacts by swinging his staff 
    and hits it squarly. The willow wisp flees. time passes Three skeletons attack 
    the party from the direction of the wisp time passes Three skeletons are now 
    in one pile The wisp attacks again, and flees time passes More skeletons time 
    passes More piles of bones time passes More skeletons, this time the party 
    is running.</p>
  <p align="left">The gnome pulls all of them on him, alone. time passes time 
    passes even more time passes The gnome enchanter scratches his head near the 
    entrance of the zone. Party runs out of befallen. Every thing chasing the 
    party attacks the enchanter, again. time passes time passes........</p>
