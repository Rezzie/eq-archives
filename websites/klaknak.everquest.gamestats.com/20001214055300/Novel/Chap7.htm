  <p align="left">I had passed out again. Vaguely, I wondered if passed out was 
    spelled &quot;passed&quot; or &quot;past&quot;. I seemed to recall &quot;past&quot; 
    relating to time and &quot;passed&quot; relating to &quot;passed my cultural 
    diversity requirement by having a psychiatrist who was from Spain&quot; but 
    ... I have lost my train of thought.</p>
  <p align="left">I had passed out.</p>
  <p align="left">Again, visions appeared within my mind.</p>
  <p align="left">Vision 1:</p>
  <p align="left">We are driven by the belief that people of faith have a right 
    and a responsibility to be involved in the world around them. That involvement 
    includes community, social and political action. Our goals include: Strengthening 
    the family; Protecting innocent human life; Returning education to local and 
    parental control; Easing the tax burden on families; Punishing criminals and 
    defending victims' rights; Protecting young people and our communities from 
    the pollution of pornography; Defending the institution of marriage; Protecting 
    religious freedom </p>
  <p align="left">Vision 2:</p>
  <p align="left">In many large cities around the world, you'll find a community 
    of people who groove on Balkan music and dance. In Seattle, they meet at 9 
    PM every Friday night at the Greenlake VFW, 7220 Woodlawn Ave NE. There are 
    usually 30 or more friendly people for Balkan dancing, and there's live music 
    of some sort about once a month. $4 donation to pay the rent. Visit if you're 
    in town! </p>
  <p align="left">Vision 3:</p>
  <p align="left">I was part of something larger than myself. I saw in front of 
    me a billion singing spheres, silently singing &quot;My Mother Cricket&quot; 
    to a chorus of celestial harmonicas. And yet, even with the infinite number 
    of spheres, the vibrations seemed to create a kind of simpler pattern, just 
    as spinning tires can sometimes create the illusion of movement in the opposite 
    direction. On my left ... a black sphere. On my right ... OUCH! What the fuck!</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Wake up!&quot; the voice commanded me.</p>
  <p align="left">I opened my good eye and saw a pair of finely tailored brown 
    slacks. They appeared nice enough to wear to a sherry party at the home of 
    the local university president's fundraising barbecue and yet casual enough 
    to use as a filter for pure grain alcohol shots.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Wake up, my fine warrior.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">It occurred to me that I had misplaced my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">I started to pass out.</p>
  <p align="left">As I tried to slip into oblivion, two muscular hands grabbed 
    my lapels (umm ..) and pulled me onto the deck of a small, but elegantly blue 
    deck.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ah, thanks ... I ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The warrior in brown slacks hit me hard in the stomach.</p>
  <p align="left">I fell over and began to ...</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh no you don't ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">And the Warrior in Brown Slacks grabbed me and forced my head 
    into the lap of a nearby Lap Fish.</p>
  <p align="left">My head cleared.</p>
  <p align="left">The Warrior threw me to the deck.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I am sick of your snivelling!&quot; he bellowed.</p>
  <p align="left">I started to pass out ...</p>
  <p align="left">He punched me in the stomach again.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Stop it!&quot; I yelled.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You are the Fungible Champion!&quot; he shouted. &quot;It 
    is time you started acting like one!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Whoa,&quot; I said. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The Warrior in Brown Slacks sighed. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Perhaps I have spoken too soon,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Where is my sandwich ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;SILENCE!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The Warrior sat on a small chair near ... the part of the ship 
    that ... um .. juts out.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You are the One Who Travels the Multiverse,&quot; he said. 
    &quot;You must fight for the cosmic balance. Sometimes you fight for this 
    side, other times ... for that side. It is a lonely business.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I considered this for a minute.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yes,&quot; the Warrior said, pulling a long piece of information 
    technology from his pocket and lighting it from his tinder box. &quot;You 
    are the warrior who helps determine the cosmic balance.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;The cosmic balance?&quot; I asked. &quot;What is that?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Precisely,&quot; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Eh?</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You are the warrior who strives to achieve the balance 
    between This and That. It is an important task.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I frowned.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I don't understand. This and That? What this and that?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;This and That!&quot; he said. &quot;It couldn't be simpler!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">The Warrior smirked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Well, if you don't know, I don't think I could tell you 
    ...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">He then laughed, and millions of light years away, crowds of 
    idiots cheered.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;But that doesn't make any sense,&quot; I said. &quot;This 
    and That? What the hell?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The warrior sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Millions of philosophers throughout the millenia have 
    tried to reconcile difference of all kinds concerning any number of subjects,&quot; 
    he said. &quot;They all thought their material was well thought out and of 
    universal importance. But they were wrong. The only thing that matters ... 
    is This and That. You are either for This or you are for That. Everything 
    else ... is window dressing.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I looked for my sandwich.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;And you are the one charged with balancing the two,&quot; 
    he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;AH,&quot; I said. &quot;And how am I to do that?&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The Warrior frowned.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I am not sure,&quot; he said. &quot;The Interesting Ones 
    pulled you from your world to enter this one ... as Gayfeather ... but you 
    have failed totally.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Agreed!&quot; I said. I pulled some letters from my pocket.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;We haven't decided yet how you can achieve your goals 
    here in the land of Norrath. We are not sure what is the This and what is 
    the That.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">A .. B ... C ... bwah. I can't believe I agreed to deliver these 
    things ...</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Those vowels are valuable,&quot; the warrior said, eyeing 
    my letters greedily.</p>
  <p align="left">I put the letters back in my pocket.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Oh no,&quot; I said. &quot;You won't get these until you 
    explain to me what I should be. What I am. What I am supposed to do.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I told you,&quot; the Warrior said gruffly. &quot;You 
    are to make the balance between This and That. Gayfeather is obviously a failure. 
    Perhaps you should seek a different identity.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;A different identity?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;A different identity. Trust 
    your fellow man, he said. Ask them what they think.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">I sighed.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;How do I do that?&quot; I asked.</p>
  <p align="left">The Warrior in Brown Slacks smiled and looked up at the sun.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ask!&quot; he said. </p>
  <p align="left">I looked into the sky.</p>
