  <p align="left">Some engineers from Freeport were on a survey mission and found 
    that the Everfrost/Blackburrow border must be changed. They stopped to inform 
    a barbarian that he was no longer in Everfrost but in Blackburrow. After a 
    long pause, he grunted and said, &quot;That's good. I couldn't take another 
    one of these Everfrost winters.&quot;</p>

  <p align="left"> A Ranger on vacation from Qeynos was visiting Grobb, and decided 
    she wanted to pick up some gator skin boots. After haggling with a troll merchant 
    who wanted over five platinum for a pair, the ranger finally exclaimed, &quot;Well 
    maybe I'll just go out into the swamp and get my own alligator so I can get 
    some boots made at a reasonable price!&quot; The merchant indicated that she 
    was free to try, and that she might even run into a pair of warriors who had 
    the same idea earlier in the day. The ranger heads into Innothule and comes 
    upon a pair of burly barbarians standing waist deep in the water, obviously 
    the two warriors. Suddenly, a huge gator swims towards one of the warriors, 
    jaws agape. Just as it's about to attack, he grabs it with his bare hands 
    and chokes it to death. The two warriors pull the carcass onto shore and flip 
    it onto its back next to a huge pile of dead gators. One of the warriors exclaims, 
    &quot;Damn it! This one doesn't have any boots on either!&quot;<br>

  <p align="left">After ten years of marriage, a barbarian woman is still questioning 
    her husband about his past. She asks for the thousandth time, &quot;Tell me, 
    how many women have you slept with?&quot; At first the barbarian man refuses 
    to tell, but his wife promises that she won't get mad. He says, &quot;Okay 
    okay. Let me see, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, then you, 
    eight, nine, ten, eleven...&quot;</p>

  <p align="left"> Did you hear about the Deathfist Orc who put a skylight in? 
    The orcs in the tent above him were furious...</p>

  <p align="left">From the &quot;Be Kind to Dwarves Week&quot; department: Build 
    a dwarf a fire, and he'll be warm for a day. Set a dwarf on fire, and he'll 
    be warm for the rest of his life.</p>
