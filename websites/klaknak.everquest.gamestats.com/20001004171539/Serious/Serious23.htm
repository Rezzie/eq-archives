  <p>GM Harrasses a Fair Reader - by Patrick L.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Is Everquest sinking into a pit of despair? Or does the Klaknak 
    need an attitude adjustment. Find out here!</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left">This is a lengthy email detailing the blatant harassment by the 
  GM staff on<br>
  &quot;The Nameless&quot;. There are many different sections:</p>
<p>1) History behind the complaint<br>
  2) The complaint<br>
  3) How an apprentice guide abused his powers to suspend my account.<br>
  4) The exact text regarding &quot;Naming Policy&quot; on the main Everquest 
  web<br>
  site<br>
  5) The exact text regarding &quot;Naming Policy&quot; as listed on the GM<br>
  guidelines web page<br>
  6) The edited log file (I removed the first 5 megabytes of data from<br>
  previous days, and the combat with mobs happening during the beginning of<br>
  this episode</p>
<p><br>
  SECTION ONE</p>
<p>My wife and I have been playing Everquest since late summer. When a new<br>
  server came online we crated new users and began adventuring together. My<br>
  wife likes Dark Elves, and created a cleric who is a follower of Innorruuk.<br>
  Lots of time went into selecting a name that would best describe the<br>
  character. She is of an evil race, and yet she is a healer. </p>
<p>She chose &quot;Euthanasia&quot;. As per http://www.m-w.com/dictionary<br>
  &lt;http://www.m-w.com/dictionary&gt; (Mirriam Webster), it is defined as:<br>
  Main Entry: eu-tha-na-sia<br>
  Function: Noun<br>
  Etymology: Greek, easy death, from euthanatos, from eu + thanatos death<br>
  The act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or<br>
  injured individuals (as persons or domestic animals) in a relatively<br>
  painless way for reasons of mercy.</p>
<p>She's an evil race. She's a cleric. Her role-playing personna is to allow<br>
  the weak to die as painlessly as possible, while killing the weak (mobs).</p>
<p>The American Humane society performs euthanasia every day on unwanted or<br>
  stray pets.</p>
<p>The act of killing a wounded horse is euthanasia.</p>
<p>If a person is terminally ill, has no hope of anything but a continued<br>
  existence in pain and suffering, and wishes to die a peaceful death,<br>
  euthanasia has been performed in rare instances.</p>
<p>One unfortunate Friday in December, &quot;The Nameless&quot; crashes. When 
  the dust<br>
  settles, Euthanasia's account is misspelled. She petitions for the name to<br>
  be changed back. Within an hour it is corrected.</p>
<p><br>
  SECTION TWO</p>
<p>A few days ago Euthanasia received harassing /tells from Gremm, an unknown<br>
  player who was many zones away. We had never heard of him before. He began<br>
  saying how he was going to challenge Euthanasia to a duel and boast to<br>
  anyone who would listen. It went on for an extended period of time. My<br>
  wife isn't into the &quot;dueling&quot; aspect of the game. She usually hangs 
  out in<br>
  low-level dungeons healing random players she doesn't know. The Gremm guy<br>
  just wouldn't let up. When it became obvious to him that she was not going<br>
  ot ever duel him, he said he &quot;would get her name changed because he found 
  it<br>
  offensive&quot;. He didn't mention that at all until the very end.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a GM (Ezerah) told her a petition had been filed on behalf of<br>
  her name and she had to change it because ONE person had complained. After<br>
  a conference of different GM's on the issue, he stated that she didn't have<br>
  to worry about her name being changed. He also said that he thought it was<br>
  a good name for a dark elf.</p>
<p>A few days later out of the blue Euthanasia gets a /tell from a senior guide<br>
  that her name is being changed because it is offensive. Someone had<br>
  petitioned (probably the same person, or a friend of his) about the name.<br>
  No clue who this person was, or why they did it. After trying to explain<br>
  what &quot;euthanasia&quot; means, her character is changed to &quot;Eutanasi&quot;.</p>
<p>I checked two different web pages regarding the official naming policy. The<br>
  exact text of these two web pages is further down this email. None of the<br>
  eight rules listed in the naming policy were broken.</p>
<p><br>
  SECTION THREE</p>
<p>I petitioned immediately to try to speak with an actual VERANT GM. I<br>
  received a reply from an apprentice guide, who halfway through my petition<br>
  decides that he doesn't want to do the job he volunteered for. No<br>
  resolution had been given on the issue, and I never got a response from him<br>
  regarding my petition. While I was trying to get an answer as to why he was<br>
  suddenly warning me about talking to him (after he asked me what he could<br>
  do), he says talking to him is suddenly considered &quot;abuse&quot;, then he<br>
  disconnects me. The complete transcript is at the bottom of this email. He<br>
  suspended me for giving him /tells while we were resolving a petition. He<br>
  wouldn't answer my question as to the status of the petiton he was<br>
  responding to - he simply kicked me off the server. He couldn't even tell<br>
  me why the name &quot;Euthanasia&quot; was offensive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SECTION FOUR</p>
<p>Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original,<br>
  high-fantasy names are desired. The following types of names are<br>
  unacceptable:</p>
<p>Vile, rude and obscene names including common swear words, anatomical<br>
  references, and deliberate misspellings and homonyms of these words.</p>
<p>Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g., Hughjass,<br>
  TugMcgroin).</p>
<p>Names of religious or historical significance (e.g., Allah, Stalin).</p>
<p>Non-fantasy names from popular media (e.g., Rambo, Darthvader).</p>
<p>Common words, phrases, or sentences non-suitable for the environment (e.g.,<br>
  Switchblade, Phaser, Ikillorcs).</p>
<p>Proper names from EverQuest (e.g., Rathe, Karana).</p>
<p>Popular and easily recognizable names from existing literature or media<br>
  (e.g., Merlin, Gandalf).</p>
<p><br>
  Names containing built-in titles (e.g., Ladygray, Sirtallon). </p>
<p>If you are found with an improper name you will be contacted in one of the<br>
  following ways: </p>
<p>For category one offenses, the name will be changed immediately. A GM will<br>
  then contact you and offer an opportunity to choose an appropriate name.<br>
  Player's corpses rendered unlootable by this process are not eligible for<br>
  reimbursement. </p>
<p>For category two through seven, you will be contacted and given the<br>
  opportunity to choose an appropriate name. In the event you cannot do so in<br>
  a timely fashion, a name will be chosen for you. The player is responsible<br>
  for informing the GM if their character has any unlooted corpses at the<br>
  time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>SECTION FIVE</p>
<p>What is the naming policy?</p>
<p>Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original,<br>
  high-fantasy names are desired. The following types of names are<br>
  unacceptable and are listed in order from the worst to the least offensive:</p>
<p>Vile, rude and obscene names including common swear words, anatomical<br>
  references and deliberate misspellings and homonyms of these words. </p>
<p>A combination of words that produce an offensive result (Hugeaz,<br>
  TugMcgroin). </p>
<p>Religious names that other players find offensive (Jesus, Allah). </p>
<p>Non-fantasy names from popular media (Rambo, Darthvader). </p>
<p>Common words and phrases non-suitable for the environment (switchblade,<br>
  phaser). </p>
<p>Proper names from EverQuest (Rathe, Karana). </p>
<p>Popular and easily recognized named from existing literature (Merlin,<br>
  Gandalf). </p>
<p>Names containing built-in titles (Ladygray, Sirtallon). </p>
