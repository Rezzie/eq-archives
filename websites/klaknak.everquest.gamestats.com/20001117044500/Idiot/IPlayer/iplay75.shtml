        <p>Once a few nights past I was sitting in my nice new land of WC (being 
          a dark elf mage of lvl 13 I rather enjoyed it here). While sitting at 
          the toll booth I saw a rather strange critter sitting near me. *click 
          on creature* A werewolf. How nice.. I'll just go have a loo.... <br>
          A werewolf attacks you more than you care to know about. <br>
          LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.<br>
          lucky i was bound near the toll booth. I wander up close and see my 
          advisary.. <br>
          /ooc Werewolf at t.... <br>
          A werewolf attacks you again for more than he did last time. <br>
          LOADING... PLEASE WAIT <br>
          Needless to say, I hate werewolfs. 
        <p>A night or two past I was a super mage at the age of 15 seasons and 
          decided it was time to raid befallen. After several minutes of asking 
          for partners I got a lvl 15 enchanter and 14 paladin to join the fun. 
          We run part of the first lvl killing everything in sight without much 
          of a problem. Ahhh, someone needs help.. NUKE NUKE.. dead mobs and we 
          acquired a thankfull monk to our group. Feeling ever powerfull we press 
          on into the dungeon. WHOA! where did the monk go..<br>
          Monk friend says: WTF! <br>
          Palidin: you dissappeared on us <br>
          Enchanter : what's going on? <br>
          my brilliant ass: I've heard tales of hole in this zone, maybe you fell 
          into one.. 
        <p>Yeah that it. he fell into a hole. So, what to do, ahh I have a brilliant 
          idea. Lets fall in the hole with him, quick trip down to next level.<br>
          Enchanter: you sure that's a good idea? <br>
          Palidin: You first!<br>
          Monk: come on down, it's nice =) <br>
          my brilliant ass: omw 
        <p>2 secs later we are all in a room with no mobs.. but oooo. I'm a mage, 
          and I had a pet upstairs. Wonder how he is doing<br>
          Taunting attacker master.. NOOOOOOOOO!!! <br>
          Every undead in befallen quickly joined us in this little room with 
          only 1 exit. we managed to blast the first few critters as they came 
          in but were soon overpowered by several ghouls and yel con'd skeles. 
          After 2 more deaths each trying to get our corpses we finally found 
          a nice cleric to help. Needless to say, I haven't been back.<br>
