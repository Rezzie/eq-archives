        <p>I'm not sure how funny this is, but it was dumb. To protect the semi-innocent 
          (and because I can't remember their names really well) I will not use 
          names. Okay, here's the story. 
        <p> I was grouped in Blackburrow with an enchanter, a shaman, and a rogue. 
          We were in the pit by the snake ledge. I don't know if it's the snake 
          pit or the spike pit. Anyway, the enchanter was going to pull some gnolls. 
          There were two or three gnolls and a guardsman. He was supposed to pull 
          ONE. He pulled them all. Then a patrolling gnoll was fighting too. I 
          hurt it and it ran. I couldn't catch it, since some gnolls heard the 
          fight and came over. Then the patroller brought a guard or two. "RUN" 
          I shouted, and we did. The shaman and the rogue died somewhere near 
          the ledge. the enchanter was ahead of me with SOW and lived. I only 
          lived because a fellow named Chingi helped me. I'm telling his name 
          because I want to honor him for helping me. As I ran across the top 
          floor, I was really hurt. He healed me. Then I ran to the entrance. 
          One foot away from the zone I was stunned and beaten. Stun wore of and 
          I ran through and lived. In the end my group and I brought at least 
          15 gnolls to the zone. I think it was fifteen, but nobody was counting. 
          Well, that's my story. It's boring, but my group and I were idiots, 
          so it kinda qualifies as an idiot file. When I'm level 50 I'm gonna 
          come back to BB and destroy every spawn in the place at least once. 
          Then I'll laugh, surrounded by bodies.
