      <p align="left">First of all, group experience. As I understand it, an exp 
        bonus is added for each player in the group, which matches what Verant 
        has said on the subject. There's not a magic "superbonus" for adding the 
        sixth player, just the normal bonus that's added for every player.<br>
        Do keep in mind that from what I've heard, the bonus itself is utterly 
        miniscule. :)</p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p align="left">Next up, the person who complained about Verant having to 
        change the game to thwart ShowEQ. They seem to be under the misunderstanding 
        that the zoning process has been changed as a result of ShowEQ. I've been 
        following the ShowEQ boards for a while now, and I have to think this 
        is simply false. Verant may have changed how zoning works, but if they 
        did it in response to showeq, they completely, utterly failed. I have 
        to think that whatever changes they made had nothing to do with showeq. 
        Yes, people have lost characters, had zoning problems, been removed from 
        guilds, etc etc. I must not be playing the same game, because these things 
        have happened from the beginning, not just recently. :) </p>
      <p align="left">Let me say this again. If any major changes went on recently 
        to try to prevent showeq users from getting access to information they 
        weren't meant to have, then Verant failed miserably in the attempt. In 
        fact, they failed SO miserably that I have to think that either no such 
        changes went on, or that if they did, they had nothing to do with showeq. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Note that Verant has done a little bit of twiddling with 
        the packets themselves, and a little bit of encryption (if you can call 
        it that) on some of the packets, but if this person, who claims to work 
        for a software company, does in fact work for a software company, it's 
        fairly obvious they've never done any network programming. If they had, 
        they would know that the kinds of changes Verant has made in order to 
        stop showeq are hardly major, sweeping changes, prone to bugs. More likely, 
        they were done at the packet level, and had absolutely no effect on the 
        rest of the game whatsoever, other than a (very) small amount of time 
        spent twiddling things around. If any of the problems mentioned were due 
        to those small changes, then frankly, Verant has bungled their code base 
        so badly that I have absolutely no sympathy for them, and the fact of 
        the matter is that if it wasn't showeq causing those problems, it would 
        be something else, guaranteed. </p>
      <p align="left">I'm also a little confused about the "vigilante justice" 
        section of that response, since I hardly think the concept even applies. 
        It's very difficult for me to take on one hand, somebody deciphering packets 
        that are coming into their network, and on the other hand, somebody who 
        has murdered another person, and compare them meaningfully. Yes, it would 
        be against the law for me to "execute" the murderer myself in the name 
        of justice, but it's hardly illegal to peek at packets that come into 
        my network. In fact, practically every corporate network out there does 
        just that, in the name of security. </p>
      <p align="left">Well, that's the meat of the matter, but I have a few more 
        nit-picks. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p align="left">From the "ShowEQ Update":</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Also, a few people were afraid I would track them visiting my site 
          and somehow use that against them: <br>
          "Hmm now, let me see... go to a page where my IP could be logged... 
          Real smart -- don't think so..." <br>
          So there is your response from the esteemed Hacker community. I think 
          their unwillingness to talk speaks volumes about how legal they think 
          all this is. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">Silly statement, because it has absolutely nothing to do 
        with legality. Has to do with not wanting to be banned from the game. 
        Most of the people using ShowEQ still enjoy the game, and they don't want 
        to get banned any more than you do. :) </p>
      <p align="left">(of course, some of them are just silly, considering that 
        even IF you logged the IP of everybody in support of showeq, and forwarded 
        the list directly to Verant, there's very little they could do with that 
        list, except maybe ban a few people who always have the same IP address. 
        For example, I could be banned, because I have a block of 16 static IP 
        addresses assigned to my house by my ISP, but I hardly think that's typical) 
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is absolutely nothing "illegal" about ShowEQ, in the 
        sense that you could be criminally prosecuted and go to jail. Even the 
        though of such a possibility is amusing, to say the least. :) Yes, ShowEQ 
        breaks the license agreement (although an argument could be made that 
        the sections it breaks are not legally binding agreements anyway, because 
        reverse engineering is perfectly allowable by law), but all Verant can 
        do is ban you. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p align="left">And last but not least, from the original article: In reality, 
        this just simply doesn't wash at all. Can anyone out there seriously say 
        with a straight face that knowing these exact numbers will somehow revolutionize 
        the gameplay in EQ?</p>
      <p align="left"> In return, I'll ask this: Can anyone out there, seriously 
        say with a straight face that me knowing my exact numbers (assuming that 
        you can turn yours off if you wish to do so), would somehow destroy the 
        gameplay in EQ?</p>
      <p align="left"> For the record, I have never used ShowEQ, and probably 
        never will, primarily due to laziness and distrust. (Too lazy to set up 
        one of my machines to dual boot to linux, and not quite trusting enough 
        to run the windows version without being able to look over the source 
        code, which even if it existed, I probably would be too lazy to do) :) 
      </p>
      <p align="left">But I don't necessarily have a problem with ShowEQ. The 
        only part about it that even begins to bother me a little is the fact 
        that people using it have an immediate heads up on random, rare spawns. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">But frankly, it doesn't bother me all that much, because 
        even if nobody used showeq, the chances that I would ever see one of those 
        are almost infinitely small anyway. In my eyes, 10 percent, or even 1 
        percent, of a very small small number isn't really all that different 
        from the number to start with. 1 in a million or 1 in 100 million, your 
        chances are pretty damned small anyway, and hardly worth being concerned 
        about. :) </p>
