      <p align="left">Well, the first one involves me at lvl 5. </p>
      <p align="left">I was grouped with my friend, Aumerien, and some necro guy. 
        We were hunting on Kerra isle, and were trained at the bridge-thing by 
        the zone. Happens a lot. Necro died, Aum gated, and I died at zone. ONE 
        FREAKIN' INCH AWAY!!!!! Sorry. still mad. Anyway, got my stuff back and 
        wanted to explore kera isle. Kerrans conned threateningly, but it was 
        late, and I was mixed up. </p>
      <p align="left">Dead at the foot of a Kerran. </p>
      <p align="left">"It will last a week," said Aumerien. I'll kill him someday. 
        Well, it rotted with all my stuff. SNIFF. I felt naked, dumb, and alone. 
        But Chef (or something close) Boyardee gave me some money and a high-elf 
        named Mastercaster (last name) gave me two engagement rings. Still, I 
        am really afraid of being away from guards very far now. </p>
      <p align="center">* * *</p>
      <p align="left">Next story!</p>
      <p align="left"> Level 7, nothing gives exp!!! Went to blackburrow with 
        Ravenwood the half-elf and some lvl 5 wood elf. Anyway, I walked in and 
        was there for a minute when I saw 10 gnolls chase some poor guy to the 
        zone. I was next to it. He died and then they attacked me. Stunned. Ran 
        the wrong way when stunn wore off, turned around, and died. Group didn't 
        really help at all, but they were there when I died. </p>
