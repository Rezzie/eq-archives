        <p>OK i thought that this was outta the ordinary the other day and turned 
          up to be a pretty funny experience (I got no exp by the way, kinda sucked) 
        <p>OK a few days back i was sitting (yes sitting, stupid tank classes) 
          and my monk friend got on, he is 20 lvls lower then me so we decided 
          to go to Crushbone to get him some exp. Once we got there i ditched 
          him and headed for teh castle, turned out there was two groups there, 
          but the Dvinn spawn was untouched, as was the Crush spawn. After a few 
          mins i called in about three lvl 50 friends of mine, and soon i had 
          a full group together, and we held the castle for 7 hours strait, even 
          pulled a patrol outside to pick up the warlord spawn. After the first 
          few minutes the other groups left cuase we were killin everything, and 
          about two hours in a few newbie tried to start a throne group, the first 
          one to cross the bridge got a chalange to a duel fomr every person in 
          the group, at once. It turned out he was a stuck up dork and the honer 
          of killing him went to our lvl 50 ranger. Soon after the newbies didnt 
          cross the bridge anymore, we wernt going to stop em, just we would have 
          takin the spawns anyways, they cant really out dmg us hehe. About 5 
          hours in there was about 3 full groups holding right outside the moat, 
          as if they were to afraid to enter, and after all our group got every 
          item that drops there, we decided to let a group in, no one would hehe.
        <p> I HIGHLY suggest others do this, tis a great way to blow a days worth 
          of your life. <br>
