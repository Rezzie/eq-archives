  <hr>
  <p align="left">Ahh, ok. I'll share my humiliations. Hope that even if you don't 
    have ANY to contribute (oh! Cmon now!) that at least you'll enjoy mine.</p>
  <p align="left">1. First 62 seconds of my first characters life: I arrive in 
    Surefall in the dead of night completely blind. I take two steps, land in 
    the water and drown because I can't see that I'm attempting to climb out while 
    under the dock. A fifth level druid fishes overhead and uses me for spell 
    practice.</p>
  <p align="left">2. First half hour of my second characters life: I'm getting 
    the hang of this game! Wow! Look I can kill bats. And rats! Hey! Look at that 
    rat! Die rat! Die. Slow down so I can hit you, rat! Hey! What are Dread Corpses? 
    Hey, why am I loading? Did I switch zones again?</p>
  <p align="left">3. Look. My first loot haul. I'm gonna sell all these snake 
    skins and buy myself a shield. Gosh that shopkeeper sure is polite--he keeps 
    saying "Thank you". Why didn't he give me any money?</p>
  <p align="left">4. Oh, I wonder what the guards will say if I hail them? I type 
    H..A..and die.</p>
  <p align="left">5. Hey! Look at that cute little gnome standing in the entrance 
    of Surefall Glade! What a cute little name...I'm going to go talk to them. 
    Why is my hit bar...oh...Loading again.</p>
  <p align="left">6. I'm 5th level. Slow going in the Hills, especially if you 
    can't kill wolves. Hmmm. Maybe I'll go scout BB. Wow! There's a lot of people 
    here! Omigod, look at all those gnolls boiling outta that doorway! Run! Run! 
    *Splash* [3 hours later a GM finally recovered my corpse for me--it had disappeared 
    and 20 people must have petitioned in my behalf. My eternal gratitude to the 
    GM Taedium who merely called me silly when I gave him consent to loot my corpse.]</p>
  <p align="left">7. Oh, I learned my lesson...not going back to BB without a 
    group--and until higher level. At 6, I find a pair of rangers who are up to 
    the challenge. Hey look--a gnoll pup! Well, there's nothing else to kill and 
    sometimes they have good stuff. I'll just step into the big tree to get behind 
    him and .... ahhhhhhhhh...*splash* [This time, a barbarian shaman graciously 
    loots my corpse for me and returns all the pitiful pieces of cloth and patchwork. 
    I sob with gratitude--it was scary down there.]</p>
  <p align="left">8. Hmmm, patrolled the tunnel tween Everfrost and BB--I can 
    kill the guards there no problem. Hey look at that train! There's some guardsmen! 
    Sure, I tell my group, guards are no problem. I can kill those. Ack! Loading 
    again. (Will I ever learn to con?)</p>
  <p align="left">9. Boy! I hate BB! No more of that! I'm going to the Karanas. 
    Druids are made for the great outdoors, right? Camouflage will keep me safe. 
    A hour later, skirting the hills I've seen giants and huge spiders and lion 
    after lion after lion. I could really use some company. Look! A ranger and 
    a warrior up there. I'll just go have a chat and see if they want a druid 
    to go along. I drop my camo so they can see me--none of that spooky voice 
    outta nowhere thing for me. What? A Bandit begins to cast a spell. Your skin 
    freezes. A Brigand begins to cast a spell. Your skin ignites. Loading again. 
    Didn't even have time to /loc. When will I learn?</p>
  <p align="left">10. I die in BB. I die in the Karanas. *sniff* I guess I'll 
    just hunt down every skeleton in the Hills until I finally level. Oh look, 
    a gnoll scout. Quick! I want that faction. Zap him with Burst of Fire. Owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! 
    It's Gnasher! Loading again.</p>
  <p align="left">Heck--that's just the first 6 levels. </p>
