<p align="center"><font size="4">Business Travel - by Toraque</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left">Travel and the experiences it can bring are rewarding in many 
  ways, not only in the knowledge of different ways of life, but also in the personal 
  growth one can see by reaching new horizons. Unfortunately, it can also keep 
  one from Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">1: LOGGING ON TO EVERQUEST Difficulties exist in the attainment 
  of a connection to an Everquest server that do not occur at one's home. Typically, 
  a business traveler carries at best a laptop, which lacks the horsepower to 
  run Everquest at anything approaching the playable:</p>
<p align="left">WARRIOR: Here's the plan--I'll pull the room. Enchanter, you mesmerize 
  the two guards on the right, Druid, I want you to kite the one on the left for 
  a minute and then bring it back, Ranger, you shoot arrows at anything that moves 
  and keep an eye out for big things heading this way.</p>
<p align="left">CLERIC: What’s the Business Traveler going to do?</p>
<p align="left">WARRIOR: Well, he hasn't moved for five minutes, so probably not 
  very much.</p>
<p align="left">As an alternative, one could pack a more powerful desktop computer, 
  but that would require either paying expensive air freight or excess baggage 
  fees, or cutting down on other luggage you might otherwise bring with you. </p>
<p align="left">BOSS: So it looks like we can revitalize the contract if we can 
  talk the home office into accepting a ten percent downturn on the . . . Weren't 
  you wearing that shirt yesterday?</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: Uh, yes.</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: And the day before that?</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: err . . . I left all my clothes back home so I could 
  bring my computer. But I made level thirty!</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: You're fired.</p>
<p align="left">One could also choose to rent or buy a computer while in country, 
  but aside from the expense, this option has several problems of it's own, which 
  brings us to:</p>
<p align="left">2: FOREIGN LANGUAGE BARRIERS The sad fact remains that most countries 
  in the world do not have English as the primary spoken language. This alone 
  is enough to deter many of those who would otherwise be able to log on to EQ, 
  especially if they have chosen to acquire a computer while in this non-English 
  speaking land.</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: Sawadee.</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: I need to rent a computer to play Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: Pah-sah, mai bin lai?</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Err, Computer? (mimes typing on a keyboard)</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: (Looks confused, then hands him something.)</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: No, that's a typewriter. Computer? Microsoft? 
  Bill Gates?</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: (Looks confused, then hands him something.)</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: No, that's a live squid. Never mind.</p>
<p align="left">Even in countries that speak a majority of English, Everquest 
  can be blocked by local customs:</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: G'Day, mate!</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: I need to rent a computer to play Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: Computer? Why? There's a pub, mate, let's go get pissed!</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Err, okay.</p>
<p align="left">(next morning)</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: G'Day, mate!</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: (Hung over) I need to rent a computer to play 
  Everquest.</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: Computer? Why? There's a pub, mate, let's go get pissed!</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Uh, okay. (next morning)</p>
<p align="left">CLERK: G'Day, mate!</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: (Extremely hung over) I need (urk) to rent 
  a computer to play Everquest. </p>
<p align="left">CLERK: Computer? Why? There's a pub, mate, let's go get pissed!</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Uh, I think I'm going to vomit.</p>
<p align="left">3: DIFFICULTIES ARISING FROM THE TRAVEL ITSELF</p>
<p align="left">Should a method of connecting to an Everquest server be determined, 
  the combined results of jet lag, local alcohols and fatigue can often result 
  in tragic consequences.</p>
<p align="left">(After a tough fight)</p>
<p align="left">RANGER: Well, we probably would have survived if you hadn't kept 
  casting 'Bravery' on that fire goblin.</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Did I do that?</p>
<p align="left">ENCHANTER: At least you only did it twice. Then you knocked me 
  in the lava.</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Err . . .</p>
<p align="left">RANGER: Moron.</p>
<p align="left">4: EXPECTATIONS OF ACTUAL WORK</p>
<p align="left">Often, once an employer has gone through the expense of purchasing 
  the airfare, hotel reservations, outlaying the per diem and all of the other 
  costs involved with running a project halfway around the world, they have some 
  concrete beliefs concerning what exactly you should be doing while you are living 
  on their expense voucher.</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: So once we get system installed, we can deliver your report 
  and make sure we can get the funding the second phase of operations. Is your 
  report ready for the customer?</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: Well, I'm still in the, err, conceptual phase and, uh, 
  waiting on, uh . .</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: Waiting on?</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: Err, waiting on the, uh, concepts to, uh, phase . . 
  .</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: So basically you haven't done any work for the whole time 
  you've been there.</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: Pretty much.</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: You're fired.</p>
<p align="left">5: LOCAL APPEARANCES OF THE FOUR HORSEMEN</p>
<p align="left">Sadly, much of the world is prone to periods of famine, murder 
  or war. Murphy’s law dictates that wherever you go will be the place that riots, 
  a coup d'etat, massive currency devaluation or outbreaks of plague will happen.</p>
<p align="left">(True story)</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: One of our guys caught Typhoid. We need you to go replace 
  him.</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: Wait a minute, we find out the hard way that the place 
  you want me to go is disease-infested, It's already put one guy in the hospital, 
  and you want me to go there? Do I even get hazardous duty pay?</p>
<p align="left">BOSS: No. Pack your bags.</p>
<p align="left">EMPLOYEE: Shit.</p>
<p align="left">Aside from this is fact that, in many places of the world, Americans 
  are not highly regarded.</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: Take me to a computer store. I need to rent 
  a computer to play Everquest. </p>
<p align="left">LOCAL DRIVER: (Nervously) We go to hotel now, yes?</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: No, I need to a computer store to--what are 
  all those people over there shouting?</p>
<p align="left">LOCAL DRIVER: Ahh, they shout, 'Death to Clinton and piss on fucking 
  Americans!' (Mob begins to burn a US flag.)</p>
<p align="left">LOCAL DRIVER: You are American, yes?</p>
<p align="left">BUSINESS TRAVELER: (Sweating bullets) Uh, Vat, me? Me Sveedish! 
  To Hotel vee go!</p>
<p align="left">On final analysis, it appears that while it is possible to play 
  Everquest while on a business trip to a foreign country, it's not without difficulty 
  or in extreme cases, assorted dangers. With this in mind, I would give Business 
  Travel four out of five stars for being able to prevent someone from playing 
  Everquest. Toraque Hirsuane, The Rathe Ranger and Business Traveler Darwin,
