      <blockquote>
        <p> (EverQuest is so HEAVILY unfair to mobs. Some exceptional mobs are 
          able to overcome one or more of the limitations below, but it's not 
          worth mentioning). </p>
        <p>1) Neutral or friendly mobs can't "consider" us to check if we like 
          them (they can only hope that we will pass by or be content with doing 
          quest transactions with them). </p>
        <p>2) Aggressive mobs don't really attack us "on sight", or they are as 
          blind as moles (we can remain just outside their reaction radius, showing 
          them our butt and eating our lunch unpunished until we are ready to 
          fight, while they stand there trying to look dignified, and we can cast 
          our first spell at them comfortably). </p>
        <p>3) Mobs have no idea of what a "group" of players is: they "consider" 
          you to know your level before deciding to either attack/retaliate or 
          stay-very-quiet/flee, but they seem to forget to add up your friends 
          standing just next to you, before making their decision (would you go 
          thinking "great, there is one blue gnoll just next to these five red 
          gnolls, I can attack it safely" ?) </p>
        <p>4) Mobs don't routinely go invisible (they could ambush and hunt us 
          nicely; we would shout all the time "plz give me see invis" in addition 
          to "plz give me sow").</p>
        <p> 5) Mobs can't camp us at our home point (unless we had real bad inspiration 
          when choosing our binding place. Imagine the mobs sitting at your home 
          point for hours and chatting: "Do you think he'll spawn soon ? - Wait, 
          /who Dumbo all... He's on Plane of Fear, he should spawn soon"). </p>
        <p>6) Mobs don't have Harmony to pull us one-by-one (psst, mob, take your 
          revenge, pull the Druid first...) </p>
        <p>7) Mobs can't kite us (mob would go: "yeah, Druid, run panting after 
          me while your life is eaten away by DOT"). </p>
        <p>8) Mobs can't check the Internet for spoilers and tactics (they could 
          have arguments on mob discussion forums, such as "Should one kill the 
          healer or evac player first ? - The healer first, but all go interrupt 
          the evac when cast - No, one or two must stick to the healer, and the 
          others must wait until near the end of evac's 9-seconds casting time, 
          so the players lose more time - Save your bash to stun the evac player 
          - No, save it to interrupt the life-saving Greater Healing", and so 
          on). </p>
        <p>9) Mobs don't have long-distance communication, such as group chat 
          and guild chat (they cry for help in a ridiculously small radius around 
          them, and they can tell their story over a long distance only by giving 
          us bad faction when they die. Imagine the Blackburrow gnolls with a 
          "radio gnoll" chat channel to coordinate their resistance against us 
          intruders, with the gnoll commander managing his troops dungeon-wide).</p>
        <p> 10) A single mob routinely gets six of us pounding at it all of a 
          sudden, without anybody ever shouting "train" as a warning. </p>
        <p>11) Mobs can't taunt us away from our opponent (picture yourself forced 
          to give up your nearly dead mob opponent and to face a fresh mob instead...) 
        </p>
        <p>12) Mobs can't zone or Gate when in danger; they would leave us exhausted, 
          with no exp, walking back to our camp spot, and having forgotten about 
          them even if they zone back in. </p>
        <p>13) Mobs can't loot our bodies (did you say "Ultima Online" ? <shriiieeek>) 
        </p>
        <p>14) Mobs don't gain exp and levels when killing players (with any luck, 
          a gnoll pup could survive in Blackburrow several months, and grow big 
          enough to kill higher level players on their way to Permafrost, then 
          eventually become a mega-death level 50 gnoll equal to Vox or Nagafen 
          - possibly giant size but still with "a gnoll pup" name tag, or maybe 
          it would have been allowed to choose a second name at level 20, such 
          as "a gnoll pup Spot").</p>
        <p> 15) Mobs can't plan elaborate large-scale expeditions into a city 
          to kill a level 50 player rumored to drop rare and valuable loots.</p>
        <p> 16) Mobs can't use cyber-flirt emotes ("a burly gnoll stares dreamily 
          into a gnoll pup's eyes", "an elite gnoll guard massages a gnoll commander's 
          shoulders"), get married in the Arena, get drunk (with Blackburrow Stout 
          of course), and duel (by the way, only some mobs such as cat people 
          have distinct males and females; you can't really tell about frogloks, 
          because frog females don't have tits which I know of; but all gnolls, 
          goblins and orcs, for instance, look like males: are they all homosexuals, 
          and/or did they manage to hide their females out of our reach ?)</p>
