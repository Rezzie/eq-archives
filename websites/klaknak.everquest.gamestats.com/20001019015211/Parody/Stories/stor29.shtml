  <p align="center">Confustibulifuscious' Traveling Guide to the Greater Qeynos 
    Area - by Phaethon</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> Greetings, traveler. I am Confustibulifucious, renowned gnomish 
    explorer. I have compiled this Guide after much research in Qeynos and the 
    surrounding parts, and many bottles of liquor. Enjoy.</p>
  <p align="left">So you want to travel to Qeynos, eh? Well, odds are, you're 
    somewhere else now. Halas, or Freeport, or maybe another continent. I don't 
    know, quit asking. Damnit, no, start over.</p>
  <p align="left">So, you want to travel to Qeynos, eh? Well, you'll probably 
    need provisions. No you don't what am I saying this stupid automatic writer 
    I hate that tinkerer I'll killllllllllll</p>
  <p align="left">&lt;MEANINGLESS SCRIBBLE&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">So, you want to travel to Qeynos, eh? Well, you'll need to prepare 
    beforehand. Make sure you aren't just starting adventuring. Unless you're 
    in Erudin, in which case leave that hellhole now before it's too late! You'll 
    need some armor and a weapon. No, not nice ones. You may die on the way. Plus, 
    gnolls are like monkeys and throw... things at you.</p>
  <p align="left">If you're in Halas, and want to leave that ice cube of a city, 
    then you have to pass through Blackburrow. The entrance to Blackburrow is 
    near some snow-covered rocks, in case you don't know.</p>
  <p align="left">If you're on Faydwer, also known as Munchkinland or Home of 
    the Oompa-Loompas, then you have to take a boat, then walk a while. You'll 
    pass the people from Freeport, so say hi to them. Oh, wait, here they come 
    now.</p>
  <p align="left">If you're in Freeport, then all you need to do is make a two-day 
    run. You can't stop to sleep or griffins will kill you. You can't stop to 
    rest or brigands will crush you. You can't stop to breathe or fire beetles 
    will gnaw you to death. Or, depending on whether you can live through one 
    of those, you can.</p>
  <p align="left">If you're in Grobb or Oggok, stay there. You smell, and when 
    you die your corpses kill the grass.</p>
  <p align="left">Any cities I forgot can just get lost.</p>
  <p align="left">No matter where you come from, you'll arrive in Qeynos Hills. 
    This place is also known as the Miserable Newbie Zone. People come from all 
    over Norrath just to whine in this zone. At all times, the air rebounds with 
    people shouting &quot;How do you turn left?&quot; and &quot;Hey, this isn't 
    Asheron's Call!&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">Naturally, all of this stupidity compacted in one place naturally 
    attracts tricksters. (amazingly, sometimes it becomes compact enough to actually 
    gain substance. I tripped over a big chunk of &quot;Help! I can't figure out 
    how to stand up!&quot; one time) I tend to encourage these tricksters, for 
    they are also stupid. Their brilliant schemes most often consist of &quot;Give 
    me money.&quot; I like to charge them 1 pp for a better scheme, which consists 
    of charging other people for your schemes.</p>
  <p align="left">An interesting thing to do is to challenge a stupid person to 
    a duel and wait a long time (of course they don't accept, they forget after 
    a while). Then, answer one of their questions &quot;To do that, you need to 
    type '/duel Confustibulifucious'&quot;. Then you can kill them. The trick 
    is to be devoid of pity.</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, so you've zoned into Northern Qeynos. I feel badly for you. 
    You have just now probably noticed the vast tide of newbies swarming over 
    the place. It's almost literally a tide. It surges out, killing every weak 
    thing in sight, then rushes back in when they become too weak or everything 
    is annihilated. For a fun way to stem this tide, or at least cut a big path 
    in it, find Queen Kliknik. Slash her once, then run until you find a newbie 
    fighting a fire beetle or Drone. Then Hide, or go invis, or feign, or whatever. 
    Watch the flaming liquid spray and roast some newbie on the end of a stick.</p>
  <p align="left">Once you're done toying with the lives of young ones, trot to 
    the gate. There should, if the schedule is correct, be a crowd there (schedule: 
    12 PM to 12 AM, Mon-Fri, teem meaninglessly in front of gate). Half will be 
    meditating/healing, half will be selling/buying, and half (math was never 
    my strong point) will be annoying/dying. Most will be doing the latter half.</p>
  <p align="left">Interestingly enough, it is fairly easy to blend in here. Simply 
    remove any pieces of armor that show, put away any weapon, and play stupid. 
    Constantly sit and stand, while going &quot;Hail&quot; &quot;Hail&quot; &quot;Hail&quot; 
    &quot;Hail&quot; &quot;Hail&quot;. When someone says something to you, talk 
    like this: &quot;I new. Have you the sword mine? Rabbit. Rabbit. Rabbit. Hail.&quot; 
    The key is gibberish.</p>
  <p align="left">There are entities called &quot;guards&quot; here. They enjoy 
    killing you for the slightest offense. Don't be fooled by their apparent &quot;rescues&quot;: 
    have you noticed what they're killing when they &quot;rescue&quot; someone? 
    Rats, and beetles, and Tomer Instogle. It's just a ploy to get you to lower 
    your guard (no pun intended) and then POW they attack and your wife has left 
    you and now a halfling bill collector wants to repossess your house and your 
    children never visit and</p>
  <p align="left">&lt;DISSOLVES INTO PLEA FOR DEATH TO COME SOON. RESUMES A PARAGRAPH 
    LATER&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">Yes... errrrr... excuse me. Anyway, the guards kill you a lot. 
    Can't really see anything funny in that. Maybe irony? No...</p>
  <p align="left">Ok, let's move one. The merchants. They are evil. They take 
    your goods at a quarter of their value, pay you a tiny amount, and sell nothing 
    but junk. I've attempted to annoy them by selling them eight Backpacks full 
    of Rat Whiskers (1280 Whiskers in all) they just gave me a billion copper 
    in return and remained unfazed. If you attack them, they kill you. </p>
  <p align="left">There are also non-guards and non-merchants, who are called 
    &quot;stupid&quot;. They pretend to give you a lot of quests or something. 
    If you attack them, they either kill you or their friends do. </p>
  <p align="left">There is also a big ocean in South Qeynos. If you attack it, 
    it goes &quot;Splash&quot;. It doesn't kill you, unless you have never swum 
    before. Then it kills you.</p>
  <p align="left">All in all, Qeynos isn't the friendliest town. Everything kills 
    you. All there is to do is buy some Short Ale and have a drink. If you ever 
    see me, I'll be the only Gnomish &quot;a beggar&quot; in the sewers.</p>
  <p align="left">Confustibulifucious is a Akannon Post staff writer. He currently 
    resides in the slime that you discard. Spare him some copper? He'll wash your 
    armor for bread.</p>
