  <p>The Verant Philoosophy (sic) by Rendr.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">[Editor's Note: Now loading ...]</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">We all pondered, all of us, about the moronic decisions that 
    Verant makes. The seeming stupidity, casually ignoring the protests of its 
    customers, disdainfully shrugging off petitions or ignoring them altogether. 
    It seems as if there is neither rhyme nor reason to any of it. "It is contrary 
    to game philosophy," or some similar phrase is always given as the reason. 
    Sometimes it is "bad for the player-run economy," but it all really leans 
    to the same issue. I wondered and pondered, frustrated at the apparent stupidity 
    of it all, and then suddenly I was enlightened. It all became clear to me 
    in a peaceful flash, and I haven't been the same sense. Verant's game philosophy 
    can be summed up in just a few words. Knowing this, it explains everything, 
    makes all clear, penetrates to the heart of all motives. Simply put, you have 
    to die. You must die as often as possible but continue to struggle for the 
    accomplishment you will never achieve.</p>
  <p align="left">The best way to illustrate is to take example of the changes 
    that have been made. Let's begin with the enchanter. Memory blur was not resistible, 
    and it cleared the monster's hate list. Well, we can't have that. If the big 
    monsters that can kill you cannot remember who they hate, then you would get 
    to live. That's contrary to game philosophy. You HAVE to die.</p>
  <p align="left">Nerfing kiting? Anyone? It's simple. If you are kiting, then 
    the monsters you worry about can't catch you and kill you. If you can kite, 
    you aren't dying, and of course, that's contrary to game philosophy.</p>
  <p align="left">Ever wonder why in every zone, Verant put at least one highly 
    aggressive monster that is far more powerful than any player who can productively 
    hunt there? Griffins in East Commons, Hill Giants in West commons (not to 
    mention the dark elf dragoons for you good races), young Kodiaks in Nektulos, 
    Spectres and Sand giants in RO, and Oasis. We could also talk about the Paladins 
    in Innothule, the vengeful soloist in Everfrost. It goes on and on. Why? It's 
    so simple, it means that at any moment, you might have to die, and there is 
    no safety. Better yet, there is absolutely nothing you can do about it because 
    they will spawn right on your head if they need to. Everybody dies. It's a 
    perfect implementation of game philosophy.</p>
  <p align="left">Ever wonder why Verant not only made merchants virtually invincible 
    but also aggressive to the wrong height or skin color or religious affiliation? 
    Bigots at Verant? No. no. no. It means that if you wander, WHEN you wander, 
    once again, you get to die, and you are completely powerless to keep it from 
    happening. You are tempted to death in the hope of selling this worthless 
    junk you have picked up. Enticed by the dream that you may get wealthy enough 
    to not die anymore, but Verant has your lesson ready for you. Game philosophy 
    is inescapable. </p>
  <p align="left">How about those enchanters again? Let's talk about Enchant Silver. 
    Is that a good opportunity to die or what? They put the only copy as deep 
    as they possibly could into the one city on Norrath guaranteed to kill you 
    on site. Neriak. Now all they have to do is make invisibility drop without 
    a seconds notice... Oh yeah, they could also have a lot of guards wandering 
    around the merchants... Wait, a necromancer just one room away would help... 
    with a pet! That's brilliant, a skeleton pet... And they have to try this 
    at 8th level? It's positively brilliant. They could not kill you more effectively 
    without camping your spawn point. It's almost as entertaining as having a 
    guide /kill you and giggle when you respawn.</p>
  <p align="left">What about those pet spells guys? Is that not sheer genius in 
    game philosophy application? Take the single most necessary spell of the pet 
    caster and bury it into one of the nastiest, most vicious locales known to 
    Norrath, and make them run it starting at 8th level. High Hold pass. If you 
    are 8th or 12th level, that is some real death for you. Or better yet, chicken 
    out, don't go get it. Live with that lvl 4 pet and try to keep going. Good 
    heaven is THAT ever some death. Always remember. You HAVE to die. It is required.</p>
  <p align="left">Want that glowing stein? OOOoooohhhh, yes. Pretty. So tempting. 
    All I need is that Koalindl fish... Uh oh. It's so simple and elegant. If 
    you kill the fish in Queynos they just dispatch a guard to kill you. Then 
    you die. Perfect. Or you can kill the dog in Halas, and the barbarians hate 
    you, and kill you. Perfect. Then take your final stuff to Ogguk where those 
    Ogres are just going to love you and hug you, and make you die. It's great.</p>
  <p align="left">But wait a minute. Damn! Those enchanters can do it without 
    dying. And it's easy for them. Well nuts. That is just an unacceptable violation 
    of game philosophy, so Verant will just make it worth less than half of what 
    it was, and now it doesn't matter at all. Oh well, have to put in some more 
    killing next time.</p>
  <p align="left">What about that economy? Isn't it great? If everyone is equally 
    poor, then it is child's play to make everyone die. They are all the same, 
    and easy to predict. The monsters can be built, and sure as hell they'll kill 
    everyone. If trade skills worked, or if something valuable were easy to get, 
    then only some of us would die. If someone could become rich, or if his wealth 
    made him powerful, he wouldn't die. It's contrary to game philosophy. Everybody 
    MUST die. It's so simple. I don't understand why I didn't see it before.</p>
  <p align="left">Similarly, if you come up with a really clever tactic to get 
    an edge, or if you are able to hone your skills and timing to perfection and 
    make yourself a little better than your fellow, you are in clear violation 
    of game philosophy. You're not dying. That's exploitation, and an offense 
    that they will terminate your account for. So make sure you post your excellent 
    ideas to message boards where Verant can read them and nerf them. That way 
    everybody gets to die again, and the philosophy is restored to its former 
    greatness once again.</p>
  <p align="left">Ever been killed through the wall? Through a door? Had an invincible 
    merchant teleport through his own shop to slay you in a single blow? It's 
    all great for maintaining game philosophy. If he hits you through a wall or 
    through the ceiling, or around a corner where you can't even target him back 
    , then it makes it even more likely that you will contribute your corpse to 
    the betterment of the game. Make certain that you do not do the same in return. 
    If you find a way to kill a monster where he cannot hit you back, that is 
    clearly an exploitation of game geometry and absolutely intolerable. If you 
    do that, you won't die, and you HAVE to die. It's required.</p>
  <p align="left">GM events. This is where Verant trains it's people on game philosophy. 
    They come running into a zone as a group where each member could easily slay 
    every player currently in the zone, and then they do just that. It's glorious. 
    Bodies are everywhere. Even after the greatest of warriors shows up, there 
    will still be casualty after casualty, and if there isn't. If someone just 
    actually walks up and kills the GMs, then that is a poor end. Very disappointing. 
    While they are at it, they make sure to reward those that die the best. If 
    you are the 50th level wizard that finally brought the beast down, you are 
    lucky is you get a polished copper, but if you were that low level shadow 
    knight who flung himself not only into death, but certain death, happy to 
    accept it, you may find yourself one of the richest newbies in the game. Won't 
    do you any good, I've seen that newbie in rubicite running from a moss snake, 
    but it will make you feel great about game philosophy.</p>
  <p align="left">If one death is good, how about multiple deaths? Isn't if great 
    that is you are smashed by something way out of your league, now you get to 
    go back stark naked to try it again? He'll almost certainly be waiting for 
    you, and the better you did before dying, the deeper you traveled, the more 
    certain it is that you will die not only once but twice, and mayhap even more? 
    That of course presumes that the wandering death machine for your zone doesn't 
    intercept you and increase the body count even further.</p>
  <p align="left">But more insidious yet, since you are certain to die, all those 
    little green beasties that can't kill you anymore get another shot at it, 
    and stark naked they will probably take you out, but on the off chance you 
    beat them, you certainly won't get any xp. And if there were anything just 
    too huge for you to even have a chance at anywhere near your body, you can 
    bet as sure as the sun rises that it will be camping your corpse, knowing 
    full well that you are WILLING to die to get that stuff back.</p>
  <p align="left">Game philosophy is in ultimate triumph. Do you see it now? Verant 
    isn't stupid. They are precise, methodical, and they have a simple, highly 
    maintained system for maintaining game philosophy. The skill with which they 
    make you die is absolutely commendable. They are intelligent, very good at 
    their jobs. The ranks of apathetic game masters and guides are eagerly in 
    training to be of such quality as their forbears, and skilled they are becoming. 
    It looks likely that Verant may have generations of people to come who are 
    capable and willing to enforce the noble quality of Everquest Game Philosophy.
