  <p>Caveat Emptor</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">For those who do not know, Caveat Emptor means: &quot;Because 
    you live in a capitalistic society, you are about to get screwed.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Certain people think that the following have lead to the moral 
    decline of America:</p>
  <p align="left">1. O.J. Simpson.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Bill Clinton.</p>
  <p align="left">3. The Cackling Klaknak </p>
  <p align="left">I beg to differ. All of the naysayers above presuppose that 
    things were fine before the denizens above came along and lied their asses 
    off. Not so. We, as a society, were as full of shit then as we are now, and 
    the biggest ... the number one reason why we feel we can lie our ass off is 
    because of all the companies out there who are trying to screw us out of a 
    buck by just flat out lying to us and misleading us. </p>
  <p align="left">And so, I present THE LIST.</p>
  <p align="left">1. Computer advertisements.</p>
  <p align="left">If you have the recent copy of PC Magazine, turn to the CDW 
    advertisement near the center. There, you will find the following advertised: 
    HP Vectra for only 759.95.</p>
  <p align="left">What? A computer for under a grand? What a great deal!</p>
  <p align="left">What they don't tell you, of course, is that the computer doesn't 
    come with a monitor.</p>
  <p align="left">What the hell? This is just plain ole misleading advertising. 
    Sure, they include the tiny font disclaimer under the computer (monitor sold 
    seperately), but this is just bullshit advertising plain and simple. I can 
    understand selling something where batteries are not included, but advertising 
    a computer without a monitor for a cheaper price is like advertising a car 
    without an engine. Yes! You too can afford the latest Mercedes model for only 
    $12,000 (engine, tires and chassis not included)!</p>
  <p align="left">2. Telemarketers:</p>
  <p align="left">One night when I was younger, I answered the phone while drunk. 
    This was my first mistake. The second mistake was saying &quot;yes&quot; when 
    the woman on the other end of the phone asked if I wanted to buy magazines 
    through a subscription service.</p>
  <p align="left">Now, when you buy magazines through these services, you really 
    do get a decent deal, but oh mama, do you pay the price. What is the price? 
    Having your name sold to every scum sucking telemarketer in the free world.</p>
  <p align="left">Sure, oh yeah, sure, I know, you can have your name taken off 
    these lists, but it takes forever to do so and it is a royal pain in the ass.</p>
  <p align="left">What I don't understand is how is it that some hapless woman 
    can sue McDonalds because she was dumb enough to spill coffee on herself, 
    but I cant sue a company for using my name as a company asset.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Phone companies</p>
  <p align="left">&lt;Klaknak's head explodes&gt;</p>
  <p align="left">4. The eleven o'clock news.</p>
  <p align="left">The Fox station out of Washington D.C. is absolutely shameless. 
    Here is what they do:</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Are our children denizens of the dark? News at Eleven.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Is Norv leaving the Skins? News at Eleven.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Do you suffer from Fecal Tunnel Syndrome? News at Eleven.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">So, you get your spinchter all tightened up waiting for the 
    news, but when you finally tune in, this is what you get:</p>
  <p align="left">Your children: Fox does an expose in which they take a hidden 
    camera into a night club. A short pimply kid says he smokes. Another says 
    she likes sex. Ooooooo.</p>
  <p align="left">Norv: No, he is not leaving.</p>
  <p align="left">Fecal Tunnel Syndrome: You could suffer from it, but the odds 
    are 1 out of 19, 000, 000 that you will contract it and even then only if 
    you are a Native American female paraplegic with a history of Lou Gherig's 
    disease on your mother's side of the family.</p>
  <p align="left">Bullshit.</p>
  <p align="left">5. Those automatic coffee machines.</p>
  <p align="left">This happened to me last night and it is the inspiration for 
    this little essay.</p>
  <p align="left">Go into any jiffy store in America and you will find an automatic 
    coffee machine that serves hot chocolate, cappacinno and some sort of nut 
    coffee. Also, inevitably, there are those little instructions that say &quot;hold 
    down the button until cup is 2/3 full.&quot; Then, inevitably, above that 
    is a hastily scrawled note from the local manager of the store: &quot;Hold 
    Down Button Until 2/3 Full. Don't Overflow.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">Well, here is the problem. None of these freaking things are 
    consistent. At the Exxon station near the university, if you release the button 
    after it is about half way full, you are going to have coffee dripping down 
    the counter and the surly attendant yelling at you. But if you go to the 7-11 
    near the Blockbuster, you have to hold that cotton pickin' thing down until 
    the cup is almost totally full or you will get jipped. Either way, these companies 
    play off our fear of the sulry attendant to force us to take less coffee than 
    we deserve.</p>
  <p align="left">Sure, some of you smart alecks could say that it is the variable 
    cup sizes that are making the difference, but I know better. I know that those 
    coffee vendors are trying to screw me by making my miss the optimal fill level 
    of my coffee. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">So you see ... the reason why we all feel like we can lie on 
    a daily basis is not because of the politicians or the double murderers but 
    because of all the scuzzy companies out there who are trying to make a quick 
    buck through a confidence job.</p>
  <p align="left">Buyer beware!</p>
