  <p align="center">The Nerd - by Cyanna Thunderhammer</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I heard that they are creating a new class for EQ, The Nerd. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">First, only humans can be nerds. Their primary stat is intelligence 
    which is higher even than the erudites and their charisma scores make ogres 
    and trolls seem like GQ cover models. They are limited to only hand-to-hand 
    combat with a skill cap of 10, and can only wear cloth armor. They also get 
    the tinkering skill. The nerd is a spell caster class similar to the enchanter. 
    They have a similar skill set except they get dodge at first level (from all 
    those years of dodging rocks, snowballs, and PE dodgeballs). Due to their 
    low charisma scores they get the full line of fear-type spells. When a nerd 
    approaches and starts to talk about their social life, stamp collecting, and 
    who was the best star trek captain, most mobs and players run for the zone. 
    They also have the skill of technobabble, which is similar to the enchanter 
    line of lull and mesmerize spells. Just let a nerd start talking about networks, 
    operating systems, and programming and not even the most well rested mob can 
    stay awake. </p>
  <p align="left">In addition the nerd will have their own set of quest armor. 
    They are: </p>
