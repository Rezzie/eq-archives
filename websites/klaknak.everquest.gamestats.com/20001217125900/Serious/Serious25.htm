  <p>Players Respond! - by the Cackling Klaknak</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> The replies to the alleged GM harrassment are voluminous. I 
    have tried my best to categorize the different emails below, although it was 
    rare that someone stuck to one topic only. I have also added a few comments 
    of my own at the end.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>GMs have a thankless job, give them a break.</b> <font color="#990000">Well 
  at first I thought I could bite my tongue and just read the story but then I 
  read the responses that were pouring in and just couldn't resist :). Let me 
  start off by saying that I used to be a guide but eventually quit as it just 
  wasn't for me. I just got tired of trying to determine which people were legitimately 
  in need of assistance and which were trying to beat the system. It's not as 
  easy as you would think and being a guide is one of the most thankless tasks 
  that you'll ever have. Believe me.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990000">Let me also say that the name &quot;euthenasia&quot; 
  is not just a harmless name and you can't just hide behind a dictionary definition. 
  Euthenasia is a hotly debated subject and a highly moral issue which will probably 
  NEVER be resolved. I can easily see how this name would be offensive to many. 
  As I said, hiding behind a dictionary won't help you with a moral issue. It's 
  not that cut-and-dried. Basically is comes down to this: </font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">1. This is a game. As a game, it could easily be compared 
  to any other game (basketball, volleyball, etc)<br>
  2. The GMs and Guides are the referees. Point blank. They make the calls and 
  issue the penalties for rule infractions. A referee's job is thankless as well. 
  People hardly ever praise a ref for good calls. He mainly gets in the spotlight 
  when he issues what is believed to be a bad call. Nobody ever notices a train 
  unless it's running late.<br>
  3. What happens when a player gets in the referee's face after what he believes 
  was a bad call? Yellow card, red card, getting thrown out of the game, etc. 
  Hmmm. Eerily similar. Strange, that.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">As in any game, the ref's call is FINAL. Badgering the 
  ref (Which is EXACTLY what the petitioner did to the guide. No denying it.) 
  will not change it. Issuing threats (You're gonna lose my business and I'll 
  post this everywhere on the net) will not change it. If anything, it strengthens 
  a ref's resolve. Now if he backs down, it's seen as a sign that they can be 
  bullied and strong-armed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000">In closing, the GM was right to change the name. He was 
  right not to back down from an abusive player. He was right to give the player 
  the e-mail address at Verant that he could escalate his complaint to. He was 
  right to<br>
  /kick an abusive player off the server for a little bit to cool off. My opinions 
  may be unpopular to some but they remain just that. My opinions. Take them as 
  you will. - Brent</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#990000">I can't believe the ignorance and stupidity of some of 
  the responses to this. 1. Guides are volunteers who try the best they can to 
  follow a set of guidelines and keep the game moving smoothly. 2. Guides are 
  the LEAST likely to be powergamers. They are giving up their playing time to 
  walk around Norrath and answer petitions and help people. Heck, they are even 
  'buffed' up to the level's they are at, they dont' PLAY to those levels. I'm 
  sure the poor apprentice didn't have the naming guidelines in front of him/her. 
  Meiko was just told by someone else that the name was changed because it was 
  wrong. What else needed to be said to the customer? He was spoken to as politely 
  as anyone could ever speak to him, and he kept sending tell after tell. I agree 
  that it WAS harassment, but on the players part harassing the Apprentice! The 
  customer was WAY WAY out of line near the end. Why doesn't everyone just sit 
  back and think about it. Realize that the guides and apprentices are just normal, 
  non-employees, who are VOLUNTEERING their time to try to help you out. They 
  should be given at least the same respect any other player would in the game, 
  if not more. - Devan</font></p>

<hr>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><b>Anti-Verant.</b></font><font color="#003399"> 
  Heyas Klaknak, It is interesting to note that Abashi has pointed out in a public 
  message area a way to contact Verant regarding complaints about GM's/Guides. 
  The email address is eqmail@verant.com fyi. I say this is interesting because 
  if there was not some perception of GM/Guide corruption, why make a public message 
  about the matter? Why give an address to send complaints to? Is there really 
  GM/Guide corruption? I asked three questions... and I propose three answers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#003399">First of all, the very fact a public message 
  by Abashi, public spokesperson for Verant, recongized this perception of GM/Guide 
  problems gives it validity. It is easy enough to hide behind a facade when no 
  or minimal problems occur, but when an issue is becoming widespread is when 
  it is acknowledged. There is a problem, Verant knows this and publicly has accepted 
  this. Ok, so they didn't come right out and say hey guys, we have corruption 
  in our ranks, but they did address the issue.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#003399">Second, they gave us an email address. I 
  suppose there is always the possibilty that an email could be just deleted when 
  it arrives, but let's suppose its really a valid address. Its also a general 
  email address, probably used for many things. But once again, this just supports 
  the concept there is a problem with players interacting with GM's/Guides and 
  this is one way to address the issue.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#003399">Last, is there really GM/Guide corruption? 
  Are there some bad apples out there in the bunch ruining the image for them 
  all? Perhaps players are just pushing the GM/Guides too far? Every person who 
  has ever dealt with a GM or Guide has left that encounter with an impression. 
  By far and large, most players leave with a good impression. Some appear to 
  be leaving with a bad impression. Granted GM's and Guides are human, prone to 
  making mistakes. Customer service is a pain to do right all the time. Sometimes, 
  no matter how hard you try, you screw up. I believe, and through personal experience, 
  there are some bad apples out there in the bunch, that GM/Guide corruption exists 
  in some form and when players push said GM/Guide's, things happen. For every 
  player out there who has had a good encounter with a GM/Guide, I hope that is 
  all you will have. For every other player who has had a bad experience, you 
  can make two choices. You can keep playing EQ in spite of the problems or you 
  can quit. I do not say this lightly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#003399">I have lost three corpses and inventory 
  items due to zone crashes, lost guild leadership and tag of my guild while zoning 
  and I have yet to have any of these issues addressed by a GM or Guide. In the 
  case of the items, all I have ever heard back from Verant is we are looking 
  into the matter. As far as the guild thing went, our guild was in decline anyways, 
  and this just put the lid on the coffin. We all just decided to disband. The 
  GM's and guides we contacted in this matter also gave me the run around, which 
  is to say, they were looking into the matter. Now in no way does this suggest 
  corruption or problems among GM's or Guides, but here is the kicker. After a 
  few days of petitioning about my problems, I was told if I continued to petition 
  the matter, I would be banned.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#003399">I don't believe in letting a game ruin my 
  day, its just a game after all. But let's face it folks, problems are out there 
  and will stay out there for some time. I have yet to play an online rpg where 
  the GM's or Guides weren't plagued with bad apples. If there wasn't, then sites 
  like the Clackling Klaknak, Dr. Twisters, Lum the Mad etc, etc, ad nauseam wouldn't 
  get these stories emailed to them. Sure not all of them out there are 100% accurate, 
  but they are out there. If it wasn't so depressing, I would say go out there 
  and take a look. Its a soap opera. Folks are going to message boards all over 
  the place to post their side of the story. The only reason they are doing this 
  is because once it has happend to you, there is nowhere to turn.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#003399">In closing, there are two sides to every 
  story. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Unless you happen to be the GM 
  of a server. Then you are god and you can do whatever you want. In that case, 
  you have no accountability and the story can be anything you choose. After all, 
  that is what you get paid to do. Make the game an ongoing, persistant story. 
  Put a spin on every nerf, every change to the game, address every concern. Remember 
  folks, only guides are volunteers. GM's actually collect a paycheck. Would you 
  want to get fired and lose your paycheck because of someone you pissed off in 
  a virtual world? Guides are volunteers, most are good folks, most are extremely 
  stressed out, some are on powertrips because they are guides. Those are the 
  ones you have to watch out for. Those and the GM's who think they are EQ. Special 
  Agent Bob</font></p>

<p align="left"><b>Semantics. </b></p>
<p align="left">There is one thing I do not understand in this whole affair: what 
  does 'Euthanasia' have to do with the holocaust? The holocaust was a genocide 
  and had IMHO not the slighest aspects of euthanasia in it. And I don't recall 
  the holocaust being passed off as an act of euthanasia either. I simply don't 
  see it. Any insights would be appreciated. Yours, Juergen P---</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This whole thing is JUST silly, and the name WAS illegal. Pure 
  and simple. For a few reasons. The first one is black and white and right from 
  the naming convention rules that the GM's REPEATEDLY told him to look at: "Common 
  words, phrases, or sentences non-suitable for the environment (e.g., Switchblade, 
  Phaser, Ikillorcs)." Euthanasia is a common word. The sheer fact that they repeatedly 
  made references to it's definition made it an illegal name. Euthanasia is not 
  a name. It is a word. Sure there are a TON of other players out there with far 
  more blatantly silly names (inagodda devita comes to mind or dirtydancer) does 
  not make your name more suitable. My characters name is also illegal and if 
  asked by a guide to change it I would, since it is a word in the dictionary.</p>
<p align="left">Second, is it's offensiveness. Lets not even get into the Holocaust. 
  Anyone who thinks that Euthanasia is not offensive to some has lived under a 
  rock for years. If it was not offensive or controversial, Kevorkian (sp?) would 
  not be a household name. Christianity does not condone suicide in any form. 
  Now my undies are not in a bunch over this name at all. I am not offended by 
  it. That does NOT mean that the name is not offensive to many others.</p>
<p align="left">In my view the ONLY mistake the guide made was not SAYING that 
  the petition was closed. But come on, anyone who read that log could tell well 
  before the first warning that it was closed, and at least this guide in particular 
  was not going to change his mind. And he gave you plenty of warning to let it 
  drop. I cant believe that this has upset so many gamers. EQ is getting ruined 
  for me, but it is not the guides or verrant that are ruining it. It is self 
  righteous people like this who believe just cause they pay a measley 10 bucks 
  a month that verrant should elevate them to the level of royalty. I dont know 
  how many ooc's I get an hour that are bitching about one thing or another and 
  claiming that verrant sucks, that the game sucks, that their class sucks. Then 
  play another class. Play another game. Stop paying verrant your 10 bucks a month 
  and make the game world a better place for us all. If you dont enjoy the game 
  or the company, dont play. - Eric</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I still don't see the problem with the name Euthanasia. If anyone 
  uses it at any time, does that mean they are referring to the Holocaust? While 
  it is a pity that a word (any word) in our language should be tied to such a 
  tragedy, I don't get pictures of goose-stepping brown shirts when someone says 
  this word. Holocaust, Aryan, Master-race, Concentration Camp however, I do. 
  And I can't hear the name of some European cities without thinking of the atrocities 
  of Nazi Germany. Dachau comes to mind immediately. I would rather see Guides/GMs 
  changing people's names like Brittany Spears and Fight Club (both seen recently 
  on different servers) than Euthanasia. But that is just MO. Also, the actions 
  of the Guide/GM in this are very suspect. Sounds like someone who made a decision, 
  got called on it, didn't have an answer and just deicded to not admit he could 
  have been wrong. Pride is a bitch, isn't it? - Jeff</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (150th anniversary edition) 
  defines Euthanasia as "the act or practice of killing individuals (as persons 
  or animals) that are hopelessly sick or injured for reasons of mercy." How does 
  this relate to the Holocaust? The Holocaust was an act of prejudice and hate, 
  and was a massacre. The same dictionary defines holocaust as "a sacrifice by 
  fire" and "a thorough destruction by fire." Euthanasia is about mercy. The Holocaust 
  was about fire and hate. What gets me more than the behaviour by both parties 
  in this issue is that neither takes the time to either explain why the word 
  Euthanasia is or isn't offensive (and it isn't a "common word" - how often do 
  you hear it used in conversation or the media without referring to Jack Kevorkian?) 
  That a guide would say it reminds him of the Holocaust shows extreme ignorance 
  of both vocabulary and history on his part. It is offensive to me that there 
  are people out there who think 5 million jews were killed in "an act... of mercy." 
  It is extremely troubling that some of these people are online administrators 
  for a game I love to play. The original petition by the "offended" player should 
  have been answered with the definition, and the petitioner told to go jump in 
  the Ocean of Tears. - Icehand</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">People are confusing 'Euthanasia', which means the 'assisted dying' 
  ( a'la kevorkian ) of a terminally ill person, with 'Eugenics', which means 
  the systematic killing of those who are considered undesireable in order to 
  improve the genetic makeup of a race. Hitler was applying an extreme version 
  of eugenics, not euthanasia. - Gleam</p>

<p align="left"><b>Forgery?</b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">I am not a constant reader of your site 
  but I do pop in time and again and enjoy it each time. I read the bit about 
  the naming problem and have to agree with both sides in a way. First off the 
  GM and their actions were and are totally unacceptable. This is NOT the first 
  I have heard of this on the nameless server and definately won't be the last. 
  I have been playing EQ since mid beta and have not stopped since. The guides 
  and GM action were unacceptable regardless of the customers responses. The customer 
  was out of line in his approach to the subject. The Guides/GM failed to follow 
  their own policy on name changing in either case since person X was not contacted 
  except to inform the name IS being changed. No choice was given to choose a 
  different name. Customer did "according to his 'log'" a "who gm all" and should 
  have noticed himself that a GUIDE on that server HAS a name that IS in violation 
  of the naming policy. With this information he should have stopped and just 
  written Verant direct and just had his wife play the game with the new name 
  until he received information from Verant.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">I will post a portion from your site in 
  which his log is included and explain a bit: What follows is his "supposed" 
  log. along with my comment onto why it is unbelievable. His first command /who

<p align="left"><font color="#990099">[Thu Dec 23 21:05:54 1999]There are 6 players 
  in EverQuest</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">When a quiry is done on GM's you will either 
  receive the names and location (as shown) but you will NOT see any of the ones 
  that are anonymous. The supposed 6 players according to his quiry say that one 
  guide is anon. An anon guide will not be seen in ANY quiry. If an anon guide 
  is even in the same zone as you are and you see their name and do a / you will 
  receive a list of all players within the zone but the guide standing in front 
  of you and is anon will NOT show up on this quiry. That is why they have to 
  ability to go anon, to investigate without being seen. That right there makes 
  his entire story unacceptable to me.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">The nameless server and the Guides and GM's 
  that serve on it are know for their rudeness. I don't play on the Nameless so 
  I don't speak from firsthand experience but many old beta testers I used to 
  be with do now play there. I know around 14 full guides and senior guides on 
  various servers and have spoken with them at lenght after I read this as well. 
  For anyone who cares I know of two servers that have outstanding guides....Mithanial 
  Marr and Brell Serellis.. there are very good guides on other serves as well 
  but from the 4 servers I play on these two are in my opinion the best..I tend 
  to play mainly on the E'ci and can't say anything good about the guides there. 
  heh.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">Unfortunately both parties in this situation 
  reacted wrongly. The customer should have kept his cool and just wrote or phoned 
  Verant to discuss the matter. Also to note the Guide named MAJICAL has a name 
  that is in violation of the naming policy since it is a common name with a misspelling. 
  He should make note of this in his letter to Verant. Sorry if I jumped subject 
  here and there but I'm writing from work in the background heh. I wish to stay 
  anon so if any of this information is posted or used please refrain from passing 
  along the personals :o)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">When I speak of the guides being anon and 
  non see able I know what I speak of....I used to be a guide and had to quit 
  due to personal real life reasons and serious lack of time. If I guided I wouldn't 
  have had any time to play :-P Another little something for those looking for 
  places they may get support. Verant has an unwritten policy concerning Guides/GM's 
  and guilds. Since guides within a normal guild could lead to conflict of interest, 
  game knowledge, they don't support it but don't disallow it. Most servers with 
  decent guides have their OWN guild. i.e. Guardians of E'ci. These guides "support" 
  their server by taking a guild name with their server name in it. Having 2 GM/Guide 
  guilds is in my opinion reason enough for me not to even want to play on that 
  server. heh. Also, just because the customer was speaking with an apprentice 
  does it in no way mean the apprentice kicked him from the server, said apprentice 
  could have been speaking on guildchannel/grouptalk/tell with a Senior or GM 
  and they could have kicked him. An apprentice has under NO CIRCUMSTANCE any 
  authority to issue any type of warning. REGARDLESS and this is something that 
  Verant stands by. Even if the lead GM told the apprentice to issue a warning, 
  that in itself violates rules and regulations set down for the guides. Ok, I've 
  rambled enough for now heh. Hope you aren't just shaking your head. I've just 
  had enough of players ragging on the Guides and I've had enough of bad guides 
  two and this is a serious case of BOTH. Sucky GMs and Jerky Players. heh Nice 
  combo eh? - anonymous</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">Ok, I'm sure you're getting a lot of email 
  about this, but I have to ask this. Since when can an Apprentice Guide boot 
  someone? I'm quite sure they can't, this person is clearly lying. - Jeffrey</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#990099">You know, as a former apprentice guide, 
  an apprentice has no power really. The guide that supposedly booted him was 
  an apprentice, and they do not have the gm commands turned on so that they can 
  do things like /kill mobs or teleport or resurrect, or boot someone off the 
  server. Seeing how thats the case you really have to doubt he was booted, since 
  the apprentice couldnt do it. - Greg H.</font></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>GM Powers.</b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#009900">I read through the article about the GM 
  abuse relating to the name change and also read through the chat log. I have 
  a concern that the log was significantly altered because it shows the apprentice 
  guide doing things that are not possible. First, only Senior Guides and up (Senior, 
  Elder, GM's) have the kick command. An APPRENTICE is not given such a powerful 
  tool. Even normal guides do not recieve that tool. If you look at the /who gm 
  list, no senior, elder, or gm were on meaning the player could not have been 
  kicked. Also, I am not familiar with how the Nameless guides work, but on the 
  servers I play the Guides are often in a guild with the server name (i.e. Keepers 
  of E. Marr) and not in two randomly named guilds. Also, when an apprentice guide 
  is in a situation they cannot handle (such as name changes) they are required 
  to escalate it immediately. Since there were two full guides on, an apprentice 
  would have no reason to keep something that they couldn't handle, especially 
  since the customer was extremely irate. Lastly, regarding the 'warnings' given 
  by the apprentice guide, they do not have any such powers. They are in a learning 
  process and only deal with abuse issues as a witness to a guide. - Michael</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>Potpourri</b></p>
<p align="left">I just finished reading your article on GM harassment. Got several 
  things to say about it.</p>
<p align="left">1. I was once a guide on Fenin-Ro, gave it up because of time 
  constraints. All of the guides and GM's I worked with were people of the highest 
  caliber.</p>
<p align="left">2. As you pointed out, Guides are all volunteers. Anyone who doubts 
  how difficult the job is, or thinks that guides or GM's are, as one of your 
  contributors put it "To me, the new GM is nothing more than a powergamer out 
  for the newest level of gaming" should volunteer for the program and see it 
  for themselves. You cannot fight or quest while guiding.</p>
<p align="left">3. The only way to verify or prove false the log presented is 
  to have another copy of it. Guides I served with all used the "shift reporter" 
  program. This program keeps you from having to keep mountains of notes on your 
  shifts. It also requires that you log your sessions as a guide, so the guide 
  in question might very well have a copy of his conversation.</p>
<p align="left">4. If the conversation is accurate, the guide was wrong. He should've 
  escalated it to a full GM, and let them be the final word on it. </p>
<p align="left">5. I also liked the name "Euthanasia". I am a huge history nut, 
  with emphasis on W.W.II. and never made the connection to the Holocaust. My 
  1st thought was of a Vet. euthanizing animals, which parallels nicely with what 
  was stated by the player as to why the name was chosen in the first place.</p>
<p align="left">6. I think political correctness sucks. In this day and age it 
  seems that we all too often bow to the wishes of the few, even if the majority 
  has to pay the price. As a guide, my 1st reaction to a petition that someone 
  found the name offensive, would be to tell them to get over it. (politely of 
  course)</p>
<p align="left">7. Has anyone who has responded to the article found it offensive?</p>
<p align="left">8. I do not think the name violates any naming conventions. The 
  one that comes closest IMHO is "Common words, phrases, or sentences non-suitable 
  for the environment" But I would argue that "Euthanasia" is very suitable for 
  the environment because you are killing things.</p>
<p align="left">9. I also feel that the petitioner bears a lot of the responsibility. 
  Like arguing with a policeman, you are always going to lose. That is what court 
  or in this case GM's are for. I agree with the person who said that he should've 
  let it drop, and re-petitioned another day, and not kept badgering the guide. 
  I cannot tell you how many times that I had people keep on and on and on about 
  petitions, mostly involving plane deaths, when it was very clear that their 
  death was not caused by a bug and there was nothing we could do to intervene. 
  Had people call me names, make threats against me, send e-mails to Verant that 
  I was a jerk and had abused them, you cannot imagine what it was like. I never 
  once warned, banned, or booted anyone because of it thoughh. I felt like part 
  of the job of a guide was to be a bit of a whipping boy. - name withheld</p>

<p align="left"><b>Klaknak's comments (all wisdom ends here ... proceed at own 
  risk).</b></p>
<p align="left">1. Thanks to everyone for replying. I only published a fraction 
  of the comments but I believe all the comments above summarize, in one way or 
  another, all the emails I received.</p>
<p align="left">2. I believe GMs are in a thankless job, yes. I believe that GMs 
  are overworked, yes. Is this an argument against what allegedly happened here? 
  No. It is merely a sentiment.</p>
<p align="left">3. Just because there is a PERCEPTION of abuse does not necessarily 
  mean there is abuse. Just because a company responds to a perception, does not 
  necessarily mean the perception is real. To keep with my humorous roots, if 
  I went to NBC and told them that Clinton was, in fact, an eggplant and if several 
  media outlets picked up on this story, we could expect Clinton to come out and 
  declare that he is not an eggplant and that if anyone had any concerns about 
  it, they could write him. This does not mean Clinton, by responding and giving 
  people opportunity to write to him, is endorsing the view he is an eggplant. 
  (Ok, I know this analogy is silly, but Jesus my site has become serious of late).</p>
<p align="left">4. The &quot;common word&quot; excuse. I have two big problems 
  with this one: (1) This whole thing started over the offensiveness of the word 
  not the commonality of it. If EQ is going to start cracking down on common word 
  usage, I think they need to take a very long and serious look at the names that 
  are out there right now. Euthanasia PALES in comparison to some I have seen; 
  (2) I am not convinced Euthanasia IS a common word in the sense that Verant 
  meant it. Look at the examples they use of common words. All of these words 
  are words that are not even slightly fantasy oriented. Euthanasia, on the other 
  hand, is most definitely a word I would not be shocked to find in any fantasy 
  novel. Granted, I don't think it is the best name in the world for a character, 
  but I dont think it is a common word like &quot;Switchblade,&quot; &quot;Phaser&quot; 
  or &quot;Ikillorcs&quot; either. Even though I respect the pro-guides people 
  I have spoken with (including some guides), I think this argument is totally 
  inadequate. I guess I could believe the offensiveness angle (tho I disagree 
  with it), but the &quot;common word&quot; argument does not seem fit to me at 
  all ... ESPECIALLY because this was not the reason given by the guide for banning 
  the name. If the GMs would now claim that the &quot;commonality&quot; of the 
  word was the source of the ban (and I am not saying they are), then this would 
  almost be a complete admission that their initial banning was wrong and now 
  they are trying to spin the situation the best they can.</p>
<p align="left">5. That being said, I don't get the whole Euthanasia thing either. 
  Let's just assume (and we know, from people who were there, that this is NOT 
  true) that the initial person petitioning the guide really was offended. What 
  exactly is the basis of this offense? I think this is what our alleged harrassee 
  was trying to get out of the guide. If someone had called their character Holocaust 
  or Killalljews, I could understand. But euthanasia? To quote one of my pleasantly 
  retro colleagues, &quot;CHILD, PLEASE!!!&quot;</p>
<p align="left">6. Is this document a forgery? I am not sure about the critique 
  the fellow above wrote about the whole anonymous issue, but I will note that 
  none of the people involved (from both sides) have contradicted the basic events 
  as transcribed above. </p>
<p align="left">7. GM Powers. This was by far the most common complaint I received. 
  Here is the argument:</p>
<p align="left">Apprentices cannot ban.</p>
<p align="left">Ergo, the log is a forgery.</p>
<p align="left">I have two problems with this: (1) Wouldn't it be possible for 
  the apprentice to be in touch with a senior GM and this GM did the actual banning?</p>
<p align="left">(2) Also, and this is pure, sheer hypothetical, but just because 
  an apprentice is not SUPPOSED to have certain powers, does this automatically 
  mean he does not have them? This, to me, strikes at the core of the problem 
  here. The original harrassee has alleged that the GMs abused their power. So 
  it isn't really, according to him, what the GMs are SUPPOSED to be doing. It 
  is what they may be doing that they are not allowed to do.</p>
<p align="left">Now, I have absolutely no idea how the coding of the guide system 
  works, and again, all of this is purely hypothetical on my part, but if it was 
  possible to give apprentices a little more power, whether to relieve the burden 
  on the head GMs or to give the apprentices more power for more sinister purposes, 
  don't you think it is possible this could happen? That is the whole point here. 
  Are certain GMs abusing their power?</p>
<p align="left">I would love to hear more about how GMs are actually given their 
  power, but I will probably receive several emails saying &quot;Ok, here is how 
  it works, but don't tell anyone.&quot; Heh heh.</p>
<p align="left">8. So these are some of my sentiments and arguments. I have yet 
  to see a GM who has been a complete jerk, so I think I tend to view all evidence 
  from this light, but since I almost never talk with GMs (especially recently), 
  I am more than willing to admit that if there were bad apples out there, I probably 
  would never have met him (or her).</p>
<p align="left">Also, with all the complaints I have heard about GMs being almost 
  completely overrun by player petitions, I don't think it is such a strange notion 
  to imagine that perhaps the rules are bent a little in order to help out as 
  many people as possible. Again, I have absolutely NO evidence of this, but I 
  think this example at least points in that direction as a possibility. I would 
  be happy to hear from anyone in the know.</p>
<p align="left">And finally, for the sake of perception, I think Verant should 
  either drop the naming policy altogether or try better to reinforce it. By hovering 
  in this middle ground where people with idiot names are not touched but someone 
  who has been harrassed by another player can be booted on this pretense, Verant 
  is just begging for this kind of controversy.</p>
<p align="left">I wonder what would happen if there was a system wide campaign 
  of petitions that asked GMs to change the names of ALL players with common names? 
  What about offensive names (a far trickier thing to define)? Would they follow 
  the same rules as religiously as they did with this person?</p>
<p align="left">I think this is a question Verant needs to ask itself as it restates 
  its naming policy.</p>
<p align="left">Thanks guys!</p>
