  <p><font size="4">The Love Boat - by Silveranthelas</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">One day I decided to take the boat from Freeport so I waited 
    for it to arrive for what seemed like a long time so I went to get a fishing 
    pole and some bait to pass the time I go out the wrong door on accident. I 
    see the boat pull up so I make a jump from one dock to another land right 
    in the water started swimming over to the dock as the boat leaves. there went 
    (30 minutes) wasted.</p>
  <p align="left">I finally get up on the dock and wait and start fishing (30 
    minutes) later the boat comes I walk up to it try to get on I figured someone 
    must have been blocking the way so I walked a little to the left and what 
    I fell into the water I didnt get on the boat I see the boat leave as Im getting 
    up onto the dock (Sigh).</p>
  <p align="left">I fish again a few skill points and some fish later (30 minutes) 
    I see the boat I RUN up to it and not knowing at the time that you have to 
    jump to get on I go running and it pushes me off to the side. I get on the 
    dock the boat already gone start fishing.</p>
  <p align="left">(30 minutes later) the boat comes I figured I would be smart 
    and get a really big running start at it I start running (with SOW on) and 
    go flying off the side into the water again (SIGH) I was not happy at this 
    moment. I get back onto the dock the boat still there this time I had found 
    the perfect way onto the dock by now I run for it and right before I reached 
    it it started going I run right off the end of the dock into the water. I 
    then shouted "Why cant I get onto the boat in FP?" Jhondoe tells you: you 
    gotta jump.</p>
  <p align="left">I fished (30 muinutes later I see the boat I run jump up onto 
    now what I noticed was a ledge. I kept running and went flying off I figured 
    must have to jump twice. I didnt make it in time for a second attempt I started 
    fishing.</p>
  <p align="left">(30 minutes) later I see the boat I jump onto the ledge then 
    jump onto the boat.</p>
  <p align="left">(FEW) I figured my troubles where over. After about a (30 minute) 
    boat ride I make it there but then me sitting and meditating and sense heading 
    didnt realize this was my stop until a long time after then we zoned. (Sigh) 
    ok I figured I would stay on the boat and ride it around (60 minutes) later 
    me STANDING right by the edge waiting to get off well on my slow computer 
    we went right past the dock while I was in the zone and were already almost 
    into the next zone (Sigh).</p>
  <p align="left">I waited another (60 minutes) RIGHT BY THE EDGE WATCHING FOR 
    WHEN IT SAID You have entered the Butcher Block Mountains. Right as I saw 
    that I jumped off the boat and swam for the dock. I FINALLY shouted "I made 
    it I made it home again home again after a 6 hour boat ride hour long boat 
    ride I made it I made it". I got MANY questions that day about how did you 
    ride the boat for 6 hours? This was all TOTALLY true even if it is stupid.</p>

    from lag death before I could bind and ended up back in Erudin.&quot;]</p>
