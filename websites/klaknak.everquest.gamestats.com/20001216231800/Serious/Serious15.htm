  <p>Are Computer Games Art?</p>
  <p>Readers Respond</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">Several people sent in some excellent comments. Here they are!</p>
  <div align="left"></div>

  <p align="left">Are computers games art? Well aside from the narrative and visual 
    aspects that you have already desribed you left out another important aspect. 
    This aspect I believe is what makes any type of software an art form. To be 
    specific CODING. Coding is an art form. All at the same time you have to follow 
    rules and at the same time bend them and find creative ways to make the code 
    do what you want, not fail to perform as desired, and be able to run on a 
    vareity of platforms which is especially important for games. Coding is an 
    art and a skill and if done poorly like with any other art form can make the 
    piece a piece of s**t, or if done beautifully, make it a masterpiece. - Elwoodiath</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> I don't have a lot of time to get into a discussion, but I 
    just want to present another confusing 'is it art' distinction that has bothered 
    me for a long time. You see, I am a software designer by profession. And I 
    have long contended to friends of mine (none of which are either programmers, 
    or people that agree with me) that my finished product, the CODE itself, is 
    a work of art. Although I don't think anybody in their right mind is going 
    to hang a software version control system on the wall of their studio, there 
    is a measure of aesthetics in software.</p>
  <p align="left">It is very easy to tell an 'elegant' solution from a mess, or 
    a 'kludge'. The definition you have printed, "The conscious use of skill and 
    creative imagination.", only supports my point. The more imaginative a software 
    solution is, the more likely it is to make me a lot of money. However, I must 
    concede that this definition can be applied to make too many things art, and 
    I don't think that is what you are shooting for. For example, a 'con artist' 
    fits this defination nicely. So, I believe we must further qualify art in 
    order to make it a useful thing. If picking women up at a bar is the same 
    type of art as composing a symphony, I haven't gone where I'd like to go. 
    And although I have never been able to solidly define it, here are a few steps 
    I believe that have led me closer to a strong definition of what is and isn't 
    art:</p>
  <p align="left">Classic Art Forms - Since we have some relatively indisputable 
    forms of art, we can fairly start with an assumption that these art forms 
    share some characteristics that define art. At least, if we get to a definition 
    of art, we can assume these art forms will fit those definitions. Examples 
    of classic art forms: painting, sculpture, symphonic music, literature. Intention 
    - Does someone need to start with the intention 'I am creating art', in order 
    to do so? Or conversely, if someone does start with the intention 'I am creating 
    art now', is the final product always art? Architecture comes to mind here. 
    Some buildings (the Parthenon, some of the Newport mansions, etc.) were designed 
    to be aesthetically pleasing. Others are designed completely for utility (tenement 
    houses, strip malls). Far more common are the buildings that need to serve 
    a function, but still should look nice. Are all architects artists, is every 
    building a work of art? There are two other art forms, photography and film, 
    which are even more glaring examples of this disparity. If I pick up the camcorder, 
    am I an artist? Hardly. If Ansel Adams grabs a poloroid and takes a picture 
    of me, is that art? Can a filmmaker accidently not make art (several Van Damme 
    flicks come to mind)? If I take enough pictures of a tree with my 35mm camera, 
    do I have a chance of any of them being art? Clearly this is open to debate, 
    but I think it is safe to say that intention is not the essence of art.</p>
  <p align="left">Utility - Can art be useful? A painting certainly can't be, 
    in a conventional sense. But what about a piece of furntinture? I've seen 
    chairs in art museums. On the other hand, my office guest chair over there 
    is certainly not art in my opinion. Again, a dead end. Opinion - this is the 
    only place I see left for debate. What if we define the essence of art as 
    'something abstract, symbolic, or representative that creates an emotional 
    reaction'. Problem is, things can be art to some people and not to others. 
    Is this a problem? I think not. 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. This 
    defintions works for me, as I often feel the same way after being punched 
    in the face as I do after looking at a Klee painting. When Old Yeller dies, 
    its as if my girlfriend has left me. My adreneline starts pumping when I read 
    a Salvatore novel, or when I listen to Slayer, just like when I am standing 
    at the top of a black diamond mogul run. And yet, when I look at my office 
    chair... nothing. Based on that, computer games, being a virtual experience, 
    is just as much art as the cover of Dragon magazine, as long as you react 
    to it. And my code... well, whatever floats my boat. Bah, I rambled. Comments?

<p align="left">Art: "The conscious use of skill and creative imagination." (Note: 
  this may turn into a ramble, but I'll try to actually have a point..)</p>
<p align="left">Are computer games art? Yes and No. Are computer game players 
  artists too? Yes and No. Let me explain. As your definition (which I really 
  like BTW) says, art requires both skill and creative imagination. I think that 
  most computer games have both. Lets pick a popular game like... I don't know... 
  Everquest. Does EQ count as art? I think so. I think it is quite apparent that 
  EQ involves alot of skill. The designers made a beautiful world, that required 
  no small amount of programming skill. The GM's keep 99% of the players happy 
  which takes ALOT of people skills. Imagination? I have extreme difficulty coming 
  up with names of random mooks in the Pen and Paper RP game I run. Yet they came 
  up with names for probably 10,000 people, zones, treasure, and even monsters. 
  Also think of the quests in the game. The Freeport Militia and the Paladin's 
  Guild? The Heretics and the Other Spellcasters in Erudin? The list goes on and 
  on. And if you wanted to, you could just immerse yourself in the number of plots 
  running around Norrath.</p>
<p align="left">But do all games have both Skill and Imagination? I'm sure everyone 
  can think of a Doom/Quake clone that had no creative thought behind it. Games 
  with the artistic merit of either Televangelists or Friends. Those are not art, 
  but rather a distraction from what's really out there...</p>
<p align="left">And us players? Are we artists? Some of us, Yes. Many, No. The 
  best example of player artistry I can think of is Guilds and their various activities. 
  No, I'm not in a guild but think of what they do. Most are founded upon a principle 
  that they abide by. An excellent example of Skill and Creativity. Guild run 
  events? The same. But how can some people not be artists. Simple. By never breaking 
  tradition. It is not creative to go to Cazic Thule and camp for Rubicite. It 
  is not creative to always level your characters from 10-20 in the same place. 
  The challange is to be creative. But how? just do things you've never done before. 
  Sure, you know Blackburrow from top to bottom by heart. What about Split Paw? 
  Everfrost? Kerra Island? Erud's Crossing? The world is a lot bigger than you 
  think. Go explore it. You won't be dissapointed. whoa.... It amazing what will 
  pour forth from your brain at midnight after the servers die. Sorry, like I 
  warned you this turned into a ramble. But let me sum up.</p>
<p align="left">Are games Art? Yes, if they are well done. Are players artists? 
  Yes, we are. We're all just a tiny bunch of Piccaso's madly painting on a huge 
  piece of canvas that Verant has been so nice to provide. Just think about your 
  site Klaknak. This site was designed around humorous occurences in a fictional 
  world where tens of thousands of people come to sweat, bleed and die together(Usually 
  in that order). Believe it or not that makes you an artist I think...</p>
<p align="left">Some random comments... 1. I like your site alot. Thanks for providing 
  a medium to share all this humor about this damnably adictive game. 2. Provide 
  more political comments. I like hearing your.... odd take on political events. 
  I'd love nothing more than to debate some of these with you, but I find this 
  to be too impersonal for any real discussion. 3. Best of luck wooing your supervisor. 
  But I don't think doing their web site will win you her heart. 4. ... Well, 
  my eyes hurt now so I think I'll stop. Best of Luck to You... Das Gerg Silly 
  EQ player</p>
