  <p><font size="4">The Manor of Unrest - by Jamilyn Skyheart</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"> The Manor of Unrest It was dark, the night -- the perpetual 
    night. I approached the house known as the "Manor of Unrest." The rain and 
    wind was getting worse, and this house was the only sanctuary to be found 
    in this Gods-forsaken Hellhole known as the Cauldron. I was about to knock 
    on the front door when a bolt of lightning struck a nearby exploiter. Boy, 
    that was a close call! In the instant of that flash, I thought I saw a ghost 
    through the window in the door. The feeling in my gut told me to run away, 
    but I knocked on the door anyway. The door opened.</p>
  <p align="left">Once inside the vestibule, I was disturbed to find that no one 
    was there. I was about to turn and run, screaming "TRAIN TO ZONE!" when the 
    door slammed shut behind me. I knew that there was no turning back now, so 
    I reached into my pocket and pulled out my magic gnome cookie. While it looks 
    ordinary, it actually has the power to turn anything into a bottle of milk 
    or a muffin. I knew this would come in handy. As a big flash of lightning 
    lit up the night, the torches went out, and the house went black.</p>
  <p align="left">Alone in the dark and just a little afraid, I decided to have 
    a look in the basement. Had I ever been in the Plane of Fear, or I never would 
    have done that. The old steps creaked as I went into the basement. My glow-in-the-dark 
    rusty short sword, which I always keep with me, gave off enough light to see 
    by, so I pressed onward. Suddenly, from the farthest corner of the basement 
    I heard a sound, no -- a voice that sounded suspiciously like Ambassador Dvinn's. 
    Thinking fast, I used my magic gnome cookie and turned the nasty Dvinn into 
    a large bottle of skim milk. I was so scared that I turned and ran up the 
    stairs and toward the front door, almost soiling my poor tattered patchwork 
    leggings. I went to open the door, when I realized that I was not clicking 
    on the door, but on my spells. Instantly, I had rooted myself.</p>
  <p align="left">Desperate, I kept trying to open the door, screaming for help 
    -- but no one was in the zone. Again, my guided hand slipped, and I cast flash 
    of light on myself. All I could do was scream, as skeletons crowded around 
    me and began to bash me. Once I regained my sight, I quickly cast Divine Aura. 
    The roots had disappeared, and I ran for the corridor, until...a skeleton 
    bashed me! The invulnerability quickly faded, and I fell on the pavement, 
    bleeding to death. And then I awoke again, under the close care of the Priests 
    of the Temple of Marr. ((based on a semi-true incident that happened to me 
    around level 10)) </p>
