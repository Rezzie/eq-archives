        stop telling your friends that movies are good! I'm tired of watching 
        movies that people rave about and expecting something wonderful. I've 
        seen too many so-called wonderful moives that turn out to be nearly crap.

        take Payback. That's a good movie right? Too hyped for me, kept waiting

          Choice prepared food company: mail in 10 proofs of purchase and get 
          1000 frequent flier miles. Getting 1000 miles for ten $2 dinners wasn't 
          bad, he figured, but getting them for ten 25-cent pudding cups was better. 
          "I quickly realized that for 25 cents I was getting 100 free miles," 
          the Davis, Calif., man said, so he bought $3,140 worth of diet pudding 
          cups, earning 1.25 million miles, or about $25,000 worth of flights. 
          As if that wasn't good enough, he also donated the pudding to food banks 
          for a tax deduction. </font></i></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">I'm not here 
        to preach. I'm here to rant. Who the hell thought up tenure? What is it 
        that made someone decide that every teacher everywhere deserves to have 
        ultimate job security? I know quite a few that do not deserve it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">Not all teachers 
        of course. By chance the one good teacher I have this semester teaches 
        two of my classes. Not the best, but he usually manages to make the really 
        dull material interesting enough that class is not an entirety of boredom 
        that drags on from now to infinity. For those of you here at TCNJ, that 
        particular person would be Dr. Rawicz. He's cool, if you can get him (engineers 
        only!) do it!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">As for Underberg 
        and Reiderer though, these are the people that make me wonder about tenure. 
        These are the people that have figured out that all they have to do is 
        stand up in the front of the room and blabber for an hour and a half and 
        they get paid. One of my fellow students mentioned that we (engineers) 
        have a lot of bad professors because in the computer and engineering industry, 
        one can easily earn as much or more than a college professor. In a department 
        such as say art or english, a college professor's salary can clearly be 
        much more lucrative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF"> I disagree. 
        I had plenty of teachers in high school that were a lot better than my 
        college professors. Does this make sense to you, my readers? College professors 
        know a lot more about their subject material, since they have a Ph.D. 
        and usually industry experience. You might overlook the one key factor 
        though. Sure, maybe my teacher for &quot;Systems and Signals&quot; might 
        know a lot about that particular course, he has <b>no freaking idea</b> 
        how to communicate this information to others. <b><font size="+2">No idea!!!</font></b></font></p>

Look at their page, they have tons and tons of products.  Certain things I know for a fact they do not make, they just re-label it to be able to sell it with their brand name on it.  Creative Labs is a company that was launched into success &quot;way back in the day&quot; with their Sound Blaster line.  They were some of the first really good, widely accepted sound cards and they set a standard.  Since then, the company has ballooned to try to grab every cent it can from anyone it can.  A lot of companies do this, and I hate it.  Why can't we have companies specialize, and make <b>good products</b>?? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">Microsoft is an even stronger example of this. They balloon like nobody's business. They churn out crappy product after crappy product just so that they can get a little slice of every software market. If they don't do a good enough job, they start giving it away for free so at least their competitors don't make money.  They couldn't compete otherwise.  Think what might happen if someone made a quality product that rivaled Microsoft?!? Our whole world would turn upside down!</font></p>

I can't say this semester is <i>totally</i> horrible from what I've seen so far, but it is better than last. I've got to take a history course this semester.  I took &quot;History in American Technology&quot; and I hope that it is at least not mind-numbingly boring.  Anything but would be wonderful for a history class of course!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">Worst thing that could happen of course, is an 8 o'clock class.  And I have one. Systems and Signals was <b>only offered at 8AM</b> and that makes me upset! Worst part of anything I've found out now that not only is it <i>way too early</i> in the morning but it's <b>horribly boring</b>! Basically it's a math class, but worse, it's an <i>applied</i> math class, which means it's all word problems. The teacher is just plain bad too.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2" color="#9999FF">BEYOND DUMB: It was a routine check-in at the Meador Inn in Van Buren,
   Ark., the desk clerk said. The man registered for a motel room, even
   looking in his wallet so he could fill out all the information required
   on the card. Then he followed the clerk into the back room, robbed her,
   and fled, she said. Police asked to see the registration card. It
   showed the name Scott Brady and a local address. Police found that
   Scott Brady was a real name, and lived at that address. They arrested
   him and charged him with aggravated robbery.</font></dfn></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Yeah.  They call the newsletter &quot;This is True&quot; because  you wouldn't believe it otherwise. Actually, that's just a dumb criminal act, you can find tons over at <a href="http://www.dumbcriminalacts.com/">Dumb Criminal Acts</a>. I'm tired of living in a world full of people like this!</p>

What is it that we're supposed to be celebrating? And how come kids get to run around and gather <b>piles</b> of <b>free candy</b>? I think the kids finally got it right, for once. In almost every circumstance, kids have it real tough. Kids don't have rights.  There's always a parent or a teacher controlling what you do or say, you don't get to control your life much at all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">But Halloween is definetly a day that the kids show ultimate triumph. I know a ton of kids that would love to dress in entirely <i>strange clothing</i> every day of the year. And if you throw in free candy, they'd just be ecstatic. Hurrah for the kids! Perhaps this small triumph will eventually grow into more significant ones? As far as I know we currently have the youngest president ever in office.  Who knows, maybe a few years down the line some kid will be in court fighting the age limit rule so he (or she, yeah right) could become president. Hey, it could happen.</font></p>

Get this, I'm told to help this guy move a bunch of 21&quot; monitors from one storage room to another.

Next to the pile of boxed 21&quot; monitors is a pile of old, unboxed monitors.  Suffice it to say that the unboxed pile was <i>not very stable</i> without the pile of boxes to lean against. The unboxed, old monitors pile decides to fall when one of the boxes is taken away. Frustrated that he now has to rearrange the old monitors pile, the guy picks up an old 15&quot; monitor and <b>throws it across the room</b>! Where does it land? On the pile of HP LaserJet printers of course, stacked <i>atop</i> each other in a precarious tower. Clearly, the printers quickly gave way to gravity and leapt towards the floor, letting plastic bits fly forth from both the printers and the monitors. It's <b>crazy</b>! I hate corporate America, they waste all our money!</font></p>

This guy knows what he's talking about! I have always <font color="#999999">loved</font> <a href="http://www.darwinawards.com">The Darwin Awards</a>, and some of my previous posts have talked about how I think <a href="http://www.vhemt.org">quite a few people need to die</a>. Of course the Darwin Awards highlight those people who manage to cleanse our gene pool by killing themselves in extremely dull-witted ways, thereby removing some of the stupider inhabitants of our planet and doing the entire human race a favor.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">One of those people that deserve to die is in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20000105/aponline070756_000.htm">this article</a>. Let me tell you, one of the things I <b>really hate</b> is   sue-happy people. Too much of America is  <font color="#CC00FF">very</font> sue happy, and it ruins things for a lot of us. You realize that it's not those companies that pay for these law suits, but all they do is charge more and <i>the consumers</i>, or <i>us</i> are who really pays for these idiots. I still think <b>nothing compares</b> to the lady that got an actual settlement and <i>got money for <font color="#0099FF">putting McDonald's coffee in her <b>crotch</b></font></i>!! People that get money for being stupid really <b>piss me off</b>!</font></p>

For those of you who don't know, I've got some strange sleep problem.   Not officially, because I've never been to a doctor, but I've surely got something.  You see, I am half-<a href="http://members.aol.com/MLCVamp/vampcrpt.htm">vampire</a>.  I sleep during the day, and I'm awake at night. Or really, I wish I was. <a href="http://www.jnj.com/">Work</a>, <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu">school</a>, dentist appointment, <b>something </b>always makes me wake up. I hate that because I'm  <i>really really</i> bad at waking up. Can't do it.  Just can't do it! Last semester at school it wasn't that bad. Earliest class was 12:30 and I could deal with that.  But no, next semester I have a class at <b>eight o'clock in the morning</b>!
