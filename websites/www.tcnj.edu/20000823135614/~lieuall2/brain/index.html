      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99FFFF">Linux. Unix. 
        These two operating systems share very much. All of these things they 
        share give them the same great advantages. I personally use (only of recent, 
        sadly) a version of Unix called <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>. 
        If you have the very slightest desire to try a Unix or Linux system, get 
        FreeBSD. It is wonderful, in my opinion.</font></p>
      <p>Anyway, I'm using this computer as a file and web server. And let me 
        tell you, it is FAST. It's running on a mere Pentium 200MHz, and it is 
        very speedy. It is running: <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.org">mySQL</a>, 
        and <a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba</a>. And that's not the best 
        part! Unbelievably, the OS and all of those software packages are completely 
        100% totally free. And, arguably, the best possible programs existing 
        in their class. Apache is commonly known to be the #1 web server, bar 
        none. It is open source, just like all of the others I've listed. PHP 
        is a competitor to <a href="http://www.allaire.com">Cold Fusion</a> and 
        suffers only slightly more complicated scripting, but on the newest version, 
        boasts similar or <i>faster</i> execution! It's an amazingly comprehensive 
        programming language that can do just about anything you would want your 
        website to do.</p>
      <p>The database mySQL is my choice to hold the dynamic data that PHP feeds 
        into my web pages. The benchmarks available on their website shows that 
        it kicks Oracle's ass when it comes to speed. It also explains how this 
        system has been in use since 1996, holding tables with millions of rows 
        representing over 100 gigabytes of data, without the slightest flaw. Finally, 
        Samba is an amazing program that allows you to set up a Un*x box to share 
        files through Micro$oft's standard &quot;Network Neighborhood.&quot; Not 
        only this, the throughput, depending on platform, can easily be double 
        that of a Windows NT server.</p>
      <p>I've thrown a lot of amazing claims at you. I have had, honestly, a ton 
        of fun setting up a new computeR for myself that was completely free (the 
        software I mean), and also better in nearly every aspect than some of 
        the most expensive alternatives! How could this possibly be? Open source! 
        Now I get to the real point to this post. Open source is good, open source 
        is great. I love everything that the open source movement represents. 
        What powers the open source movement? It is filled with completely free 
        products, and there is no money to be made! Largely, geeks fuel the open 
        source movement. The database program mySQL is actually produced by a 
        company, and another (freeware, not open source but still about the best 
        solution there is) program called <a href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/">VNC</a> 
        is completely free, and produced by a real company.</p>
      <p>As I said, the open source movement is largely fueled by geeks. I love 
        these geeks. These people are the special type that actually are able 
        to program solutions to today's computer problems, and do it for just 
        a few simple reasons. Largely, these people <i>want</i> a better solution. 
        Most of them also feel that people deserve a better solution. Just like 
        these rare companies, they seem to realize that monetary gains are not 
        all that are important in this world.</p>
      <p>I wish more companies would realize this. If each large corporation in 
        the world produced just <b>one</b> of the software solutions that it needed, 
        plus made the source code freely available and modifiable, then using 
        a computer today would be much much better. Plus, I theorize, these companys 
        would actually run <b>better</b> rather than losing money due to extra 
        costs of hiring programmers. How you ask? Well, as I said before, each 
        large corporation would need to produce a product (something important 
        to it, and not already easily available) and then quickly the common software 
        purchase would instantly disappear, become free. Imagine how much money 
        this would save companies! Take $100 for Winblows, $150 (a conservative 
        estimate) for Office, and various other programs that each and every employee 
        needs. Instantly, imagine $300 savings, times every employee, every four 
        years or so! That's a lot of moola! On top of that, each and every program 
        you use is now designed almost specifically for what you need it to do. 
        Productivity obviously recieves a good boost!</p>
      <p>Which leaves me with only one thing to say... <b>Make it free!!!</b></p>
