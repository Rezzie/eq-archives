        <tr>
          <td width="100%"><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">After breakfast
            in Dagnor’s Cauldron, I listlessly strolled into the Estate of
            Unrest. Surveying the courtyard, I realized that I was practically
            alone. With that realization in mind, I decided to take my leave of
            Unrest, and headed back out to Dagnor’s Cauldron. The run was
            swift though, since I still had the Spirit of the Wolf. Once I
            reached the Butcherblock Mountains, I purchased more food supplies
            and sold what little loot I had acquired from the night before.
            Minuets later, I arrived at the docks, where I found a wood elf
            rogue waiting and a dwarf fisherman. Upon closer inspection, I
            recognized the wood elf to be Dulark <font color="#808000">(Level
            19, Wood Elf, Rogue, &lt;Borrowers of Norrath&gt;)</font>. Many
            moons ago, when I was hunting bandits in West Karanas, Dulark would
            occasionally be in the same party as myself. He did not seem to
            recognize me though; this was fine by me, since I was in no mood for
            conversation. To pass the time, I put away my sword and shield, and
            took out my fishing pole. I was barely able to cast the rod five
            times, before I spied the ship in the distance. The ship docked and
            the two of us boarded. I noticed on the bow, the inscription &quot;SirensBane&quot;.
            The ship had only one passenger; a half elf ranger named Naoto <font color="#808000">(Level
            20, Half Elf, Ranger)</font>. He did not seem to care that the ship
            had docked and remained aboard when we set sail.</font>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Once the coast faded from
            view, the whether changed drastically. Blue skies and white clouds
            gave way to dark skies and gray clouds. Then the rain began to fall
            with lightning following. The seas began to undulate in a sickening
            motion. I began to feel queasy, so I sat down and stared only at the
            deck. Hours later, the storm passed. I looked up and saw several
            large, scraggly rocks to my right. The nearest one appeared to have
            two sea creatures basking in the moonlight. I was not sure, but I
            took them to be sirens. Further to the right, I thought I saw an
            aqua goblin. As we harmlessly passed the rocks, I looked back and
            was surprised to see a silhouette standing on a rock far to the left
            of the larger ones. I squinted my eyes, but was unable to resolve
            the image in the darkness.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">About an hour later, the ship
            docked at an island with an Inn not far from the dock. Due to the
            lateness of our voyage, Zachariah Reigh was not there to greet us. I
            imagined that even if he was, he would have frowned, since there
            were only three passengers. With a gust of wind in the sails we left
            island and continued toward our destination. With that, I went below
            deck and tried to catch up on some much-needed sleep.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">When I awoke, the ship was
            already docked in East Freeport. I gathered my belongings and made
            my way to the West section. At the West gate, I found a wizard,
            Xcalaber <font color="#808000">(Level 15, Human, Wizard, &lt;The
            Circle of Eternity&gt;)</font>, to bind my soul. I paid him the
            usually courtesy, 2pp. It was still dark, and being fully rested, I
            was in need of something to do.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">So, I veered left from the
            gate and headed towards the West Commonlands. My journey was
            uneventful; I continued along the edge of a mountainside into the
            East Commonlands. While clearing the top of a tall sand dune, I came
            to a spot where eerie stone pillars jutted from the sand at the base
            of the dune. A strange red glyph adorned the center pillar. Having
            been here before, I knew that undead conjugated at these ruins. I
            surveyed the ruins quickly and noticed nothing stirred. Satisfied
            that they were unoccupied, I continued along my way. After some time
            of traversing the sand dunes, I finally came upon my destination. An
            opening in the side of a sand covered mountain. This would be only
            my second visit to Befallen.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">I walked through the entrance
            and into a medium sized hall. To the left, a caved in hallway. Rusty
            spikes lined both sides of the hall, with rotting heads impaled on
            them. Straight again and down a small flight of stairs, four other
            hallways, two on each side, adjoined the hall and each doored. In
            the center, a large rock blocked the view of the rear, where part of
            the wall had eroded away to reveal several skulls embedded in the
            rock. These skulls glowed in an eerie incandescent green light. As I
            stood there, absorbing my surroundings, a dwarf in bronze armor came
            running by with a ghoul in hot pursuit. I asked the dwarf Laudrac <font color="#808000">(Level
            16, Dwarf, Warrior, &lt;Clan of Light&gt;)</font> if he was in need
            of assistance. He grunted in the affirmative. With that, I began to
            cast Ward Undead upon the ghoul. I cast the spell three times and
            the decadent creature dropped dead. I used my remaining mana to heal
            the dwarf. I asked him if he would like to join forces, he said he
            only worked alone and scuttled off. I watched him open the second
            door on the left with a strange key. While the door was still ajar,
            I slipped in.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">I cautiously explored the
            adjoined rooms. So far, they were only cluttered with rocks, bones
            and giant rats. Down at the end of the hall, the floor gave way to
            the level below. I peered over and noticed rusty spikes protruding
            from the floor, and broken stone stairs to the left.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Just then three combatants
            ran into the room below from a hall hidden from my view. It appeared
            to be a troll fighting an acolyte and his pet skeleton. The dwarf I
            had healed earlier came running up from behind me to see what all of
            the ruckus was about. The troll seemed to be losing, the dwarf
            Laudrac asked if we should help. Without waiting for an answer, he
            entered the room to my left. I followed, and noticed that the wall
            to the right of the door had crumbled and the stone stairs could be
            seen beyond them. The dwarf was already descending the stairs and
            nearing the battle. I too followed. The dwarf and the troll were
            engaging the acolyte, so I began to attack his skeletal pet. With
            the help of a few Ward Undead spells, I was able to finish off the
            pet. By then, the dwarf and the troll had finished the acolyte too.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Not knowing my way around, I
            ascended the stairs and returned to the level above. The dwarf
            followed and asked for another heal. I used my remaining mana to
            heal him and began to meditate. While meditating, I was attacked by
            a Dark Elf Skeleton. The foe was more than a match for me, in my
            weakened condition. I had to use Lay of Hands on myself and the
            skeleton still proceeded to gravely injure me, so I called for help.
            The dwarf, Laudrac was not far away, and quickly came to my aid.
            Once the skeleton was killed, I asked Laudrac to unlock the door for
            me, so that I might find a safe place to rest and meditate. He
            cordially obliged, and I made my way back to the main hall near the
            entrance.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">While meditating, a cleric
            named Thuunder <font color="#808000">(Level 17, Human, Cleric,
            &lt;Dark Circle&gt;)</font> happened by, in search of a companion. I
            told him that I was very much in need of a companion as well, so we
            joined forces. Luckily, Thuundar had been to Befallen many times
            before and was very familiar with its layout. In addition, he had
            two keys for two of the doors. The first order of business, he said,
            was to get me a set of keys as well. So, I followed him as he lead
            the way to a room where he said an ogre shadow knight stayed with
            the keys. Along the way we had to fight many greater skeletons,
            lurking mummies, ghouls and other undead.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Finally, we came upon the
            shadow knight and a furious battle ensued. Thuunder took on the
            surrounding skeletons while I engaged the shadow knight. The
            cowardly shadow knight began to flee when I was about to smite him.
            So I chased off after him down unfamiliar corridors and rooms.
            Finally, I delivered one last fatal blow and downed him. I was happy
            to find two keys, a large rawhide mask and barbed armplates on him.
            Thuunder informed me of the magical properties of the barbed
            armplates, so I replaced my banded armplates with them.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">With the newly acquired key
            we gained entrance to a new section of Befallen. There, a dark elf
            skeleton greeted us. After we dispatched of him, a lurking mummy
            attacked us forthright. After the mummy, we were badly injured and
            in need of meditation. While meditating another dark elf skeleton
            attacked us. The skeleton focused his attention to me and I began to
            weaken. Thuunder tried his best to save me, but alas the skeleton
            was too much in my weakened condition and I feel unconscious.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">I awoke, unarmored and
            equipmentless in West Freeport where the wizard had bound me the day
            before. I sat and began to re-memorize some necessary spells. Once
            finished, I summoned a Hammer of Wrath for protection, and cast
            Courage and Holy Armor upon myself. From there, I began to make my
            way back towards Befallen.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Upon re-entering Befallen, my
            companion Thuunder greeted me. Since my equipment and gear was
            locked behind a door on the third level, we would have to find
            someone with a key or find another shadow knight. We made our way
            back to the locked door to see if any other adventures would be
            there with a key. We found no such luck, so we headed back to find
            another shadow knight. While fighting skeletons near the shadow
            knight room, we ran into a fellow guild member of mine, a bard name
            Khoals <font color="#808000">(Level 18, Wood Elf, Bard, &lt;<a href="http://people.ne.mediaone.net/jfadams/home.html">Shepherds
            of the Wolf</a>&gt;)</font>. He eagerly joined us as we waited for a
            shadow knight. The time passed as we waited and waited. The room had
            two large rocks in the center, which meet the ceiling. Khoals, being
            bored, sat atop one of them. Thuunder mentioned that he knew a monk
            name Svancara who had the third key and would leave to find him. We
            agreed and stay behind as he left. Hours later, I lost track of
            Khoals, but meet up with the monk. We made our way back to the
            locked door and were attacked in front of it. He opened the door for
            me and also engaged the skeleton. I entered and found another dark
            elf skeleton waiting for me. He grinned maniacally as the door swung
            shut, and locked, behind me. Being armorless, the skeleton began to
            rip me to shreds. I tried futilely to fend him off with my Hammer of
            Wrath. Knowing full well that I would die again, I began to yell for
            help. Svancara unlocked and open the door, then I ran in. The
            skeleton became disinterested in me and attacked another adventurer
            who was standing near the door. After the skeleton was killed, I
            retrieved my equipment and went up the stairs to heal and meditate.
            While meditating I was attacked by a ghoul, luckily, Thuunder had
            just returned and helped dispatch it. Once we were fully healed we
            headed back to the shadow knight room where we found Khoals firmly
            wedged between the two rocks. He was yelling that he could not move
            and was stuck. Apparently, he had fallen asleep on top of one of the
            rocks and slide down in-between them while turning over. Try as we
            did, we could not free him. Finally, in desperation, Khoals
            suggested that we find our guild leader Graywolf, and have him
            teleport us out of Befallen. Thuunder being the only one in our
            group with the keys to the first two doors went back to the entrance
            to meet with Graywolf. About an hour later, Graywolf and Thuunder
            returned just as three skeletons were trying to attack Khoals. I
            killed one, and the others finished the remaining. After the brief,
            but chaotic skirmish, Graywolf gathered us all around the rocks and
            cast his group teleport spell. Moments later, we found ourselves at
            the druid ruins in the East Commonlands. There were also many other
            people near the ruins, mainly dealing with the vendors there.
            Graywolf, being a very busy person these days, had to leave to tend
            to matters elsewhere. Thuunder, decided to return to Befallen, so we
            bid our farewells. Khoals had business in Halas, and I wanted to
            venture to Permafrost, so we journeyed together. Khoals played a
            lively tune which accelerated our travel and with that we were off.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">We made haste to Kithicor
            Forest, then through Highpass Hold, East Karanas, North Karanas,
            West Karanas, Qeynos Hills, Blackburrow, Everfrost Peaks and finally
            to Halas. All the while chatting about various sundry things. In
            East Karanas, a hound of some kind attacked me, then while running
            though West Karanas, a bandit made the misfortune of attacking us.
            Other than that, the journey was skirmishless. Once we reached Halas,
            I paid a female barbarian shaman 2pp to bind our souls there. Khoals
            worked on making and selling pottery while I made time for lunch.</font></p>

            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Half an hour later, Khoals
            and I meet at the entrance of Halas and headed for Permafrost. We
            wandered the tundractic plains of Everfrost for hours in the quite
            darkness. Twice lone orc mountaineers ambushed us. While en route,
            we aided a barbarian being attacked by a polar bear by a tower.
            Afterwards, I fully healed him.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">From there, we finally found
            the entrance to Permafrost, an hour later. The entrance resembled a
            giant keep with a large, unobstructed opening with torches on either
            side. Once long ago, I had been here before, so I know full well
            about the ice giants that guarded the entrance. Khoals sneaked up
            through the opening, slightly entering the courtyard, and peeked to
            the left and right. Two massive ice giants stood on both sides,
            waiting to stomp any passerby’s. Finally we decided to make a mad
            dash for it, using one of Khoals’s bard songs. With the song
            playing I lead the way, bolting through the courtyard with Khoals
            following close behind. As we cleared the courtyard, a hallway
            emerged to our left and a cubbyhole to our right with an ice giant
            waiting. We kept running and the ice giant was only able to smack
            Khoals once before we entered Permafrost.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Inside, I noticed that the
            walls were made of greenish-blue ice and they seemed tall enough for
            a giant to comfortably walk about. The hallway where we stood, ended
            before for us and turned right. We almost didn’t notice the ice
            goblin standing there; he seemed to almost blend into his
            surroundings. He attacked us and later fled when it was apparent
            that we were too great a foe for him. So we cautiously continue down
            the gargantuan hall to our right. Two more ice goblins blocked our
            path. I mumbled my concerns as we were forced into combat again. The
            goblin furthest away was my target. I sprinted up to meet him and
            noticed that the great hall made a turn to the left. I peer to the
            left, half concentrating on my foe, and saw that the hall opened
            into a room of sorts with a ladder going up and five more ice
            goblins. All five ice goblins turned at once and with a screech, and
            tore off in my direction. I started to back away as I saw an ice
            goblin diviner start casting nasty spells. The odds were not in our
            favor, I thought as I was running back towards my comrade.
            &quot;Run!&quot;, I shouted. Just as I was about to exit Permafrost
            I was stunned by the onslaught of ice goblins surrounding me.
            Luckily, I was able to leave with half of my health. Khoals had also
            lost half of his health as the target of the ice goblin diviner’s
            spells.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Once outside, we knew we’d
            have to deal with the ice giants again. With a quick prayer to
            Karana and Khoals’s bard song playing we began our mad dash once
            again, this time with Khoals in the lead. Just as we cleared the
            courtyard and gate, I felt the cold presence of an ice giant behind
            me. I shouted to Khoals, &quot;Run!&quot;. Just as I began see the
            outlines of a nearby stone temple, I no longer heard the bard’s
            song and began to decelerate. With that, I felt a crushing blow come
            from behind and fell lifelessly to the cold snow.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">I awoke to the sounds of a
            flickering campfire; I was in Halas. Once again, I began to
            re-memorize my needed spells. Summoning the hammer and holy armor,
            once finished.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">Hours later, Khoals returned
            to Halas. Then with the help of another bard song, we went in search
            of my equipment. Once I was re-equipped we decided to save
            Peramfrost for another day when we’re more powerful.</font></p>
            <p><font SIZE="2" face="Lucida Casual">From there we hunted many
            wooly mammoth calves. Finally after we had slain our sixth calf or
            so, we were having a hard time finding more in the darkness. So, I
            decided to camp and Khoals said he would return to Halas.</font></p>

          <td width="100%"><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">I joined a small

            Bodhi <font color="#808000">(Level 15 Wood Elf Ranger)</font>.&nbsp;
            Having fought along side Mintin the eve before, I asked if he had
            the 10pp he owed me for the small bronze collar I gave him.&nbsp; He
            assured me he hadn't forgotten and would pay me later.&nbsp; Soon
            thereafter, we began to engage the many vile undead creatures
            lurking around the unholy grounds.&nbsp; We battled many a ghoul and
            skeleton.</font>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">While in the courtyard, an
            injured Paladin, named Hihi <font color="#808000">(Level 25, Half
            Elf, Paladin, &lt;The Praetorian Guard&gt;)</font>, ran by with many
            fowl undead creatures in pursuit.&nbsp; As she feel from exhaustion
            and near death, I healed her completely with Lay of Hands.&nbsp; She
            fled to safety and thanked me later.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, a
            wizard named Winthrope <font color="#808000">(Level 19, Erudite,
            Wizard, &lt;Lords of Chaos&gt;)</font> joined us.&nbsp; Many battles
            later, Lucian had to leave and a bard, named Naladen <font color="#808000">(Level
            15, Wood Elf, Bard)</font> joined as well.&nbsp; A few battles
            later, Bohdi and Naladen made a trip to Greater Faydark to sell
            their loot and buy supplies.&nbsp; Sometime in between, a dwarven
            rogue, named Vergadian <font color="#808000">(Level 15, Dwarf,
            Rogue)</font> joined us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">Upon my urgings, we entered
            the derelict mansion in search of more undead to release.&nbsp; Many
            other adventurers were also inside the mansion.&nbsp; Finally, we
            found an unoccupied room, with rusty spikes in the floor and ghastly
            hooks hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; I shuddered at the sight of
            the hooks; contemplating their purpose.&nbsp; While in the room we
            fought many ghouls, dark boned skeletons and even a lurking mummy.&nbsp;
            Just as I was beginning to feel comfortable in the room, I heard the
            telltale screech of a werebat.&nbsp; Moments later, the dreadful
            beast came jumping down the nearby stair and headed straight for me.&nbsp;
            Before I could react, the werebat slashed out at me with many evil
            skeletons in toe.&nbsp; I yelled for my companions to flee as I
            headed out myself.&nbsp; Luckily, all of our party members made it
            to safety.&nbsp; Sometime later, the Wizard Winthrope was smited by
            a mob of undead.&nbsp; Upon his attempt to retrieve his gear,
            another mob of undead, fell him again.&nbsp; With that, he took his
            leave and promised to return another day.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">Soon after Bohdi had
            returned, I had to go to Kaladim to sell loot and buy supplies.&nbsp;
            Mintin asked to return with food and drink for him.&nbsp; With great
            speed, I ran through the bleak and dreary Dagnor's Cauldron and
            returned to conifer surroundings of Butcherblock Mountains.&nbsp; I
            found my favorite High Elf vendor in a small house near the entrance
            of Kaladim and sold my loot and restocked my ration and milk supply.&nbsp;
            With post haste, I began my way back towards Unrest.&nbsp; Finally,
            upon returning to Unrest, I found my remaining companions, Mintin
            and Vergadian near death with two ghouls hot on their tails.&nbsp;
            Mintin being the most seriously injured and closest to death,
            received my attention first.&nbsp; A day had past since I last used
            Lay of Hands, so I fully healed Mintin and went off to find
            Vergadian again.&nbsp; After a few Light Heal spells were cast on
            Vergadian, I felt my mana was completely drained and went back over
            to Mintin to dispatch his adversary.&nbsp; Mintin was once again
            badly injured, however, his ghoul was easily disposed of.&nbsp; Upon
            running back to Vergadian, I noticed he was on the verge of death.&nbsp;
            Luckily, I was able to smite his ghoul before he met his maker.&nbsp;
            Later, he recuperated in the relative safety of Dagnor's Cauldron
            where I gave Mintin twenty units of rations and twenty units of
            milk, free.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">While meditating, I noticed
            that Winthrope had returned, so we eagerly accepted him back into
            our party.&nbsp; This reunion was short-lived, though.&nbsp; After
            running from many overwhelming groups of undead, Winthrope had to
            leave.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, I informed my remaining comrades,
            Mintin and Vergadian, that I too had to leave, to find breakfast and
            rest.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">Later in the day, I returned
            to Unrest in search of brave new souls to adventure with.&nbsp; At
            first there were none, so I braved the grounds alone, challenging a
            few select tormented undead and animated jack o'lanterns, with the
            occasional death beetle in tow.&nbsp; While meditating after a sweat
            less skirmish, a druid new to Unrest, named Everett <font color="#808000">(Level
            16, Half Elf, Druid, &lt;Lost Order of Akalabeth&gt;)</font>
            happened upon me.&nbsp; So we joined forces.&nbsp; As we waited for
            undead to release, I schooled Everett in the peculiarities of
            Unrest.&nbsp; We found few undead to fight, so we entered the
            mansion though the rearmost door and occupied the room therein.&nbsp;
            Although, we did not stay long for the surrounding chaos was too
            great for a small party of only two.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">Returning to the empty
            grounds of the courtyard, we ran into a halfling warrior name Nean <font color="#808000">(Level
            15, Halfling, Warrior)</font> who eagerly joined our ranks.&nbsp;
            The courtyard grounds seemed unnaturally sparse.&nbsp; Just then I
            remembered that sometimes, the mindless tormented dead fall into the
            small mote around the hill with a waterfall.&nbsp; So I dove into
            the chilly water and found a prospect about 20 feet underwater.&nbsp;
            Once he was lured to the surface, my group easily dispatched of him.&nbsp;
            Soon afterward, Everett wandered off, never to be seen again.&nbsp;
            While Nean was engaging death beetles, I enlisted the services of
            another adventurer to replace Everett.&nbsp; Avital <font color="#808000">(Level
            16, Wood Elf, Druid)</font>, a wood elf druid joined us.&nbsp;
            Shortly thereafter, a wood elf bard, Penaden <font color="#808000">(Level
            17, Wood Elf, Bard)</font>, also joined us.&nbsp; We fought many
            tormented dead and jack o'lanturns.&nbsp; Whilst engaged in combat,
            an angry group of deadly undead forced us to retreat to the confides
            of Dagnor's Cauldron.&nbsp; While healing and meditating,&nbsp; we
            were separated from Penaden.&nbsp; With everyone fully healed and
            meditated, we re-entered the Estate of Unrest; returning to our
            duties of bashing the undead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">During one of our rest and
            meditation sessions, an old comrade, Bodhi <font color="#808000">(Level
            15 Wood Elf Ranger),</font> happened by and joined.&nbsp; Bodhi,
            being unexplainably fearless, ventured into the mansion alone to
            find more prey for us to battle.&nbsp; Some time later, a friend of
            Avital, Dias <font color="#808000">(Level 15, Halfling, Cleric)</font>
            joined us just is time as we were being badly injured by a group of
            death beetles, a greater skeleton and a jack o'lantern.&nbsp; Around
            ten battles later I felt myself become more seasoned and powerful.&nbsp;
            I took this cue to take leave of my group to find some lunch and
            relaxation.&nbsp; At the same time, another Paladin, Tanaman <font color="#808000">(Level
            16, Half Elf, Paladin, &lt;Aradani&gt;)</font> expressed an interest
            in joining our mighty group.&nbsp; I told my group to take him as my
            replacement and was off.</font></p>

            still there.&nbsp; They eagerly accepted me back into their ranks.&nbsp;
            With that, we entered the mansion with high expectations.&nbsp;
            Bodhi wanted to return to the room adorned with spikes and hooks,
            however, it was already occupied.&nbsp; So we made our way to the
            rearmost room.</font>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">After about five battles or
            so, Tanaman asked that we invite a former companion of his named
            Jarred <font color="#808000">(Level 16, Dark Elf, Shadow Knight)</font>.&nbsp;
            I felt somewhat hesitant about allowing the dark elf shadow knight
            into our ranks, however, the rest of the members felt he could be a
            useful addition.&nbsp; Reluctantly, I succumbed to their wishes;
            though I would keep a sharp eye on him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">Into our first battle with
            Jarred, against a ghoul, I noticed him cast a spell on the near dead
            ghoul, which at first glance appeared to me to be Spook the Dead.&nbsp;
            Once the ghoul was dead, I chastised the dark elf, telling him not
            to cast Fear on the undead.&nbsp; It is a dangerous thing to do
            here, which could lead to our deaths.&nbsp; And I for one, would not
            go chasing any undead with Fear cast on them in here.&nbsp; He
            assured me that the spell he cast was not Spook the Dead, but
            another one that causes the victim to freeze in fear, not run in
            fear.&nbsp; I accepted his explanation and readied myself for the
            next battle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Lucida Casual" size="2">There we stayed and battled
            many ghouls, lurking mummies and the occasional dark boned skeletons
            and even a few dry boned skeletons.&nbsp; Several hours and battles
            later, my group was wandering off and I noticed a brave bard,
            slightly struggling with a nasty ghoul.&nbsp; I quickly cast the
            spells of Courage and Holy Armor upon him and healed him with my
            remaining mana.&nbsp; Once I was through casting, I noticed the bard
            appeared familiar.&nbsp; Lo and behold, it was Penaden, my lost
            comrade of earlier.&nbsp; Once he dispatched of the ghoul he was
            eager to rejoin me, however, my current party was already full.&nbsp;
            Since I was getting tired I advised my group to take Penaden as my
