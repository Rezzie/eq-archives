            *Fear Plane Update*<br>
            <br>
            Due to an influx of shallow souls into the Plane of Fear, Cazic
            Thule has banished all mortals below level 46, from this point
            forward, from entering. In addition, Cazic has further refined the
            combat abilities of his minions within the Plane. These changes will
            begin to take effect after the update is complete.<br>
            <br>
            *Guild News*<br>
            <br>
            We are aware of the guild problems (unknown guild tags over
            characters) which are occurring on a few of the servers. Our
            programming team is in the process of fixing this problem, and it
            should be moving over to the live servers early next week, pending
            thorough testing.<br>
            <br>
            To accommodate the increase in new guild requests, beginning
            tonight, guilding will be occurring every night at 6pm, Pacific.<br>
            <br>
            *Update News*<br>
            <br>
            The update that will be performed on the servers tomorrow morning
            will include a few additional enhancements, of which are listed
            below.<br>
            <br>
            - A zone crash problem.<br>
            - An enhancement to the Fear Plane which includes, a base limit of
            level 46 for entry into the Fear Plane, and NPC encounter
            adjustments.<br>
            - Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable<br>
            - The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly
            reduced<br>
            - Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into
            higher level spells.<br>
            - Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a
            level 49 spell)<br>
            - Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis.<br>
            - Shadow Vortex (Necro) should be more effective.<br>

            on-line. We are going to gauge the player load tonight, and if need
            be, bring up a third server, possibly as early as tomorrow
            afternoon.<br>
            <br>
            As we mentioned in last week's patch message, the Vallon and Tallon
            Zek (PvP-teams) servers are in a *beta* stage of game development.
            By this, we mean, due to game-related properties, unique only to the
            PvP-Teams servers, we reserve the right to make any changes to game
            play, sweeping if need be.<br>
            <br>
            The teams are as follows:<br>
            <br>
            Team 1 Team 2 Team 3 Team 4<br>
            High Elf Dwarf Human Ogre<br>
            Wood Elf Gnome Barbarian Troll<br>
            Half-Elf Halfling Erudite Dark Elf<br>
            <br>
            This means that any member of one team may be PK'd by a member of
            any of the other 3 teams, but not my a member of their own team.
            Looting on the PvP-Teams is exactly the same as looting on the
            regular PvP (Rallos Zek) server.<br>
            <br>
            We have increased the level limits for PvP to +/-8 levels as opposed
            to the +/-4 that exists in Rallos Zek (normal PvP server).&nbsp;<br>

            Update - Please Read *<br>
            <br>
            Well, folks, we totally underestimated the number of people wanting
            to check out the PvP-Teams server and the demand is far too great
            for one server. Unfortunately, we were forced to bring Tallon Zek
            down soon after its launch because we had more than 5,000 people
            online at once. While the servers were still running, there was lag
            and the areas were simply too crowded - you players deserve a better
            environment than that. As a result, Tallon Zek will remain down
            until we can get an additional server (which will take at MINIMUM
            one week). I apologize for the inconvenience, and I'm sure many of
            you are frustrated by this. In the end, though, it's better to wait
            for more resources than to leave Tallon Zek up.<br>

            servers will be coming down at 7:00 AM Pacific, tomorrow morning for
            an update. The estimated downtime is approximately 2 hours. This
            update will require a minor client-side download. The following
            enhancements and new features will be activated once the update is
            complete.<br>
            <br>
            *General Announcements*<br>
            <br>
            We are currently in the process of finishing up final internal
            testing for Tallon Zek, the new PvP-Teams server. We expect that it
            should be coming on-line this week. Once the date nears, a better
            estimate on the time of launch and further information regarding the
            Tallon Zek server will be made available.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The Fear Plane is now on-line. However, before adventuring to the
            Fear Plane, we advise you to heed the following advice:<br>
            <br>
            Traveling the planes is not like visiting a dungeon. People die in
            dungeons.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            People die hard on the planes.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Dying on a plane means that you might die in a place where your body
            may be extremely hard to recover, or in an area that you have no
            idea how to get back to. Big, nasty monsters will jump you at
            inopportune times, spells may work differently and once valid
            tactics might go right out the window.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The planes are dangerous places to adventure, and massive player
            slaughter will happen on a regular basis.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            We are not saying this to goad you in to going - this is an honest
            disclaimer. So don't say we didn't warn you.<br>
            <br>
            *Trade Skill Enhancements*<br>
            <br>
            - Baking Chocolate and Fish Head Soup now work as designed.<br>
            <br>
            - Pottery has been enhanced by new items that can be made through
            the trade skill that will help the player-driven economy.
            Additionally, some of the profits of other pottery made items have
            been adjusted to facilitate this change.<br>
            <br>
            - Make and apply poison is now working in the game. To apply poison
            a Rogue must sit and click a piercing weapon on a poison to apply
            it. When the Rogue attacks there is a chance the creature will
            become poisoned. The poison will need to be reapplied if the player
            changes zones.<br>
            <br>
            *New Features*<br>
            <br>
            - The ability to report player whom are harassing has been
            implemented. This is done by typing &quot;/report&quot; - the
            previous 10 lines of text will be saved to the server for Customer
            Support representatives to review. This command may only be
            performed once while on-line, you must then log out and back in to
            use it again.<br>
            <br>
            - The &quot;r&quot; key will now initiate a reply to the last player
            whom sent the user a tell.<br>
            <br>
            - The /surname command has been added, which allows a player of 20th
            level or greater to issue his or her character a last name.<br>
            <br>
            - When a player consumes alcohol, a message will be given to players
            within the area.<br>
            <br>
            *Game Play Enhancements*<br>
            <br>
            - If a character is knocked unconscious, and has no stamina, the
            player will still regain consciousness.<br>
            <br>
            - Players are no longer able to cast Shadowstep next to a zone point
            and teleport to an area past the teleport region, which is
            inaccessible to other characters.<br>
            <br>
            - If a player is too far from a corpse while attempting to perform
            the /loot command, a message will now be given.<br>
            <br>
            - If the user was under the effect of either Treeform or Minor
            Illusion, then had Spirit of Wolf cast on them,&nbsp;<br>
            the player would be able to move in their altered state - This is no
            longer possible.<br>
            <br>
            - If the Eye of Zomm makes contact with a zone-point, the spell will
            immediately wear off.<br>
            <br>
            - Players may now target Drakes much easier.<br>
            <br>
            - Several &quot;Safe Zones&quot; have been Fixed.<br>
            <br>
            - A number of quests have been both enhanced and added.<br>
            <br>
            - Helmet colors are now displayed properly on Barbarians.<br>
            <br>
            - If a character is blinded, the chat box will no longer flash.<br>
            <br>
            - If a shuriken or throwing knife is equipped, then unequipped, the
            weapon will no longer remain on the character model.<br>
            <br>
            - Monk trainers will now train Instill Doubt.<br>
            <br>
            *Spell Additions and Enhancements*<br>
            <br>
            - The Eye of Zomm now allows the caster to travel up and down.<br>
            <br>
            - When player dispels minor illusion, the character's weapons will
            no longer disappear from the character model.<br>
            <br>
            - Some 44th and 49th Damage spells have had slight modifications
            made to them:<br>
            <br>
            - Gasping Embrace (Enchanter) has been re-tuned in the style of
            other DoT spells to make it more party friendly.<br>
            <br>
            - Retribution (Cleric) has had a typo fixed, and does about ten
            percent less damage now.<br>
            <br>
            - Ice (Druid) has had its damage lowered by a few points to match
            the damage done by Starfire.<br>
            <br>
            - Rend (Wizard) is now available on certain Wizard vendors (lvl 49
            spell)<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            - Succor's (DRUID) casting cost has been raised to match the casting
            cost of the Circle, Evacuate and Portal spells.<br>
            <br>
            - Wizard Portal and Evac spells have had their AoE radius range
            upped to match Druid Circle spells.<br>
            <br>
            - Necromancer research components that did not previously stack
            should now stack.<br>
            <br>
            - The Bug that allowed Screaming Terror to work Outdoors has been
            fixed.<br>
            <br>
            - Vampiric Curse (NECROMANCER) damage has been upped.<br>
            <br>
            - Share Wolf Form (DRUID) has had its Area Effect Radius reduced.
            This means that party members who want to be turned into wolves
            should stand near the caster, while those that do not should stand
            further away.<br>
            <br>
            - Hitting F1 twice, or /pet target will now target your pet.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
