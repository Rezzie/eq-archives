<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
<p>Kelethin is one of the most amazing cities in all of Norrath, a tree city built 
  peacefully around the trunks of the giant trees of the Greater Faydark. I was 
  seeking Bards in this part of the world, and a fellow traveller who gave me 
  directions told me to not look at my feet, but I had no idea what he meant until 
  I saw the bottoms of dozens of wooden platforms sticking out of the mist. This 
  is the ancestral home of the wood elves, and the center of their society. Elevators 
  can be raised and lowered to the surrounding forest floor from some of the lower 
  platforms, allowing easy access for the wood elves and protection from those 
  they would rather not have visiting.
<h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
<p>The area surrounding Kelethin is swarming with life. Black wolves, wasp drones, 
  and bats move through the forest, and provide the targets for many a budding 
  archer from the city above. The nearby orc city of Crushbone also sends scouts 
  occasionally as far as Kelethin, but they have never gained a foothold on the 
  city's platforms themselves.
<p>Further from the main city lies the entrance to Crushbone itself. The orcs 
  have made camps ringing the entrance and many heroes (and corpses) have been 
  made by fighting the large orc families that live here. Faeries also move through 
  the woods, but they will leave the average traveller alone unless they are known 
  to hunt faerie-kin. The nearby smaller forest of Lesser Faydark holds the portal 
  to the land of both the gnomes and is inhabited by more ferocious orcs and other, 
  more horrible creatures. The dwarven city of Kaladim lies through the Butcherblock 
  Mountains and their dangers.
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>K</font>elethin</h3>
<p>Kelethin is one of the four major cities on the continent of Faydwer, the others 
  being the cities of the high elves, the dwarves, and the gnomes. They share 
  Greater Faydark with the high elves, although the high elf city of Felwithea 
  is almost exactly the opposite of Kelethin, being a grand and opulent city on 
  the outside, and simple and beautiful on the inside. The gnome city of Ak'Anon 
  and the dwarven city of Kaladim are both a short distance away, the first through 
  the sparsely populated forest of Lesser Faydark, and the second through the 
  stretches of the Butcherblock Mountains.
<p>As far as travelling abroad, Kelethin is about as far from a port as you can 
  be on this island, and the trip from Kaladim's port to the human city of Freeport 
  is a long and boring one. There is a set of magical gates near the pass to Lesser 
  Faydark that powerful mages are rumored to be able to travel with, but they 
  have been inactive for quite some time.
<h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
<p><b>Places</b>
<p>The city itself is really the site to see when you are in Kelethin. It is incredible 
  to an outsider (although I'm part elf myself) that these wood elves live and 
  work on platforms with no rails or protection from falls to the ground below. 
  Although personally not afraid of heights, my barbarian friend who made the 
  trip to this city with me refused to ride the elevator to the platforms and 
  curled up in a bush below to await my return. I can't say that I blame him.
<p><b>People</b>
<p>The people of Kelethin are a quiet folk. They are sequestered away in Greater 
  Faydark, and since the population reveres nature as a rule, it would be difficult 
  to find any of the poachers or other misusers of the gifts in Kelethin. It pains 
  my human half to say it, but I feel that elves are one of the truly beautiful 
  races in Norrath, and this peaceful city is a faint reflection of an inner peace 
  and harmony that we all could learn from.
