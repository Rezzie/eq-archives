      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Warsliks Woods is a massive, rough forest that spreads from Cabilis to 
        the ocean to the north. In between lies the most untamed area near to 
        Cabilis. This area is under the rule of the forest giants, who have made 
        this area their home for generations, and the goblins, who long ago took 
        over the ruins of an ancient trading post overlooking the gorge that runs 
        through the area.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The forest is dangerous because it is very easy to stumble across any 
        of the monsters that inhabit the area, all of which are highly aggressive, 
        every time you crest a hill or run through a few trees. Every monster 
        on the list roams the forest freely, and every monster on the list will 
        attack you as soon as they see you, no questions asked. This is the true 
        danger of Warsliks Woods.
      <p>Otherwise, the area is relatively straightforward. Most of the creatures 
        (other than the Skulking Brutes) appear in a fixed area or camp, and can 
        be hunted with relative ease. Probably the largest problem is that the 
        area really isn't designed for young broodlings. There isn't a &quot;newbie&quot; 
        area near the entrance of the city where they can hunt weak monsters, 
        instead the difficulty level increases rapidly the further away from the 
        city a young Iksar gets. For this reason, although the levels listed starts 
        at one, my recommendation is that you don't even try to hunt here until 
        at least 5th to 6th levels, and even then pickings will be slim.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This area has several good areas to hunt monsters in, despite what I've 
        said above. First of all, every concentration of monsters has a nearby 
        area that you are able to pull to when hunting them. For the goblins and 
        the forest giants, you can pull them either away from their fort, or you 
        can pull them to one of several relatively clear corners inside the fort 
        itself. The goblins can be pulled to the southeast corner of their fort, 
        which is also safe from patrolling goblins for a group. The Iksar around 
        Bandit Lake can be pulled to the wall.
      <p>Otherwise, there's not much to be said for this area. It isn't open enough 
        to be a good outdoors hunting area, and really only shines when a good 
        group pulls one of the camps in order to hunt.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>W</font>arsliks <font size="+2">W</font>oods</h3>
      <p>The city of Cabilis has a small outpost in the southwest corner of Warsliks 
        Woods. In the northwest corner lies a narrow pass that opens up into the 
        Field of Bone to the east. Along the western wall lies the pass to the 
        Overthere a vast plains area rumored to hold the ancient Iksar shipyards 
        and Sebilis itself. And somewhere, its entrance hidden, the Crypt of Dalnir 
        is rumored to lie within the forest...
