        The Quests</b></p>
      <p><b>Monk Newbie Quest</b><br>
        Master Bain<br>
        Court of Bain<br>
        He asks you who sent you. You tell him Grand Master Glox. Then he will 
        give you your first wristband, the Shackle of Dust.</p>
      <p><b>Monk First Rite</b><br>
        Master Raska<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        Hands you First Rite Pack and has you seek out Goblin Scout Beads, Large 
        Scorpion Pincer, Froglok Skipping Stone, and Sabertooth Cub Canine, combine 
        and return to him. Returns to you Shackle of Clay, and AC 3 Monk only 
        wristband. Note that this quest can be done a second time after completing 
        the Task of Cleansing to have two shackles again. Improved faction with 
        Swifttails and LegionOfCabilis.</p>
      <p><b>Monk Task of Cleansing</b><br>
        Master Raska<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        After completing Monk First Rite, ask about Shackle of Stone. He commands 
        you to seek out Iksar Bandits and acquire two Bandit Masks and return 
        them along with your Shackles of Dust and Clay to acquire Shackle of Stone, 
        an AC 4 Monk only wristband. Improved faction with Swifttails and LegionOfCabilis.</p>
      <p><b>Monk Shackle of Rock</b><br>
        Master Raksa, Master Niska<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        After completing the Shackle of Stone quest, Master Raksa will mention 
        that you need to see Master Niska. Ask her about the Shackle of Rock, 
        and she will tell you she needs the Claws of Talon, a legendary monk. 
        When asked more information, she refers you to the Court Chronicler. The 
        Court Chronicler has a book about Talon, which describes his whole life, 
        and at the end states that his claws were removed after his death and 
        placed in a jar inside of Kurn's Tower. Return them to her to receive 
        the Shackle of Rock. Note that there are two fists that you need to acquire 
        in order to complete the quest, as well as possibly a third &quot;fist&quot; 
        that is as yet unidentified certainly.<br>
        The left fist can be obtained off of the Sarnak Couriers in Lake of Ill 
        Omen. No quest, just kill them until you get one...<br>
        The right fist can be obtained through the following quest. If you ask 
        the bartender of the pub in Cabilis who Talon Southpaw was, he remarks 
        that he thinks one of the Claws was possessed by Master Rinmark. If you 
        ask Master Bain about this, he states that Master Rinmark has left the 
        Court of Pain and has travelled to the Overthere to meditate. He is actually 
        to be found in the Timorous Deep on the Chessboard Island. His approximate 
        location is -5070, +2765 and he is actually called &quot;iksar master.&quot; 
        Ask the master about Talon Southpaw and he raves about his greatness: 
        &quot;The great master. His soul is the wind. He speaks to us in words 
        of thunder. He strikes Norrath with bolts of lightning. I seek to be as 
        he. I have travelled the globe in search of his fists. I have found only 
        one...&quot; Ask to return it to Cabilis, and he will ask you to prove 
        yourself worthy by finding some items. He hands you a pack if you say 
        that you will, and in this pack you must combine an Excavator Paw (from 
        Burynai Excavators in Field of Bone/Kurn's Tower), an Intact Brutling 
        Choppers (from Skulking Brutling in Warslik's Woods), a sash from an exiled 
        Human Monk (from a Young Ronin in Oasis of Marr), and the Sparring Gloves 
        of a Goblin Pitfighter (found off of Goblin Pitfighter in Warslik's Woods).<br>
        The third &quot;fist&quot; is gained the following way. In Kurn's Tower, 
        there is a semi-rare spawn near where the Cook spawns below, named "A 
        Fingered Skeleton". Around lvl 16+ mob. He drops a finger each time you 
        kill him, though note that you have to kill him at least 4 times to get 
        all fingers. You need 4 from him: 2.5", 3.1", 3.5", 4.0&quot;. Then, you 
        must travel to Timorour Deep and visit the Great Oowomp. Feign Death is 
        a valuable tool to have here, as well as sneak. Since he is usually camped, 
        this part of the quest can be fairly easy if it is done correctly. You 
        must sneak up behind the Great Oowomp and give him 5gp. A mob will spawn 
        named, "A Dancing Skeleton". Ask the dancing skeleton about Talon Southpaw 
        ("Who was Talon Southpaw") and he will say something back to you. Tell 
        him that you will "Return it to Cabilis" and he will give you a fist, 
        but note that it is a container (it is really the thumb of the fist) and 
        you must place all 4 fingers in the container and combine them to make 
        the third fist. Returning all these fists (3 total) will result in the 
        Shackle of Rock. </p>
      <p><b>Monk Training Bag</b><br>
        Master Bain<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        Hands you Leech Husk Pouch, fill with 4 Leech Husks off of Swamp Leeches 
        (Uncommon drop) or Giant Swamp Leeches (Common drop), return to Klok Mugruk. 
        Klok Mugruk then hands back Training Bag Husk and tells you to seek out 
        3 Granite Pebbles, which you use with Husk to tailor a Monk Training Bag. 
        Improved faction with CabilisResidents and LegionOfCabilis. To get the 
        Granite Pebbles, you must hunt Escaped Frogloks (Rare Random Spawn) in 
        the Swamp of No Hope which drop one Busted Froglok Shackle for each Frog 
        killed. Kill six Escaped Frogloks and take them to the Toilmaster. Give 
        the Shackles to the Toilmaster in two at a time. For each two shackles 
        you give him he will present you with one Granite Pebble. To tailor the 
        Training Bag, place the Granite Pebbles (UNSTACKED) in a Large Sewing 
        Kit with the Training Bag Husk and combine. You get a Monk Training Bag, 
        which is a Lore No Drop item that isn't actually a bag. You then give 
        the Tailor Training Bag to Master Bain, in return he gives you a random 
        piece of armor equivalent in stats to its respective piece of Curscale 
        Armor (armor class anyway), however, its appearance is that of what is 
        worn by Master Bain or Grand Master Glox (looks like the Monk Cured Silk 
        Armor series). Also receive 1 GP and improved faction with CabilisResidents 
        and LegionofCabilis.</p>

        Beads from Goblin Scout, one Sabertooth Kitten Canine, and three Bone 
        shards. Combine and return it to him and he will reward you with a Curscale

        and shaman.</p>

        from three creatures, from carnivorous plants, from leeches, and from
