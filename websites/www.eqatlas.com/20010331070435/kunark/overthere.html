      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Overthere is a vast area of plains that gradually evolves to reach 
        the northern shore of the continent of Kunark. There is a vast area of 
        ravines and chasms that have existed for centuries, infested with the 
        evil Scorpiki, ancient protectors of the hidden temples. The evil races 
        of Norrath have also claimed the shore of The Overthere and have established 
        their beachhead here. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone is only fairly dangerous. It used to be that the creatures 
        there would not be KOS to you at all, but that was recently changed so 
        now only the cacti-type creatures are not aggressive, but everything else 
        will attack you. It is possible that this is only true in the southern 
        half of the zone, and that in the northern half most of the creatures 
        are still non-aggressive, but I'm not sure about that.
      <p>One place that bears special mention is the Overthere evil race outpost, 
        where all Iksar and good races are KOS by some huge cliff golems and undead. 
        To catch the boat, swim from the outside of the eastern edge of the outpost. 
        The dragoons from the outpost actually go on patrol around the zone during 
        the night. This can be a problem to people that would normally be KOS 
        to them, as you will be attacked as the dragoons make their rounds.
      <p>The other is in the chasm. The entire bottom is covered with scorpiki, 
        the evil mixing of scorpions and iksar that have lived here for centuries 
        beyond count. They are aggressive and powerful.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone is probably the best hunting area for druids of all levels. 
        The large, open spaces are almost unique on the new continent, which is 
        generally very crowded with poor visibility. Also, the creatures are sparsely 
        distributed, allowing you to pull and kite to your heart's content.
      <p>Also, this zone has a wide range of levels for monsters, enabling anywhere 
        from 15th level to 40th level and up hunting. The region closer to the 
        zone to the Frontier Mountains is quite high level, but as you go east 
        and then north past the Warsliks Woods entrance, the monsters become weaker 
        and can be handled by a 20th level adventurer easily. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>O</font>verthere</h3>
      <p>The Overthere is the site of the beachhead of the evil races. This large 
        structure is where the broken barge lands and disembarks for the Timorous 
        Deep. The location is approximately 3000, 2000. If you are an Iksar, refer 
        to the <a href="cabfptravel.html">Cabilis to Freeport Travel Guide</a> 
        for more information. 
      <p>The Frontier Mountains can be reached through a short pass located at 
        -6000, 1380. The area is notable for the large platform structure just 
        north of the pass.
      <p>Warsliks Woods can be reached by a pass located high in the hills at 
        approximately -240, -4390. The area is noticeable because of the large 
        Iksar statue that stands in the plains straight out from this position. 
      <p>The Skyfire Mountains can also be reached through the Overthere, through 
        a large temple-looking structure located at -1100, 3900. 
      <p>Howling Stones can be found by zoning to it through The Overthere. The 
        location of the entrance is in a chasm with a large number of scorpiki. 
        There is a glowing red sphere that is locked, and nobody seems to know 
        where to find the key...
