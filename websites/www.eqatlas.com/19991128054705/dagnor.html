<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>Dagnor's Cauldron is a barren wasteland that separates Butcherblock Mountains 
  from the haunted Estate to the south. One can't imagine what manner of impact, 
  whether magical or natural, rent this landscape to make it as twisted and ugly 
  as it is now. 
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>Dagnor's Cauldron is a barren zone, grey stone covered with small amounts of 
  red and green moss, and very broken. The aggressive aqua goblins roam all over 
  this zone, as do the undertow skeletons, and are often difficult to see due 
  to the terrain. As such, travelling through the zone is an exercise in keeping 
  ones eyes peeled for approaching or lurking danger.
<p>The other danger in the Cauldron is from the terrain itself. Since many people 
  travel through here at enhanced speeds, shall we say, they have to take into 
  consideration that falling off of some of these rock formations can be painful. 
  My record so far is 151 hit points from one fall, while running sideways along 
  a cliff and not sped up. I shudder to think if I had the Spirit of the Wolf 
  in me and had been going straight over the top. The safest way from north to 
  south is along the edge of the water on the west side.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>Dagnor's Cauldron doesn't have many advantages over other zones on Faydwer. 
  I suppose you could adventure there and kill snakes at lower levels, and pick 
  off aqua goblins as you get to higher levels, but it's probably more work than 
  it's worth. Just move into Unrest. The zone is basically a difficult place to 
  travel through on the way to Unrest.
<p>There are two unique bonuses to this zone. First of all, this zone's version 
  of &quot;guards&quot; is the NPC camp at the northwest end of the lake. They 
  provide grudging protection if you need it, and will also heal you if you ask. 
  The other individual is found on the island in the center of the lake, Corium 
  Darkblade. He can make poison for you if you want him to, for a small fee.

  <font size=+2>D</font>agnor's <font size=+2>C</font>auldron</h3>

<p>From the north the entrance to Dagnor's Cauldron is easily missed, a crevasse 
  in the rock wall on the southern edge of Butcherblock Mountains. The path to 
  the south of the crossroads leads the traveller there. The only exit from the 
  south of the Cauldron is into the Estate of Unrest. The entrance to Kedge Keep 
  lies underwater in the southern edge of the lake.
