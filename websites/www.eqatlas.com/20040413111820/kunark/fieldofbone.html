      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Field of Bone is the original site of a vast reservoir for the city 
      of Cabilis and the nearby structures. Long ago, however, great battles occurred 
      in the field and the magical energies unleashed there forever charred the 
      surface of the earth. Since then, only the banished and the dead roam these 
      fields. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      <p>The Field of Bone consists mostly of a large desert like area, roamed 
        by various insect species, scorpions, scale wolves, outcast Iksar, and 
        the risen dead. Of these, only the Iksar and the undead are aggressive. 
        Since this area is where new Iksar mostly come to hunt, they need to be 
        aware that, occasionally, powerful skeletons, such as militia and scalebone 
        skeletons, as well as Iksar bandits and manslayers, will wander through 
        the area frequented by these young broodlings. Make sure that that decaying 
        skeleton you're running up to attack is really what you think it is, and 
        all Iksar are not the Crusaders there to save you. Other dangers in this 
        area are that certain monsters will group with each other when one of 
        their kind is in a fight. Scale wolves are notorious for their packlike 
        behavior. Also, most of the insects in this area have a hive mentality 
        and will come to the aid of their own kind as well. This is actually more 
        dangerous, as these insects can be almost as powerful as militia skeletons, 
        and are crawling all over the area.
      <p>There are a few more areas to note the dangers in. South of the old reservoir 
        lies an area that is hunted by seasoned broodlings looking for large and 
        giant scorpions. This area is a small area lying between the reservoir 
        and the ancient ruins of Kaesora. Although the scorpions will not group 
        and are easily handled, there are many aggressive and powerful Iksar and 
        skeletons that also roam through this area, and are often more powerful 
        than the scorpions and other creatures. Again, watch what's going on around 
        you, the Field of Bone is aptly named as its the color of bone, and skeletons 
        are hard to see until you're almost on top of them.
      <p>There are two specific dangers, the first is the tangrin. Off the northern 
        shore of the field is a small island with an ancient Iksar wall built 
        on the southern edge of it. On this island lives the tangrin, a very aggressive 
        and dangerous ape that will kill you before you see it coming. The second 
        is the targishin, an aggressive skeleton of unknown significance, that 
        stands guard over the entrance to the ruined catacombs below Kaesora. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Hunting in the Field of Bone is what most Iksar do when they're young. 
        Scorpions and carrion hatchlings provide a good source of money with their 
        pincers and carapaces. Scaled wolf pups are hunted for their curscale 
        skins to make the rare curskin armor, highly sought after by the Swifttail 
        caste. Further out are some areas where you are able to hunt with a relatively 
        good view of what's around you, giving you more safety. One particular 
        area is the reservoir. Creatures tend to stay in the center of the reservoir 
        and never travel to the edge, and likewise creatures from outside never 
        travel into the reservoir itself. What this means is that you can set 
        up camp in one of the access ramps to the reservoir and pull monsters 
        from the middle with a high degree of control and safety. The reservoir 
        levels also range from about fifth to about 14th, making for a good range 
        of hunting just in the reservoir. 
      <p>The surface ruins of the buried Kaesora is a place where you can be bound, 
        which is very convenient for anyone hunting in either Kurn's or Kaesora.
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2> T</font>he <font size=+2>F</font>ield <font size=+2>O</font>f 
        <font size=+2>B</font>one</h3>
      East Cabilis opens into the southwestern corner of the field, and since 
      most castes of Iksar have their guilds in East Cabilis, this provides easy 
      access to the field. Also, unbound Iksar will respawn in the field, so many 
      people travel through here. In the northwest edge, not far from Cabilis, 
      you can enter Warsliks Wood. In the south you can enter the Swamp of No 
      Hope, and just north of that, behind the ruins of Kaesora, the entrance 
      to the Emerald Jungle lies. Kurn's Tower lies silent in the middle of the 
      Field.
