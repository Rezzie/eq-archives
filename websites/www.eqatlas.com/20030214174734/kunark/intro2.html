      <h4>Storyline</h4>
      <p>Kunark is a vast continent, nearly half as large as the vast continent 
        of Antonica, and up until recently was believed by most to be a story 
        to scare small children with. The continent is more tropical than the 
        other continents of Norrath, and is covered in swamps and heavy forest, 
        as well as vast, heavily-weathered mountain ranges.</p>
      <p>It is in this land that the Iksar race of ages past thrived and flourished, 
        creating an empire whose only equal in all of Norrath was the mighty Combine 
        Empire of old. The entire continent belonged to the Iksar, and their cities, 
        vast monuments to their power, were scattered across its surface. They 
        built vast waterworks to supply their cities with the water that they 
        enjoyed, as well as religious temples and villages all over Kunark. It 
        was impossible to walk for a few hours without seeing some stonework that 
        the Iksar had created to mark their homes or their triumphs. All who entered 
        the lands knew who it belonged to the first time they saw an immense statue 
        of an Iksar appearing out of the swampy mists.</p>
      <p>Then their empire fell. The mighty legion of evil forces, led by the 
        great dragon Trakanon, assaulted the Iksar Empire. Over a short number 
        of years, the Iksar lost battle after battle until finally they were driven 
        from their great capital city of Sebilis by the wurm itself, who lives 
        there to this day. Following that, the tribes of Iksar were forced to 
        survive in the wilds of Kunark for many years while they gathered their 
        strengths. During this period, the basis of the modern Iksar society was 
        formed. The necromancers gained in power over their evil forces, and the 
        legions of warriors of the Greenmist were formed to help protect the tribes. 
        Following their unity, they recaptured their walled city of Cabilis.</p>
      <p>Even there, they suffered for centuries, trying to return their society 
        to the basics, by which it had accomplished so much in the ages prior. 
        Cooperation was fostered among all the sects in this small city, and gradually 
        posts were obtained in the surrounding areas. Iksar who fought against 
        this concept were cast out to survive in the lands beyond Cabilis' walls.</p>
      <p>Now the Iksar civilization are at what many hope to be a turning point. 
        Their society thinks as one, and is beginning to take on their ancient 
        enemies in the surrounding lands, fighting the goblins, sarnak, and frogloks 
        to reclaim the swamp over which they had ruled. The struggle is not an 
        easy one, however, for as the good races of the continent of Antonica 
        have become more powerful in the ways of exploration and magic, they have 
        discovered ancient, unused gates into the lands of Kunark and have started 
        to arrive in small groups. Shortly thereafter, small boats began ferrying 
        adventurers to a small beachhead on the continent, the only stronghold 
        of the vast lands beyond on this continent. The Iksar are waiting...</p>
