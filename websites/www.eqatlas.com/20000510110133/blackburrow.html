      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Blackburrow is the home of the Blackburrow clan of gnolls. It is something 
        of a combination between underground dungeon and above ground hunting 
        area, and represents the only pathway to get from Everfrost and the home 
        of the barbarians to the Qeynos Hills and lands beyond. The overall structure 
        of Blackburrow consists of two entrances and a ring with a deep hole in 
        the middle. There are multiple tunnels to the lower levels where higher 
        level gnolls can be found. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This level is quite dangerous, mostly for two reasons. The first is that 
        it is famous for its "trains." Trains are created when a gnoll runs to 
        the lower levels after being attacked, encounters some of its fellows 
        and recruits them to help him to return to the top. Invariably, the gnolls 
        at lower levels in Blackburrow are tougher and more dangerous, and I've 
        seen trains of almost a dozen Gnoll Elite Guards running through the area. 
        Since they are all above 10th level and the average level of a character 
        on the top is about 8th or so, these trains leave a trail of bodies behind 
        them and a large number of high level characters running to the exits 
        /shout'ing "run" and "zone" and "TRAIN!!!" Quite satisfying. 
      <p>The other danger is that there is a large variance in the strength of 
        the gnolls who spawn at the top, which is made more dangerous by the fact 
        that there really isn't a good, safe place to stand and keep an eye on 
        the spawn spots. They spawn all around you and have a wide range of levels, 
        so you can wind up attacking a much more powerful gnoll if you don't /con 
        first. Needless to say, this happens often, and people will be running 
        past you with gnolls chasing them. 
      <p>The other problem, and this is more of an annoyance than a danger, is 
        that there are 15th level warriors sitting at the top killing scrawny 
        gnolls when they appear. What I mean is, there are a lot of high level 
        people who don't go kill gnolls their own levels in the lower dungeons, 
        but instead hunt on the top. This can mean slim pickings for us lower 
        level people. It can also mean more trains, because a very low level monster 
        will flee when attacked by one of these guys, and if they aren't quick 
        enough or smart enough to catch it before it runs down its hole, you can 
        bet a train is on its way. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This area, although dangerous, does provide some good benefits. First 
        of all, the gnolls are generally pretty wealthy. Most of the gnolls you 
        kill will either have a weapon or some cloth armor item, all of which 
        are worth cash. You'll find that every time you go home, you'll feel rich 
        for having hunted there. 
      <p>The other reason people hunt here is for quest items, mostly monks coming 
        out of Qeynos looking for items for the quests. They can only be found 
        here, so monks are seen here frequently with their parties. There are 
        quite a few other quests that can be done here, looking for various items 
        for use in the surrounding towns, so the place is a hub of activity. 
      <p>The character of hunting in Blackburrow has changed significantly over 
        the past few months of Everquest, and I have changed this guide to note 
        that. When the average player was about 10th level, Blackburrow was swamped 
        and it was almost impossible to get a kill in anywhere in the dungeon. 
        Trains happened about every 5 minutes, and you had to play at 3 am in 
        order to get a shot at camping the Elite Room. Now things are different. 
        The dungeon is much more open as people have improved the levels of their 
        characters, and you can actually hunt here. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>B</font>lackburrow</h3>
      <p>There are two entrances to Blackburrow. The first is on the southeast 
        segment of the canyons of Everfrost, which can be hard to find given that 
        the area is confusing. I'm not sure why, but I get lost there about every 
        other time even though I've travelled that path about a hundred times 
        now. The tunnel is guarded by several gnolls, and has up to three of them 
        down through it, so you'll often see barbarians who are timid to go into 
        Blackburrow itself hunting out here. The tunnel itself is long and dark, 
        and used to be impassable without a light source. I believe they've improved 
        it, but not by a ton, so don't count on it being vastly lighter. 
      <p>The other entrance is through Qeynos Hills, and the entrance is in the 
        northeast corner of the zone. There is no path to it, but it is east of 
        Surefall Glade and north of the zone to the Plains of Karana. The gnoll 
        head canopy is hard to mistake. There are several good spawn sites nearby 
        for gnolls, especially a few for gnoll watchers in groups that are fun 
        to take out for lower level groups. The tunnel here to Blackburrow is 
        much lighter and shorter.
