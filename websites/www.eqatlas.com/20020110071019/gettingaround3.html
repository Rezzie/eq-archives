      <h2>Teleportation Travel (aka Gating, Porting)</h2>
      <p>The simplest form of porting is Gating, which is gained my many classes, 
        usually with their second spell level. This allows them to travel back 
        to their bind spot. Although this doesn't really speed up travel going 
        to anyplace, it can greatly speed it up returning to where you started 
        if you were smart enough to bind yourself there. This isn't really considered 
        true porting, however.
      <p>Teleportation is a special form of travel, which higher level druids 
        and wizards are able to use. Druids gain this line of spells at level 
        19, wizards at level 20. Some general principles apply for how this works. 
        Druids and Wizards gain the ability to port themselves before they can 
        port other people. They usually get the personal port spell two spell 
        levels before they gain the group version of the same. The group versions 
        are very costly in terms of mana (300 mana). For example, at 24th level 
        a druid with 200 wisdom, casting one of these spells costs the druid almost 
        a third of total mana. At level 40 it costs almost 20% of total. Realize 
        this fact when asking people for ports, as they are not just a matter 
        of quickly porting you somewhere. 
      <p>The only unusual form of teleportation is that shamans are able to make 
        potions that will allow you to be teleported to either Halas area or Feerott. 
        They are also able to create a potion that will take you to the ruins 
        of Kaesora within the Field of Bone. These are useful for shamans for 
        getting their spells, but also for others, especially to Halas which has 
        no nearby port spell from anyone else. 
      <p>There are also some ways of moving around that occur in special cases 
        or as the cause of special spells. Magicians at level 55 get a spell called 
        Call of the Hero which allows them to teleport the targetted person directly 
        to them (within the same zone) and clears all the aggro counters for that 
        person. Clerics, when resurrecting a fallen character, will summon you 
        to life at your body, in essence teleporting you to your corpse. People 
        are also able to use the <a href="kunark/timorousteleport.html">teleport 
        pots in Timourous Deep</a> to move around as well.
      <p>Some spells are considered &quot;evac&quot; type of spells, short for 
        evacuation. These are generally used in dungeons as a way to get out of 
        the place quickly when things go wrong. They are actually the same as 
        regular group port spells in terms of mana cost, however they have a much 
        quicker casting time and recast time, making them more appropriate for 
        times of urgency. The downside with these spells is that there's a small 
        chance that they will leave people behind. These spells are also used 
        for travel to different places at times.
      <p>Now on to the specific spells. First the druid spells. Below is a table 
        that includes the zones that the spells take you to and the number location 
        on the map it's on, as well as info on the particular spell, including 
        what the name is as well as whether it is solo or group and what level 
        the druid obtains the spell. After the druid list is the wizard listing.</p>

      <p>Wizards also have a spell called Translocate that they get at level 50. 
        Using this spell, they can send one group member back to that group member's 
        bind spot. The other Translocate spells are similar, and send the target 
        to the place the spell is for. All of the Translocates other than the 
        level 39 and level 50 one require a Small Portal Fragment, which is sold 
        at the Temple of Solusek Ro for about 1 pp, and is consumed in the casting.
      <p>At level 52 wizards get the spell Abscond, which will teleport the wizard 
        only to a safe spot within the same zone that the spell is cast in. Graffe's 
        has compiled a <a href="http://www.graffe.com/abscond.html">listing</a> 
        of all of these locations.
      <p>At level 57 wizards get the spell Evacuate, which is an evacuation spell 
        for the group to a safe spot within the same zone.
      <h4>Rules for Velious Group Teleports</h4>
      <p>The spells for porting around Velious are unique. First of all, they 
        are the only spells where the druids and wizards both teleport to the 
        same location. Secondly, there used to be keys required to teleport to 
        these places. Note that this requirement has been removed since the Shadows 
        of Luclin expansion was released.
      <h4>Travelling To and From Luclin</h4>
      <p>There is only one way to get to Luclin, and that is through Nexus Scions 
        located at the major Wizard spires. These spires are the ones in Greater 
        Faydark, Toxxulia Forest, Northern Plains of Karana, and Dreadlands. The 
        scions will give you a stone to allow you to port to the Nexus on Luclin. 
        After a certain amount of time, they will cast the portal spell and everyone 
        standing beneath the spires will be teleported to the Nexus.
      <p>Once on Luclin, there are a couple of ways to get back to Norrath. Wizards 
        and Druids can use any of their normal gate or teleport spells and go 
        back to Norrath. You can also use portals in the Nexus to take you back 
        to Norrath, in exactly the same fashion that you got up there. These are, 
        at present, the only ways to move back and forth, as there are no Wizard 
        or Druid spells that will do it.
