<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>The Lavastorm Mountains are a relatively small, but very difficult and dangerous 
  zone to travel through. It is similar to Dagnor's Cauldron, in that some cataclysm 
  has wrecked the terrain within it, here being obviously volcanic in nature. 
  There are many lava pits throughout the zone, and shattered rocks stick up from 
  the ground. A massive lava pit, known as Solusek's Eye, lies in the center along 
  the northern edge of this shattered land.
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>Lavastorm is one of the highest level outside zones currently within the game. 
  There is no monster here than can be attacked by someone of less than 14th level 
  or so, while adventurers 16th-18th will be able to hunt well, and higher level 
  adventurers will be hard pressed to find anything to occupy themselves. The 
  main dangers are the creatures within the zone. Of all the creatures above, 
  only a handful are aggressive, and that includes the goblins, the fire elementals, 
  the fire imp, and the shadowed men. Of these, the ones that are extraordinarily 
  dangerous are the fire imp and the shadowed men. The fire imp is one of those 
  monsters that /con's much lower than they actually are. Fighting a green aggressive 
  one at level 17 as a ranger with both fire and magic protection over 50%, I 
  was killed rather easily because this creature casts a rather powerful fire-based 
  spell throughout battle. The shadowed men are a special case, as they come in 
  a rather large group, and are well-known to be both fast on the ground and lethal 
  in combat, regularly tearing apart larger groups of more powerful characters. 
  They are also approximately 30th level, which makes them the most powerful creatures 
  in the zone to date.
<p>The other danger is the terrain itself. The harsh rock outcroppings and ravines 
  can hide drops that will cause you damage (especially if taken quickly), pits 
  of lava, or aggressive monsters. Travelling slowly and with care, or quickly 
  with levitate, are the safest ways to get through the zone.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>As a ranger who prefers to hunt outdoors, I enjoy hunting in this zone to most 
  of the dungeons around. The monsters are relatively scattered so you can control 
  exactly what you fight. All of the creatures spawn items that are worth a fair 
  amount of money. They are all also extremely cool creatures, nowhere else can 
  you hear the sounds of the rock dervish as its many rocks slam into your armor 
  in rapid unison, or hunt the manner of creatures that are seen here.
<p>There are some more practical benefits to hunting in the zone as well. The 
  good races can sell at the gypsies located along the west wall, and the evil 
  races (dark elves at least) can sell to the druid merchant at the druid ring 
  in the northwest corner (don't ask me why that makes sense). Also, there are 
  many higher level druid spells for sale there. There are *four* dungeons accessible 
  from this zone, making it a crossroads of higher level characters to and from 
  hunting grounds within the various dungeons.
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>L</font>avastorm</h3>

<p>Lavastorm can be reached from the south by trekking through the Nektulos Forest, 
  home to the dark elves. Exits to Najena lie in the southeast corner of the zone, 
  behind a massive set of shattered doors. Entrances to Solusek's Eye A and B 
  lie along the southern edge of Solusek's Eye, and the Temple of Solusek Ro lies 
  along its northern edge.
