      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      Innothule Swamp is the home of the Trolls. Dank and soggy, it's the perfect 
      place for the Trolls to call home. Located in the very southern edge of 
      Antonica, it lies beyond the Southern Desert of Ro and adjacent to The Feerott, 
      home of the Orges. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      For young and experienced characters alike, Innothule Swamp can be a deadly 
      place due to it's many aggresive monsters, many of whom group. Add to this 
      the generally low PC population here, it's remarkable easy to find oneself 
      swarmed with little notice. 
      <p>As stated above, aggresive, grouping monsters can be very hazardous. 
        This is especially true when fighting the Frogloks, who spawn in a wide 
        area surrounding the entance to their home, Guk.&nbsp; Fighting here can 
        be deadly since almost all Frogloks patrol and they span a large range 
        of levels. Perhaps the best tactic to emply in this area is to grab a 
        Froglok's attention and high-tail it to the zone edge.&nbsp; Even doing 
        this oftens results in turning around to find 3-4 Frogloks of various 
        varieties attempting to make mince-meat out of you. 
      <p>Another danger in Innothule is the swamp itself. Unless you are a very 
        good swimmer, you never want to find yourself trapped by deep water. Most 
        of the creatures in the swamp are VERY good swimmers, making fleeing even 
        more hazardous if swimming is required. Generally avoid the deep water 
        and stick to the zone edges. 
      <p>There are a few human NPCs that patrol near Guk that are aggressive and 
        aren't particularly fond of the "evil" races.&nbsp; Be alert for these 
        unless you are around 10th level. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      Innothule is a great area to hunt with its variety of monsters, high creature 
      population, and great treasure.&nbsp; A troll never has to wander far from 
      home to find adventure. Characters can easily hunt the swamp up to 8th or 
      9th level, and Guk offers higher level prey and even greater treasure. 
      <p>Who says Trolls have to be ugly AND poor?&nbsp; Decaying Skeletons, Frogloks, 
        and Fungus Men all occasionally spawn with rusty weapons and often have 
        several silver to boot. And best of all is the netted and woven armor 
        that the Frogloks carry.&nbsp; Prized by monks for its magical properties 
        and low weight, this armor can sell for tremendous profit in the human 
        lands. Best of all, you never have to buy armor when adventuring here! 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>I</font>nnothule <font size=+2>S</font>wamp</h3>
      From the North, Innothule Swamp is reached through the Southern Desert of 
      Ro which lies south of Freeport. This can be a dangerous place, and probably 
      shouldn't be travelled by those less than about 6th or 7th level. To the 
      south is Grobb, home of the Trolls. Be particularly wary of this area if 
      you are of the "good" races. 
      <p>From the west, Innothule Swamp is entered by coming out of The Feerott, 
        home of the Ogres. This area lies south of Karana and Qeynos. 
      <p>To the east is Guk, home of the Frogloks. A particularly stunning dungeon 
        with many dangers and rewards...
