      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The land of Firiona Vie is a very wild forest, and also happens to be 
        the site of a beachhead established long ago by the elves of Faydwer. 
        After being long-abandoned, the elves are now returning to this land to 
        rebuild their fortress.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone is highly dangerous. Virtually every monster in this zone (Firiona 
        Drixies excluded) will attack every creature, no matter what. For that 
        reason, the only &quot;safe&quot; place in this zone is the high elf compound 
        of Firiona Vie, which lends its name to this region.
      <p>Specifically there are two new creatures in this zone that are the bane 
        of every traveller. First are the Drolvarg, a highly aggressive breed 
        of gnolls that has taken up residence in an abandoned tomb in the eastern 
        part of the woods. These Drolvargs are a constant nuisance to a traveller 
        in that direction, and have very large, fast moving patrols, forcing you 
        to keep your eyes open.
      <p>The other, probably more important, creature are the drachnids. These 
        abominations can be seen wandering the whole forest, although they are 
        more frequent in the western part. They are spellcasters that are around 
        30th level and are highly aggressive. They also have a tendency to pop 
        into appearance, which I'm not sure is that they are hiding, but more 
        likely related to my computer. Nonetheless, watch for these as well while 
        moving through the forest, as they tend to frequent the route travelled 
        by younger adventurers who arrive at the dock and want to go to Lake of 
        Ill Omen. 
      <p>Also, druids should be careful to not travel to the guards in wolf form, 
        as they will be killed. Evil races should be wary of travelling near the 
        Docks area, and also the caverns that lead from here to the Dreadlands 
        are frequented by high level guards that will attack evils on sight.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone provides a large number of creatures to hunt from, and they 
        tend to get more powerful the more easterly you go. It is also safe to 
        pull from either the dock area (although others will hate you) or to the 
        zone by Lake of Ill Omen, although none are super.
      <p>Probably the best thing in this zone are the drixies. They may not like 
        you, but they seem to hate everything else in the forest. I doubt you 
        could ever make this work to your advantage, but if you are being chased 
        by something that's going to kill you, run it into a couple of drixies 
        and watch the fun (while you can), knowing that whatever killed you has 
        likely seen its last day as well. Petty, I know... I had the pleasure 
        of watching three drixies drive off two drachnids that had wandered too 
        close. A short time later, I saw a large Drolvarg nearly kill a drixie, 
        only to have two more drixies wander by, heal the injured one, and proceed 
        to beat the crap out of the drolvarg. They may not help you, but they're 
        fun to watch...
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>F</font>iriona <font size=+2>V</font>ie</h3>
      <p>The boat to Timorous Deep and Butcherblock Mountains arrives at the dock 
        located at -4400, 1400.
      <p>To travel to Lake of Ill Omen, follow the stream just west of the ramp 
        to the mainland. This stream will take you into some hills and to the 
        Lake at approximately 1290, 3500. In the Lake the location is 1300, -4300.
      <p>There are several zones to the Swamp of No Hope scattered across the 
        northern edge of the forest.
