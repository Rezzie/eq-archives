      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The history behind the ruins of Kaesora is lost, however most believe 
        that the same cataclysm that struck down the wurm and permanently scoured 
        the surface of the Field of Bone above it laid waste to Kaesora as well. 
        Now only the dead walk these halls. Ancient ruins lie at the heart of 
        this place, presumably the remnants of the structures that were built 
        by the vampiric Warlord Chosooth.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Probably the most prominent danger in the dungeon is the fact that it 
        is very confusing. From the entrance, there are two entrances out of the 
        main room, both pits leading downward. One of the pits leads down one 
        level, and the other pit, if taken far enough, leads to the bottom of 
        the dungeon. The one-way nature of the dungeon is dangerous, because leaving 
        the dungeon is a long path out past many monsters, and there's not really 
        any way to retrace your steps. Once you fall down a beginning pit, you 
        either better know your way or have a way to port out.
      <p>There are two separate groups of inhabitants in this dungeon, the spiders 
        and the undead. The spiders consist of a mixture of necromancers and healers 
        as well as warrior types, and are all aggressive to outsiders. Some will 
        see through regular invisibility, and they can root if they need to, which 
        is very dangerous if you wish to flee this area quickly. The undead are 
        typical undead, although in general they tend to stay pretty spread out 
        throughout the areas that they inhabit. They are also occasionally seen 
        intermingled with some of the spiders.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Kaesora is considered a &quot;doable&quot; dungeon, which means that 
        a group of the appropriate levels that is well-balanced can go through 
        most parts of the dungeon, getting experience and items along the way, 
        with relative ease. A group in the mid to high 30's in level could do 
        most of the dungeon. This is enhanced by the fact that virtually all of 
        the loot from Kaesora does not come off of static spawns, but drops off 
        of every monster in the zone. Anything from spiders to undead will drop 
        virtually all of the items that don't come off of a static spawn.
      <p>The loot is also quite good, and within several hours of time a typical 
        group would generally gather half a dozen or more items from the creatures 
        within, all of which are generally pretty rare to find on the market, 
        and so tend to sell well. For example, Truesilver is a pretty uncommon 
        item to see up for sale, however the Truesilver Mail Shirt is about as 
        good as most of the class-specific armor breastplates, and can drop off 
        of anything in the zone.
      <p>The dungeon is also not a very busy one, placed deep within the continent. 
        Most are fighting in the church for the key to Howling Stones, when they 
        are here. That means that doing the dungeon becomes something that is 
        really an option for any group wanting to do so. The ruins outside of 
        Kaesora is also a bindable spot, making it even better to hunt in. 
      <p>In addition, the monsters are generally pretty well spread out. Although 
        the dungeon consists of a series of twisting corridors and rooms, it isn't 
        crawling with creatures. This means, in general, that a group can pretty 
        safely hunt here and expect to be able to rest and recuperate without 
        constantly being attacked by monsters. This holds true all the way down 
        to the bottom of the dungeon. This scarcity combined with only occasional 
        wanderers, and a group can feel free to take a rest just about anywhere.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>aesora</h3>
      <p>Kaesora can be reached by entering the ruins in Field of Bone and travelling 
        down through an opening into Kaesora itself. The opening lies just above 
        the ground in the ruins to the south of the Pit. The location is approximately 
        -1900, -275.
