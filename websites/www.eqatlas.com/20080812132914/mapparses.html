      <p>The following includes instructions on how to send in a log parse for 
        use by myself in making a map for EQ Atlas. Please follow them closely, 
        or log parses that you send me will not be useful.
      <h4>Map Parse Commands</h4>
      <p>The map parsing program that I use (written by Tad, thanks Tad!) uses 
        some very simple commands. There are only two commands that are important 
        and useful when creating the log file. They are &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;label&quot;. 
        They are used as follows:
      <p>Stop - Used to stop drawing a line or series of lines, format is simply 
        &quot;stop&quot; on a new line. The hotkey for it would be &quot;/say 
        stop&quot; It's as simple as that.
      <p>Label - Used to label a point as having something significant. The use 
        is &quot;label &lt;text&gt;&quot; where &lt;text&gt; is the label that 
        you want to attach to that point. This is then followed by a /loc that 
        shows where you want the point to be. There is no good way to hotkey this, 
        unfortunately.
      <p>Nothing else matters, so say whatever you want to. Just be careful to 
        not say stop (although you can do it in guild or group chat or anything 
        else) or it will screw it up. I don't think many people casually say label, 
        so that shouldn't be a problem.
      <p>You also need to know how to use your log. To turn it on, you type /log 
        on. To turn it off, you type /log off. I recommend making these into hotkeys 
        as well, simply for your use. Also, if you log out and back in, or zone, 
        I suggest you set log to on or off, depending on what you want, regardless 
        of what it was just a moment ago. There was some weirdness where it didn't 
        stay on after zones and stuff like that before, and it's better to just 
        put it in than to have to redo half the zone again.
      <h4>Example:</h4>

        Haven map for Luclin.

        etc...
      <p>This shows a few things. The first is how you would draw a chain of points. 
        Note that the program that runs through this log will draw straight lines 
        between all of those points. I highly suggest making a /loc hotkey to 
        take loc's frequently. Remember to hit 'stop' between the sections you 
        want to separate. Next on this you can see how I label things for the 
        parser. I hit 'stop' before them, then type label and what I want to call 
        it, then hit a /loc once. The first /loc will be the location of the marker 
        for that label. If you want to start drawing more lines after that, simply 
        start hitting /loc's, the parser will know what's going on.
      <p>That's it! Walk into a zone, type &quot;/log on&quot; and then go to 
        town!
      <h4>Log File Manipulation</h4>
      <p>If you do enough of these, you need to know how to play around with your 
        log files. These are text files saved in the main directory, named &quot;eqlog_73_&lt;name&gt;.txt 
        where &lt;name&gt; is your character's first name. These are just text 
        files, and you can rename them whatever you want. Realize, however, that 
        the /log command will only write it to this file, if you change the name 
        to something else it will make a new file to write it to, named as in 
        the above example. I suggest that after completing a log file for a particular 
        zone, you rename it with the zone's name and start a new log file. If 
        you do log with two zones in it, my parser will lump them together, it 
        has no way to tell them apart.
      <h4>What do you Label and Not Label?</h4>
      <p>If you know the site well, then you know what to label. Basically anything 
        I might put on the site, you should label. What to label includes: all 
        Trainers, merchants and what they sell, tradeskill objects (like Brew 
        Barrels and Forges), names of shops, slang names of rooms, monsters (either 
        named or not) that inhabit a room or an area, zone lines, etc. There may 
        be more, but that's all I can think of at the moment. Just be aware that 
        too many labels is not a problem for me, too few is.
      <p>Now, what to *not* label. Like I said above, too many labels is not a 
        problem for me, it's too few. But this will save you some time. I don't 
        care about NPC names, unless they are monsters that you can kill (i.e. 
        Named MOB's). I don't care about doors (unless they're secret) and gates 
        or that sort of stuff, unless there's something unique about them (locked, 
        trapped, etc). I don't care about quest givers, as I don't put them on 
        my page (unless they're also merchants or named MOB's). Those should save 
        you some time, as I think of more I'll put them in.
      <h4>Special Circumstances</h4>
      <p>While I can't cover all special circumstances with this, I'll try and 
        mention some that might come up a lot.
      <p>What if you can't move into an area (locked and you can't reach, guarded 
        by KOS monster, etc)? Simply don't draw it. Don't skip the spot and keep 
        drawing the line, as I will think that you had it mapped out completely. 
        If you can't reach an area, simply type 'stop' and restart again where 
        you can.
      <p>What if you can't do the whole zone? It doesn't matter, just send it 
        in. I can put together pieces that multiple people send in, even if they 
        overlap, without a problem. Some zones I imagine will need to be done 
        this way.
      <p>What if it's multiple levels? That's a tough one, but I think the best 
        way to do it is this. Put labels at the exit and entrance to and from 
        every level (I'm thinking of Tower of Frozen Shadow here). If you could, 
        map each level into a different parse file, that way it's super easy for 
        me to tell what's where. If they're all in one, and the areas overlap, 
        it's sometimes very difficult for me to pick out what part belongs where. 
        The best thing for me, to be clear, would be if each area had a separate 
        text file for it, labeled with how to get in and out of that area.
      <p>Ready to Map?
      <p>So, now that you've read through all this, does it still sound like something 
        you want to do? If so, follow these simple steps.
      <ol>
        <li>Check the <a href="mapstatus.html">Map Status</a> of the zone you 
          want to do. If it has <b>Done</b> in the Parse column, no parse is needed. 
          If you already have it done, feel free to send it in, but if not look 
          to doing something else.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions above and do a log parse. Be sure to delete/rename 
          your old log before you start so you get a fresh log.</li>
        <li>Check how the map looks by running it through the <a href="mapper.html">following 
          page</a>, which has a Java version that will show you how your map will 
          look.</li>
        <li>When you're done, rename the file &lt;zonename&gt;.txt and email it 
          to me at <a href="mailto:Muse@eqatlas.com">Muse@eqatlas.com</a>. Be 
          sure to include how you want your credit to appear on the web page for 
          it.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That's it! You've sent in a zone log parse, and I'll start working on 
        the map for it pronto! Thanks!</p>
