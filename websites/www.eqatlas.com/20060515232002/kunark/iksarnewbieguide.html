      <h3 align: left align="center">by Sssilik</h3>
      <p>OK, it's fun to explore a new race and new zones. Here are some tips 
        and advice from someone still learning the hard way.</p>
      <p>First, BEFORE you create a character, do a little research. Right now, 
        EQAtlas (www.EQAtlas.com) has the only guides I've found, and Muse has 
        done his usual excellent job mapping out Cabilis and the surrounding zones. 
        Print out the maps and read the information. On opening day, there were 
        more people asking where things were than I had imagined. I found myself 
        being a tourguide simply because I had the maps. &lt;<i>Note that the 
        above was unsolicited praise, yet still appreciated 8) --Muse</i>&gt;</p>
      <p>Now, go create your character. I won't go into details, 'cause other, 
        more experienced players have already done that. My first character is 
        a Shaman, so some things may have a slight slant in that direction, but 
        I'm trying to make my advice general. </p>
      <p>Once you spawn, go do your Newbie Quest, and train. Combat types should 
        dump all 5 points into their first weapon. Casters should check their 
        starting spells, and train 1 point into each of the casting skills for 
        these spells, and the rest into their newbie weapon. (For Shamans, that's 
        1 into Alter, 1 into Abjure, and 3 into 1HB.) Casters should keep their 
        buffs going at all times, if only to practice their skills. Melee classes 
        and races with special attacks should also put a point into those skills. 
      </p>
      <p>Now, BEFORE YOU GO KILL STUFF, go to the Haggle Baron's and see Klok 
        Mugruk. (Merchants are "Kloks.") Work your way through the quest he offers 
        until he gives you the backpack for the Curscale Skins. THIS IS A FREE 
        BACKPACK. The only caveat is be careful not to hit Combine unless you've 
        got 8 skins in it. </p>
      <p>OK, NOW go out to the newbie area in the Field of Bones. At first level, 
        the only things that are even are the Scaled Wolf Pups. /Con everything, 
        kill anything white, and loot the corpses. Loot any corpses that others 
        have left on the ground. If you fill up the backpack with hides, hit Combine. 
        Then go back to hunting. One warning: The pups and scarabs are group-oriented. 
        Be ready to run if your HP get too low. Feel free to /yell for help, there 
        are people who would love to kill what you've pulled. </p>
      <p>Don't worry about dying. Just remember where your body is. You'll want 
        that backpack and your newbie quest item. </p>
      <p>Once you hit second level, go back to your guild and Train. If you have 
        money to buy more spells, buy them first, see what caster skills you need, 
        and drop one point into each. Put the rest into your chosen weapon. If 
        your backpack is full and Combined, go back to the Haggle Baron's and 
        turn it in for experience, faction, and curscale armor. Get another backpack 
        from the Klok. </p>
      <p>At second level, scorpions are white. You can easily level to 5 just 
        killing scorpions (who do NOT mob you, and do NOT have poison) and Scaled 
        Wolf Cubs and Pups. Loot the scorpion stingers. Turn in 4 of them to Warlord 
        Zyzz on the second floor of the first building to your right as you enter 
        the zone from Cabilis. Zyzz gives you money, experience, and faction. 
        There is a merchant on the second floor of the first building to your 
        left as you enter the zone, where you can sell any other loot you've picked 
        up along the way. </p>
      <p>Each time you level, go back and train. Put 1 point into whatever skills 
        you need for your class, and the rest into your chosen weapon, until you've 
        reached 5th or 6th level. A lot of people advise you not to put more than 
        one point into your beginning weapon skill. I've found that I hit a lot 
        more often by "wasting" points here at low levels. So what? That means 
        I get a loot and experience faster, and spend less time running around 
        looking for my corpse. At 5th-6th level, start saving up your Practices 
        for your class-special skills. </p>
      <p>So long, and good hunting! </p>
