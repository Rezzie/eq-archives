      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Lake Rathetear is a large lake, almost a small sea, that sits nestled 
        in the distant wilds of Antonica. Many individuals who like to get away 
        from the main population centers come to here and the Rathe Mountains 
        because of their relative seclusion, and the lake and its surroundings 
        are home to many who have carved out their niche. Aviaks, spellcasters, 
        goblins, ogres, bandits, barbarians, gypsies, gnolls, and the occasional 
        hermit all reside in this area. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Lake Rathetear is a mid-level zone, and therefore is dangerous to people 
        travelling through it who are of lower levels. The most dangerous part 
        is the entrance from Southern Plains of Karana, which is heavily inhabited 
        by gnolls during the day and undead at night. I recommend travelling through 
        here at a brisk pace and invisible if possible if you cannot deal with 
        these creatures. 
      <p>The other significant danger is the fact that the zone is mostly aquatic. 
        Relying on boats is chancy at best, because now that the zone is more 
        heavily travelled, the boats aren't always at docks like they used to 
        be. Most of the walls are scalable, and it's possible to walk around much 
        of the zone clinging to a rock face, but there are definitely parts where 
        you will be forced to swim. Why is this dangerous? First of all, unless 
        you are a truly excellent swimmer, fighting the aqua goblins, sharks, 
        deepwater goblins, or Webclaw in the water is not going to be an enjoyable 
        experience. The other problem is that there is rumored to be a lake monster 
        that roams the lake. I haven't heard of him harrying adventurers lately, 
        but that doesn't mean he isn't simply resting... 
      <p>The other miscellaneous dangers have to do with the way the zone is laid 
        out, with little pockets of creatures and adventure separated from the 
        zone edges by a lot of water. Also, the enemies either come in packs or 
        are alone but hidden away inside of a tower or building, with very little 
        nearby room to rest and relax. Stepping onto land can be a scary experience... 
      <p>More specifically, the danger areas are as follows... The hermit lives 
        in a hut with the door facing away from shore, so you can't see him. He 
        is KOS to evil races, at least, as well as good races, and will attack 
        you as soon as you step onto the dock, and is about level 19. I have a 
        funny screen shot of my ogre in a raft with his dead body sitting on the 
        front, because I had to /corpse my body onto the raft without stepping 
        off of it, and then float to the nearby shore. The stone skeletons are 
        inside of their tower, and you have to walk up slowly to see them hiding 
        in there. I'm not sure what level they are, but they're able to summon 
        pets... You be the judge. The orc and bandit camps in the north have very 
        limited space to rest nearby, mostly just up on the hill behind them. 
        I got there by levitating, and I'm not sure you can walk by them without 
        them attacking. The northern entrance is very dangerous, although thankfully 
        very camped these days. Undead and spellcasting gnolls thrive in this 
        area, and are very difficult to avoid. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Lake Rathetear has many benefits due to its unique layout. It is not 
        a large, open zone like many of the other outside areas (the plains and 
        the deserts across Antonica). It is laid out more like places like Rathe 
        Mountains and Butcherblock Mountains, with several areas that all can 
        be considered their own mini-zones in which to hunt. As such, there can 
        be present no less than 11 groups of campers if everyone was nice and 
        took their own spot, and are often many more than that because certain 
        areas (the entrance to South Karana, for instance) have a large number 
        of dangerous spawns. I guess this is only of benefit if you like to camp, 
        but its a good zone for that. 
      <p>The lake's location next to Southern Plains of Karana and the Rathe Mountains 
        also make it a very busy transit area, with many groups heading through 
        on their way to nearby higher level zones. This is a good area to auction 
        off or for items that you need. There are also places to sell and buy 
        items, so a busy adventurer could spend weeks and never leave the zone 
        (other than to go to the bank). 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>L</font>ake <font size=+2>R</font>athetear</h3>
      <p>In the northwest corner of the lake along its northern shore lies the 
        entrance to the Southern Plains of Karana. This is something of a gauntlet, 
        as that specific area is infested with both gnolls and undead who will 
        attack all on sight, and even hang out on the dock for your boat. Just 
        west of this entrance lies the zone edge to the Arena, through a tunnel 
        by some aviak lookout posts. 
      <p>To the east lies the zone to Rathe Mountains, nestled in what is actually 
        the largest open area in the zone, between a camp of ogres and a camp 
        of bandits...
