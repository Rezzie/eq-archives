      <p><b>Monk</b>: (Go to <a href="monkguide.html"><b>Monk Guide</b></a>)<br>
        Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, 
        or New Sebilis as some may call it, is a great walled city located deep 
        in the heart of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants 
        of Cabilis foresaw your inner strength. It was then that your path was 
        chosen for you. Now that you have reached the season of rebirth you have 
        been summoned to the Court of Pain, training gounds and temple of the 
        Swifttail Caste. There you shall learn the ancient combat arts of the 
        monk. Through discipline and sacrifice your body, mind and soul shall 
        be forged into a weapon. Being an Iksar you know that your race stands 
        alone and allies are few and not to be trusted. It is only with the city 
        of Cabilis that you are truly safe.</p>
      <p><b>Necromancer</b>:<br>
        Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, 
        or New Sebilis as some may call it, is a great walled city located deep 
        in the heart of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants 
        of Cabilis detected the mana surging within your life force and thus your 
        path was chosen for you. Now that you have reached the season of rebirth 
        you have been summned to the infamous Tower of Death. It is there that 
        you shall be introduced to the dark circle of magic known as necromancy. 
        The scholars of the temple shall welcome you into the Brood of Kotiz to 
        begin your studies. Most Iksar residents fear and respoect the Brood of 
        Kotiz. The rumors of experiments performed on fellow Iksar run rampant. 
        All other Iksar castes have respect for the Brood. Beware of other races 
        as well as outsiders from abroad. They have no love for the Iksar. It 
        is only within Cabilis that you are truly safe. </p>
      <p><b>Shadowknight</b>:<br>
        Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, 
        or New Sebilis as some may call it, is a great walled city located deep 
        in the heart of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants 
        of Cabilis detected the spark of strength and wisdom within you. It was 
        then that your path was chosen for you. Now that you have approached the 
        season of rebirth, it is time to abandon your life and journey to the 
        Temple of Terror to begin your training in the brotherhood of the Crusaders 
        of Greenmist, shadowknights of Cabilis. There you shall learn the ways 
        of torture and discipline under the direction of the Lords of Pain. You 
        shall prepare yourself for the crusades to come. Know that all other nations 
        fear you. The Iksar have no allies and most outsiders shall attack you 
        on sight. Only with Cabilis are you truly safe. </p>
      <p><b>Shaman</b>:<br>
        Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis,

        was then that your path was chosen. Having reached the season of rebirth 
        you have been summoned to the Temple of Terror. It is there that you shall 
        study the ways of the unholy shamans known as the Scaled Mystics. Through 
        the Hierophants, ancient Iksar ancestors shall guide you through the stages 
        of the Scaled Mystics so that one day you may become a vessel of great 
        power. Together with the Crusaders of Greenmist you form the religious 
        backbone of the Iksar empire. The Iksar Legion does not act without the 
        aid fo the Scaled Mystics. Know that all other nations upon Norrath fear 
        and dislike the Iksar and cannot be trusted. Only with Cabilis are you 
        truly safe. </p>

        Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, 
        or New Sebilis as some may call it, is a great walled city located deep 
        in the heart of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, your path was chosen

        season of your long life it is time for you to abandon the innocence of 
        a broodling and report for duty as a new recruit within the Legion of 
        Cabilis. Under the tutorage of the Drill Masters you shall become a great 
        warrior. You shall protect your people with pride for there are many dangers 
        within the untamed lands of Kunark as well as the rumor of the arrival 
        of adventurers from abroad. As a member of the once great Iksar Empire 
        you are aware of the hatred and fear other races have of you. Only within 
        Cabilis are you truly safe. </p>
