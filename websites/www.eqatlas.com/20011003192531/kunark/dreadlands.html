      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Dreadlands is the name given to the harsh lands surrounding the ancient 
        Karnor's Castle. The area includes an area of forest inhabited by the 
        Drachnids, as well as the edge of a massive glacier extending down from 
        the mountains. Buried within a secluded valley is an ancient outpost of 
        the Combine Empire.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This vast area is inhabited by a large number of aggressive creatures, 
        and these comprise the major danger in travelling through the area. Every 
        creature you see will attack you, and all the creatures can see through 
        any invisibility spell or effect, so be prepared. 
      <p>The glacier area is dangerous because the mountainous terrain makes it 
        difficult to see creatures as you move through the area, so it is possible 
        to come over the crest of a hill directly on top of something not very 
        happy to run into you.
      <p>The wooded area further to the east is inhabited by the drachnids, a 
        group of fast-moving, spellcasting, aggressive spiderlike creatures that 
        continually roam the area. The decreased range of vision in this area 
        from the trees and frequent snowstorms make it easy to stumble across 
        them while travelling, and since most of them cast spells, it is advised 
        to not stumble across them. 
      <p>There is also a powerful dragon that can be found in this area, a frost 
        dragon named Gorenaire. Keep your eyes peeled, because if you stumble 
        across this one unprepared, you will more than likely be killed quicker 
        than you've ever been before.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Hunting in this area is actually much safer than in other areas of the 
        continent of Kunark for several reasons. First and foremost is that throughout 
        most of the zone, you have a large area of visibility surrounding you 
        while you hunt. This allows you to see creatures that might interrupt 
        you most rudely during a battle and move out of the way ahead of time. 
        The glacier has good vision, and the blasted area surrounding Karnor's 
        Castle has even better visibility. This is cut down significantly during 
        the frequent snowstorms, but is still quite good, and tends to cheer up 
        the barbarians in the group.
      <p>It is also relatively safe because there seem to be fewer monsters walking 
        around to avoid, possibly because of the vastness of the zone, or it may 
        just be an illusion caused by the large amount of visibility.
      <p>The Lost Valley bears special mention. This area is an isolated area 
        off of the western edge of the main area of the zone, and contains within 
        it the ancient ruins of an outpost of the Combine Empire. Nearby lie Wizard 
        and Druid portals, and this is where these classes gate into when using 
        spells to arrive in Kunark. The rest of the Lost Valley is not normally 
        inhabited by wandering monsters, although a traveller must be careful 
        because occasionally large creatures from the main area either get trained 
        or disoriented and wind up here. The outpost itself has some relatively 
        strong skeletons that don't wander around, and a skeletal monk of some 
        importance.

        <font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>D</font>readlands</h3>
      <p>The Druid and Wizard Teleportation spots are located at 2500, 7725 and 
        3050, 9650 respectively. 
      <p>There are many ways to get into the Dreadlands. The zone to Burning Wood 
        is at approximately 3400, -800. This places you at approximately -3500, 
        -800 in the Burning Wood. 
      <p>The zone to Firiona Vie is at 370, -5920. The tunnel in Firiona Vie opens 
        up at -200, 3590 after following a long passage through the mountains. 
      <p>Frontier Mountains can be entered through a tunnel located at 2100, -3410 
        and zones into Frontier Mountains at location -3675, -3330 (at the end 
        of the tunnel). 
      <p>Karnor's Castle is located at approximately 650, -1845.
