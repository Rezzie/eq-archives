      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Kithicor Forest has recently become a much more dangerous, dark place. 
        In days past, it was a quiet woods where an intrepid explorer could find 
        many things of interest, but now it is overrun. It is confusing to travel 
        in only because there aren't too many identifiable waypoints and the range 
        that one can see is limited, but it contains good hunting for two different 
        ranges of adventurers, as well as several unique items. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Another addendum. Following the opening of the Plane of Hate, this zone 
        has become significantly more dangerous. At night, there are many very 
        high level (level 35+) undead in the zone, which are highly aggressive. 
        These undead can also sometimes be found during the day. In addition, 
        different creatures are now appearing here, such as goblin workers and 
        will-o-wisps, which are relatively high level (low teens). Exercise caution 
        when travelling through here, especially at night. 
      <p>The shadowed men have recently taken up appearing in this zone with frightening 
        frequency. Their stepped up presence has turned a previously relatively 
        safe zone into a much more dangerous one, as they often can't be seen 
        until close, form into cohesive and deadly groups, and are extremely powerful. 
        Keep your eyes peeled for this new group of inhabitants. 
      <p>This zone is very dangerous to travel through, whether day or night. 
        At night the powerful undead, which are mostly over 40th level, spawn 
        all over the zone. In the daytime, these undead no longer spawn, but if 
        more powerful characters did not destroy them they will still be walking 
        around. It is only relatively safe to run along the walls, as the monsters 
        can charm you off of the wall. Also, there are now Dark Elf Dragoons that 
        can be seen wandering the zone, causing problems during the daytime hours.
      <p>There are other dangers here as well. The first is that the forest itself 
        is very confusing and hard to get around if you don't know what you are 
        doing. All the trees and hills look the same, and there is no sky to see 
        and not many paths to follow if you get lost. If you bite off more than 
        you can chew in terms of a monster, there are no wandering guards to save 
        you (no guards period, actually) and you pretty much have to know where 
        you're headed if you want to zone in time to escape. There also aren't 
        many roaming bands of other players to save you if you need it. 
      <p>The second is the named Orcs that live in the southwestern corner of 
        this zone. They aren't always out, but apparently to some people they 
        /con as being indifferent to you, although they actually kill on sight. 
        They are also, by far, the toughest monsters in the area (other than maybe 
        Thumper, I never poked him to find out). A large number of players use 
        the southern edge of the zone as their waypoint to find their way from 
        West Commonlands to Highpass Hold, and it brings them perilously close 
        to these guys. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>As I mentioned above, people think that there are few benefits to playing 
        in this area. When playing my ranger, I had to disagree. This area provides 
        some of the best untouched hunting in the game, all readily accessable. 
        It is possible to track around and find any monster you want, and I guarantee 
        you nobody else will be after it. This goes for the newbie area as well 
        as the higher level area that covers most of the southern edge of the 
        zone. As a 10th level ranger, everything in that area /con'ed comfortably 
        blue to me, and lower level groups could hunt their and make good experience. 
        The largest problem with hunting here is the lack of money, as none of 
        the creatures are sentient and carry cash with them. This is still true 
        since the addition of the more powerful monsters, but is much more dangerous. 
      <p>The other big plus in the game is that there seems to be some interesting 
        quests available (or soon to be) in this area. The items that I mentioned 
        above can be obtained from Ged Twigborn, a roaming NPC in the vein of 
        the more famous Baobob Miller. He is occasionally accompanied by his non-speaking 
        companion Irin Lunis. To find him, you either have to be able to track 
        him down, which still requires some footwork, or to find Irin Lunis and 
        follow her when she moves, because if she's by herself, she's walking 
        towards him. He generally appears randomly in the southern half of the 
        zone. It also appears that there is a Kithicor Resident faction. I haven't 
        been able to increase it other than by doing the above quests, although 
        you can increase it by killing orcs in Highpass Hold. There are several 
        more NPC's (including the enigmatic Thumper) who don't speak to me yet, 
        who I think will if I can get my standing higher. 
      <p>The newest quest is that rangers can now obtained Ivy Etched Armor from 
        a ranger outside of Morin Shadowbane's house in the northwestern section 
        of the forest. This is a class-specific armor for rangers, and appears 
        as green chain armor. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>ithicor <font size=+2>F</font>orest</h3>
      <p>On the eastern edge of the zone lies the entrance to the West Commonlands, 
        a mid-level zone that most people duck their heads and run through on 
        their way to Freeport to the east. 
      <p>On the northern edge lies the halfling starting city of Rivervale, a 
        remarkably well-developed city (in terms of quests and talking NPC's), 
        and beyond lies Misty Thicket and Runnyeye and the Gorge of King Xorbb, 
        along the alternate route between Qeynos and Freeport. 
      <p>On the western edge lies the entrance to Highpass Hold, a high mid-level 
        zone. My recommendations are to not attempt this zone unless you are invisible, 
        know the zone extremely well (and I mean like the back of your hand) or 
        are at least 15th level or higher. Once you step in and see the trail 
        of bodies leading off down the narrow, windy path, you might get an idea 
        of what I mean. When you look up and see the orc shaman casting Root on 
        you you'll definitely know what I mean.
