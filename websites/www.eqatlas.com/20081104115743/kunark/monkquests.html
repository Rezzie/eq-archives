        The Quests</b></p>
      <p><b>Monk Newbie Quest</b><br>
        Master Bain<br>
        Court of Bain<br>
        He asks you who sent you. You tell him Grand Master Glox. Then he will 
        give you your first wristband, the Shackle of Dust.</p>
      <p><b>Monk First Rite</b><br>
        Master Raska<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        Hands you First Rite Pack and has you seek out Goblin Scout Beads, Large 
        Scorpion Pincer, Froglok Skipping Stone, and Sabertooth Cub Canine, combine 
        and return to him. Returns to you Shackle of Clay, and AC 3 Monk only 
        wristband. Note that this quest can be done a second time after completing 
        the Task of Cleansing to have two shackles again. Improved faction with 
        Swifttails and LegionOfCabilis.</p>
      <p><b>Monk Task of Cleansing</b><br>
        Master Raska<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        After completing Monk First Rite, ask about Shackle of Stone. He commands 
        you to seek out Iksar Bandits and acquire two Bandit Masks and return 
        them along with your Shackles of Dust and Clay to acquire Shackle of Stone, 
        an AC 4 Monk only wristband. Improved faction with Swifttails and LegionOfCabilis.</p>
      <p><b>Monk Shackle of Rock</b><br>
        Master Raksa, Master Niska<br>
        Court of Pain <br>
        After completing the Shackle of Stone quest, Master Raksa will mention 
        that you need to see Master Niska. Ask her about the Shackle of Rock, 
        and she will tell you she needs the Claws of Talon, a legendary monk. 
        When asked more information, she refers you to the Court Chronicler. The 
        Court Chronicler has a book about Talon, which describes his whole life, 
        and at the end states that his claws were removed after his death and 
        placed in a jar inside of Kurn's Tower. Return them to her to receive 
        the Shackle of Rock. Note that there are actually three fists that are 
        required to complete this quest.<br>
        The left fist can be obtained off of the Sarnak Couriers in Lake of Ill 
        Omen, an uncommon sarnak that appears anywhere sarnaks do. No quest, just 
        kill them until you get one...<br>
        The right fist can be obtained through the following quest. If you ask 
        the bartender of the pub in Cabilis who Talon Southpaw was, he remarks 
        that he thinks one of the Claws was possessed by Master Rinmark. If you 
        ask Master Bain about this, he states that Master Rinmark has left the 
        Court of Pain and has travelled to the Overthere to meditate. He is actually 
        to be found in the Timorous Deep on the Chessboard Island. His approximate 
        location is -5070, +2765 and he is actually called &quot;iksar master.&quot; 
        Ask the master about Talon Southpaw and he raves about his greatness: 
        &quot;The great master. His soul is the wind. He speaks to us in words 
        of thunder. He strikes Norrath with bolts of lightning. I seek to be as 
        he. I have travelled the globe in search of his fists. I have found only 
        one...&quot; Ask to return it to Cabilis, and he will ask you to prove 
        yourself worthy by finding some items. He hands you a pack if you say 
        that you will, and in this pack you must combine the following items: 
        Burynai Excavator Paw (common drop from Burynai Excavators in Field of 
        Bone/Kurn's Tower); an Intact Brutling Choppers (from Skulking Brutling 
        in Warslik's Woods, found wandering the southwest corner of the zone, 
        south of the large treeless valley that runs east of Bandit Lake), a Torn 
        Sash from an exiled Human Monk (from a Young Ronin in Oasis of Marr or 
        South Ro, appears randomly but also at dervish camp in SW corner of the 
        water in Oasis), and the Sparring Gloves of a Goblin Pitfighter (found 
        off of Goblin Pitfighter in Warslik's Woods, spawns randomly but also 
        in one tent in the goblin fort there).<br>
        The third &quot;fist&quot; is gained the following way. In Kurn's Tower, 
        there is a semi-rare spawn that can appear at several different spots, 
        but all near where the Cook and Jester appear, named "A Fingered Skeleton.&quot; 
        He drops a finger each time you kill him, though note that you have to 
        kill him at least 4 times to get all fingers. You need 4 from him: 2.5", 
        3.1", 3.5", 4.0&quot;. Then, you must travel to Timorous Deep and visit 
        the Great Oowomp. Feign Death is a valuable tool to have here, as well 
        as Sneak. Since he is usually camped, this part of the quest can be fairly 
        easy if it is done correctly. The Great Oowomp starts out as indifferent 
        to iksar monks, so he might not attack you, but he won't talk to you unless 
        you use sneak. You must sneak up behind the Great Oowomp and give him 
        5 gold pieces. The Great Oowomp then summons his pet, named "A Dancing 
        Skeleton.&quot; Ask the Dancing Skeleton about Talon Southpaw ("Who was 
        Talon Southpaw?") and he will tell you about him and about how he has 
        a fist, but that it is missing most of the fingers. Tell him that you 
        will "Return it to Cabilis" and he will give you a fist, but note that 
        it is a container (it is really a fist with just a thumb) and you must 
        place all 4 fingers in the container and combine them to make the third 
        fist. Returning all these fists (3 total) will result in the Shackle of 
        Rock. </p>
      <p><b>Monk Training Bag</b><br>
        Master Bain<br>
        Court of Pain<br>
        Hands you Leech Husk Pouch, fill with 4 Leech Husks off of Swamp Leeches 
        (Uncommon drop) or Giant Swamp Leeches (Common drop), return to Klok Mugruk. 
        Klok Mugruk then hands back Training Bag Husk and tells you to seek out 
        3 Granite Pebbles, which you use with Husk to tailor a Monk Training Bag. 
        Improved faction with CabilisResidents and LegionOfCabilis. To get the 
        Granite Pebbles, you must hunt Escaped Frogloks (Rare Random Spawn) in 
        the Swamp of No Hope which drop one Busted Froglok Shackle for each Frog 
        killed. Kill six Escaped Frogloks and take them to the Toilmaster. Give 
        the Shackles to the Toilmaster in two at a time. For each two shackles 
        you give him he will present you with one Granite Pebble. To tailor the 
        Training Bag, place the Granite Pebbles (UNSTACKED) in a Large Sewing 
        Kit with the Training Bag Husk and combine. You get a Monk Training Bag, 
        which is a Lore No Drop item that isn't actually a bag. You then give 
        the Tailor Training Bag to Master Bain, in return he gives you a random 
        piece of armor equivalent in stats to its respective piece of Curscale 
        Armor (armor class anyway), however, its appearance is that of what is 
        worn by Master Bain or Grand Master Glox (looks like the Monk Cured Silk 
        Armor series). Also receive 1 GP and improved faction with CabilisResidents 
        and LegionofCabilis.</p>
      <p><b>Curscale Shield<br>
        </b>Drill Master Dal<br>
        Fortress Talishan<br>
        Talk to Drill Master Dal in Fortress Talishan and Mention that you are 
        a new recruit and he will hand you a Partisan Pack, a 6-item backpack. 
        He wants you to fill it with one Giant Blood Sac of the Giant Leech, Scout 
        Beads from Goblin Scout, one Sabertooth Kitten Canine, and three Bone 
        shards. Combine and return it to him and he will reward you with a Curscale 
        Buckler, AC 4 +1 fire prot wt 3.0, all races, classes monk, warrior, shadowknight, 
        and shaman.</p>

      <p><b>Unique Writing Materials </b><br>
        War Historian Kobl <br>
        Fortress Talishan <br>
        He mentions that he can create unique writing materials. Asking about 
        that reveals that he can make Blood Ink and Illweed Parchment. To make 
        Blood Ink he needs globules of blood from four places. He needs blood 
        from three creatures, from carnivorous plants, from leeches, and from 
        mosquitos (all found in Swamp of No Hope). He also needs globules from 
        blood pit in Tower of Death. For the Illweed Parchment he demands four 
        Illweed Reeds from the Lake of Ill Omen, and mentions that you may only 
        be able to get them by fishing. </p>
