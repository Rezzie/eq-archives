        <h3>Part 1</h3>
      </center>
      <p>The purpose of this article is to provide you with the basics on how 
        to get around the entire world of Everquest, designed for both newbie 
        and expert alike. I'll talk about moving by foot, boat, and by spell and 
        hopefully provide enough information that, after reading this, you'll 
        be able to move freely around Norrath.
      <h2>Land Travel</h2>
      <p>Land Travel is the most common method of getting anywhere within the 
        game. It is also about the least desirable, since it takes quite a bit 
        of time to get from point A to point B within the game. There are several 
        methods by which people speed up land travel however, which I will describe.
      <p>By far the most popular method is the spell Spirit of Wolf, commonly 
        called a SOW. This spell can be cast by shamans at level 9, by druids 
        at level 14, and by rangers when they hit level 30, and can be cast on 
        anyone. The higher level the caster is, the faster the spell allows you 
        to move. This spell increases your run speed significantly (by a third 
        to a half) and enables you to move quickly over land. Most monsters can't 
        outrun you if you have SOW on you, although be aware that certain high-level 
        ones can (like named Griffins and some giants), and that other creatures 
        can snare or root you as well. Occasionally you will even find creatures 
        that cast SOW on themselves (the ogres in WK are notorious for this) and 
        can catch you that way. The spell lasts around 35 minutes. Shamans have 
        the ability to make potions that can be purchased that will cast SOW on 
        the user as well. These come in single-use, 5- and 10-shot versions.
      <p>There is an upgrade to SOW called Scale of Wolf. This can be cast by 
        shamans at level 24 and druids at level 29, and can only be cast on people 
        in your group. The movement rate given by this spell is much higher than 
        SOW (around half to two-thirds increase) however the spell vanishes if 
        you engage in melee or cast any spells. This limits its use, and many 
        people rarely use this spell except when travelling through safe territory. 
        This spell lasts around 45 minutes otherwise. 
      <p>Druids and rangers also get the ability to cast wolf form on themselves 
        and those in their group. Druids get this spell at level 24 for themselves 
        and at level 39 for their group, rangers at level 49 for themselves. This 
        allows them to move slightly faster than SOW. The downside is that they 
        go away (like all other illusions) upon zoning.
      <p>There is a spell that is occasionally useful to move quickly in short 
        bursts, which is the Spirit of Cheetah. Shamans and Druids both get this 
        spell at level 24, and is self-only. This increases your run speed by 
        double, but only lasts 48 seconds and overwrites any other speed spell 
        you have. It is used for quick getaways exclusively.
      <p>Bards also get two songs that help people to move more quickly. The first 
        and most common one is Selo's Accelerando, which bards get at level 5. 
        The speed increase varies widely depending on what percussion instrument 
        (if any) the bard is using and the level of the bard, but at higher levels 
        is faster than SOW. The spell only effects people in the same group and 
        within a certain distance from the bard singing the song. Selo's Song 
        of Travel is a much more powerful version of Selo's Accelerando, and is 
        the level 51 bard song. This song gives faster movement, invisibility, 
        see invisibility, and levitate to all those in the bard's group.
      <p>There is an item that increases speed if you don't have the option of 
        using one of the above called the Journeyman's Boots, or more commonly 
        JBoots. This item is obtained through a <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=28">quest</a> 
        only and cannot be purchased. By right-clicking on the item, the person 
        with the item gets a speed boost that is a little slower than a SOW, but 
        is still useful. Also, Watchman Boots have charges of SOW in them, and 
        one of the Shaman Epic Quest boots that you get along the way, Black Fur 
        Boots, have a SOW-like effect on them as well.
      <p>All of the above abilities to move faster are only usable in &quot;outdoors&quot; 
        areas. This includes all outside zones and the ones labelled &quot;Outdoor&quot; 
        in the zone description.
      <p>By using one of the above methods to move more quickly over land, travel 
        on land is made much safer. The only other thing that you need to do is 
        to be sure to avoid creatures that will attack you. This is intuitively 
        obvious, but realize that even if a monster can't outrun you, they can 
        still stun you and keep hitting you and, if they do enough damage while 
        you're running away, you will start losing stats and become encumbered, 
        thereby slowing you down enough that you can't outrun them at all. Keep 
        your eyes on where you're going. 
      <p>Another thing to be careful of, especially when using a way to speed 
        up movement, is rough terrain. Moving quickly on broken ground or over 
        mountainous terrain will result in some serious falls for you and some 
        really serious damage. Having a spell like levitate can help out in those 
        areas. An even better spell is the spell Dead Man Floating, which necromancers 
        get at level 44. This lasts much longer than levitate and also adds some 
        other nice bonuses.
      <p>Another thing that is important is knowing where you are going and what 
        to expect. I recommend to look at the zone connection maps to figure out 
        what zones you will be passing through to get to where you're headed, 
        and then go to those zone guides and read about what dangers you might 
        face, as well as to get a map and see how to get around that zone.
