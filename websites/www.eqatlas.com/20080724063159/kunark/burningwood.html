      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Burning Wood was an ancient, beautiful forest. Now, however, its 
        surface has been scarred by the fiery meteors that have stricken this 
        area in the recent centuries, leaving its surface marred and aflame.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The Burning Wood is like many of the outdoor areas in Kunark, a vast 
        open area that is crisscrossed by many wandering monsters. Most of the 
        outer edges of the area are fairly heavily forested and hilly, making 
        visibility of these monsters even worse, and given that they will frequently 
        travel and even spawn on the edges of the zone, makes hunting the zone 
        edges more dangerous than elsewhere.
      <p>The center area, although more open, is not without its dangers. Since 
        much of the center area is more blasted and ablaze, many wurms and undead, 
        as well as the apes, can be seen wandering this area. Pretty much every 
        monster in this zone is aggressive to everyone, although invisibility 
        works on some of them as well. Hunting in the center requires that you 
        keep your eyes open.
      <p>The other big danger in the zone is the huge craters. These are a danger 
        if you are travelling quickly through this zone, because they are very 
        deep and steep, and cresting a hill to have the ground open beneath you 
        at top speed can be gut-wrenching at best. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This is one of the few outdoor zones where hunting in the middle of the 
        zone may be preferable to clinging to the walls and pulling there. In 
        a group with people that can watch around and make sure monsters aren't 
        inbound and casters who are on their toes, the more clear areas of the 
        zone make good hunting, with a steady supply of monsters with a pretty 
        consistent level and can provide good experience.
      <p>There are only a couple of areas with static spawns in the zone, and 
        these are the sarnak fortress to the northeast, the forest giant town 
        over the crater, and the hornet's nest in the southwest. Also, a couple 
        of the ruins have monsters that appear in them regularly. These, again, 
        can be hunted fairly easily by a good group.
      <p>Many of the monsters in this zone have specific weaknesses that can be 
        exploited by a class designed to take advantage of them. Many monsters, 
        including the apes and gorillas, are considered to be undead, and are 
        affected by those spells. 
      <p>Also, many of the higher level monsters in this zone have random spell 
        drops as loot, so it's a good place to hunt for spells as well.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>B</font>urning <font size=+2>W</font>ood</h3>
      <p>Burning Wood can be reached through several zones. The zone into the 
        Dreadlands is located at approximately -3500, -800. In the Dreadlands 
        this zone is at approximately 2500, -1000.
      <p>The Skyfire Mountains can be reached by zoning at approximately 4000, 
        1500. Unknown what is loc of zone in the Skyfire Mountains.
      <p>The Frontier Mountains can be reached at approximately -2800, -4625, 
        which is in a tunnel. In the Frontier Mountains this corresponds to location 
        (at the end of the tunnel) of -2580, 3760.
      <p>Chardok can be reached through the evil lizard castle at approximately 
        5900, -3800. The zone entrance is not the same as the exit, which you 
        can reach by travelling left into Chardok and will return to Burning Wood.
