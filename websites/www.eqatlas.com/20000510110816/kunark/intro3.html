      <h2 align: left align="center">The Ruins of Kunark - What's New?</h2>
      <h4>What's New in Kunark</h4>
      <p><b>The zones:</b> The new zones in Kunark are all massive. This is the 
        first thing I noticed when I was playing the game. Even with my adventurous 
        spirit, it was about a week into the game when I finally was able to walk 
        all the way around a zone (it was Warsliks Woods), and it took me over 
        an hour to do so. I wasn't even mapping, just looking. According to grid 
        coordinates, each of the outside zones is at least the size of Western 
        Plains of Karana from the original, although they feel much larger and 
        more in-depth.</p>
      <p>The zones have a lot more detail and depth to them then the original 
        zones do. There are little &quot;subzones&quot; in each zone, which are 
        small areas, either lairs of monsters or small catacombs, that exist within 
        the larger zone. These are usually tunnels underneath the zone (or at 
        least the ones I've found are). These usually involve something completely 
        separate from the zone above, and I think some of the ones I went into 
        were not populated yet.</p>
      <p>The zones also line up logically. This may be a geek mapping pet peeve 
        that I've had for a long time, where all these supposedly contiguous areas 
        have dimensions that don't make sense with each other and simply don't 
        line up, but in the expansion they do. It goes so far as, if you're in 
        Cabilis and you zone from west to east, your /loc in both is the same. 
        Very impressive...</p>
      <p><b>The gameplay:</b> The gameplay from one perspective isn't changed 
        at all. By this I mean that nothing has changed about grouping or anything 
        that would seriously affect how you play the game. There are some minor, 
        helpful tweaks that they have put in in preparation for the expansions 
        release that are nice. Many of these consist of fixing prior glitches 
        or interface problems. For instance, barbarians can now have shields (they 
        always could, they just wouldn't show up as wearing them). The interface 
        is more useful in that I can drop armor on my image on the right in the 
        inventory screen and it pops onto my character (this may have been there 
        before, but I never noticed it). The more significant changes I will outline 
        below. </p>
      <p><b>Quests:</b> Quests are pretty much of the same type as they were in 
        the old days - go get me this and bring it back to me. What has changed 
        (that I've noticed) is that the quests have become more class restricted 
        and also more dependent on the trade skills. The <b>class restrictions</b> 
        occur because most of the quests involve you handing in some item that 
        you got when you started the game. The <b>trade dependency</b> is kind 
        of disturbing, since it seems like a heavy-handed attempt to make people 
        value trade skills. What this means is that, in order to do a certain 
        quest, you will have to perform some sort of trade action on it. As an 
        example, one of the early necromancer quests involves using a sewing kit 
        to mend a tapestry (which you then turn in with a necro item to get the 
        next item). One of the other non-class restricted quests I've seen requires 
        both blacksmithing and cooking (at least) to complete. Apparently the 
        reward is quite good, but at what cost?</p>
      <p><b>Items:</b> Being only 9th level, my main character hasn't had the 
        opportunity to find many new items. What he did find were many new sorts 
        of items sold by vendors that should make everyone's life better. First 
        and foremost is that now you can purchase inexpensive newbie-class weapons 
        of the various types to use. These are better than the rusty weapons we 
        all grew up using, and are very inexpensive (e.g. the 1H blunt weapon 
        cost about 3 gold). This makes a nice step between the rusty weapons and 
        regular weapons, which cost several platinum each.</p>
      <p>Kunark is also a vast area. There are new survival-oriented equipment, 
        including items that supposedly allow you to decant water and food while 
        in the vast territories. While the iksar get foraging, many others don't 
        and I think these items will help a great deal (although I haven't been 
        able to afford one yet). There are also several new types of armor that 
        you can buy, although they don't seem to have many advantages over the 
        old types (which are also sold), at least as far as I've seen.</p>
      <p><b>Monsters:</b> The monsters in the expansion are much more powerful. 
        The expansion was definitely designed with higher level characters in 
        mind. My character (only 9th level) can only run about 3 minutes into 
        any zone before everything around him is tombstone to him. I wouldn't 
        recommend bringing any character over here from the main continent until 
        they are at least mid-teens, because you will likely find nothing to hunt, 
        and everything you do is very near areas patrolled by the Iksar.</p>
      <p><b>The Iksar:</b> Last but not least are the Iksar themselves. The Iksar 
        are a reptilian race with many benefits to start out with. They have ultravision 
        (I think), which means they can see in the dark passably well. They start 
        out with a swimming skill of 100, with no cap that I've seen so far (my 
        character is over 140 currently). They can be either Necromancers, Shadow 
        Knights, Shamans, Warriors, or Monks. They get the ability to Forage, 
        almost a necessity in this vast area. And they are possibly the only race 
        that is truly safe in their home town of Cabilis.</p>
      <p>Above are the details on what you can look forward to in the expansion...</p>
