      <h3>for Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves, Iksar, and other sociopaths...</h3>
      <p>So, you've gone ahead and hit "Start" on the character creation screen 
        that tells you "Moderate/High Difficulty," have you? Well, you're going 
        to need my help then, because if you want to get any of the cool stuff 
        in the game (and I'm sure you do) you're going to have to travel. Although 
        Verant blessed the Trolls by putting the most goodie-filled dungeon on 
        their doorstep (Guk), you all will still want to travel elsewhere in order 
        to see more of the world. This guide will go through some of the more 
        problematic areas that you might have to travel through and tell you how 
        to not die... 
      <h2>Religion</h2>
      <p>Religion makes a large difference about whether or not a dark race is 
        attacked. This is especially true for dark elves, who are generally accepted 
        (if not liked) in a few major cities. Choosing Agnostic for your religion 
        helps, as many won't attack you based on race but instead based on your 
        religion. This is apparent with DE Enchanters, who can illusion their 
        appearance but still be KOS from their religion. Something to consider. 
        Religion is separate from faction when determining how others consider 
        you. </p>
      <h2>Faction</h2>
      <p>This is the only place on the site where I'll mention faction, and then 
        only in general terms. Faction is the term given to your relative standing 
        with certain groups (factions) within the game. For instance, there is 
        a faction associated with the Freeport guards. This faction is different 
        from that associated with the merchants in Freeport, the paladins in Freeport, 
        and the evil classes underneath the city, for example. Some of these factions 
        are also in opposition to other factions, which means that if you get 
        some positive faction with one of them, you will likely lose faction with 
        another of them. There may be ways to raise or lower one without affecting 
        the others, but more often than not their aren't.
      <p>What this means is several things. Since everyone starts out with some 
        basic faction values for all the factions based on race and class, you 
        may be limited to where you can go. An ogre, for instance, starts out 
        with bad faction with the Freeport guards, but good faction underneath 
        the city. This faction can be changed, however, through your actions during 
        the game. Killing orcs in the Commonlands raises faction with the guards 
        of Freeport, for instance, so an ogre might, one day, be able to walk 
        through Freeport freely. The downside is that you lose faction with your 
        brethren underneath the city, who will learn to dislike you. Certain things 
        can't be overcome, either, so an ogre shadowknight is likely going to 
        worship some evil god, and since religion is an independent factor in 
        how others consider you, you could kill orcs til they were all dead by 
        your hand, and still be hated in Freeport because of your religion. This 
        is important to know so that you don't waste your time trying to fix faction 
        that can't be fixed.
      <p>Another good (and relevant) example of faction occurs in Kunark with 
        Venril Sathir faction. This faction is what the merchants in the evil 
        Outpost in Overthere base their considerations on. However, there are 
        many places in Kunark where you could fight monsters (notably ogres in 
        Timourous Deep, and several high-level dungeons like Karnor's Castle) 
        and get negative Venril Sathir faction. Following the information above, 
        this will, over time, make you KOS in the evil Outpost, and doesn't really 
        give you any corresponding good faction anywhere else. This faction is 
        also very difficult to raise, so you need to be careful.
      <p>That's all I'll say on faction. It's a very complex topic that I couldn't 
        hope to explain well, and that you'll have to just pay attention to. Keep 
        an eye on the factions you get with each kill and see if they make sense. 
        If you're an iksar, and you lose faction with Cabilis, you might want 
        to hunt elsewhere...
      <h2>Freeport</h2>
      <p>Freeport is probably the most frequently travelled city by the dark races. 
        It is the port by which they all have to use to reach the island continent 
        of Faydwer. It also lies between the Dark Elf city of Neriak and the swamplands 
        to the south where the Trolls and Ogres reside. Due to its importance 
        to the evil races in general, I will discuss it first. 
      <h3>The Tunnels</h3>
      <p>There is an extensive tunnel network running beneath the city of Freeport, 
        which the dark races and less-than-legal classes use to get around. These 
        tunnels start (from the outside) in both West Freeport and East Freeport. 
        The path through West Freeport is the simplest. The entrance to the catacombs 
        lies in the northeastern corner of the newbie area in the West Freeport 
        zone. One of the two bends in the corner is where the actual tunnel is, 
        and it is not distinguishable from the rest of the wall. The tunnels inside 
        represent the remains of a water system that is empty at present. The 
        key to getting to any area of interest is to stay to the left. If you 
        take every left turn in the West Freeport zone, you will eventually zone 
        into North Freeport. 
      <p>Once there, you will find yourself with your first danger, having to 
        travel an open waterway underneath the paladin guild! The trick to this 
        is that you have to travel through here at night time. During that time 
        of day, all the guards that typically stand on the bridge that goes over 
        the water are gone, and you won't be attacked. After passing into the 
        tunnel on the other side, you again zone into West Freeport. In West Freeport 
        again, you turn first right and then left, and this brings you out into 
        a long, open-topped aqueduct running through a fairly empty section of 
        the city. Specifically, it opens up behind Torlig's Herbs and Medicines, 
        on the eastern edge of West Freeport just north of a zone to East Freeport. 
        This is a dangerous area for evil races, although guards are not too common 
        here. The zone to East Freeport is a short step away, but guarded by a 
        guard (and you can't get anywhere on the other side except through guards 
        anyway). The only place you can really go is to head into the court with 
        the empty stage and the shady thief guys in the middle. They are involved 
        in some quests. This is as far as the tunnels into West Freeport will 
        bring you. 
      <p>East Freeport has some more important places of interest in the tunnel 
        system. There are two entrances to it from the newbie zone, the easiest 
        one to take is in the southwestern corner of the newbie zone, found in 
        a similar fashion to the entrance in West Freeport. Passing into this 
        tunnel entrance you will enter a small circular room with two exits leading 
        off of it. The tunnel to the left leads to the other entrance to the catacombs 
        and an interesting underwater structure, but nothing more. To the right 
        leads to the other interesting parts of the city. Passing through this 
        tunnel, you will come to a choice about going left or right. Left will 
        lead the explorer to the Necromancer, Shadow Knight, and Cleric trainers 
        for Freeport, and beyond them to a secret door that leads into the inn 
        in the southeastern section of East Freeport. Taking the right path brings 
        you to a door guarded by two Rogues. To the left of the door is a passage 
        that leads to a room with a dark elf and another door into the Seafarer's 
        Roost at the docks of East Freeport. If you pass through the door behind 
        the two Rogue guards, there is a long tunnel that leads to an opening 
        into the bay, whereby you can swim to the left to reach the actual Freeport 
        docks. 
      <p>The docks of Freeport are usually safe, as long as you stay outside of 
        the Port Authority. There are a bunch of guards on the other side of the 
        Port Authority, and I haven't tested whether or not they can see you. 
        On the dock side of it, though, there are no NPC's (that I know of) that 
        will attack you. I have on rare occasions seen a guard standing on the 
        main dock, but only rarely. There are also reports of a fishing woman 
        that will occasionally attack evil travellers... 
      <h2>Qeynos</h2>
      Qeynos is not traditionally regarded as a place for evil, and isn't as heavily 
      trafficked, but has a similar infrastructure to Freeport, with an extensive 
      underground network of tunnels tieing the city together. 
      <p>The outside entrance to the Qeynos tunnels lies to the east of the Gates 
        in North Qeynos. Along the wall there is a section of wall that is overgrown 
        with vines. This is a false wall, and behind this wall lies a small room 
        with a well, where the Klicknik Queen is known to spawn. Swimming down 
        the well will bring one into the Catacombs of Qeynos. There are other 
        entrances/exits to the catacombs within the city, providing evil creatures 
        some degree of mobility. The lake just outside the Crow's Nest and the 
        Monk's Guild has a tunnel into the catacombs, as does the water under 
        the bridge just before one enters the section of town with the bank. The 
        last normal entrance is in the water by the docks where the boat comes 
        in. All of these tunnels lead into the catacombs, and through the catacombs 
        eventually connect with each other. 
      <p>The other, more unusual, entrance to the catacombs is through the arena. 
        When entering the arena, one wall has an opening that leads into the area 
        under the arena, where blood and bones mark those that died within those 
        walls. Marked out in bones is a path that leads into one of the larger 
        prison cages and to a secret door that leads into the catacombs. The catacombs 
        at this point are dangerous to those who are not of the evil races or 
        classes, as they are guarded by skeletons. In this area lie the Shadow 
        Knight and Necromancer guilds for the city of Qeynos, as well as trainers 
        for the other magic-using classes for evil races. 
      <h2>Faydwer</h2>
      <p>Half of the battle to reaching Faydwer is in getting onto the boat at 
        Freeport. But what do you do when you reach the other side? You basically 
        have to jump ship and swim for shore outside of the dock area. If you 
        have to pick a side, go to the right, as there is more open area there 
        and it's easier to get around. Going to the left forces you to walk past 
        several guard houses in order to reach some of the better parts of Butcherblock, 
        and this can easily be avoided. 
      <p>As far as zones on Faydwer, they present their unique challenges and 
        benefits for the dark races. Butcherblock is a large, open hunting ground, 
        with the benefits of no roaming guards. Greater Faydark is the hub of 
        all the other zones, and is good because you can be bound anywhere within 
        the zone (not in a hostile city). The down side is that most of the areas 
        near the cities as well as near Crushbone have roaming guards that will 
        attack you. The entrance to Crushbone is generally safe, as is the area 
        to Lesser Faydark. Lesser Faydark is generally safe, with a few exceptions 
        (the ranger camp). Steamfont Mountains are similar to Butcherblock, scattered 
        relatively easily avoidable non-moving guards. The downside to all these 
        zones is that most if not all people are hostile to you, and buying and 
        selling may well be impossible. 
      <p>The next trick is how do you get home? If you are travelling by boat, 
        that can be fairly tricky. You basically have to swim around the entrance 
        to the docks and get on the docks onto the boat without being seen and 
        attacked. The NPC at the end of the dock will not attack you, but the 
        one near the base of the dock will, although he can be avoided. The method 
        that I've heard about (note I've never actually tested this myself) is 
        that the dark races can swim in the water in front of the boat and wait 
        until it passes over them. They then are somehow sucked up into the hold 
        of the boat and can avoid all that fighting at the dock. Again, I haven't 
        tested out either of these to see if they work or not, I have, however, 
        been assured by many people after first posting this that this works just 
        fine. The most reliable? Find (or pay) a friend to teleport you. 
      <h2>Cross-Country Trip</h2>
      <p>The trip from Freeport to Qeynos is dangerous even for the good races, 
        and the problems are exacerbated for the evil races. First of all, there 
        is no easy way through the center of the continent. The passage through 
        Beholder's Maze, Runnyeye, Misty Thicket and Rivervale is complicated 
        by the fact that all evils are KOS in Rivervale. Likewise, passage through 
        High Keep is complicated by the same problem, as well as the high level 
        orcs and gnolls that are there. The safest route (and unfortunately the 
        longest) is the southern route through the kingdom of the ogres. Basically, 
        from Qeynos, the route consists of travelling into Qeynos Hills, Western 
        Karana, Northern Karana, Southern Karana, Lake Rathetear, Rathe Mountains, 
        Feerrott, Innothule Swamp, South Ro, Oasis of Marr, North Ro and from 
        there East Freeport. The most difficult of these is Lake Rathetear where 
        you need to avoid a fairly high-level camp of undead upon entering from 
        South Karana and then get on a boat (or swim with more danger) to the 
        eastern shore. 
      <h2>Odus</h2>
      <p>The continent of Odus is currently (effectively) closed to the evil races. 
        I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but it currently is. The 
        basic difficulty is that there is no tunnel system or other system by 
        which to avoid the guards when entering and going through Erudin. The 
        docks pass by several guards, then you zone into a chamber patrolled by 
        several guards, and then into the main city where guards are ever-present, 
        only to walk outside by the guards. As you can see there is no way to 
        avoid them, and as far as I know you can't swim around to Kerra Isle, 
        for instance. Erud's Crossing is still a possibility to hunt at, although 
        it's so difficult to get to for the evil races (and the Kerrans might 
        KOS them), that it's probably not worth it. 
      <p>For evils stuck in Paineel who want a way out, you have three options. 
        First is to trust your invisibility and go through Erudin to the dock, 
        stay invisible through Qeynos and eventually you'll escape. Second is 
        to get a teleport out of there. Lastly, you can use the Nexus Scion at 
        the wizard rings in Toxxulia Forest to take you to Luclin, from which 
        you can go anywhere else.
      <h2>Kunark</h2>
      <p>Kunark is the last continent to still pay attention to the old world 
        factions (see below for Velious and Luclin for what that statement means). 
        The newest area in Kunark (and one that introduces a new &quot;Dark Race&quot; 
        for discussion here) is Cabilis.
      <p>The iksar are unique in their ability to travel around. Basically, they 
        can't. Iksar are hated in every single area of the old world and Kunark 
        except where there are other Iksar. This has to do with the storyline 
        of Kunark, but basically the Iksar are despised. If you play an Iksar, 
        you have no friends in the old world. Cabilis is your home. Other evil 
        races are as hated in Cabilis as Iksar are hated elsewhere, so don't think 
        they are your new friends. Cabilis is iksar-only. You can increase your 
        faction, however, to the point where you can travel in and out of those 
        cities (especially Freeport but also some of Qeynos). This takes a great 
        deal of time, and I won't describe the process here, but it can be done 
        if you are exceedingly patient.
      <p>The easiest way for evils to get to and from the continent is by using 
        the shuttle through Timourous Deep from Oasis of Marr. This is very convenient, 
        since it takes off from a neutral shore close to the home towns of the 
        evils, and deposits you (eventually) in the evil Outpost in Overthere, 
        where you are free to shop or do whatever you want. You can also get there 
        on the shuttle designed for good races to Firiona Vie, but this is much 
        more dangerous. Basically you get on the barges in Butcherblock, and take 
        them out to the ship in Timourous Deep. You board that ship and take it 
        to Kunark, being sure to not get off when it stops in Timourous Deep. 
        You then need to jump ship and swim ashore outside of the docks in FV. 
        It is possible to go invisible through the town, but needlessly dangerous. 
        If you can't bind yourself, you can bind in Frontier Mountains.
      <h2>Velious</h2>
      <p>Velious was the first expansion that was race/class neutral. What this 
        means is that any old race or class could travel here and be as liked/hated 
        as any other race or class. The ship to the continent takes off from North 
        Ro in a safe area on the shore, and is guarded by neutral gnomes. The 
        main city is Thurgadin, which is again neutral to all. In Velious, faction 
        is everything, and you are liked/hated based on your faction and not based 
        on race or class, and everyone's faction starts out neutral. Not much 
        else to say on that. This is all because the beings on Velious have essentially 
        no history with any outsiders, so haven't learned to hate or love them.
      <h2>Luclin</h2>
      <p>Luclin is also (mostly) a race/class neutral expansion. The easiest parts 
        of Luclin to reach are completely race and class neutral and you can travel 
        as freely as on Velious. The only areas on Luclin that is not kind to 
        outsiders is Sanctus Seru. The guards of Sanctus Seru start out anywhere 
        from actively disliking evils to actively attacking them within the city 
        itself, and actually one particular guard attacks just about anyone, evil 
        or not. This is again based on the history of the place, where Sanctus 
        Seru was a very righteous faction of the Combine Empire that tried to 
        assassinate their ruler because he wanted to let dark elves into the Empire. 
        Thus, they dislike dark elves and all others evil. Katta Castellum is 
        the half of the Empire that wanted dark elves in, so they are a bit nicer 
        to evils, and won't simply kill you because of your race (I don't think). 
        However, bad religion will make you KOS in Katta, so if you worship an 
        evil god (you know who you are) you will be hated here as well. Your only 
        safe place will likely be Shadow Haven then.
      <p>With Luclin came evils' best friend -- The Nexus. Basically, anywhere 
        you are, you can travel safely to any other place throughout any of the 
        realms by use of the Nexus, including hard to reach places like Odus and 
        Faydwer. This is also helpful to everyone, since you are never forced 
        to wait for a port or the boat to get from place to place, just run to 
        your neighborhood Nexus Scion and be on your way.
      <p> 
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The above is a description of the major sections of the game and how 
        the evil races can thrive and travel almost as much as the good races. 
        Note that many of these problems can be circumvented by invisibility spells 
        (in fact Odus is open to you if you can become invisible) and illusions. 
        For the most part, though, these areas are open to the dark races as I've 
        put forth above. I hope this means I'll see more ogres in Crushbone!</p>
