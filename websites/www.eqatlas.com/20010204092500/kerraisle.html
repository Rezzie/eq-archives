      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      Kerra Island is a small island that lies just off the west coast of Odus. 
      This island's main inhabitants are the Kerrans, a race of catlike people 
      who are peaceful until you make enemies of them. The island in Erud's Crossing 
      is often mistakingly referred to as Kerra Island, but it is not. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      <p>** Note that the following description has not yet been updated since 
        the recent patch. The zone levels listed above are more accurate. **</p>
      <p>This island's main danger is the Kerrans, who, as mentioned above, will 
        generally leave you alone until you start killing their kindred. Then 
        this place becomes rather scary. </p>
      <p>At lower levels, the front of the zone is much like the front of Crushbone, 
        lower level spawns that are generally separate from each other so that 
        you can handle them one at a time. At higher levels (around 10th) you 
        will definitely need to move further into the island to find Kerrans that 
        are worth hunting, and this is dangerous. The most dangerous part of it 
        is that the Kerrans in the open areas all roam around their area and are 
        very close together. For instance, the area by the docks has approximately 
        20 Kerrans all within plain view, and (although I didn't try this myself) 
        they are close enough together that I think hitting one would bring them 
        all on you. The other open area is almost as bad (and higher level too). 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This is another dungeon that is relatively untouched, therefore making it 
      good hunting without much competition. This is probably in large part due 
      to the fact that few people know or care to go there and check it out (I 
      myself played an Erudite for most of the beta and never stepped foot on 
      the island). It is also kind of far away for most of the characters, including 
      Erudites, who by the time they're ready for this are bound to Qeynos. The 
      only other problem that I can foresee with this area is that there is a 
      large jump in difficulty from the front spawn spots to the ones further 
      in. The tunnels provide some separate Kerrans to hunt, but the larger areas 
      are just scary. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>erra <font size=+2>I</font>sland</h3>
      There is only one way in and out of the island, and it is through the tunnel 
      on the east side of the bridge that spans the river. This leads to the narrow 
      strip of water that separates Kerra Isle from Odus, a strip small enough 
      that it can be swum with ease. Only low-level adventurers need fear the 
      swim, as there are occasional giant pirhana that swim the waters. </td>
