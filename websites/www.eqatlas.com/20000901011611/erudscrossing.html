      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      Erud's Crossing is the name of the zone which the ferry from Qeynos to Erudin 
      passes through, and it marks the path that Erud himself travelled on his 
      way to the island of Odus centuries ago. Erud's Crossing's only feature 
      is an island that marks the halfway point of the trip, and it is a most 
      unique island, with its own ecosystem of unique creatures. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      This island is a very dangerous zone for several reasons.&nbsp; First of 
      all, there is practically no escape from enemies if you run into trouble 
      and are overwhelmed.&nbsp; There is no zone edge that anyone can easily 
      swim to, and no guards to protect you.&nbsp; It is even impossible to flee 
      into the water when chased, because most monsters will chase you there as 
      well. 
      <p>Secondly, the ecosystem of the island is quite variable and the monsters 
        have an intricate relationship.&nbsp; The following information is mostly 
        secondhand, but reliable as far as what happens on the island.&nbsp; First 
        of all the island is very small, so it is not uncommon to have monsters 
        of the same type as the one you're fighting wander by and join in.&nbsp; 
        All monsters will join with others of their type.&nbsp; Secondly, many 
        of the monsters are intertwined in their relationships, the most complex 
        being the beetles and spiders.&nbsp; The Kerra Isle Beetles are well-liked 
        by the Kerrans who hang out by the dock.&nbsp; As such, killing the beetles 
        can make getting on and off the island difficult, as these Kerrans will 
        begin to hate you and are also among the most powerful monsters here.&nbsp; 
        Also, killing the beetles can result in the spawning of Island Madmen 
        by the docks, some of whom are extremely dangerous spellcasters and all 
        of whom are powerful and aggressive. They can also cause Fire Elementals 
        to spawn in the volcano, which are aggressive and high level. These have 
        also been known to swarm the island.&nbsp; The spiders represent a different 
        problem, and that is that they all seem to know what is going on elsewhere 
        on the island.&nbsp; Attacking one is a quick way to draw others to you, 
        and there are rumors that the entire island's population of spiders has 
        occasionally swarmed an attacker. 
      <p>The other danger is, as mentioned above, the unpredictability of the 
        spawn rates.&nbsp; For instance, the zombie sailors generally spawn at 
        a regular rate and can provide good hunting.&nbsp; There are rumors that, 
        however, there are occasions when the zombie sailors spawn en masse and 
        swarm the island.&nbsp; Skeleton sailors occasionally spawn in their place, 
        and are much tougher. The other problem with the island in general is 
        that you must be very aware of how small it is and how easily it is for 
        others to join in on the fight.&nbsp; This was mentioned before, but needs 
        to be emphasized.&nbsp; You should not come here to hunt evens and upper 
        hands solo, you will assuredly die at some point because another will 
        join in.&nbsp; This happens with all the monsters, not just those specifically 
        mentioned above. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      Despite the above dangers, this island can be a great deal of fun to hunt 
      in.&nbsp; The danger makes it very exciting, and there is a great deal of 
      strategy to hunting without being swarmed.&nbsp; The island is also generally 
      not very heavily hunted, and has a good variety of creatures, although people 
      generally come to hunt the wisps that frequently spawn and the zombie sailors 
      because of their rawhide armor and for quests out of Qeynos. 
      <p>There is also a strong sense of comraderie among the people on the island.&nbsp; 
        Basically, one person killing the wrong monster or starting the wrong 
        train can result in the death or near-death of virtually every person 
        on the island, so there is a willingness to help out here that you rarely 
        see elsewhere.&nbsp; The smallness of the island makes you feel like you 
        are in your own little world, with only the occasional boat to take you 
        to safety. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>E</font>rud's <font size=+2>C</font>rossing</h3>
      Erud's Crossing can only be reached via the ferry that runs from Qeynos 
      to Erudin.&nbsp; When coming from Qeynos, the ferry runs along the shore 
      for quite some time before actually reaching the docks, so many impatient 
      adventurers jump ship and swim for shore.&nbsp; This also helps you to avoid 
      the Kerrans at the docks.&nbsp; When on the boat from Erudin to Qeynos, 
      the boat passes far north of the island, but if you are an able swimmer 
      you could jump ship and make it to the island. Catching the boat to Qeynos 
      this way, however, is significantly more difficult.</td>
