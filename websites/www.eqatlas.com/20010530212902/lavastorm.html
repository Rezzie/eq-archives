      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Lavastorm Mountains are a relatively small, but very difficult and 
        dangerous zone to travel through. It is similar to Dagnor's Cauldron, 
        in that some cataclysm has wrecked the terrain within it, here being obviously 
        volcanic in nature. There are many lava pits throughout the zone, and 
        shattered rocks stick up from the ground. A massive lava pit, known as 
        Solusek's Eye, lies in the center along the northern edge of this shattered 
        land. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Lavastorm is a good stepping stone for hunting through the teens, as 
        it is filled with monsters at those levels.. There is no monster here 
        than can be attacked by someone of less than 12th level or so (although 
        some people with pets can do so), while adventurers 16th-18th will be 
        able to hunt well, and higher level adventurers will be hard pressed to 
        find anything to occupy themselves. The main dangers are the creatures 
        within the zone. Of all the creatures above, only a handful are aggressive, 
        and that includes the goblins, the fire elementals, the fire imp, and 
        the shadowed men. Of these, the ones that are extraordinarily dangerous 
        are the fire imp and the shadowed men. The fire imp is one of those monsters 
        that /con's much lower than they actually are. Fighting a green aggressive 
        one at level 17 as a ranger with both fire and magic protection over 50%, 
        I was killed rather easily because this creature casts a rather powerful 
        fire-based spell throughout battle. The shadowed men are a special case, 
        as they come in a rather large group and don't wander, and are well-known 
        to be both fast on the ground and lethal in combat, regularly tearing 
        apart larger groups of more powerful characters. They are also approximately 
        30th level, which makes them the most powerful creatures in the zone to 
        date. 
      <p>The other danger is the terrain itself. The harsh rock outcroppings and 
        ravines can hide drops that will cause you damage (especially if taken 
        quickly), pits of lava, or aggressive monsters. Travelling slowly and 
        with care, or quickly with levitate, are the safest ways to get through 
        the zone. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>As a ranger who prefers to hunt outdoors, I enjoy hunting in this zone 
        to most of the dungeons around. The monsters are relatively scattered 
        so you can control exactly what you fight. All of the creatures spawn 
        items that are worth a fair amount of money. They are all also extremely 
        cool creatures, nowhere else can you hear the sounds of the rock dervish 
        as its many rocks slam into your armor in rapid unison, or hunt the manner 
        of creatures that are seen here. 
      <p>There are some more practical benefits to hunting in the zone as well. 
        The good races can sell at the gypsies located along the west wall, and 
        the evil races (dark elves at least) can sell to the druid merchant at 
        the druid ring in the northwest corner (don't ask me why that makes sense). 
        Also, there are many higher level druid spells for sale there. There are 
        *four* dungeons accessible from this zone, making it a crossroads of higher 
        level characters to and from hunting grounds within the various dungeons. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>L</font>avastorm</h3>
      <p>Lavastorm can be reached from the south by trekking through the Nektulos 
        Forest, home to the dark elves. Exits to Najena lie in the southeast corner 
        of the zone, behind a massive set of shattered doors. Entrances to Solusek's 
        Eye A and B lie along the southern edge of Solusek's Eye, and the Temple 
        of Solusek Ro lies along its northern edge.
