        <p align="left"><b>READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.</b></p>
        <p align="left"><b>THESE MAPS ARE
              NOT USED IN-GAME BY THE CARTOGRAPHY SYSTEM.</b></p>
        <p align="left">The Muse's Maps PDF is a 244-page PDF document (10
          MB in size when zipped) that contains all the original maps from the
          EQ 
          Atlas web site. To purchase this PDF, click on the link below.</p>
        <p align="left">Muse's Maps includes maps and map descriptions for most 
          zones. The maps that are not included are: 1) zones for which there 
          is no map on the EQ Atlas website, and 2) zones for which the maps were 
          not created by EQ Atlas and are included on the website with permission 
          of the creator. Basically, any map that is currently a color map in 
          the &quot;standard style&quot; is included in the PDF.</p>
        <p align="left">To see a sample map in the &quot;standard style,&quot; 
          check out this <a href="akanondemo.pdf"><b>Ak'Anon Demo PDF</b></a> 
          that is right out of the Muse's Maps PDF for a sample of what's included.</p>
        <p align="left">What's not included: As stated above, no maps that were 
          not made by EQ Atlas are included, nor are maps that are not on EQ Atlas 
          (obviously). Also, the textual descriptions of each zone as well as 
          the individual guides are not included. It's purely maps with their 
          associated legends.</p>
        <p align="left">Purchasing the PDF entitles you to any future updates
           to the PDF that are released for as long as it stays in production.
          
          These updates will not be as frequent as the web page, and will require
           a redownload of the PDF for those who have purchased it before. They
          
          will be provided in the form of coupons sent to the email address of
           the purchaser entered at the time of ordering for a repeat download.
          
          We provide no guarantee that there will be updates to this. <strong>Updated</strong>          (7/19/2003): Coupons turned out to not be feasible. Instead, simply
          redownload the file using the information provided in the email you
          originally received confirming your order. E-mail notifications will
          be sent out to everyone who asked for one to notify them of the update.
          I can not help you redownload the update if you do not either have
          your order number or your original email.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Note</b>: There will be a checkbox asking you if you 
          want to receive updates. You should check this box since I will be using 
          that to notify you of updates to the PDF. I will also announce it on 
          the website if you don't wish to do that. Updates will be provided by 
          coupons sent to the email address used in the original purchase. If 
          this email address becomes invalid, there is no way for us to update 
          this and make updates available to you. Please be aware of that when 
          entering an email address. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Piracy Notice</b>: Esellerate limits the number of 
          downloads of a file to prevent piracy. Each download counts against 
          your total, after which there will no more downloads. Each update will 
          add one to this limit so that you can get the update using the above-mentioned 
          coupon.</p>
        <p align="left">Reposting of this PDF will not be tolerated. All of these 
          maps are copyright 2002 by myself, and obtaining them through any means 
          other than the purchase link below is illegal. I normally give people 
          a warning if they post my maps, but there will be no warning if I see 
          the PDF up on some site. You may not like this policy, but then you 
          don't have to agree to these rules and purchase the PDF.</p>
