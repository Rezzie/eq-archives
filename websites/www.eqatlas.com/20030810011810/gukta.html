      <p><i>Grobb recently underwent a change in management, shall we say, and 
        the evil trolls were replaced by the much nicer Frogloks from Guk, after 
        which it was renamed Gukta. I can't say I'll miss the trolls, and now 
        I have fewer places I have to avoid like the plague...</i></p>
      <p align="right"><i>--Muse</i></p>
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Gukta, which in froglok means &quot;New Guk,&quot; is a very small compared 
        to some of the human towns on Antonica, and very utilitarian in its design. 
        The entrance from the vicious Innothule Swamp is heavily guarded by frogloks, 
        and the interior of the caverns are filled with their kind as well as 
        swamp species that they have tamed and trained. There are prisons for 
        their enemies, the trolls. Mud flows freely through their town, and they 
        seem not to mind.
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>The Innothule Swamp is a dark and dangerous place, even for the trolls 
        who roam it daily. The numerous small islands can quickly confuse and 
        lose a traveller, and roaming fungus men, kobolds, and much worse can 
        easily run down an outsider who hasn't learned the way around, or anybody 
        who hasn't learned how to swim. Adjacent to Innothule Swamp is the Feerrott, 
        another drier swamp area which is where the ogres have made their home. 
        There used to be a great deal of travel between the two races' home towns, 
        but now this has changed with the frogloks takeover. 
      <p>From the Innothule Swamp it is possible to travel directly to the Desert 
        of Ro, although the path is very dangerous and the Desert of Ro even more 
        so. This is the way to travel overland to the human city of Freeport, 
        however, and through there to Faydwer (assuming you can get on the boat). 
        By passing through the Feerrott, it is possible to reach the Rathe Mountains 
        and, past them, the Plains of Karana east of Qeynos. This path is frightening 
        and desolate, and there were many times I was glad for my drumming ability. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>G</font>robb</h3>
      <p>The access to Grobb is through the Innothule Swamp, which can easily 
        be reached from the ogre home of Oggok by travelling a short distance 
        through the Feerrott. It is possible, although arduous, to reach both of 
        the human cities of Qeynos and Freeport. The former is reached through 
        the Rathe Mountains north of the Feerrott, and then the vast Plains of 
        Karana north of that. The latter can be found adjacent to the Desert of 
        Ro, which stretches north of Innothule Swamp for many miles. 
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>The town is a primitive place. The frogloks have done their best to clean 
        up the refuse of the trolls, but there are still places where the walls 
        seem permanently stained with blood. They have, however, remade it to 
        appear much more to their liking, and it will probably appear more and 
        more like the original Guk over time.
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The frogloks of Gukta, although similar in appearance to their cousins 
        in Guk itself, are quite different in philosophy. Having been transformed 
        by their god Mithaniel Marr, they appear to have reclaimed some of their 
        former glory, before their civilization was shattered and they began to 
        practice necromancy. These frogloks seem to be trying to make up for lost 
        time, and are welcoming in the good races with tolerance their cousins 
        in Guk don't yet share.
