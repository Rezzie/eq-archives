      <p><i>It should be noted that the following description was taken partially 
        from my encounter with a huge troll Shadow Knight named Jubjub while I 
        was travelling to this area to seek out the frogloks. I had just barely 
        escaped with my life after finding a haunted ruin within the swamp, when 
        I stumbled across this troll, healing quickly beneath a tree. He spared 
        my life only because I healed him with my song and was able to entertain 
        him with my drumming skill (and, I would later find out, because he had 
        previously tried half-elf flesh and really didn't favor it). Some wonder 
        why I would bother to interact with the likes of him, but I was injured 
        and the sword he picked up when I encountered him was as long as I was 
        tall, and covered in gore and chunks of hair and scales... Being rather 
        intelligent, for his race, he scratched the above map in the dirt for 
        me and gave me a description of its inhabitants, although his take on 
        them was quite the opposite from what I express below. He warned me to 
        never travel within, for his buddies would &quot;smash&quot; me. I followed 
        his advice...</i></p>

      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Grobb is a very small compared to some of the human towns on Antonica, 
        and very utilitarian in its design. The entrance from the vicious Innothule 
        Swamp is heavily guarded by trolls, and the interior of the caverns has 
        many sights that would turn an outsiders stomach. There are prisons for 
        their enemies, the frogloks, as well as anyone else unfortunate enough 
        to stop by for a visit. There are multiple sites for torturing these prisoners 
        as well. Mud flows freely through their town, and they seem not to mind. 
        The guilds of the Shadow Knights and Shamans are hidden away in dark mines, 
        away from the light of day. The Warrior's guild is near the entrance, 
        which can be a problem for their neighbors, the ogres, because the Warriors 
        have an intense rivalry with them. 
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>The Innothule Swamp is a dark and dangerous place, even for the trolls 
        who roam it daily. The numerous small islands can quickly confuse and 
        lose a traveller, and roaming fungus men, kobolds, and much worse can 
        easily run down an outsider who hasn't learned the way around, or anybody 
        who hasn't learned how to swim. Adjacent to Innothule Swamp is the Feerott, 
        another drier swamp area which is where the ogres have made their home. 
        There is a great deal of travel between the two races' home towns, and 
        something of an alliance exists between the two, opposed as they are against 
        most of the rest of Norrath. 
      <p>From the Innothule Swamp it is possible to travel directly to the Desert 
        of Ro, although the path is very dangerous and the Desert of Ro even more 
        so. This is the way to travel overland to the human city of Freeport, 
        however, and through there to Faydwer (assuming you can get on the boat). 
        By passing through the Feerott, it is possible to reach the Rathe Mountains 
        and, past them, the Plains of Karana east of Qeynos. This path is frightening 
        and desolate, and there were many times I was glad for my drumming ability. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>G</font>robb</h3>
      <p>The access to Grobb is through the Innothule Swamp, which can easily 
        be reached from the ogre home of Oggok by travelling a short distance 
        through the Feerott. It is possible, although arduous, to reach both of 
        the human cities of Qeynos and Freeport. The former is reached through 
        the Rathe Mountains north of the Feerott, and then the vast Plains of 
        Karana north of that. The latter can be found adjacent to the Desert of 
        Ro, which stretches north of Innothule Swamp for many miles. 
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>The town is a horribly primitive place. There is one bar and two places 
        of torture, one out in the open and the other hidden in a cave. There 
        are also several prisons, one main one and several private ones, usually 
        owned by the guilds. The only other places of interest are the single, 
        well-stocked weapons and armor shop, the bank, and the guild halls buried 
        away in old mines ringing the troll glade. 
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>There aren't many nice things to say about the people of Grobb, if you 
        can even refer to them that way. They have no crafts other than weaponmaking 
        available to them, and no activities other than watching torture, fighting, 
        and drinking. Be wary of them in their good moods.
