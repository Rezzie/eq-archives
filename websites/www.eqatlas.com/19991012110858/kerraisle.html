<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
Kerra Island is a small island that lies just off the west coast of Odus.
This island's main inhabitants are the Kerrans, a race of catlike people
who are peaceful until you make enemies of them. The island in Erud's Crossing
is often mistakingly referred to as Kerra Island, but it is not.
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
This island's main danger is the Kerrans, who, as mentioned above, will
generally leave you alone until you start killing their kindred. Then this
place becomes rather scary.
<p>At lower levels, the front of the zone is much like the front of Crushbone,
lower level spawns that are generally separate from each other so that
you can handle them one at a time. At higher levels (around 10th) you will
definitely need to move further into the island to find Kerrans that are
worth hunting, and this is dangerous. The most dangerous part of it is
that the Kerrans in the open areas all roam around their area and are very
close together. For instance, the area by the docks has approximately 20
Kerrans all within plain view, and (although I didn't try this myself)
they are close enough together that I think hitting one would bring them
all on you. The other open area is almost as bad (and higher level too).
<p>The necromancers might also be dangerous. They are of relatively low
level, less than 10th, but they have pets and roam around their area quite
a bit. They may also be aggressive to other non-necro Erudites, although
I don't have any verification of this.
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
This is another dungeon that is relatively untouched, therefore making
it good hunting without much competition. This is probably in large part
due to the fact that few people know or care to go there and check it out
(I myself played an Erudite for most of the beta and never stepped foot
on the island). It is also kind of far away for most of the characters,
including Erudites, who by the time they're ready for this are bound to
Qeynos. The only other problem that I can foresee with this area is that
there is a large jump in difficulty from the front spawn spots to the ones
further in. The tunnels provide some separate Kerrans to hunt, but the
larger areas are just scary.
<p>As far as other benefits to this area, I'm not sure what they are. There
is a good possibility that the Kerrans could carry some very interesting
unique magic items, but I myself haven't received any nor have I heard
of others who have. This is again due to the low traffic in the area. There
is an entire culture here in a small place, and someone could undoubtedly
become very rich if they spent a great deal of time here.

<font size=+2>I</font>sland</h3>
There is only one way in and out of the island, and it is through the tunnel
on the east side of the bridge that spans the river. This leads to the
narrow strip of water that separates Kerra Isle from Odus, a strip small
enough that it can be swum with ease. Only low-level adventurers need fear
the swim, as there are occasional giant pirhana that swim the waters.
