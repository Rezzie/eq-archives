      <h4>Tips for Kunark</h4>
      <p>Here are some tips that might help you out when dealing with the Kunark, 
        both in terms of what to expect and to not expect, as well as how to move 
        about.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Spirit of the Wolf. The zone is vast, and having a speed-enhancing 
          spell on at all times makes life so much better.</li>
        <li>Weight-reducing bags. Carry those special bags (like from the orc 
          in Highpass) that reduce weight to zero so that you can carry more goodies.</li>
        <li>Food and Water. Either bring a lot of them, have a friend who can 
          summon them, or make an Iksar character to bring you one of the new 
          food/water creation devices. There is no place for you to buy these 
          items easily on the continent.</li>
        <li>Basic Safe Travelling Concepts. I've used these all along to map areas 
          I shouldn't be in. This includes not getting lost (figure out how to 
          use /loc), /con'ing monsters as you run along (right-click on them to 
          get a fast /con), and just general stupid avoidance (don't go running 
          over a hilltop with SoW in an area you've never been in but you think 
          has giants, for instance).</li>
        <li>Maps. I may be biased here, but I think knowing where you are going 
          is going to help out a lot.</li>
        <li>Have fun! The expansion, for me, is a very exciting thing. I love 
          exploring new areas and finding out things that many people don't know 
          or haven't seen yet. Try to do this as much as possible. In the weeks 
          ahead, Kunark will still vastly be an unexplored land for all of us. 
          Enjoy it while it lasts, since they haven't announced another expansion 
          yet! </li>
      </ul>
