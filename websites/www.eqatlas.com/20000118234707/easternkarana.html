      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Eastern Plains of Karana is a rough, partly hilly area on the eastern 
      edge of the Plains of Karana. The area is frequented by many of the rarest 
      and most dangerous creatures in all of Antonica, and is connected to the 
      rest of the world only by two narrow mountain passes and one massive bridge. 
      Some intrepid souls make their homes out here amidst the creatures. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      This area is frequented by some very dangerous and aggressive creatures, 
      many of which are similar to other areas of the Plains of Karana (hill giants, 
      griffawns) and many more which are unique to this area (the gnoll and undead 
      reavers, gorge hounds and war wolves, evil eyes, lion and lioness royalty). 
      There is a lot of good hunting here, but it comes at the price of being 
      very dangerous. Also, it is a fair distance from anyplace that you can bind 
      safely at lower levels (you can bind High Hold Pass and Keep, but those 
      are dangerous too) which can make the trip lengthy. 
      <p>Given that this is the case, there are few places to hunt safely (other 
        than the edges of the zone) and no real guard to protect you or to run 
        to. Random death is the key here, and with so many creatures running around 
        who are aggressive (it's like you're in an angry zoo) I wouldn't recommend 
        hunting here until you reach 15th level, unless you are very good at avoiding 
        dangers. 
      <p>Also note the presence of very high level killing machines that are here, 
        like the evil eyes, Broon and cyclops, name gnolls. Even if you're hunting 
        carefully within your level, these can certainly spoil your day. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This area provides good hunting from 15th until about 25th level, roughly, 
      as the area is just jam-packed with monsters that you'll be able to hunt. 
      It also is somewhat less crowded than areas that are closer to the main 
      cities. This makes the area good hunting for a careful group. 
      <p>Sir Morgan is a well-known feature of this area. He is a plate-clad knight 
        who hangs out just east of the bridge from Northern Karana with his squire 
        and offers to guide you to the other side and protect you along the way. 
        His price is fairly cheap, and if you have bad luck avoiding danger, might 
        be worth the price to have this man guide you and keep your hide from 
        harm. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>E</font>astern <font size=+2>P</font>lains of <font size=+2>K</font>arana</h3>
      The southern and western borders of this area are blocked by a vast river 
      that continues flowing westward through the Plains of Karana. The sole way 
      across this is over a massive bridge in the northern part of the western 
      edge, likely built by giants many years ago, if anything can be guessed 
      from the massive scale of the structure. 
      <p>The pass to Highpass Hold lies on the eastern edge of the zone, through 
        a very long and narrow pass through the mountains. 
      <p>One can also travel into the Gorge of King Xorbb, which lies in the northeastern 
        corner. A trail leads past some shops on the way to the Gorge.
