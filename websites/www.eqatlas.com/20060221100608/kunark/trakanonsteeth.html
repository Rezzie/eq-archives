      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Trakanon's Teeth is a vast, swampy area in the mountains of the same 
        name. The most notable feature is the vast ruins of the ancient city of 
        the Iksar, Sebilis. The ancient ruins of a massive aqueduct lead from 
        the small lake in the area to near the old city. Now, however, the city 
        and the surrounding area are filled with the tormented dead. Other creatures 
        of the swamp also roam freely in the large areas of the jungle.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This vast space is home to many dangerous, wandering creatures. Many 
        of them are aggressive, and many of them are very difficult to see against 
        the underbrush and the ground while moving through the zone. Frogloks 
        of all types are a frequent sight, and the more dangerous trakaraptors 
        and trakanasaurs also wander freely and are aggressive. When travelling 
        through this area, it is wise to move quickly and know which direction 
        you're going, for it is possible to go past these monsters quickly and 
        they won't become aggressive, but if you are slow or stop to look around, 
        you will get jumped. If hunting here, stay close to the wall and be ready 
        for lots of additions to the battle, even with a good puller.
      <p>Many of the other monsters, like the spectral keepers, generally keep 
        to fixed places at either the small ruins in the larger jungle or in the 
        Ruins of Sebilis behind the wall. They occasionally move outside of the 
        city but generally stay within it. These are harder to pull by themselves 
        from their surroundings.
      <p>The other problem is that the zone is so large. If you are stuck without 
        a way to move quickly, travelling through this zone is arduous and dangerous. 
        It is safest to stick to the walls and avoid everything.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone, like a few others across the world, has a large number of 
        rare creatures that can be hunted, making it a good place to find some 
        nice, uncommon items. Having someone who can track is essential for this 
        type of hunting, as the zone is very large.
      <p>The area behind the wall near the city of Sebilis is relatively free 
        of roaming creatures. There is occasionally a spectral keeper moving around 
        outside of the city itself, but for the most part you can move freely 
        behind the wall without fear of getting jumped. This is good for setting 
        up camp against the wall, as the pulls are much safer without wandering 
        monsters.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>rakanon's <font size=+2>T</font>eeth</h3>
      <p>The entrance from the Swamp of No Hope is located at the spring that 
        feeds the whole swamp at approximately 1570, -4500 and enters Trakanon's 
        Teeth at 1570, 4500.
      <p>There is a connection to the Emerald Jungle at 3955, 1500 along the northern 
        edge of the zone.
      <p>Sebilis can be reached through Trakanon's Teeth, found at location -2055, 
        -4450. To enter, you need to find a red sphere buried under some ruins, 
        and also have the correct key to activate the portal. The key is obtainable 
        through a quest with Emperor Ganek.
