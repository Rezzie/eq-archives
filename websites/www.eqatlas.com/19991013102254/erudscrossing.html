<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
Erud's Crossing is the name of the zone which the ferry from Qeynos to
Erudin passes through, and it marks the path that Erud himself travelled
on his way to the island of Odus centuries ago. Erud's Crossing's only
feature is an island that marks the halfway point of the trip, and it is
a most unique island, with some unique creatures.
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
This island is a very dangerous zone for several reasons.&nbsp; First of
all, there is practically no escape from enemies if you run into trouble
and are overwhelmed.&nbsp; There is no zone edge that anyone can easily
swim to, and no guards to protect you.&nbsp; It is even impossible to flee into the water when chased, because most monsters will chase you there as well.
<p>Secondly, the ecosystem of the island is quite variable and the monsters
have an intricate relationship.&nbsp; The following information is mostly
secondhand, but reliable as far as what happens on the island.&nbsp; First
of all the island is very small, so it is not uncommon to have monsters
of the same type as the one you're fighting wander by and join in.&nbsp;
All monsters will join with others of their type.&nbsp; Secondly, many
of the monsters are intertwined in their relationships, the most complex
being the beetles and spiders.&nbsp; The Kerra Isle Beetles are well-liked
by the Kerrans who hang out by the dock.&nbsp; As such, killing the beetles
can make getting on and off the island difficult, as these Kerrans will
begin to hate you and are also among the most powerful monsters here.&nbsp;
Also, killing the beetles can result in the spawning of Island Madmen by
the docks, some of whom are extremely dangerous spellcasters and all of
whom are powerful and aggressive.  They can also cause Fire Elementals to spawn in the volcano, which are aggressive and high level.  These have also been known to swarm the island.&nbsp; The spiders represent a different
problem, and that is that they all seem to know what is going on elsewhere
on the island.&nbsp; Attacking one is a quick way to draw others to you,
and there are rumors that the entire island's population of spiders has
occasionally swarmed an attacker.
<p>The other danger is, as mentioned above, the unpredictability of the
spawn rates.&nbsp; For instance, the zombie sailors generally spawn at
a regular rate and can provide good hunting.&nbsp; There are rumors that,
however, there are occasions when the zombie sailors spawn en masse and
swarm the island.&nbsp; Skeleton sailors occasionally spawn in their place, and are much tougher.  The other problem with the island in general is
that you must be very aware of how small it is and how easily it is for
others to join in on the fight.&nbsp; This was mentioned before, but needs
to be emphasized.&nbsp; You should not come here to hunt evens and upper
hands solo, you will assuredly die at some point because another will join
in.&nbsp; This happens with all the monsters, not just those specifically
mentioned above.
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
Despite the above dangers, this island can be a great deal of fun to hunt
in.&nbsp; The danger makes it very exciting, and there is a great deal
of strategy to hunting without being swarmed.&nbsp; The island is also
generally not very heavily hunted, and has a good variety of creatures,
although people generally come to hunt the wisps that frequently spawn
and the zombie sailors because of their rawhide armor and for quests out
of Qeynos.
<p>There is also a strong sense of comraderie among the people on the island.&nbsp;
Basically, one person killing the wrong monster or starting the wrong train
can result in the death or near-death of virtually every person on the
island, so there is a willingness to help out here that you rarely see
elsewhere.&nbsp; The smallness of the island makes you feel like you are
in your own little world, with only the occasional boat to take you to
safety.

Erud's Crossing can only be reached via the ferry that runs from Qeynos
to Erudin.&nbsp; When coming from Qeynos, the ferry runs along the shore
for quite some time before actually reaching the docks, so many impatient
adventurers jump ship and swim for shore.&nbsp; This also helps you to
avoid the Kerrans at the docks.&nbsp; From the other direction this is
also possible, but the swim is significantly longer.
