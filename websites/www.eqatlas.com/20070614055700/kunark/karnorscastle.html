      <h3><font size="+2">D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Karnor's Castle stands bleakly in the center of the Dreadlands. Once 
        one of the major military establishments of the Iksar Empire, it now stands 
        in ruins. The inhabitants within are maintained in their unholy life by 
        the eternal iksar vampire, Venril Sathir. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This dungeon is one of the highest level dungeons in all of Norrath, 
        and as such, is very dangerous for many reasons. First of all, all of 
        the monsters that you meet are at least 45th level, and many are in the 
        50's. This means that they have some very powerful abilities, including 
        complete healing, gating, etc. Secondly, it is very difficult to separate 
        spawns when pulling, and most of the time you will need to fight at least 
        two monsters with every pull. This requires either an excellent puller, 
        a very well-balanced and functioning group, or an enchanter for crowd 
        control, and it is recommended to have all three. 
      <p>The layout of the dungeon is also noticeable. There is only one major 
        exit for the zone, and everyone entering and exiting goes through one 
        common area. It is important to remember this when either entering the 
        zone or fleeing a train to the zone, in order to keep yourself or others 
        from getting killed. Typically you should enter from the right hand (southern) 
        side and flee on the left (northern) side. Be sure, however, to find out 
        the local server rules regarding this, as people can get very upset if 
        you train the wrong way and get a dozen people butchered. 
      <p>Monsters also seem to have a long aggro range, and will generally attack 
        you from a seemingly large range. They will jump out of the moat to join 
        in, or join in attacks if you start going after monsters a level below 
        or above you. 
      <p>For evil races, care must be taken if you wish to hunt in this zone. 
        The faction hit that you take is Venril Sathir, which is the same as the 
        faction in the outpost in the Overthere. If you hunt here long enough, 
        you will no longer be welcome in your only outpost on Kunark
      <p>Venril Sathir also has made Karnor's Castle his home. He is considered 
        one of the most powerful creatures in all of Norrath, for he is resistant 
        to most damage spells and procs a massive lifetap spell every time he 
        hits a creature, healing himself in the process. Destroying him takes 
        the coordinated effort of several groups, and there are only a few strategies 
        known to work against him. Proceed at your own risk...
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Karnor's Castle is where many of the class-specific armor from Kunark 
        comes from. Many of the lesser items drop from random monsters, and there 
        are many separate monsters where the more powerful items drop. Many groups 
        are here to acquire this equipment. There are also some incredible weaponry 
        and other equipment here as well. 
      <p>This zone is also considered to be an outdoor zone in terms of what spells 
        you can cast (like SoW, Wolf Form, Harmony, etc), but you can also cast 
        the Kunark Dungeon Evac Spells, which are generally indoor only. This 
        makes the zone very druid- and ranger-friendly. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>arnor's <font size=+2>C</font>astle</h3>
      <p>Karnor's Castle is reached through the Dreadlands. It's location is approximately 
        500, -2250.
