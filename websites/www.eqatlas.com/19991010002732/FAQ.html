  <h1>EQ Atlas FAQ</h1>

<p><b>Why didn't you put up the map to (insert your starting city name here) ?</b>
<p>
<ul><li>There are a couple of reasons I've started out with the cities I did.  First of all, the information I've obtained I gathered during the beta of Everquest.  Many of the cities and areas weren't fully fleshed out in the beta, they essentially didn't have that "finished polish" on them.  Therefore, I knew that they would change when the final came out.  And I didn't want to spend time making maps and descriptions I would have to change in a few days anyway.  There were certainly cities that were very fleshed out and that I could have chosen (Halas, for example), but chose not to.  It had to do with time available to me, that's the only reason.  Rest assured, all cities will be up and running in the weeks ahead.
</ul>
<p>
<p><b>When will you be putting up maps and screenshots of the other zones?</b>
<p>
<ul><li>This is a tricky topic, but it boils down to this.  There will be maps of the other zones available as I make them.  They will not be as accurate as the maps and descriptions of the starting cities, and this is done intentionally.  My goal is not to provide you with everything you can find in the game.  First of all, there's no way I could do this (I have a regular job), and secondly, it would detract from a game that I immensely enjoy.  I would not want this done to me, so I'm not doing it to anyone else.  In fact, there may be intentional errors or omissions in the other zone maps.  My intent is to make this site from the viewpoint of my character, Muse, and he wouldn't know all, so all won't appear here.  As for screenshots, I will conceivably put up screenshots of significant sights in the starting cities and zones, but I will likely not have them of other zones.  Expect sketches of these places by Muse and his companions, however.  Expect the guides to other starting cities to be up in the first few weeks.
</ul>
<p>
<p><b>When will you put up information on quests?</b>
<p>
<ul><li>I won't.  See above for the explanation.
</ul>
<p>
<p><b>I've found an error.  Why is it there?</b>
<p>
<ul><li>Because I am human.  Please send all errors/omissions to <a href="mailto:Muse@eqatlas.com">Muse@eqatlas.com</a> so that I can update the section appropriately.
</ul>
<p><b>What cities will you have up next?</b>
<p>
<ul><li>This all depends on when I can start playing the game, but the cities that we plan on having up within the first week of play include Halas, Oggok, Grobb, Kaladim, and possibly Felwithe.  Erudin will come after these, followed by Rivervale, Neriak, and Ak'Anon (sorry, I've only played once in each place so far).
