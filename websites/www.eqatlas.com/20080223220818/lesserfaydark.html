      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Lesser Faydark is a dark forest which, unlike its neighbor Greater Faydark, 
        has been overrun by the evil orcs and bandits, as well as the much more 
        powerful undead sprites and other corrupted creatures.. There are also 
        small camps of Pixies, Faeries, and Brownies, as well as the mighty Fae 
        Drakes, all of whom make this zone their home.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This is a mid-level zone, where you should really be in the mid-teens 
        or higher to plan on surviving for very long. Although there are areas 
        in the zone where you can hunt at much lower levels, the danger is that 
        there are many wandering dangerous creatures in the zone now.
      <p>Most of the other monsters in this zone reside in camps. These monsters 
        tend to not wander very much outside of their little camps. The only exception 
        to this is the Brownie Scouts that wander the middle of the zone. They 
        are very aggressive and almost as powerful as the Brownies in the town. 
        Also, most of the other monsters that wander can begin to dislike you 
        as you kill more of their kin. These include the Fae Drakes and the Pixies 
        and Faeries, who are all frequently seen travelling through the zone, 
        but are generally neutral to their neighbors. Equestrielle the Corrupted 
        is occasionally seen in the zone, wandering around to the entire zone. 
        She is also highly aggressive to all, and the bards will not assist you 
        in fighting her.
      <p>One of the largest dangers in the zone, however, are the Brownies that 
        live in the town to the north. These creatures of the forest are very 
        aggressive, and are KOS to just about everyone (the only people I've seen 
        spared are druids in Wolf Form). They are all at least 45th level and 
        are Druids, so are capable of taking down even a very well trained group 
        quickly. Accidentally walk near their town and you better know an invisibility 
        spell for recovering your corpse... Unless, of course, you can take on 
        wolf form, in which case they'll gladly sell to you... 
      <p>There is another danger that recently surfaced, that of the Tier'Dal 
        that currently inhabit the abandoned camp of Wu along the southern border 
        of the camp. These Tier'Dal are aggressive and powerful, and the trains 
        caused by someone inadvertantly stumbling across them can wreak havoc 
        across the forest.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>If you are able to get over living in constant darkness and are powerful 
        enough to fight off the undead sprites, this area provides good hunting 
        for mid-level characters. The camps are usually not camped (well, the 
        bandit camps are), and you can travel around making money off of the orcs 
        that fill the southern half of the region. If you are brave, you can start 
        making enemies of the other races in the area and make money off of them 
        as well. They are all well equipped with loot and provide good money to 
        an adventurer. 
      <p>There are other, more subtle, benefits to this zone. People who want 
        to rip our their hair in Greater Faydark with the constant chatter will 
        find it remarkable absent in this zone. There is also a small enclave 
        of very high level wood elves living in a small hut in the middle of the 
        zone, who you can sell to for good prices as well as buy food from. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>L</font>esser <font size=+2>F</font>aydark</h3>
      <p>To the north, in the northeastern corner, lies the pass that connects 
        the great forest of Lesser Faydark and Greater Faydark. Just south of 
        that on the eastern wall lies the pass that leads into the Steamfont Mountains, 
        home of the gnomes. 
      <p>In the southwestern corner lies the narrow pass that separates the rest 
        of the world from Castle Mistmoore, rumored to be home to an ancient dark 
        elf vampire. Many who pass through here never return...
