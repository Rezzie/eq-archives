<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>Highpass Hold lies along the main travel route from Qeynos to Freeport, and 
  is a mountain pass guarded as well as possible by the valiant guards of Highpass 
  Keep. Orcs and gnolls have patrols that run up to the foot of the Keep itself, 
  and the brave Highpass citizens have carved out their homes out of the gulleys 
  and nooks.
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>Highpass Hold is dangerous to lower level adventurers because of the high level 
  gnolls and orcs that are frequently found just inside either entrance. The orcs 
  control the southern entrance and are more powerful than the gnolls that command 
  the northern entrance. Rarely do the guards venture this far out in order to 
  keep their area safe, so the traveller must either travel invisibly or quickly, 
  or hope that some other adventurers are hunting these creatures to keep the 
  area safe.
<p>The other danger to the zone is a group of NPC's that have set up a camp in 
  a small nook directly out from the gates of the city. They are highly aggressive 
  to any traveller, although for some reason the guards of the city turn a blind 
  eye to their presence. There is also a secret area of bandits that can be found 
  if you swim under the bridge by the Tiger's Roar. Most people haven't interacted 
  with them, as they are either too scared or too high level, so let me know what 
  they do.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>This zone's biggest attraction is as a stopping off point for people travelling 
  from one end of Antonica to the other. Most of the people here are either just 
  passing through or on their way to the Keep for some rare item or spell.
<p>There is also something of an economy here at the foot of the Keep. Out of 
  the six buildings, three of them contain bars (there apparently isn't much to 
  do up here except drink) and there is also good support for a variety of trade 
  skills, especially brewing and pottery, as all the equipment and materials for 
  these can be found here. There are also several good inns in the area.

  <font size=+2>H</font>ighpass <font size=+2>H</font>old</h3>

<p>Coming from Freeport an adventurer reaches Kithicor Forest before passing into 
  the southern edge of Highpass Hold. Out of the eastern edge of Highpass Hold 
  lies Highpass Keep. From the northern edge of the Hold one passes into Eastern 
  Karana and winds their way down a long, narrow gorge until finally reaches the 
  Plains of Karana.
