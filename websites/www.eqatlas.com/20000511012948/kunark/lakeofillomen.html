      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Lake of Ill Omen is the ancient site of the city of Varnek, which was 
      cursed ages ago and has since sank beneath the waters, giving the local 
      area its name. The reptilian sarnak have moved into the area and have secured 
      an ancient fortress to the southwest. The goblins have established a mine 
      in the hills in north of the lake. The Brood of Kotiz has taken it upon 
      themselves to eradicate the sarnak from the area, and have directed their 
      trainees to do so. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      The only true danger in this area is all of the wandering monsters that 
      roam around the area. The worst of these are the goblins which are hard 
      to see at night in the grassy areas, and many powerful goblins can be found 
      wandering through areas inhabited by much less powerful creatures. Also, 
      the sarnak are hard to see, but they are much less frequently found wandering 
      around. There are several areas with high concentrations of creatures that 
      warrant mention. The more frequent are the ruins throughout the area, which 
      are typically turned into outposts for either the outcast Iksar or the goblins. 
      Since they are often inside the buildings, care needs to be taken when moving 
      around these areas. 
      <p>The area that is most dangerous, however, is the area to the southwest, 
        where the sarnak have recaptured an ancient Iksar fortress and turned 
        it into their stronghold in the area. Traveling anywhere near the area 
        means that you will encounter many wandering sarnak, all of which are 
        highly aggressive and strong. There is an area of less danger, and that 
        is the goblin mines to the northwest of the lake. The small entrance belies 
        the vast network of catacombs that exist beneath the mountains, and the 
        goblins numbers are far more than they would seem based on their surface 
        patrols.
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This area has a good mix of creatures, and they are typically found in small 
      clusters that you can easily hunt with a small group. That allows for some 
      good areas to hunt if you fit the appropriate level range for the monsters 
      in that area. 
      <p>This area is also an excellent area for both necromancers and shadow 
        knights to hunt, as there are hordes of skeletons of various types that 
        provide bone chips for them. It is also the area where the beginning quests 
        for both necromancers and shadow knights are primarily based, so they 
        can be found hunting in this area a great deal. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>L</font>ake <font size=+2>O</font>f <font size=+2>I</font>ll 
        <font size=+2>O</font>men</h3>
      <p>The Iksar city of Cabilis lies to the northeast through a long, narrow 
        valley. Just south of the valley entrance lies a small gorge with a stream 
        that feeds the lake. This gorge leads to a small spring that also feeds 
        down to the old elven beachhead of Firiona Vie.
      <p>Far to the west, just north of the sarnak fortress lies the narrow pass 
        to the Frontier Mountains.
