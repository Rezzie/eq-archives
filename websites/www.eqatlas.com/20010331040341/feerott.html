      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Feerott is the dark swampy home of the ogres and lizard men of Antonica. 
        The ogres live in a cave system at the edge of the swamp, while the lizard 
        men have established camps scattered throughout. It is also the home of 
        the ancient ruined temple of Cazic-Thule. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p> As the newbie area for the ogres and also many trolls, most of the wandering 
        monsters on the eastern side of the river are not aggressive and very 
        low-level. The only aggressive ones are the lizard man broodlings, shadow 
        wolves, and froglok tads, all of which are first-level monsters. Also, 
        the trails throughout are generally not next to the big spawn spots. These 
        two factors combined make the Feerott relatively safe to travel through, 
        since you won't be harrassed when you do it. 
      <p> The Feerott hides many hidden dangers, however. Most of the higher level 
        creatures that you can hunt in the zone are groupers, and will rush to 
        the aid of those around them. Particularly notorious are the spiders, 
        who will help others of their kind and are often difficult to attack without 
        others of their kind around. Your best hope with them it to catch them 
        alone away from their main spots. The lizard men are also notorious groupers. 
        Taking on a camp of them is usually more difficult than it would seem, 
        as there is usually a spellcaster among them, making the proposition more 
        difficult. 
      <p>The land to the west of the river is even more dangerous. Although there 
        are large areas that are without life, the area surrounding the termination 
        of the only branch of the trail is crawling with random spawns, all good 
        for a pair of 5th or 6th level characters. There are also some areas with 
        high concentrations of undead, which are good if you can take them, and 
        they are all aggressive. This is also where Roror, the priest of Cazic 
        Thule, runs around. He can't be mistaken for another lizard man because 
        he always has a pet with him.  Last, but definitely not least for good races,
	  is the Bouncers from Oggok, typically Bouncer Hurd.  These large ogres are
	  aggressive towards all good races, move very fast, and hit very hard.
      <p>The island itself is a unique place in the Feerott. There are discrete 
        temples with usually lone and sometimes pairs of lizard men upon them, 
        which it seems like you would be able to take out with ease. However, 
        if they run (and they will), they are only a short jaunt from their nearest 
        neighbor, and I've seen trains of eight lizard men running across the 
        bridge to Oggok, chasing a poor Troll. The other danger is that there 
        might be a Basher upon the Temple itself. My ranger could track him up 
        there, and since they can take me out quickly I didn't approach, but it 
        may also be part of a frequent bug that happens where named NPC's appear 
        off of zone edges on tracking... 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>There are some benefits to adventuring in the Feerott, although honestly 
        most of the evil races spend their time in neighboring Innothule Swamp. 
        The largest benefit comes when you are a newbie character. The path from 
        Oggok to Innothule becomes a track that newbies take laps on, killing 
        whatever creatures cross their path. At second and third level, the spiders 
        are good for exp and their webs are worth fair money (although not stackable, 
        unfortunately). Also, froglok tads and lizard men will frequently give 
        netted and cloth armor to throw on yourself (or sell for good money) and 
        also have rusty weapons frequently. There is also the benefit of having 
        Innkeeper Thug around, as he will buy and sell items for a fair price 
        to about anyone, and almost as good as going into town itself. 
      <p>The next time that you will see a benefit to being in Feerott is when 
        you can group and take out lizard man camps. There are quite a few camps, 
        and since lizard men provide pretty good loot, a group that can take them 
        out frequently can do well for themselves. There is a wide range of levels 
        for the camps, as well, ranging from 3rd level near the Oggok to Innothule 
        path, up to at least 12th level on the west side of the river. 
      <p>Some miscellaneous benefits include the evil enchantress. who likely 
        has some goods for a group high enough level to take her out (she is the 
        45+ creature listed above). And the entrance to the Temple of Thule can 
        not be overlooked, again an area for at least 15th (more like 20th or 
        higher) level people to travel in. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>F</font>eerott</h3>
      <p>Travellers from the direction of Freeport arrive on the eastern edge 
        of Feerott, after travelling through the Desert of Ro and Innothule Swamp. 
        Travellers from Qeynos area arrive at the western edge, after travelling 
        through the Plains of Karana and the Rathe zones. 
      <p>The entrance to Oggok lies along the northern border of the Feerott, 
        with a small grouping of buildings outside. The Lost Temple of Thule entrance 
        lies directly across from it, on the southern edge on the island.
