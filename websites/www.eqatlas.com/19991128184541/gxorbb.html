<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
The Gorge of King Xorbb, alternately known as the Beholder's Maze, is a narrow 
collection of gulleys and ravines that are very similar to those in Highpass Hold, 
however, unlike its southern neighbor, this area has much less friendly occupants. 
The nearby goblins of Runnyeye Citadel keep a vigilant watch on all who pass through 
here, and a western variety of minotaur makes this area their home. Also, this 
area is known for its most dangerous occupants, the evil eyes. 
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
The most obvious danger in this area are the creatures. Every single one is aggressive 
and very strong, and narrow gorges make any combat here even more dangerous, as 
your enemies buddies will happen to walk by sometime soon, almost guaranteed. 
The muddites are very strong for their size, and these living blocks of clay are 
generally a bit tougher than they /con to you, as they can deal out and take a 
large amount of damage. The minotaurs are also very strong. The evil eyes are 
the pinnacle of dangerous. They are armed with many spells and one of them was 
able to kill my 11th level ranger with one spell. I've heard that these evil eyes 
are weaker than the ones in Runnyeye itself. Be very careful around these creatures. 
<p>In order to avoid these creatures, especially if you are just passing through, 
  the common method is to run high up on the wall to get from one end to the other. 
  By staying as far up as possible, you will be out of the range for monsters 
  to notice you. The downside to this is falling damage. The route from Runnyeye 
  to Eastern Karana involves staying to the left and up on the left wall the whole 
  way, but there is at least one spot where the slope vanishes as you round a 
  corner and you will take some damage. This is enhanced greatly by any speed-enhancing 
  spell, so you people possessed by the Spirit of the Wolf or singing Accelerando 
  might want to slow it down a bit or face taking the absurd amount of falling 
  damage you might take.
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
This area is just plain good hunting. Most of the people either sit at either 
entrance and draw creatures to the entrance (Runnyeye side more than Eastern Karana 
side) or are sitting around the King's Throne. Lower level adventurers can actually 
hunt quite well on the low level goblin lookouts while higher level adventurers 
can pull muddites or minotaurs to the edges. The evil eyes are usually taken out 
by groups near their spawn spots. 
<p>In addition to these traditional camping areas, the farther regions of the 
  zone provide some very good, out of the way nooks in which a party could camp 
  and pull creatures out of the main path, and without a great deal of competition. 
  I haven't seen any groups taking advantage of this, perhaps because it's scary 
  to not have a zone edge at your back here, but it is certainly possible.
<h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>G</font>orge of <font size=+2>K</font>ing <font size=+2>X</font>orbb</h3>
From the west, adventurers would pass through Eastern Plains of Karana and through 
the pass into the southwestern corner of this zone. 
<p>From the east, adventurers would need to pass through the Halfling city of 
  Rivervale and Misty Thicket, and then make a brief run through Runnyeye Citadel, 
  home of the goblins, to reach the southeastern edge of the Gorge. Passing through 
  Runnyeye to reach here involves taking every right turn and quickly leaving 
  the Citadel.
