Innothule Swamp is the home of the Trolls. Dank and soggy, it's the perfect
place for the Trolls to call home. Located in the very southern edge of
Antonica, it lies beyond the Southern Desert of Ro and adjacent to The Feerott,
home of the Orges.
<H3>
<FONT SIZE=+2>D</FONT>angers</H3>
For young and experienced characters alike, Innothule Swamp can be a deadly
place due to it's many aggresive monsters, many of whom group. Add to this
the generally low PC population here, it's remarkable easy to find oneself
swarmed with little notice.
<P>As stated above, aggresive, grouping monsters can be very hazardous.
This is especially true when fighting the Frogloks, who spawn in a wide
area surrounding the entance to their home, Guk.&nbsp; Fighting here can
be deadly since almost all Frogloks patrol and they span a large range
of levels. Perhaps the best tactic to emply in this area is to grab a Froglok's
attention and high-tail it to the zone edge.&nbsp; Even doing this oftens
results in turning around to find 3-4 Frogloks of various varieties attempting
to make mince-meat out of you.
<P>Another danger in Innothule is the swamp itself. Unless you are a very
good swimmer, you never want to find yourself trapped by deep water. Most
of the creatures in the swamp are VERY good swimmers, making fleeing even
more hazardous if swimming is required. Generally avoid the deep water
and stick to the zone edges.
<P>There are a few human NPCs that patrol near Guk that are aggressive and
aren't particularly fond of the "evil" races.&nbsp; Be alert for these
unless you are around 10th level.
<H3>
<FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT>enefits</H3>
Innothule is a great area to hunt with its variety of monsters, high creature
population, and great treasure.&nbsp; A troll never has to wander far from
home to find adventure. Characters can easily hunt the swamp up to 8th
or 9th level, and Guk offers higher level prey and even greater treasure.
<P>Who says Trolls have to be ugly AND poor?&nbsp; Decaying Skeletons,
Frogloks, and Fungus Men all occasionally spawn with rusty weapons and
often have several silver to boot. And best of all is the netted and woven
armor that the Frogloks carry.&nbsp; Prized by monks for its magical properties
and low weight, this armor can sell for tremendous profit in the human
lands. Best of all, you never have to buy armor when adventuring here!

From the North, Innothule Swamp is reached through the Southern Desert
of Ro which lies south of Freeport. This can be a dangerous place, and
probably shouldn't be travelled by those less than about 6th or 7th level.
To the south is Grobb, home of the Trolls. Be particularly wary of this
area if you are of the "good" races.
<P>From the west, Innothule Swamp is entered by coming out of The Feerott,
home of the Ogres. This area lies south of Karana and Qeynos.
<P>To the east is Guk, home of the Frogloks. A particularly stunning dungeon
with many dangers and rewards...
