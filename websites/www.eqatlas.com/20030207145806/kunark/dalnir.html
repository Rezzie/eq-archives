      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Crypt of Dalnir is the hidden burial tomb of Dalnir, the ancient 
        Haggle Baron of the City of Cabilis. Recently, however, the Kly have taken 
        over the tomb and expanded it for their own, currently unknown, purposes. 
        The poor creatures who have fallen under their sway protect the upper 
        floors while they continue their experiments in the tunnels below.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Dalnir has several different, unique dangers that can only be found here, 
        largely because of the unique creatures that are found here. First of 
        all, many of the creatures are only occasionally aggressive, and this 
        applies to the nibblers and the goos. These are more commonly not aggressive, 
        but it's always safer to assume that they will attack than not. The coerced 
        and the kly are uniformly aggressive to all who enter. Both the coerced 
        and the kly have powerful spellcasters among their ranks, especially the 
        kly who have many wizard types among them. The coerced count shamans, 
        magicians, necromancers, shadow knights, and clerics among them. The number 
        of creatures in any area here is very high, so crowd control or a large 
        group are essential to doing well.
      <p>Another danger in this zone is that the levels are separated by pits. 
        The amount of damage that you can take from falling in one of these pits 
        won't kill most people capable of hunting here, but the fact that there 
        are typically aggressive creatures hanging around the landing area make 
        the thought of freefalling less appealing.
      <p>Third is the few exits that are available. Although the dungeon is small 
        and could be considered by some to have a rather large number of relatively 
        easy exits, for all the exits you have to pass by many aggressive creatures 
        while winding your way through twisting corridors to the zone out spot. 
        The third floor is especially dangerous since you have to pass through 
        the toughest monsters in the zone to reach the zone exit, which isn't 
        something that I recommend with little life to spare.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone is one of my favorite zones in the game. It is different from 
        many other zones for a variety of reasons, which make hunting here a unique 
        experience. First off, many people come here for the loot that Dalnir 
        has to offer. Many unique and powerful items are found in here off of 
        a few monsters, and even the random wandering creatures (the kly and coerced) 
        have uncommon drops of good items, even if you're hunting the front tunnel.
      <p>There are several quests that occur completely within this zone, as well 
        as an evolving storyline that you can learn about through journal entries 
        that can be found throughout. These quests result in some very nice weapons, 
        but I won't describe more so that you can figure it out.
      <p>The coerced in this area are some of the more interesting creatures found 
        anywhere in Kunark. They come from most races, and represent most of the 
        classes, and therefore make a &quot;strategy&quot; against them very hard 
        to define. The coerced drop many of the good items listed above. With 
        some experience, you can determine which particular coerced will drop 
        which items, although this doesn't really help you choose which ones to 
        fight. The coerced generally stick to the first and second floors, although 
        they can rarely be found on the third floor. 
      <p>The Kly are also unique. The Kly are believed to be an offshoot of the 
        Sarnaks from ages past, who have taken to doing experiments on other races 
        that fall outside of the &quot;norm&quot; of the sarnak culture, and so 
        they have found this tomb from which to perform those experiments. They 
        are never found on the first floor, and are mostly on the second and third 
        floors.
      <p>Dalnir is pretty much a monk's haven. Any monk in the above level range 
        who hasn't hunted here at least once is pretty much crazy. Half of the 
        armor and weapons, including some of the best monk weapons to be found 
        at this level are found in Dalnir. The obvious benefit of Safe Fall and 
        pit traps doesn't even really need to be mentioned. The Kly that appear 
        all over the two lower levels rarely drop pieces of the prized Crescent 
        Armor as well. 
      <p>Although I mentioned it above in the Dangers section, the number of exits 
        is also a plus in this dungeon, as you can fight here without having to 
        rely on an evac'er in the group. Many groups set up camp directly at the 
        exit on the first or second floors, and since the dungeon levels are relatively 
        small, a good and smart group can pull half the level from there.
      <p>Also, experience in this area is very good. With a well-balanced group, 
        the high volume of creatures that that group can fight in a relatively 
        short period of time provide great levelling opportunities. Many of the 
        battles felt like they were &quot;close&quot; which was exciting, but 
        since there are a large number of relatively balanced creatures around, 
        it is rare that you get jumped by something that could take out your whole 
        group.

        <font size=+2>D</font>alnir</h3>
      <p>The entrance to Dalnir is located through an old, hidden tunnel at 3490, 
        3965 in Warsliks Woods. Bear to the right down the tunnel to lead you 
        to the water illusion that leads you underneath...
