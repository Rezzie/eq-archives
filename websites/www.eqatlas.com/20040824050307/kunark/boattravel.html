        Boat Travel Instructions</b></p>
      <p>The boats for Kunark leave from <a href="../oasisofmarr.html">Oasis of 
        Marr</a> and <a href="../butcherblock.html">Butcherblock Mountains</a>. 
        From Oasis they leave at the dock along its eastern shore, the same dock 
        that people generally hang out by when hunting in the Oasis. In Butcherblock 
        Mountains, they leave from the same dock area that the boat to Freeport 
        leaves from. The actual dock is different, it is the dock to the south 
        of the Freeport dock.</p>
      <p><b>From Butcherblock</b></p>
      <p>The ships themselves are called ferries. The ferries each can hold a 
        large number of people, either on the top or on the inside, which you 
        have to swim to reach. The underside is recommended for travellers who 
        would rather stay unnoticed by the types of people who frequently walk 
        on the docks, and are easy to get on and off of while in the water itself.</p>
      <p>The boats pass quickly out of the local area that they are in, and enter 
        another ocean area, the Timorous Deep. The ferries travel a short distance 
        into this zone, at which time you need to disembark them and board the 
        large sailing ship, the Maiden Voyage. This massive sailing ship then 
        lowers its side sails and moves incredibly fast across the Timorous Deep, 
        circling around an island its way to the land of Kunark. If you stay on 
        the boat, you will pass into the zone called Firiona Vie in Kunark.</p>
      <p>The boat then (after a long period of time) takes you to a large beachhead 
        area in an old Iksar waterfront area at approximately loc -2000, 1940. 
        This area is guarded/owned by the good races, so it is reasonable that 
        if you would be KOS on the mainland to them, the same is true here, and 
        you should disembark shortly after coming into this area. Wolf form is 
        also KOS here, so be careful. My suggestion would be to swim left (west) 
        as you will cross a short waterway to the west of the docks and land on 
        a small section of land that juts south along it. There appears to be 
        nobody around, and you can safely move north into the rest of the zone. 
        When returning, follow the same path and swim across the water to the 
        leaving ferries as they head to the mainland.</p>
      <p>Once in this land, there are many dangers that immediately confront you. 
        The frogloks have a strong presence in the local area, and tuk warriors 
        and the like frequent the area. Also, the vicious drachnids move silently 
        through the forest surrounding the docks. Remember that this area has 
        gone wild...</p>
      <p>In Firiona Vie, the docks are in the extreme southwest portion of the 
        zone. Note that if you are in Wolf Form, you will be KOS to the guards 
        on the docks. Don't ask me to explain, I can't. From here you have several 
        options. You can adventure into Firiona Vie itself, or you can proceed 
        directly to the other nearby zone. the Lake of Ill Omen shares a spring 
        that feeds both the lake and the small stream that leads down to near 
        the docks. An adventurer can follow the stream to its source in the hills 
        to the west, which will lead them to the Lake of Ill Omen area at approximately 
        loc 1290, 3500. From there it is easy to find your way to the lands beyond.</p>
      <p>Realize what I stated above. Only on the docks are you safe. The races 
        of Antonica have established a beachhead, nothing more, and once you step 
        out of sight of the nearest guard, you fall prey to the dangers of this 
        continent. Bind yourself on the dock, if you are able, and stock up on 
        food and water, for it may be a long time before you see friendly faces 
        from home again...</p>
      <p><b>From Oasis of Marr</b><br>
        <i><b>(Thanks to Mynegon of CT for this section)</b></i></p>
      <p>The "Barrel Barge" leaves from the dock in Oasis. This is a relatively 
        safe spot to wait, but sometime it is visited by Sand Giants so you need 
        to be on your toes. The Barge makes a very sort trip, zoning quickly into 
        the Timorous Deep, and then quickly arriving at an island. It then almost 
        immediately heads back to Oasis making no other stops nor passing anything 
        else of interest. </p>
      <p>While the Barge is the start of the route to the Evil strong hold at 
        The Overthere, this part of the route is safe for Good travelers. There 
        are no NPCs at either end of the trip. </p>
      <p>The island you arrive at is nicknamed Ogre Junction. It's a large island 
        with a mountain on the North end, three mountains along the Southern side 
        corner with a big sandy plane in the middle. The Barge a lands in a cove 
        on the West side of the plane. </p>
      <p>At the South Western end of the Island is a small Ogre settlement. The 
        settlement consists of a few typical Ogre hunts, docks, and 15 or so Ogres, 
        mostly warrior types. These Orges are have the same faction as the Evil 
        outpost in Kunark, they will let pass Evil travelers including Necromancers 
        and Shadow Knights of any race. </p>
      <p>In the South East corner of the Island on a beach behind the mountain 
        is a Spiroc city. The Spiroc is a parrot race and their city looks much 
        like the Aviak city in South Karana. Some are at least in the high 30s 
        and they can be aggressive. </p>
      <p>While there are a few Ogres in in the Northern mountain, and the Spiroc 
        patrol around their city, the sandy center of the Island is uninhabited 
        and probably a safe place to rest. </p>
      <p>At the Junction docks a larger ship may be caught. The Bloated Belly 
        is a huge raft made from the hull of a wrecked ship. It must be seen to 
        be believed. Travelers not tolerated by the Ogres can probably not board 
        the ship from the docks. However the ship is very low to the water, and 
        it is possible to swim around and climb on. The ship has a number of barrels 
        attached to its sides, the trick is to find one that is low in the water 
        or at a 45 degree angle. It's easy to climb up those barrels and on to 
        what passes for the deck. It is also possible to simple run on to it when 
        levitating. Good travelers should be aware of the Ogres in the rocks when 
        maneuvering for the boat. </p>
      <p>The ship heads across the Timorous Deep passing two points of Interest. 
        The first is a grave yard of shipwrecks which forms an island. This island 
        is rumored to be the home of bandits. The ship actually takes in it's 
        sail and slows as it passes the wrecks so it's possible to board there. 
      </p>
      <p>The second is Chess Board Island with Spirocs and Iksar outcasts. It's 
        at about this point that the boat comes closest to the fire pot tower. 
        If that's your destination, jump off and head more or less South. Even 
        with the boat ride, it is still a very long swim. </p>
      <p>Finally the ship reaches The Overthere. As soon as the boat zones, Good 
        travelers should jump off the left side and swim to shore. Stay away from 
        the structures on your right. The boat pauses for a few minutes before 
        moving to the dock. Good travelers can use this opportunity to swim out 
        to the boat for the return trip. </p>
      <p>Once the boat starts moving again it arrives almost immediately at the 
        dock. This is the Evil stronghold in Kunark. It's the ruins of the Iksar's 
        Danak Shipyards. There are a number of buildings and a large open market 
        surrounded by the remains of a great wall. The area is well guarded and 
        should be a safe place to rest. Of note is a large open area called the 
        Spell Vendor Pavilion, where 51+ spells for all classes may be purchased 
        and spell quests start, a building full of clockwork merchants selling 
        mostly trade supplies, and a bank with two clockwork bankers. </p>
      <p>Beyond the encampment is the vast plane of The Overthere. It's probably 
        about the size of South Karana. It is teaming with life, and is a 20-40 
        hunting ground. The Frontier and Skyfire Mountains and Warsliks Woods 
        all lie beyond The Overthere and the entrance to a dungeon named Howling 
        Stones maybe be found near the center of the zone. </p>
      <p><b>Gating Into Kunark</b></p>
      <p>Although I have never seen them with my own eyes, there are rumored to 
        be some ancient Wizard and Druid portals that exist intact in the Dreadlands. 
        This area is a small distance from Firiona Vie through a small section 
        of tunnels that lead into the area surrounding the elven beachhead. These 
        are the only known portals on the entire continent, as the Combine Empire 
        did not rule this land as they did all the others.</p>
