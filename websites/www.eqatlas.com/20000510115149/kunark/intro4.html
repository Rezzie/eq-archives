      <h4>What's Bad in Kunark</h4>
      <p>Now onto what's bad with the expansion, or at least the things that are 
        going to upset people with the expansion when it comes out.</p>
      <p><b>Binding:</b> Binding is an important issue, both because the rules 
        have changed with the expansion and also because the continent design 
        has a heavy effect on all.</p>
      <p>Spellcasters can bind in any non-dungeon zone in the expansion. Non-spellcasters 
        can only be bound in city zones. It was previously mentioned that this 
        is two zones, and I'm not sure if they meant East and West Cabilis, or 
        if possibly one of the other city areas is bindable (i.e. Sebilis). I 
        believe (or I have heard) that it's possible to bind in Firiona Vie. At 
        any rate, very few areas.</p>
      <p>What does this mean? It means that all you warrior-types better get used 
        to begging for SoW if you plan on dying in the expansion. Verant stated 
        before that they want the continent to be vast and dangerous, and it certainly 
        is that. My fear is that it will be a continent run by the casters, as 
        the fighter-types will get sick of running around to get their bodies, 
        but this remains to be seen...</p>
      <p>The continent design, as I've mentioned above, is a big deal as well. 
        It is huge. Imagine that every zone you have to cross is equivalent in 
        size to Western Plains of Karana (the long direction) and you have a good 
        sense of what's involved with moving around Kunark. Can everyone say hours 
        of running around?</p>
      <p><b>Quests:</b> As I mentioned before, many of the quests are now dependent 
        of trade skills. Although I think this is more realistic (perhaps), my 
        guess is that not enough people either already know the trade skills necessary 
        to do the quest or will bother learning them. It's also unclear if any 
        of the races from outside of Kunark will have any access whatsoever to 
        these quests, as Cabilis is likely to be a hostile environment. Unless 
        they require bare minimum skill, they will likely go vastly underutilized.</p>
      <p><b>Merchants and Selling:</b> This kind of goes along with the binding 
        problem. I'm not sure that the new continent is going to be a place to 
        make lots of money, mostly because I haven't seen a large number of merchants 
        that you are going to be able to sell to. The Iksar can sell to the merchants 
        near Cabilis, but I haven't seen any others in any other zone so far. 
        The races from Antonica can only sell to the merchants on the docks in 
        Firiona Vie, as far as I've seen. All this means that you better get your 
        hands on some large bags fast and some strength-enhancing items if you 
        want to be walking around with tons of loot.</p>
      <p><b>Casual Gamer Effect:</b> This is merely my prediction, but my guess 
        is that the casual EQ gamer is going to hate playing in the expansion 
        with their old characters. Given the vast size and binding issues, entire 
        sessions could be spent recovering corpses and redying in new areas. Even 
        playing the Iksar is difficult, since money is scarce (so far). I'm predicting 
        a lot more anger rising out of this than we've seen to date.</p>
