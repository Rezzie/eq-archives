      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Mines of Nurga are part of the large underground home of the goblins. 
        Long ago the Mines were a vast network of busy tunnels, now all that remains 
        are the ruins of the functioning mine and slaves busy doing the work by 
        hand.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The entrance to the Mines is kind of tricky. There is a large waterfall 
        at the entrance from the Frontier Mountains, which is a very long, and 
        painful fall. This waterfall can actually be climbed if you're careful, 
        so isn't as dangerous as you might think. Going upstream actually leads 
        to a safer way to access most, but not all, of the rest of the Mines. 
        The entrance from Temple of Droga, however, is very one-way, and leads 
        down into a room with goblins in it deep within the Mines, so it's best 
        to be ready. 
      <p>All of the goblins in the Mines will aggro anyone, and many of them are 
        casters who cast damage shields. They also like to run away when they 
        are hurting, which can be dangerous with this many creatures around.
      <p>The spiders are tougher than the goblins are, and hit hard and move fast. 
        They also will group together to fight in that area. Located in their 
        area as well is the Sleeping Ogre, who really isn't sleeping and will 
        attack anyone inside of his huge aggro radius.
      <p>The Burynai are the hardest, mostly because they are in large groups 
        and come to fight that way. Crowd control is essential, and the pathing 
        in this area is known to be especially bad.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The Mines are one of the safer areas to hunt in the game. Unlike the 
        neighboring Temple of Droga, where it is difficult to get a rest from 
        the great number of goblins, here the creatures are spread out into discrete 
        areas that one can clear and pull from more easily. With about four or 
        five creatures in an area, this area can probably be hunted safely by 
        lower level groups than those that could survive or do well in the Temple.
      <p>The spiders here are also frequently of higher level than the goblins, 
        so higher level groups can make more experience hunting them than they 
        can anything else. There are also three relatively separate areas to hunt 
        within the dungeon. One is the goblins themselves, who occupy the most 
        easily accessible areas of the dungeon. The second is the spiders, who 
        are situated in the middle of the dungeon. The third area is the burynai 
        area, which is a relatively densely populated area of caves deep within 
        the mines.
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>M</font>ines Of <font size=+2>N</font>urga</h3>
      <p>The Mines can be reached in the Frontier Mountains, at location -2955, 
        -655. It is also possible to reach the Temple of Droga from deep within 
        the mines. This entrance, however, is one-way, and the return entrance 
        is quite a distance off.
