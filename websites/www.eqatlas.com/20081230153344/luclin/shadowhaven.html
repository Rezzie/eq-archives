      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Shadow Haven is a network of caverns that wind their way through Luclin, 
        and have been filled with the domain of several trade families, who make 
        Shadow Haven their home. The city also lays claim over the Bazaar and 
        the Nexus, and controls and provides security for those areas as well.
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>Shadow Haven is adjacent to two of the areas that it controls, the Bazaar 
        and the Nexus. The Bazaar is where Shadow Haven makes most of its revenue, 
        with the heavy amount of trade that occurs there. The Nexus is more important 
        to their business, however, since many people coming to or leaving from 
        Luclin need to pass through there. They are also connected to Paludal 
        Caverns, through which they send caravans to the Vah Shir city of Shar 
        Vahl. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size="+2">S</font>hadow <font size="+2">H</font>aven</h3>
      <p>The Nexus has a portal that takes you to and from Shadow Haven. One of 
        the two exits of the Bazaar is into Shadow Haven (the other into Nexus). 
        There is an obvious one way exit from Shadow Haven to the Echo Caverns 
        from one section of town, and a well-hidden two way entrance near the 
        Nexus teleporter here. Also, the tunnels to Paludal Caverns can be found 
        here, used for transporting goods to Shar Vahl.
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>Shadow Haven was very obviously built from a mixture of people and caverns. 
        The caverns were changed to accomodate those who wished to live there, 
        and bear striking resemblances to their homes on Norrath.
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The residents of Shadow Haven are generally suspicious and careful around 
        outsiders, although their living comes from making money off of outsiders 
        and they know it. They generally are willing to trade, and often have 
        others do small tasks for them in order to gain trust. They generally 
        consider themselves above the fighting and troubles of the rest of the 
        world, and even if they don't like you, they'll generally leave you alone.
