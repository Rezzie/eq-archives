      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Emerald Jungle is a vast, beautiful, and dangerous jungle. It is 
        separated from the rest of the continent by a large cliff where it is 
        sunken into the earth. An ancient city, its name long lost, lies hidden 
        in the twisted trees.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>The jungle is a vast, open area in which to hunt. The only thing truly 
        dangerous in the zone is the large number of aggressive monsters that 
        walk around the zone. Virtually every monster in this zone will attack 
        anyone on sight, and most can see through invisibility to better do so. 
        Given that the jungle is typically pretty dark and has a large amount 
        of foliage and ruins, this makes seeing these creatures before they jump 
        you even more difficult. Of special note is that there is a dragon named 
        Severilous that wanders the lower level of this zone, and given the limited 
        amount of visibility, should be something people scan for on tracking 
        if they have it at all times.
      <p>The only danger associated with the geography of the zone is the huge 
        cliff that runs across the western half of the zone. This divides the 
        zone very roughly into areas of weaker monsters (on top of the cliff) 
        and tougher monsters down below, although there is a lot of overlap. Do 
        not think this is a hill! If you run off of it, you more than likely will 
        die painfully. There is really only two safe ways down, either by levitating 
        or my taking the Grand Staircase near the northern end of the cliff. It 
        also should be noted that the zone exits are quite a ways away from where 
        you might be fighting, and one is on top of the cliff. Combining this 
        with how easily you can get turned around in the zone, and you could run 
        into problems.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>The jungle is a fairly open and very underhunted zone. Most people are 
        here either on their way to or from the City of Mist that lies within 
        it. The zone, however, is a relatively safe area to hunt with a wide range 
        of monsters. It is possible (although risky) to kite monsters here, since 
        in most areas away from the larger groups or ruins the monsters tend to 
        be scarce. There is also ample areas to pull monsters to the edge of the 
        cliffs if that's more to your liking. 
      <p>There are also a few areas with static spawns, and these are the iksar 
        outcast camps, which are filled with, you guessed it, iksar outcasts of 
        various sorts. Two of the three of these are along the walls of the jungle, 
        and the iksars within are some of the lower level monsters in the zone, 
        good for a group in the mid-30's.
      <p>Sadly, with all of this open space and opportunity for good hunting, 
        there are very few if any rare spawns and little in the way of rare equipment 
        here. Come here looking for experience, not goods, and you won't be upset.

        <font size=+2>E</font>merald <font size=+2>J</font>ungle</h3>
      <p>Emerald Jungle can be reached through the Field of Bone at location -1750, 
        -1250. This places you in the Emerald Jungle at approximately -1820, 5330. 
        From there you quickly reach a cliff face into the jungle below.
      <p>The City of Mist lies buried in the jungle, located at approximately 
        300, -1960.
      <p>There is also a connection to Trakanon's Teeth, located at -3425, 1570. 
      <p>The Wizard spell Markar's Relocation teleports the group to -1250, 3500.
      <p>The Druid spell Wind of the South teleports the group to -3100, 3500.
