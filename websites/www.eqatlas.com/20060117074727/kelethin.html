      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Kelethin is one of the most amazing cities in all of Norrath, a tree 
        city built peacefully around the trunks of the giant trees of the Greater 
        Faydark. I was seeking Bards in this part of the world, and a fellow traveller 
        who gave me directions told me to not look at my feet, but I had no idea 
        what he meant until I saw the bottoms of dozens of wooden platforms sticking 
        out of the mist. This is the ancestral home of the wood elves, and the 
        center of their society. Elevators can be raised and lowered to the surrounding 
        forest floor from some of the lower platforms, allowing easy access for 
        the wood elves and protection from those they would rather not have visiting. 
      <h3><font size=+2>S</font>urrounding <font size=+2>A</font>reas</h3>
      <p>The area surrounding Kelethin is swarming with life. Black wolves, wasp 
        drones, and bats move through the forest, and provide the targets for 
        many a budding archer from the city above. The nearby orc city of Crushbone 
        also sends scouts occasionally as far as Kelethin, but they have never 
        gained a foothold on the city's platforms themselves. 
      <p>Further from the main city lies the entrance to Crushbone itself. The 
        orcs have made camps ringing the entrance and many heroes (and corpses) 
        have been made by fighting the large orc families that live here. Faeries 
        also move through the woods, but they will leave the average traveller 
        alone unless they are known to hunt faerie-kin. The nearby smaller forest 
        of Lesser Faydark holds the portal to the land of both the gnomes and 
        is inhabited by more ferocious orcs and other, more horrible creatures. 
        The dwarven city of Kaladim lies through the Butcherblock Mountains and 
        their dangers. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>K</font>elethin</h3>
      <p>Kelethin is one of the four major cities on the continent of Faydwer, 
        the others being the cities of the high elves, the dwarves, and the gnomes. 
        They share Greater Faydark with the high elves, although the high elf 
        city of Felwithea is almost exactly the opposite of Kelethin, being a 
        grand and opulent city on the outside, and simple and beautiful on the 
        inside. The gnome city of Ak'Anon and the dwarven city of Kaladim are 
        both a short distance away, the first through the sparsely populated forest 
        of Lesser Faydark, and the second through the stretches of the Butcherblock 
        Mountains. 
      <p>As far as travelling abroad, Kelethin is about as far from a port as 
        you can be on this island, and the trip from Kaladim's port to the human 
        city of Freeport is a long and boring one. There is a set of magical gates 
        near the pass to Lesser Faydark that powerful mages are rumored to be 
        able to travel with, but they have been inactive for quite some time. 
      <h3><font size=+2>L</font>ocal <font size=+2>C</font>olor</h3>
      <p><b>Places</b> 
      <p>The city itself is really the site to see when you are in Kelethin. It 
        is incredible to an outsider (although I'm part elf myself) that these 
        wood elves live and work on platforms with no rails or protection from 
        falls to the ground below. Although personally not afraid of heights, 
        my barbarian friend who made the trip to this city with me refused to 
        ride the elevator to the platforms and curled up in a bush below to await 
        my return. I can't say that I blame him. 
      <p><b>People</b> 
      <p>The people of Kelethin are a quiet folk. They are sequestered away in 
        Greater Faydark, and since the population reveres nature as a rule, it 
        would be difficult to find any of the poachers or other misusers of the 
        gifts in Kelethin. It pains my human half to say it, but I feel that elves 
        are one of the truly beautiful races in Norrath, and this peaceful city 
        is a faint reflection of an inner peace and harmony that we all could 
        learn from.
