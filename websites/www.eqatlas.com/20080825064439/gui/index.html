      <h2>Download .zip file: <a href="eqatlasgui.zip">eqatlasgui.zip</a> (version 
        1.3) </h2>
      <p>Version 1.3 available - updated 9/22/2002<br>
        Version 1.2 still available - updated 9/10/2002 - <a href="eqatlasgui-1.2.zip">download</a></p>
      <h2>readme.txt</h2>
      <p>The EQ Atlas GUI XML Creator is a Java program that will allow you to 
        create a GUI component to display maps (or really any .jpg image) within 
        Everquest's new User Interface. The program looks at the images you have 
        in the install directory and creates a EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file, which will 
        replace your existing Help window in the game. 
      <p>What you need before you begin:</p>
      <p>1) EqAtlasGUI.jar (the executable java program that does this) - in eqatlasgui.zip 
        above </p>
      <p>2) Java VM 1.4.0 (can be obtained from <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>, 
        look for Java VM under downloads -- currently in upper right corner of 
        page). Windows XP does not come with a VM installed, and the VM's on older 
        Windows versions are probably not 1.4.0. This download is about 9 MB.</p>
      <p>3) .jpg or .jpeg image files (doesn't matter what they are, as long as 
        they are jpg files)</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Steps:</b></p>
      <p>1) Unzip the .zip file containing the files: readme.txt and EqAtlasGUI.jar 
        into the uifiles folder in your Everquest install directory. For example, 
        when selecting the directory in WinZip, you would choose c:\Everquest\uifiles 
        as the directory (replacing c:\Everquest with the directory you have EQ 
        installed in). The zip file will then unzip into c:\Everquest\uifiles\eqatlas 
        directory.</p>
      <p>2) Place all .jpg image files you want to use within the uifiles\eqatlas 
        directory (or in whatever directory you have the EqAtlasGUI.jar file). 
        They must be in the same directory for this to work correctly! You cannot 
        &quot;trick&quot; it and rename a png a jpg and expect it to work, it 
        will not.</p>
      <p>3) Double-click on EqAtlasGUI.jar. This will run the java program. Yes, 
        it's ugly.</p>
      <p>4) At this point, choose from among the options listed. Leave it on Normal 
        Textures the first time through, this will likely work. If you have a 
        Voodoo3 card or have problems with maps appearing crunched or deformed, 
        you can try the Voodoo3 Textures selection (this is beta code, I have 
        no way to test it so let me know if it works). If you want to have a screen 
        with fixed sizes for the tabs (for instance, if you have a lot of maps) 
        then choose Scrollable Tabs. Then enter the width in the space (it must 
        be a number) and then you must hit Enter! If you don't you will get an 
        error when you go to create the file.</p>
      <p>5) Click on the &quot;Create XML&quot; button. This will open up a file 
        chooser where you can select which jpg images to include in the file. 
        Do NOT choose images outside of this directory. This will cause it to 
        fail when you go to run it in EQ. Use shift-click and ctrl-click to select 
        more than one. All the images you want to use must be selected at this 
        time.</p>
      <p>6) When you're done selecting images, click the &quot;Create XML&quot; 
        button. The program will run, and this takes a few seconds. It will create 
        the EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file.</p>
      <p>7) Close the program. If you don't trust me, check that the EQUI_HelpWnd.xml 
        file is in the uifiles\eqatlas folder.</p>
      <p>8) Now you enter Everquest normally. If you have never used the new User 
        Interface before, you need to add the line &quot;NewUI=TRUE&quot; to the 
        [Defaults] section of the eqclient.ini file. This will activate the new 
        UI in all your characters.</p>
      <p>9) Once in the game, you will see the new UI. Type &quot;/loadskin eqatlas 
        1&quot; which will load the file you created above. It should work correctly, 
        if not, see below in the 'Errors' section. The &quot;1&quot; in that is 
        to maintain the location of all your current windows when you load the 
        different skin. If you don't have the Help window open normally, click 
        on the large ? at the top of the screen to see it.</p>
      <p>10) You're now using the program correctly! If you wish to add new images 
        or remove old ones, simply run the program again. I recommend choosing 
        less than 20 images, since the tabs get so small you have a hard time 
        telling which is which. You do not need to rerun the program every time 
        you play EQ, only if you want to change the images you've selected.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Errors:</b></p>
      <p>This is beta software, meaning there are probably errors in it. If you 
        followed the above instructions exactly, it *should* work correctly. If 
        you did not follow them, I can guarantee you that's why it didn't work.</p>
      <p>If you followed the above and it still didn't work, do the following: 
        send me an email at 
        <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
name="Muse";
site="eqatlas.com";
document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + name + '@' + site + '\">');
document.write(name + '@' + site + '</a>');
</SCRIPT>
        and include the following: the EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file that you were using, 
        the UIErrors.txt file from the Everquest directory, and a description 
        of what happened.</p>
      <p>You can also check out the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=12">GUI 
        Mod section</a> of the Forums at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">www.eqatlas.com</a>.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b></p>
      <p>Q: Does this violate the EULA?<br>
        A: No. SOE representatives have specifically said that maps in the GUI 
        are fine.</p>
      <p>Q: Do you have a way to download all your maps at once?<br>
        A: No, in fact I don't allow that. I want people who use this to go to 
        my pages and download the maps individually, so that the site can make 
        at least a small amount of money and continue to exist.</p>
      <p>Q: How do I download maps then?<br>
        A: Go to the page that has the image you want. Right-click on the image. 
        This will pop up a menu that, depending on your operating system and browser, 
        will say something like Save Image As... Select that and save it in the 
        uifiles/eqatlas directory. Just make sure it's a jpg file.</p>
      <p>Q: I am not using the default UI. How do I use this and that at the same 
        time?<br>
        A: You can copy the EqAtlasGUI.jar file and the images you are using to 
        the other directory and run it there. It doesn't care where it's located, 
        as long as the images are in the same directory. It will, however, overwrite 
        your EQUI_HelpWnd.xml file in that folder (if it exists), so you will 
        lose access to that original file.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Q: Can I make this replace any other window (like the Pet Window)?<br>
        A: No. Due to limitations in the way the new GUI works, specific files 
        have to contain certain components. If you look at the XML created, the 
        top contains components that are never even used in this modification. 
        If these are removed, the Help Window won't work. This is true for all 
        the other windows as well, so I would need to write one of these programs 
        for each one of those.</p>
      <p>Q: Can I rename this file something else and use it?<br>
        A: No. See the above Q/A.</p>
      <p>Q: It says &quot;Could not find the main class. Program will exit!&quot; 
        when I try and run it, what's wrong?<br>
        A: You probably have an old VM. See above in requirements.</p>
      <p>Q: When I try to load, nothing seems to happen, and the Help window is 
        the normal one. What's going on?<br>
        or When I try to load, I get an error like: &quot;eqatlas error, loading 
        default skin.&quot; What's going on?<br>
        A: Check the installation directory. It should be &lt;EQ Install Dir&gt;\uifiles\eqatlas 
        and the file EQUI_HelpWnd.xml should be in there. If that's wrong, it 
        needs to be. If that's correct, send me the information I mention above 
        in the Errors section.</p>
      <p>Q: I can only get one image to load, what's going on?<br>
        A: You need to select all the images you want to use at the same time 
        using shift-click and ctrl-click in order to load them all in the file.</p>
      <p>Q: When I try to run the EqAtlasGUI.jar, my unzipping program starts 
        up and tries to extract it. How do I get it to run correctly?<br>
        A: The problem is that .jar files are .zip files with a different name. 
        You need to set up the .jar files to be run by the program javaw that 
        came with the Java VM. This is located in the \bin directory of the java 
        installation. On Windows 98, the way to do this is to go under View in 
        a desktop menu and choose Folder Options... Then choose File Types and 
        find the jar files, it should be under Executable Jar File. If you can't 
        find it, you'll need to make a new one. If you can find it, edit it so 
        that it uses javaw. This is a bit complicated, but make a new action or 
        edit the open action, and choose javaw as the program.</p>
