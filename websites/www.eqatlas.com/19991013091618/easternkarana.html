<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
The Eastern Plains of Karana is a rough, partly hilly area on the eastern edge 
of the Plains of Karana. The area is frequented by many of the rarest and most 
dangerous creatures in all of Antonica, and is connected to the rest of the world 
only by two narrow mountain passes and one massive bridge. Some intrepid souls 
make their homes out here amidst the creatures. 
<h3>
<font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
This area is frequented by some very dangerous and aggressive creatures, many 
of which are similar to other areas of the Plains of Karana (hill giants, griffawns) 
and many more which are unique to this area (the gnoll and undead reavers, gorge 
hounds and war wolves, evil eyes, lion and lioness royalty). There is a lot of 
good hunting here, but it comes at the price of being very dangerous. Also, it 
is a fair distance from anyplace that you can bind safely at lower levels (you 
can bind High Hold Pass and Keep, but those are dangerous too) which can make 
the trip lengthy. 
<p>Given that this is the case, there are few places to hunt safely (other than 
  the edges of the zone) and no real guard to protect you or to run to. Random 
  death is the key here, and with so many creatures running around who are aggressive 
  (it's like you're in an angry zoo) I wouldn't recommend hunting here until you 
  reach 15th level, unless you are very good at avoiding dangers.
<p>Also note the presence of very high level killing machines that are here, like 
  the evil eyes, Broon and cyclops, name gnolls. Even if you're hunting carefully 
  within your level, these can certainly spoil your day.
<h3>
<font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
This area provides good hunting from 15th until about 25th level, roughly, as 
the area is just jam-packed with monsters that you'll be able to hunt. It also 
is somewhat less crowded than areas that are closer to the main cities. This makes 
the area good hunting for a careful group. 
<p>Sir Morgan is a well-known feature of this area. He is a plate-clad knight 
  who hangs out just east of the bridge from Northern Karana with his squire and 
  offers to guide you to the other side and protect you along the way. His price 
  is fairly cheap, and if you have bad luck avoiding danger, might be worth the 
  price to have this man guide you and keep your hide from harm.
<h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>E</font>astern <font size=+2>P</font>lains of <font size=+2>K</font>arana</h3>
The southern and western borders of this area are blocked by a vast river that 
continues flowing westward through the Plains of Karana. The sole way across this 
is over a massive bridge in the northern part of the western edge, likely built 
by giants many years ago, if anything can be guessed from the massive scale of 
the structure. 
<p>The pass to Highpass Hold lies on the eastern edge of the zone, through a very 
  long and narrow pass through the mountains.
<p>One can also travel into the Gorge of King Xorbb, which lies in the northeastern 
  corner. A trail leads past some shops on the way to the Gorge.
