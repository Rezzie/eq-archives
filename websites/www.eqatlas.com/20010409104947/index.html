            <blockquote> 
              <p>Just got back from the Fan Faire in San Diego. This was a cool 
                event that I had a lot of fun at, it's just too bad I couldn't 
                hang around for the Saturday night after-party &quot;festivities.&quot;</p>
              <p>There were some announcements that came out of it. One is that 
                the next Fan Faire is going to be on June 16-17 in Minneapolis, 
                MN. I think summer is there by then. The other big announcement 
                was that they are coming out with two servers next with different 
                rules. The first is a PvP server with an unknown-as-yet ruleset. 
                The second will be a role-playing server that Brad mentioned might 
                have restrictions (in some way) on grouping based on race and 
                religion, as well as a one-character-per-server rule. Should be 
                interesting.</p>
              <p>Brad and Jon also mentioned a few tidbits while specifically 
                not mentioning stuff. Jon said that although they weren't mentioning 
                supporting other platforms, they were in fact a Sony company, 
                so make of that fact what we will. Brad expanded to say that they 
                plan on following online gaming wherever it may lead, right now 
                that is on PC's. They also mentioned that although they aren't 
                announcing any expansions at the present time, they do plan on 
                enhancing the game for as long as it remains popular. They also 
                specifically didn't mention what race they might introduce next, 
                although when asked if it would be pixies, Jon specifically mentioned 
                that they weren't stupid. :)</p>

              <p>As an aside, sorry I haven't updated lately. There honestly hasn't 
                been that much sent into me to update, and I've been busy in my 
                job hunt. I don't expect it to pick up anytime soon, as I'm going 
                to the Fan Faire, then my parents are going to be in town, and 
                then I start working 90 hours a week again. I recommend you take 
                most questions to the Forums because you'll get a quicker response.</p>

              <p>I added in a <a href="hole.html">larger map of the Hole</a> that 
                is printable, but will take up the whole page on its own, so that 
                people can print that and see it a bit better. The one I put up 
                yesterday, I realized, was a bit small, especially when printed.</p>
              <p>Also, the new personal gate spells to the Dreadlands were added 
                in with this patch for wizards and druids. They are both level 
                24 spells. The wizard spell can be purchased in the Temple of 
                Solusek Ro by a new gnome vendor up on the balcony (it's not on 
                my map yet). The druid spell can be purchased from the druid guild 
                in Kelethin (#21 on my map). FYI, if you're looking for the Dreadlands 
                map, realize that it's separated into two pieces, the portals 
                are on the Lost Valley map (this question has almost reached FAQ 
                status, sadly).</p>
              <p>Also, shamans can now create a potion that will take you to the 
                Field of Bone at the bindable place in Kaesora ruins. I've updated 
                the Getting Around Guide appropriately.</p>

                Hole</b></a> today. Hope you enjoy it! Note that there is a paucity 
                of information about monsters and loot drops in this zone. If 
                you have any additional info, feel free to send it in.</p>
              <p>As to when I'll put up a new survey to get your opinions on where 
                to map, I'm holding off on that until I can see how deeply I can 
                penetrate into the Tower of Frozen Shadow. If I can't, it won't 
                be on the list, so I'm waiting to see.</p>
              <p>Also, it appears that the official boards at the Station were 
                closed down to be replaced by something more useful. I applaud 
                this, since these boards have been essentially useless for anything 
                other than complaining (hence the appropriate name &quot;Whineplay&quot;). 
                They have now become a place where you submit comments or ideas 
                that get reviewed before they are commented on by others, instead 
                of directly posting your thoughts. I'm normally not a fan of such 
                heavy-handedness, although that place really needed some help 
                (and by &quot;help&quot; I mean swift beatings with a heavy stick).</p>
