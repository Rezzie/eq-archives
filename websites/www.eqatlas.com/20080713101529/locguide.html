      <p>The /loc command is the single most useful command in this game for finding 
        yourself and getting around to different places. It is much better than 
        the Sense Heading skill for several reasons. Sense Heading must be trained, 
        and therefore is practically useless at lower levels, and is only really 
        reliable when you start hitting your high teens in level. Sense Heading 
        is also quite vague. You can be heading Southwest, turn a significant 
        amount, and still be heading Southwest. This is fine a lot of times, but 
        many (in fact, most) you need to know exactly where you are and where 
        you're headed. 
      <p>That's where the /loc command comes in. This guide will tell you how 
        to use /loc to find your way around. In case you all are wondering, all 
        of my maps have the places on them in their appropriate positions. The 
        reason I don't have a specific /loc printed out for each of them is that 
        you can look at the map, eyeball what the /loc would be, and head in that 
        direction and finally see it. 
      <h3>The /loc Button</h3>
      <p>Before I go on to describe how to use /loc effectively, you need to set 
        up a button devoted to the /loc command. This involves reassigning one 
        of your Social buttons to be a /loc button. First of all, pick a useless 
        Social button, like AFK or GM's. Then reassign this to be the /loc command 
        and place it in your hotkeys on the left side of your screen. If you know 
        how to do this, skip to the next section. I will briefly describe how 
        to do this (it's all in your manual as well).</p>
      <p>You go to the Social buttons section, and you will see a dozen or so 
        neatly arranged little buttons. Right-click on one of them, and it will 
        pop up in the chat window the reassignment window. The top bar you will 
        notice is the name that you saw on the button. Click on this and you can 
        type in whatever name you want, let's use &quot;loc&quot;. The bottom 
        part is similar, and this is where the actual command goes. Here you must 
        type &quot;/loc&quot; for it to work. Tada, you've reassigned the button! 
        Click Done, and you will see the little loc button on the right.</p>
      <p>Now you must move it to one of the hotkey areas in the lower left. Mine 
        is in spot five on page 2 of the hotkeys, my travel menu, but that's just 
        me. :) To do this, you left-click on the loc button and hold down the 
        button. After a second has passed, you will get a floating loc button. 
        Move this to the left side and click it into the spot you want. Now you 
        can either hit this button with your mouse to give you the /loc, or you 
        can use the numbers to do it (on mine I hit shift-2 to go to the second 
        window, then 5 for the loc button).</p>
      <h3>Everquest's Grid System</h3>
      <p>Everquest's grid system is unique. Not willing to follow the trend of 
        eons of mapping and coordinate systems, EQ's creators decided to create 
        their own. Although not difficult to master, anyone used to normal grid 
        systems will be confused by EQ's grid system from time to time. Even myself, 
        who has probably hit the /loc button more times than anyone in the game 
        (and you think I'm kidding) sometimes just sits and stares at the string 
        of /locs that I get, confused. Or maybe that's the beer. At any rate, 
        I'll explain to you how...</p>
      <p>There are three numbers in any /loc. These numbers can either be positive 
        or negative. The first number is the North/South coordinate location, 
        with positive numbers being more North. The second number is the West/East 
        location, with positive numbers being more West. That one is the confusing 
        one, as almost all systems make East the positive direction (hence North-South, 
        East-West), but in EQ it's flipped. The third number is Vertical location 
        (or altitude). This is really only useful if you are lost underwater and 
        want to figure out which way is up, and so I won't discuss it any more 
        in this article and focus on the first two numbers instead.</p>
      <p>This is the layout of a /loc result:</p>

      <p>Let's do some examples using just the first two digits. If we assume 
        a symmetric map (most of EQ's maps aren't this, but let's just assume)...</p>
      <p>-2478, 300<br>
        Southwest of center, far more south than west<br>
        512, -324<br>
        Northeast of center, slightly more north than east<br>
        512, 300<br>
        Northwest of center, slightly more north than west</p>
      <p>You simply have to get used to looking at them. Now on to how to use 
        them to replace Sense Heading.</p>
      <h3>The String of /locs</h3>
      <p>So you've figured out how to find out the /loc that you are at. The problem 
        is that that is useless. Why do you care, you're already there? What you 
        need is how to find out how to get from the /loc that you're at to the 
        /loc you want to be at. You could use Sense Heading and go in the general 
        direction, but this simply isn't practical most of the time, for the reasons 
        I mention above.</p>
      <p>What you need to do is use /loc repeatedly, creating the &quot;string 
        of /locs.&quot; This is where the true power of the /loc command comes 
        in to play. How do you do it? It's easy, you just keep hitting the hotkey 
        over and over as you run in a relatively straight line. What you need 
        to get going is just a bunch of sequential locs to analyse, the more the 
        better. The hard part is interpreting it.</p>
      <p>Now, if you want to get from point A to point B, the string of /locs 
        is easy to interpret and use. This is best seen with an example. Say you 
        enter the zone at /loc 2300, -800 and you know that the spot you died 
        in was at /loc -200, -500, and you want to get to your body (who doesn't, 
        right?). You start running into the zone, and you start hitting the loc 
        button. Your first loc that you get is 2250, -840. Are you heading in 
        the right direction?</p>
      <p>Let's think about it. Simply look at the /loc you're at and the one you 
        want to be at and compare the two. In the above example, you need to go 
        vastly negative (south) in the first number, and just a touch positive 
        (west) in the second number. It helps to be able to do math. So what you 
        want out of your /loc's is to see that trend, you want the first number 
        to be dropping quite quickly, and the second number to move only very 
        slightly more positive throughout your trip. Obviously at any point you 
        may have to reassess where you are and where you should be heading, but 
        this is fairly easy. You'll begin to feel like a spaz because you'll be 
        striking that loc button a thousand times...</p>
      <h3>Replacing Sense Heading with /loc</h3>
      <p>This is a more advanced topic, but one that is much more useful and powerful 
        than the use of /loc above. As I said before, Sense Heading can be vague. 
        Say you want to go east, but slightly to the north. Sense Heading will 
        just say &quot;You are heading East&quot; but that doesn't tell you if 
        you are headed slightly north or south during that trip. You need more 
        specific info.</p>
      <p>The first step, as above is to develop a string of locs. Say you are 
        a poor human, lost and blinded at night in North Karana looking for the 
        path to East Karana. You have no idea where in the zone you are or which 
        way you're headed, but you know you want to go to the east. Well, simply 
        start running and build up a string of locs, which might look like the 
        following:</p>
      <p>15, 130<br>
        5, 155<br>
        -5, 180<br>
        -15, 205<br>
        -25, 230</p>
      <p>You get the idea. Which direction are you headed with the above string? 
        Just analyze the numbers. Comparing the second (or fifth) set of numbers 
        to the first, you see that the first number has become more negative, 
        and the second number more positive. Negative, Positive, when looking 
        at the little table above, corresponds to South, West. See how easy? This 
        particular string can provide you with more info if you're quick at math. 
        The first number dropped 40 loc points, the second increased 100 loc points. 
        This tells you that you are heading more West than South, so like a West-Southwesterly 
        direction. To get pointed east, you can just turn until your string analysis 
        says you are heading East, using the above method.</p>
      <p>The other way to think of it is to say to yourself, okay, I want to head 
        east, what would my loc string look like? A purely easterly course would 
        mean that the first number in the loc would not change at all (no north/south 
        movement). The second number would be dropping steadily as you head more 
        easterly. You then start running and turning and do the string of locs 
        until you see this pattern emerge. This is a little brainless, but is 
        very simple to do and quite reliable, especially when you're in your 20th 
        hour of consecutive playing and can't remember where you put the coffee 
        pot...</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>With all of this said, I don't want you to go away thinking this is easy 
        to master. I was an engineer and math person, and have been hitting locs 
        since January (yes, the beta) and this still sometimes eludes me. My only 
        advice is practice practice practice. On a good awake day I can do two 
        locs (maybe three) and head to a spot on the opposite side of the zone 
        and hit it close enough to see it in the rain, simply by doing the math 
        and using the slew of information in the /loc command. Good luck!</p>
