<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>The Arena is a small zone with one prominent feature, the large PvP Arena in 
  the middle of it. It is rumored that the gods themselves once did battle in 
  this area, or possibly some ancient wizards, but the truth is unknown.
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>Despite the rumors, this zone is very safe. The only area of the zone that 
  is PvP is the Arena itself, which is a large ring shaped building in the middle 
  of the zone. The opening to the Arena lies on the opposite side of the entrance, 
  so it is impossible to accidentally step into the PvP area and be killed. Aside 
  from that, there are virtually no other players in this zone at any given time, 
  since there is practically nothing here.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>The main benefit of this zone is its relative safety. There are no monsters, 
  and most of the zone is not actually PvP. Characters can also be bound inside 
  of this zone, which is a much needed feature for good races hunting the aviak 
  town in South Karana or in Lake Rathetear or the Rathe Mountains. Nobody wants 
  to run from Qeynos or Highpass...
<p>The other benefit is that occasionally there are sanctioned battles in the 
  Arena, with prizes given out to the champions. On non-PvP servers, it is one 
  of the few places other than the cities individual arenas that allow PvP combat 
  for those who wish to enjoy it.
<h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
  <font size=+2>A</font>rena</h3>

<p>The Arena can be reached by entering from Lake Rathetear. In the northwest 
  corner of Lake Rathetear along its western border can be found a rather large 
  grassy area inhabited by aviaks, north of the barbarian village. The tunnel 
  to the Arena can be found there, flanked by two aviak lookout posts.
