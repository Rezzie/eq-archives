      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The history of Kurn's Tower is a convoluted one. The tower is named after 
        Kurn Machta, a warlord of the Sebilisian empire during Rile's reign. Rile's 
        son, Atrebe, performed many experiments on various creatures within Kurn's 
        Tower, eventually resulting in the creation of the Sarnak race. Now, however, 
        the remains of the temple are haunted by the creatures destroyed in those 
        experiments, and the burynai are using their necromantic powers to slowly 
        reclaim the Tower.
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This zone is filled from top to bottom with undead. These undead are 
        also highly aggressive, regardless of your level, so travelling freely 
        between areas is not really possible. Expect to be jumped by every skeleton 
        you pass, and the skeletons are occasionally on patrol. Obviously, you 
        need to be prepared to deal with this problem.
      <p>On the lower levels, the undead are mixed in with burynai that are often 
        of the necromancer or shadowknight classes. These burynai cast all of 
        the available necromancer spells and can Harm Touch you, but are not as 
        aggressive as the undead. There are many areas, however, where there are 
        many of them closely packed together.
      <p>The other danger is in moving between the lower levels. To move from 
        the basement to the catacombs requires a drop through one of two very 
        deep holes. Once in the catacombs, the only way out is through an exit 
        that leads you to the Field of Bone outside. Having levitation or lots 
        of hit points around is useful for these drops.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Kurn's Tower is an excellent step up for the Iksar from Cabilis who are 
        hunting in the Field of Bone. As far as hunting goes, the zone is a relatively 
        safe area to hunt. Most of the monsters spawn in predictable spots away 
        from other monsters (or large groups of them). They can be pulled easily 
        and, since they are mostly undead, you don't need to worry about runners. 
        This makes hunting either solo or in a small group fairly easy to do. 
        Trains are very rare here, and if they exist consist of maybe one or two 
        skeletons that the poor person simply couldn't finish off.
      <p>Also, there is some nice loot here. First of all, any necromancer from 
        anywhere nearby should hunt here, since you can gather hordes of bones 
        for the future, as well as be able to use your undead-oriented spells. 
        The creatures in the lower levels occasionally drop bronze weapons and 
        spell research components, and provide some good money for the level of 
        the creatures that are here. Also, monks spend a great deal of time here 
        acquiring quest components.
      <p>Also, the zone is largely empty. There is usually a small cluster of 
        people situated in the front entryway, but the other levels are typically 
        completely empty. Pick a room, any room, and pull all the other rooms 
        on the floor if you want to.

        <font size=+2>K</font>urn's <font size=+2>T</font>ower</h3>
      <p>Kurn's Tower is the most impressive structure in the Field of Bone, jutting 
        from the ground at the north end of the ancient reservoir.
