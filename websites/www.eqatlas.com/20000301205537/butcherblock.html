      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Butcherblock is a massive zone, one of several large zones on the continent 
        of Faydwer. It lies between Greater Faydark and the Ocean of Tears, and 
        holds the docks for the boat leaving to Freeport on its edge. The dwarven 
        city of Kaladim is one of the impressive sites in this region, and many 
        tall ridges separate this region up into areas that are almost zones unto 
        themselves. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Butcherblocks greatest dangers are those that you bring on yourself. 
        What I mean by this is that there are not a large number of roaming aggressive 
        monsters, but instead there are a large number of creatures that exist 
        in camps that are dangerous and will group up and crush you, and it is 
        easy to feel like you can take on a camp only to realize too late that 
        there was a goblin shaman hiding in a tent or that the other undead pawn 
        was a little too close on the Chessboard. The only creatures that I see 
        consistently presenting a danger of this sort are the orc runners that 
        occasionally move through the farthest region of Butcherblock, near the 
        zone edge to Greater Faydark. The huts here offer false solace, there 
        are no guards and the NPC's will attack nothing that comes here, except 
        characters. 
      <p>Most of the danger here is represented in dangerous areas and camps. 
        By far the most dangerous is the Chessboard, a very disturbing area that 
        can easily be your grave unless you are extremely careful. The area seems 
        quiet enough, but attacking one of these very powerful undead when it 
        is too close to another can quickly spell your demise. Most of the other 
        dangerous areas or the goblin camps, which spawn goblins ranging in levels 
        from 4th to 9th or 10th, including occasionally a goblin shaman or wizard, 
        which are tougher than their level lets on. There are also several aggressive 
        skeleton spawn spots at the ruins further out, and several camps of aggressive 
        dwarf bandits. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Butcherblock is, by far, one of my favorite zones to start a character 
        in. You could honestly never leave the zone, travelling within its confines 
        until you reached 7th or 8th level, and you could adventure there even 
        longer in a group. Eventually, the need for something elsewhere will drag 
        you away, but I guarantee you'll be back. One of my babies in the beta 
        was a dwarven cleric, and I miss travelling in this zone. 
      <p>That said, now on to the reasoning behind my beliefs. First off, the 
        zone is never that crowded. It is so spread out that it rarely becomes 
        a nuisance that there are too many people around, and there are entire 
        areas that you can hunt in with maybe one other person as the only other 
        player you see all night long. You get experience quicker in this environment 
        as well as wealth, and I was buddies will all of those other characters 
        who hunted in my area, as I would often take a deep breath after a tough 
        battle to turn around and find them there, watching me in case something 
        went horribly wrong. 
      <p>As I mentioned above, the zone itself can effectively be broken up into 
        more zones within it, as guard houses keep monsters from entering other 
        areas and the walls prevent much cross-wandering. This is good if you 
        want to get away from the rush and hunt in your own area. It is also good 
        because the designers took advantage of this and created areas within 
        Butcherblock to suit someone of every level. Like I said (probably too 
        often) above, you could live in this zone for the first 8 levels of your 
        character, which is good for rogues, for instance, who have to keep going 
        home to get a new skill. 
      <p>The other good thing about the zone is that there are a number of places 
        to sell and buy goods without having to zone. There are a set of huts 
        by the zone to Greater Faydark with all manner of goods that other adventurers 
        have sold there. There are also huts along the water edge closer to the 
        docks, and there are high elves making a killing selling food to people 
        by the docks themselves. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>B</font>utcherblock</h3>
      <p>Kaladim's entrance lies in the middle of the northern edge of the zone. 
        West of the huge statue that signifies the home of the dwarves is the 
        dock, where you can catch the very infrequent boat to Freeport (don't 
        miss it!). Listen for cries of "boat!!" and stay close, as the wait is 
        long and painful. 
      <p>To the east lies the zone to Greater Faydark. The tunnel lies in the 
        eastern mountains. The entrance to Dagnor's Cauldron lies in the southern 
        wall of the zone.
