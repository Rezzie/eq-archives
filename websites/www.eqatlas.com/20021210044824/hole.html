      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Hole was created at the end of the Erudin/Heretic war, when the Heretics 
      used their magical powers to punch a hole in the earth deep into the depths 
      of Odus. Within this deep shaft they built their city of Paineel. However, 
      they penetrated too deeply and, unknown to them at first, they had touched 
      upon the Plane of Underfoot itself, which had been cast onto the earth in 
      eons past. In the years after the city was built, they became aware of the 
      enemy below them and attempted to block them in, but with the arrival of 
      the great Master Yael, the elementals and minions of Brell swept through 
      the city on one gruesome night, destroying everything in their path. The 
      Heretics were forced to retreat to their highest outpost, the site of the 
      current city of Paineel. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      <p>Levitate does not work in the Hole, so attempting to use it, either by 
        dropping in from Paineel above or to move down the outer shaft around 
        the castle, will be painful. Also, once you step off the very first ledge 
        in the dungeon, you have to either be able to teleport out or find the 
        key to escape, because there is no way to make it back up to the ledge 
        without the key.
      <p>The rest of the dungeon is broken into several discrete areas. Most of 
        the city area, including the front castle, is filled with elementals of 
        various types, many of which are casters. There are also ratman warriors 
        and rock golems that are mixed in with the elementals. These are all high 
        level (around level 50) and some will summon. Combine this with wandering 
        monsters and this area is very difficult to adventure in. Having at least 
        one full group of level 50+ is necessary to do well here.
      <p>Further in stands the tower filled with undead. Unlike the rest of the 
        dungeon, there are no elementals in this tower. The tower is tightly packed 
        with rooms and monsters, and is vertical, so it is a dangerous place to 
        hunt. Many of the undead are necromancers and shadow knights. This is 
        generally considered the most dangerous area to hunt, because of the high 
        number of aggressive monsters you will get with each pull.
      <p>At the deepest part of the Hole lies the area of Master Yael, the leader 
        of the elementals. He stands before a locked door which, so far, has no 
        key. This presumably leads to the Plane of Underfoot. Master Yael has 
        the ability to death touch people fighting him.
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Many of the monsters in the Hole fit the category of &quot;summoned&quot; 
        creatures, which means that classes that get the line of spells that affect 
        summoned creatures (e.g. Dismiss Summoned) will be significantly more 
        effective fighting in this zone. Most of the rest count as undead creatures, 
        which is good for the clerics and paladins in the group. </p>
      <p>Most of the loot in the dungeon is on a random cycle, which means that 
        fighting any monsters of the appropriate type will give you any of the 
        items on the random rotation. Some of the items drop off of specific creatures, 
        and are very good, but these are the exception to the rule. Most of the 
        named creatures will drop withered leather armor at times.</p>
      <p>This zone is a haven for the high-level weapon quests for all the classes. 
        No less than six different classes (that I can think of) have to make 
        their own trips to the depths of the Hole to obtain vital components for 
        their quests. Getting to know the area at some point is, therefore, a 
        good idea.</p>
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>T</font>he <font size=+2>H</font>ole</h3>
      <p>There are two ways to enter the Hole, both from within the Erudite city 
        of Paineel. The first is through the large hole with the waterfall in 
        Paineel. This, however, is not a safe way to enter the city. Levitate 
        gets stripped when you enter the zone, and you will fall for lethal damage 
        at the feet of Master Yael at the bottom of the zone.</p>
      <p>The other way is through a small, locked boulder located in the area 
        just past the newbie area in Paineel. You will need to be able to pick 
        locks in order to open this, but evil races can purchase the key in Paineel 
        for quite a large sum (around 100-120 pp). Also, smaller races or creatures 
        (like wolf form or some illusions) can fit through the rocks with a little 
        work, although they must be careful not to drown while doing so.</p>
