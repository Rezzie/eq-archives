      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Lesser Faydark is a dark forest which, unlike its neighbor Greater Faydark, 
        has been overrun by the evil orcs and bandits. There are also small camps 
        of Pixies, Faeries, and Brownies, as well as the mighty Fae Drakes, all 
        of whom make this zone their home. The proximity of Castle Mistmoor sends 
        a taint throughout the region... 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This is a mid-level zone, designed for group of adventurers higher than 
        7th level, or solo adventurers higher than tenth. The main reason these 
        level limits exist is because orc centurions, which range approximately 
        from 9th-10th, wander the zone on patrol from their respective camps, 
        and are difficult to avoid. A lower level character attacked by one of 
        these would need to be very quick and know their way around to avoid a 
        death and difficult chore of finding their corpse here. 
      <p>Most of the other monsters in this zone reside in camps. As such, travel 
        is relatively safe with almost no aggressive monsters (barring the mummy 
        and centurions) that wander around. However, most of the other monsters 
        that wander can begin to dislike you as you kill more of their kin. These 
        include the Fae Drakes and the Pixies and Faeries, who are all frequently 
        seen travelling through the zone, but are generally neutral to their neighbors. 
      <p>One of the largest dangers in the zone, however, are the Brownies that 
        live in the town to the north. These creatures of the forest are very 
        aggressive, and are KOS to just about everyone (the only people I've seen 
        spared are druids in Wolf Form). They are all at least 45th level and 
        are Druids, so are capable of taking down even a very well trained group 
        quickly. Accidentally walk near their town and you better know an invisibility 
        spell for recovering your corpse... Unless, of course, you can take on 
        wolf form, in which case they'll gladly sell to you... 
      <p>There is another danger that recently surfaced, that of the Tier'Dal 
        that currently inhabit the abandoned camp of Wu along the southern border 
        of the camp. These Tier'Dal are aggressive and powerful, and the trains 
        caused by someone inadvertantly stumbling across them can wreak havoc 
        across the forest.
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>If you are able to get over living in constant darkness, this area provides 
        good hunting for mid-level characters. The camps are usually not camped 
        (well, the bandit camps are), and you can travel around making money off 
        of the orcs that fill the southern half of the region. If you are brave, 
        you can start making enemies of the other races in the area and make money 
        off of them as well. They are all well equipped with loot and provide 
        good money to an adventurer. 
      <p>There are other, more subtle, benefits to this zone. People who want 
        to rip our their hair in Greater Faydark with the constant chatter will 
        find it remarkable absent in this zone. There is also a small enclave 
        of very high level wood elves living in a small hut in the middle of the 
        zone, who you can sell to for good prices as well as buy food from. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>L</font>esser <font size=+2>F</font>aydark</h3>
      <p>To the north, in the northeastern corner, lies the pass that connects 
        the great forest of Lesser Faydark and Greater Faydark. Just south of 
        that on the eastern wall lies the pass that leads into the Steamfont Mountains, 
        home of the gnomes. 
      <p>In the southwestern corner lies the narrow pass that separates the rest 
        of the world from Castle Mistmoore, rumored to be home to an ancient dark 
        elf vampire. Many who pass through here never return...
