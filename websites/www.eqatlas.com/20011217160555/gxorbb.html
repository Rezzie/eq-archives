      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      The Gorge of King Xorbb, alternately known as the Beholder's Maze, is a 
      narrow collection of gulleys and ravines that are very similar to those 
      in Highpass Hold, however, unlike its southern neighbor, this area has much 
      less friendly occupants. The nearby goblins of Runnyeye Citadel keep a vigilant 
      watch on all who pass through here, and a western variety of minotaur makes 
      this area their home. Also, this area is known for its most dangerous occupants, 
      the evil eyes. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>D</font>angers</h3>
      The most obvious danger in this area are the creatures. Every single one 
      is aggressive and very strong, and narrow gorges make any combat here even 
      more dangerous, as your enemies buddies will happen to walk by sometime 
      soon, almost guaranteed. The muddites are very strong for their size, and 
      these living blocks of clay are generally a bit tougher than they /con to 
      you, as they can deal out and take a large amount of damage. The minotaurs 
      are also very strong. The evil eyes are the pinnacle of dangerous. They 
      are armed with many spells and one of them was able to kill my 11th level 
      ranger with one spell. They are enchanters, and are notorious for charming 
      a groupmate and killing off your whole party. I've heard that these evil 
      eyes are weaker than the ones in Runnyeye itself. Be very careful around 
      these creatures. 
      <p>In order to avoid these creatures, especially if you are just passing 
        through, the common method is to run high up on the wall to get from one 
        end to the other. By staying as far up as possible, you will be out of 
        the range for monsters to notice you. The downside to this is falling 
        damage. The route from Runnyeye to Eastern Karana involves staying to 
        the left and up on the left wall the whole way, but there is at least 
        one spot where the slope vanishes as you round a corner and you will take 
        some damage. This is enhanced greatly by any speed-enhancing spell, so 
        you people possessed by the Spirit of the Wolf or singing Accelerando 
        might want to slow it down a bit or face taking the absurd amount of falling 
        damage you might take. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      This area is just plain good hunting. Most of the people either sit at either 
      entrance and draw creatures to the entrance (Runnyeye side more than Eastern 
      Karana side) or are sitting around the King's Throne. Lower level adventurers 
      can actually hunt quite well on the low level goblin lookouts while higher 
      level adventurers can pull muddites or minotaurs to the edges. The evil 
      eyes are usually taken out by groups near their spawn spots. 
      <p>In addition to these traditional camping areas, the farther regions of 
        the zone provide some very good, out of the way nooks in which a party 
        could camp and pull creatures out of the main path, and without a great 
        deal of competition. I haven't seen any groups taking advantage of this, 
        perhaps because it's scary to not have a zone edge at your back here, 
        but it is certainly possible. 
      <h3> <font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>G</font>orge of <font size=+2>K</font>ing <font size=+2>X</font>orbb</h3>
      From the west, adventurers would pass through Eastern Plains of Karana and 
      through the pass into the southwestern corner of this zone. 
      <p>From the east, adventurers would need to pass through the Halfling city 
        of Rivervale and Misty Thicket, and then make a brief run through Runnyeye 
        Citadel, home of the goblins, to reach the southeastern edge of the Gorge. 
        Passing through Runnyeye to reach here involves taking every right turn 
        and quickly leaving the Citadel.
