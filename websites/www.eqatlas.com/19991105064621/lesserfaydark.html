<h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>

<p>Lesser Faydark is a dark forest which, unlike its neighbor Greater Faydark, has been overrun by the evil orcs and bandits.  There are also small camps of Pixies, Faeries, and Brownies, as well as the mighty Fae Drakes, all of whom make this zone their home.  The proximity of Castle Mistmoor sends a taint throughout the region...
<h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>

<p>This is a mid-level zone, designed for group of adventurers higher than 7th level, or solo adventurers higher than tenth.  The main reason these level limits exist is because orc centurions, which range approximately from 9th-10th, wander the zone on patrol from their respective camps, and are difficult to avoid.  A lower level character attacked by one of these would need to be very quick and know their way around to avoid a death and difficult chore of finding their corpse here.
<p>Most of the other monsters in this zone reside in camps.  As such, travel is relatively safe with almost no aggressive monsters (barring the mummy and centurions) that wander around.  However, most of the other monsters that wander can begin to dislike you as you kill more of their kin.  These include the Fae Drakes and the Pixies and Faeries, who are all frequently seen travelling through the zone, but are generally neutral to their neighbors.
<h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>

<p>If you are able to get over living in constant darkness, this area provides good hunting for mid-level characters.  The camps are usually not camped (well, the bandit camps are), and you can travel around making money off of the orcs that fill the southern half of the region.  If you are brave, you can start making enemies of the other races in the area and make money off of them as well.  They are all well equipped with loot and provide good money to an adventurer.
<p>There are other, more subtle, benefits to this zone.  People who want to rip our their hair in Greater Faydark with the constant chatter will find it remarkable absent in this zone.  There is also a small enclave of very high level wood elves living in a small hut in the middle of the zone, who you can sell to for good prices as well as buy food from.

<p>To the north, in the northeastern corner, lies the pass that connects the great forest of Lesser Faydark and Greater Faydark.  Just south of that on the eastern wall lies the pass that leads into the Steamfont Mountains, home of the gnomes.
<p>In the southeastern corner lies the narrow pass that separates the rest of the world from Castle Mistmoor, rumored to be home to an ancient dark elf vampire.  Many who pass through here never return...
