      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Dagnor's Cauldron is a barren wasteland that separates Butcherblock Mountains 
        from the haunted Estate to the south. One can't imagine what manner of 
        impact, whether magical or natural, rent this landscape to make it as 
        twisted and ugly as it is now. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Dagnor's Cauldron is a barren zone, grey stone covered with small amounts 
        of red and green moss, and very broken. The aggressive aqua goblins roam 
        all over this zone, as do the undertow skeletons, and are often difficult 
        to see due to the terrain. As such, travelling through the zone is an 
        exercise in keeping ones eyes peeled for approaching or lurking danger. 
      <p>The other danger in the Cauldron is from the terrain itself. Since many 
        people travel through here at enhanced speeds, shall we say, they have 
        to take into consideration that falling off of some of these rock formations 
        can be painful. My record so far is 151 hit points from one fall, while 
        running sideways along a cliff and not sped up. I shudder to think if 
        I had the Spirit of the Wolf in me and had been going straight over the 
        top. The safest way from north to south is along the edge of the water 
        on the west side. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>Dagnor's Cauldron doesn't have many advantages over other zones on Faydwer. 
        I suppose you could adventure there and kill snakes at lower levels, and 
        pick off aqua goblins as you get to higher levels, but it's probably more 
        work than it's worth. Just move into Unrest. The zone is basically a difficult 
        place to travel through on the way to Unrest. 
      <p>There are two unique bonuses to this zone. First of all, this zone's 
        version of &quot;guards&quot; is the NPC camp at the northwest end of 
        the lake. They provide grudging protection if you need it, and will also 
        heal you if you ask. The other individual is found on the island in the 
        center of the lake, Corium Darkblade. He can make poison for you if you 
        want him to, for a small fee. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>D</font>agnor's <font size=+2>C</font>auldron</h3>
      <p>From the north the entrance to Dagnor's Cauldron is easily missed, a 
        crevasse in the rock wall on the southern edge of Butcherblock Mountains. 
        The path to the south of the crossroads leads the traveller there. The 
        only exit from the south of the Cauldron is into the Estate of Unrest. 
        The entrance to Kedge Keep lies underwater in the southern edge of the 
        lake.
