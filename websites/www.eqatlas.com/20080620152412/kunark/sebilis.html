      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Sebilis is the vast, ancient capital of the Iksar Empire, founded long 
        ago by the Emperor Venril Sathir. From here, the Iksar Empire ruled for 
        many years. Then the serpents, led by Trakanon, came and destroyed the 
        Empire and their capital city, claiming it as their own. Since then, it 
        has fallen into ruins. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>This is one of the dungeons where the entrance is not the same as the 
        exit. Upon passing through the entry portal, you are dropped into the 
        entry room on the first floor. From there, it may seem like a short run 
        to the exit, but it really is not given the powerful inhabitants of the 
        zone. Although there are two portals out in this zone, it is almost a 
        necessity to be able to teleport out in order to do so safely, as trying 
        to make it to these teleports is not at all easy.
      <p>Every single one of the monsters in this zone is close to 50th level, 
        and most are more powerful, and anyone fighting here has to be aware that 
        this is what they are facing. Most of the monsters also come in at least 
        pairs, and often in larger groups, so it is essential to have some sort 
        crowd control when fighting here, as well as a good group. Few groups 
        here are less than 50th level, even though it is possible to fight in 
        the entry corridor at a lower level.
      <p>One of the other problems is that there are several doors in this dungeon 
        that are locked and require a Rogue with a substantial Lockpicking skill 
        in order to open. These areas that are cut off by a locked door include 
        the Crypt Area and the area with Trakanon in it, so if you want to go 
        to those, be sure to bring a Rogue along with you.  The door leading to Trakanon can actually be opened without a Rogue, so it isn't as difficult as it first seems.
      <p>Trakanon resides deep within the dungeon in an open-aired cavern. He 
        is waited on by his assistant Tolapumj, and they are both exceedingly 
        powerful monsters to try and take down, although they also drop some of 
        the best equipment in the game. The other problem with fighting them is 
        that the area around where they are is very tricky to navigate because 
        of the water nearby, so fighting here is more of a hassle. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone has some of the best loot in the game outside of Veeshan's 
        Peak, and is generally filled with level 50+ characters. In fact, this 
        is as close as most of the even high-level characters can expect to get 
        to Veeshan's Peak in terms of loot and experience. Expect to get very 
        used to fighting in this zone once you break level 50.
      <p>Other than the loot (if that can even be said), this zone's main benefit 
        is that of being a large hunting ground for players that are very high 
        in level. The dungeon has several relatively separated areas that you 
        can go to in order to hunt for the creatures that are there, and there 
        are very few trains (as there is little place to run to).
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>ebilis</h3>
      <p>Sebilis can be reached through Trakanon's Teeth, through a portal buried 
        under the ruins of the city above. The easiest way to find it is to face 
        west at the most eastern part of the surface town, and there you will 
        see three buildings, one wide one on the right and two narrower ones on 
        the left. Pass directly between the wide one and the middle narrow one 
        and you will see a tunnel leading down. To enter, you need to find a red 
        sphere buried under some ruins, and also have the correct key to activate 
        the portal. The key can be obtained by getting two medallion pieces from 
        a Froglok Hunter and Forager in Trakanon's Teeth and giving them to Emperor 
        Ganak.
