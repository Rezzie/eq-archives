      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>The Swamp of No Hope is a vast marsh, extending from the southeast corner 
        of Cabilis far to the east. After the fall of the Iksar empire, the frogloks, 
        ancient enemies of the Iksar, retook the swamp and made it their home, 
        building a massive town deep within the swamp and near to the spring that 
        feeds it all. From there they, to this day, retain control over the swamp, 
        despite frequent conflicts with the Iksar of Cabilis, who occasionally 
        take them as slaves. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Overall, the swamp is not very dangerous to travel through if you are 
        careful and keep your eyes open. The only aggressive creatures are banished 
        Iksar and skeletons, both of which stick out like a sore thumb in the 
        green swamp, and the frogloks, which you can usually hear coming from 
        quite a ways away. The problem comes when traveling through the swamp 
        quickly, where it is easy to come over the crest of a hill or through 
        the dense underbrush and run directly into one of these creatures. This 
        is especially dangerous anywhere outside of the safer area near Cabilis, 
        as many of the frogloks and banished Iksar are at least in their teens 
        in levels.
      <p>That being said, fighting in the swamp is actually quite dangerous. There 
        are a lot of wandering monsters, especially in the area near Frogtown 
        where the frogloks are constantly wandering, but the same problem exists 
        in all places. It is very difficult to find a place to fight monsters 
        where others will not walk by and join in the fight, and any group hunting 
        here has to be prepared for that.
      <p>There are several small outposts of banished Iksar and some haunted ruins 
        scattered throughout the swamp, but the area of major importance is Frogtown, 
        the home of the frogloks. This area has high concentrations of frogloks 
        all living closely together. They also have roaming patrols around the 
        area at all times. These factors make it dangerous for anything other 
        than a well-orchestrated attack by a good group when attacking the town 
        itself. There is only one ramp, although you can flee readily off of the 
        platforms of the town itself. Just be sure to save some extra hit points 
        for the fall... 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This area is a vast area that at most times seems to be underpopulated, 
        both by monsters and by adventurers seeking a fortune. However, this is 
        mostly due to difficulties in finding out what to do in the swamp, and 
        not for lack of something to do. 
      <p>There are many isolated camps throughout the swamp that make good hunting 
        for people of the appropriate levels. Also, it is relatively safe to hunt 
        along the edges, and there are many creatures in the swamp, between the 
        everpresent leeches and mosquitos and the other wandering monsters.
      <p>Frogtown itself provides a good opportunity for groups. There are many 
        places on the platform that provide relatively safe spots to pull from, 
        with a little bit of difficulty in getting to them. Once established, 
        a group could pull a whole section of platform quite well, and escape 
        off of the edge if need be to the swamp below. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>S</font>wamp <font size=+2>O</font>f <font size="+2">N</font>o 
        <font size="+2">H</font>ope</h3>
      <p>The city of Cabilis has a small outpost in the northwestern section of 
        the swamp, with a small area of relative safety surrounding this. Slightly 
        to the east of this safe area is a small pass that leads to the Field 
        of Bone. The southern edge of the swamp has many small passes into the 
        forest near the elven fortress of Firiona Vie. To the east, the spring 
        that feeds the swamp lies in a small tunnel that leads into the hills. 
        The intrepid explorer could sneak past the Iksar outcasts that call this 
        cave home and into the ancient mountains of Trakanon's Teeth, home of 
        Sebilis itself.
