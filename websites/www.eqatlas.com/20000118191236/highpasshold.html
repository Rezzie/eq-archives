      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>escription</h3>
      <p>Highpass Hold lies along the main travel route from Qeynos to Freeport, 
        and is a mountain pass guarded as well as possible by the valiant guards 
        of Highpass Keep. Orcs and gnolls have patrols that run up to the foot 
        of the Keep itself, and the brave Highpass citizens have carved out their 
        homes out of the gulleys and nooks. 
      <h3><font size=+2>D</font>angers </h3>
      <p>Highpass Hold is dangerous to lower level adventurers because of the 
        high level gnolls and orcs that are frequently found just inside either 
        entrance. The orcs control the southern entrance and are more powerful 
        than the gnolls that command the northern entrance. Rarely do the guards 
        venture this far out in order to keep their area safe, so the traveller 
        must either travel invisibly or quickly, or hope that some other adventurers 
        are hunting these creatures to keep the area safe. 
      <p>The other danger to the zone is a group of NPC's that have set up a camp 
        in a small nook directly out from the gates of the city. They are highly 
        aggressive to any traveller, although for some reason the guards of the 
        city turn a blind eye to their presence. There is also a secret area of 
        bandits that can be found if you swim under the bridge by the Tiger's 
        Roar. Most people haven't interacted with them, as they are either too 
        scared or too high level, so let me know what they do. 
      <h3><font size=+2>B</font>enefits</h3>
      <p>This zone's biggest attraction is as a stopping off point for people 
        travelling from one end of Antonica to the other. Most of the people here 
        are either just passing through or on their way to the Keep for some rare 
        item or spell. 
      <p>There is also something of an economy here at the foot of the Keep. Out 
        of the six buildings, three of them contain bars (there apparently isn't 
        much to do up here except drink) and there is also good support for a 
        variety of trade skills, especially brewing and pottery, as all the equipment 
        and materials for these can be found here. There are also several good 
        inns in the area. 
      <h3><font size=+2>T</font>ravelling <font size=+2>T</font>o and <font size=+2>F</font>rom 
        <font size=+2>H</font>ighpass <font size=+2>H</font>old</h3>
      <p>Coming from Freeport an adventurer reaches Kithicor Forest before passing 
        into the southern edge of Highpass Hold. Out of the eastern edge of Highpass 
        Hold lies Highpass Keep. From the northern edge of the Hold one passes 
        into Eastern Karana and winds their way down a long, narrow gorge until 
        finally reaches the Plains of Karana.
