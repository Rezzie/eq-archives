        Broodlings </h2>
      <h4 align: left align="center">by Shadjakin Shadowheart</h4>
      <p>Well, I am very pleased with myself. Yesterday, when I arrived at home 
        I had received my Kunarks CDs. After a couple hours of installation and 
        patching I was ready to make my first Iksar. </p>
      <p>Iced - Shaman </p>
      <p>So I puttered around the Field of Bone and Swamp of No Hope for a bit 
        and made it two level 2. I then decided I wanted to see if I could find 
        the way to Freeport. Nothing better for exploration than a newbie. </p>
      <p>After a bunch of deaths in the Swamp of No Hope and Firionia Vie I decided 
        to try the other port I had heard of. </p>
      <p>More deaths, but I eventually made it to the Dark Elf City in Overthere. 
        From there it was pretty easy to make it to Freeport. </p>
      <p>Here is the safest route I found in all my exploration. Sorry if some 
        of this is vague, as I have not checked any maps yet. </p>
      <p><b>Field of Bone</b>: </p>
      <p>Starting from your bind point in the Field of Bone run ahead down the 
        path to the deserts edge. Follow the desert with it on your right hand 
        side until you reach the road that crosses from the hills into the desert. 
        Turn left there and follow the road to where it dead ends at the mountains. 
        Put the mountain on your left hand side and follow the wall. You should 
        zone pretty quickly into Warsliks Woods.<sp></p>
      <p><b>Warsliks Woods</b>:<sp> </p>
      <p>When you zoned you arrived in a little valley. Watch our for gobins here. 
        Cross the valley parallel to the zone and put the mountians on your right 
        hand side. Follow them to the ocean. Stop at the cliffs edge. With the 
        ocean on your right, follow the cliff until it takes you down to the sea. 
        From there you swim out to a little island with 4 pillars on top of it. 
        Once you reach this island you can continue to follow the coast by swimming 
        until you reach the end of the zone. When you run out of beach, turn inland 
        with the mountians on your right and follow the zone edge in. You should 
        find the Overthere zone after a bit. </p>
      <p><b>The Overthere</b>: </p>
      <p>Head straight out of the zone valley to the plains bearing a bit to the 
        right. Your goal is the Dark Elf city at about 3000, 2000. The walls are 
        nice and big so you should be able to see it from some distance off. </p>
      <p>My shaman and monk were both KoS here as was the warrior I guided across 
        the second time I made the trip. So go to the right hand side of the city 
        keeping a cautious distance from the walls. Your goal is to find the beach. 
        I moved about halfway down the cliff and was able to easily spot the boat 
        when it zoned in (looks like a floating wreck) and swim out to it. </p>
      <p>The skeletons on the dock were KoS so I cowered on the far side of the 
        boat and was safe there. After waiting at the docks for a bit, the boat 
        moved out and into the Timorous Deep. </p>
      <p><b>Timorous Deep</b>: </p>
      <p>I recommend not moving around on the boat, I fell off the first time 
        <grins> If you do fall off the dock the boat goes to at the ogre camp 
        is at about loc 5600, 3000. (Thanks to those nice people who gave me a 
        loc) The ogres here all conned indiferent to all of my Iksar chars. Get 
        off at docks on this island and put the water on your left and walk to 
        the next cove. **<i>Note that since the change, the ogres are now KOS 
        to the Iksar... --Muse </i>**</p>
      <p>You want to catch the Barge in this cove. There is not much in the way 
        of land marks, but it is the first cove past the docks area. The barges 
        do not come to land so you will need to swim out to them again. They do 
        stop however, so you have time to try a few times to get on. </p>
      <p>From there the barge will sail out to Oasis.</p>
      <p><b>Oasis of Marr</b>: </p>
      <p>The barge will take you straight to the docks here. Get off and put the 
        water on your right side and run. You should make it to the North Ro zone 
        pretty quickly. </p>
      <p><i>&lt;Note that from here on out, the factions are likely to have changed, 
        as Verant has made Iksar KOS in all the normal cities. Proceed with caution 
        -- Muse&gt;</i></p>
      <p><b>North Ro</b>: </p>
      <p>Follow the waters edge all the way to the Barbarian Fishing village. 
        The vendors here conned apprehensive. Odd thing is the fisherman conned 
        Amiable to my shaman, but Indifferent to my Monk. Not sure why. Anyhow, 
        from here put the zone edge hills on your right and follow them in to 
        Freeport. </p>
      <p><b>Freeport</b>: </p>
      <p>The Freeport Militia conned Apprehensive, the Merchants Indifferent. 
        So you should be free to walk around most of East Freeport. </p>
      <p>In West Freeport the Monks and the Casters Guild were both KoS. Avoid 
        those places. </p>
      <p>In North Freeport, the Paladins were Dubious as were the bards. I did 
        not get to con the Clerics. </p>
      <p>It was quite and adventure and it was fun running around nervous as hell 
        the first time. Special thanks to all of you who helped, most specifically 
        Nukemzukem (level 17 Troll Shaman) for the help with getting on the Barge.
