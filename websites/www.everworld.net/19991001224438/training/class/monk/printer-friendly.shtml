<center><h2>The Monk</h2></center>
Welcome to the ranks of the most elite fighting class in all of Norrath. There is something to be said for any individual that wants to become a monk. Wanting to take on the varied and dangerous creatures of Norrath with nothing but your fists and kicks says much of you. Hopefully this guide will help you on your career as a monk.
<p>
The first thing to do is create your alter ego. You will have 20 extra points to distribute amongst your attributes. ALL the attributes are important and ALL play a part in your adventures. Verant has done a fantastic job of making all the stats viable. It is personal choice where you want your points allocated. Obviously, some are more directly important to you as a monk than others. For the monk characters I have played in beta I normally allocate the points to strength and agility.
<p>
After this comes the deity selection. Beyond starting location, I have found little difference in between choosing Agnostic or Quellious the Tranquil. Perhaps if I were a higher level this may make a difference. I have heard rumors that some merchants may not trade with you if you are agnostic and they are aligned with a certain religion. However, I cannot confirm this. 
Agnostic monks start in Qeynos and Quellious monks start in Freeport. Both are large human cities, with everything you need to begin at your disposal. When you enter the world, the first thing to do is take your guild note to your guild so that you can receive your guild tunic and a bit of experience. You will also have 5 points to allocate to your skills. I HIGHLY recommend that you put a minimum of 2 points into the skill MEND at every level until 10th or 11th level. MEND is a monk specific skill that you can use to heal damage to yourself. It recycles approximately every 5 minutes real time and can be a lifesaver. At my current level (10) I heal about 2 bubbles of life when the skill succeeds. My skill in mend is around the upper 40's as I practice it constantly, whenever it recycles, even if I am not wounded.  Also, for those new to the game, once a skill reaches a certain point (20 I think...) if you choose to increase this skill at your guild, you will have to pay money for each point put into the skill starting at 1copper then increasing by 1 copper per point.
I will not go into creatures you should or should not fight, beyond saying/con everything. For People that are new to the game, monsters vary a lot in how tough they are even if they are of the same race. So just because that Orc centurion you killed a second ago was an even match, it doesn't mean the next one you come across will be.  I only recommend that if the creature /cons as blue, it is worth experience, so go for it. Some people would rather walk right by 3 or 4 monsters that /con as  "looks like you have the upper hand" well they look for an EVEN or a SLIGHT RISK fight. 
Weather you are in Qeynos or Freeport, there are newbie zones right outside the gates that should tide you over until you are 3rd level and want to venture a bit further away from the safety of the gates.

<center><font size="4"><b>SKILLS</b></font></center>
Monks start with dodge and dual wield at 1st level, which is very impressive. Warriors do not get dodge until 6th level or dual wield until 15th. Dodge checks every time you are in combat and if successful, you dodge an opponents attack. 
Here is a breakdown of all monk skills that are attained with level increase and what levels the skills are available at. Please remember that you must "buy" the skill initially at the lowest level (rated as awful) in order for the skill to be able to be used by you.
<ul>
 <li><a href="#01">SAFE FALL</a> (Level 3)</li>
 <li><a href="#02">ROUND KICK</a> (Level 5)</li>
 <li><a href="#03">SNEAK</a> (Level 8)</li>
 <li><a href="#04">TIGER CLAW</a> (Level 10)</li>
 <li><a href="#05">BLOCK</a> (Level 12)</li>
 <li><a href="#06">DOUBLE ATTACK</a> (Level 15)</li>
 <li><a href="#07">FEIGN DEATH</a> (Level 17)</li>
 <li><a href="#08">EAGLE STRIKE</a> (Level 20)</li>
 <li><a href="#09">DRAGON PUNCH </a>(Level 25)</li>
 <li><a href="#10">DISARM</a> (Level 27)</li>
 <li><a href="#11">FLYING KICK</a> (Level 30)</li>
 <li><a href="#12">RIPOSTE</a> (Level 35)</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<blockquote>
<DD><a name="01"><b>Safe fall:</b></a><br> This skill, if successfully used, allows you to fall great distances with little or no damage. This skill takes great patience to train, as you have to physically fall, and take damage if the skill fails, to get good with it.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="02"><b>Round kick:</b></a><br> Self-explanatory. An upgraded kick.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="03"><b>Sneak:</b></a><br> If used successfully you can sneak right past guards. Handy in some areas of the game.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="04"><b>Tiger claw:</b></a><br> A variation of the punch. I believe this is magical, I am not certain however as I have not fought anything requiring magical weapons with my monk.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="05"><b>Block:</b></a><br> Automatically checked in combat- blocks opponent attacks.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="06"><b>Double attack:</b></a><br> Self explanatory.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="07"><b>Feign Death:</b></a><br> I have heard from many higher level monks that this skill is one of the best in the monk's arsenal. If successful, you will fall to the ground and monsters will think you dead, there fore stopping any attacks on you. Very handy if a large monster happens to spawn right next to you.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="08"><b>Eagle Strike:</b></a><br> Combat attack- I have not seen the animation for it so I am not certain what it looks like.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="09"><b>Dragon punch:</b></a><br> A punching attack that does impressive damage based on skill.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="10"><b>Disarm:</b></a><br> self explanatory- allows you to disarm an opponent if skill is successful.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="11"><b>Flying kick:</b></a><br> THE most powerful attack of the monk. If your skill is high enough, you can do upwards of 70 hit points of damage to an enemy.</dd>
<p>
<DD><a name="12"><b>Riposte:</b></a><br> The ability to take your opponents attack and turn it against them to do damage.</DD>
</blockquote><p>
SO the guards at Mistmoore killed you? Oh well....
The great thing about being a monk I have heard from many other monks and I myself also believe is the "disposability" of your character. It is a huge advantage not having to worry about saving enormous sums of money to buy that next big weapon, or saving up to get that chain mail tunic. The monk can only wear leather. My character wears patchwork and I am happy with it. If my character happens to die, which happens allot in this game, it is not a great loss monetarily. You can easily recover from death as you only have a few platinum's worth of armor if you are wearing patchwork. If you are a high level warrior and die, you HAVE to go retrieve your corpse as most individuals of high level have invested enormous amounts of time getting the money to buy the armor they wear. Remember, your mind and body ARE the weapon- you do not rely on "crutches" like metal armor and swords!
<p>
May fortune follow your fists!!
