<center><h2>The Wizard</h2></center>
So ye wish to learn the arts of magic.   Know that the road to becoming a great wizard is a long road indeed.  I have only begun to unravel the basic mysteries myself, but I will tell you all I know.  Pay attention now for he who has a wandering mind will soon find himself wandering the realm of the dead.
<p>
<center><font size="4"><b>THE GOOD</b></font></center>
We are indeed unrivaled throughout the land.  There are none who can strike down a beast faster than a powerful wizard.  We are the masters of offense, for the quicker one can kill his opponent the better.  There are also very few who have the ability to gate (a spell which enables one to return to ones homepoint from anywhere on Norrath), and fewer still who can open gates big enough for others to travel through.  The more lessons one learns  the greater an assett he becomes to any party.  Did anyone ever tell Gandalf he was not welcome in a group!
<p>
<center><font size="4"><b>THE BAD</b></font></center>
We are wizards not warriors.  You should understand that as soon as possible.  In melee combat we are worth about as much as a child throwing a stone at the wall.  We are weak of body and cannot sustain damage as well as a fighter can.  Due to the nature of our magic we are also limited to cloth type clothing to protect us.  If this does not appeal to you then the door is that way, but before you go know this.  Without the powers of a strong wizard many a party would fail.
<p>
<center><font size="4"><b>CHARACTER CREATION</b></font></center>
A wizards strength lies not in his body but in his mind.  Intelligence is the single most important trait for a successful wizard.  Put all the points you can into Intelligence.  This will allow you to not only have more mana in which to cast more spells, but it will also allow you to learn skills at a greater pace.  With your remaining points I would suggest placing them into either stamina or dexterity or both.  I feel that placing it all into Stamina is the best choice.  The more stamina you have, the more hit points you have, the longer you will survive.  However, dexterity also improves your chances of not being interrupted while casting.  In the end it is up to you.
<p>
<center><font size="4"><b>IN THE BEGINNING</b></font></center>
Any apprentice needs a teacher, therefore upon entering Norrath seek out your guild hall and master.  This is important as he will be able to train you as well as give you your guild robe once you hand him the guild note.  The robe will be your first piece of protection and you will need all you can get.  Once you have introduced yourself you have 5 points in which to train.  I would suggest either spending all your points on piercing in order to help you survive in the lower levels as you will most likely be alone, or save the points for a later date.  The reason behind this is that a wizard is very limited in choice of weapons.  One starts with a dagger which does less dmg then a staff but is much faster.  Many prefer to save the points to train in a staff when they either are able to purchase one or are lucky enough to find one.  Either way is good but I believe training in piercing is better.  You need to survive in the early stages.  Later on you wont be fighting in melee as much and therefore it becomes irrelevant.  I personally like to save my points to train in evocation, which is the art of direct damage, since spells are ones bread and butter.
<p>
Once you have trained for your fourth time I would suggest learning meditate.  This skill will allow you gain mana at a much faster rate.  This will allow you to get back into the thick of things that much faster.  Only spend a point in it as you will master it quickly with you high intelligence.
<p>
<center><font size="4"><b>THE BASICS</b></font></center>
Now you are ready to begin your studies.  Open your spellbook and begin scribing Minor Shielding and Shock of Frost, which are already in your inventory.  To do this simply left click on the spell and then drag it to a spot in your spellbook and left click again.  This takes a bit of time so make sure not to do anything else unless you interrupt the process of scribing the spell.  Once you have done this you are ready to memorize your spells.  Again left click the spell and drag it to a slot to the left of your spellbook (there are eight), then left click again on the spot you want the spell to be placed in.  You will now begin to memorize the spell.  Again one must focus on this task.  Memorization may seem very slow at first, but worry not it gets faster as you grow in power.   Now you are ready to cast, and possibly explore your new surroundings.  Cast Minor Shielding as this will protect you in two ways.  It will not only provide a bit of protection, but it will also give you more hit points.  To cast Shock of Frost simply left click on your intended target and then left click on the spell which you placed in a slot earlier.  The chances are you may "fizzle", this happens because one has yet to master the spell and school of magic at ones current level.  With practice not only will your skill improve but fizzles will also lessen.  Just try again and eventually you will get it to work.

<center><font size="4"><b>SUGGESTED SPELLS</b></font></center>
Money does not always come easy to a wizard, especially at lower levels, and it will cost you money in order to purchase that new spell you have had your eye on.  Some wizards like me cannot stand having a spellbook that is incomplete.  If you are like me then you will need alot of money.  I would suggest taking up some form of trade such as fishing in order to earn some spare cash.  Also do not spend your money frivolously.  Save all the money you can for your spells.  Once you reach the next circle of spells at level four, you can blow it all on some new toys.  I personally believe that all the spells are worth buying, for each one has a use and can help you in mastering that school of magic.  However, there is also another approach for those who are either having a bit of trouble making a living and/or simply do not want certain spells. Following is a list of spells I feel are a must have for a wizard to survive.
<p>
<DD><b>1st Circle/Level 1</b></dd> <br>Shock of Frost for damage, and Minor Shielding which will give you a boost to your armor class and hit points (this is easy, you already start with these two!)
<p>
<DD><b>2nd Circle/Level 4</b></dd> <br>Shock of Fire for more damage, Gate which will allow you to return to your starting point if ever you are lost or simply want to go home very fast, and Root, which will hold a creature in place if it works, which will allow you or a friend to either escape or cast at will with no fear of damage.
<p>
<DD><b>3rd Circle/Level 8</b></dd> <br>Shock of Ice for even more damage, Lesser Shielding which will give you more armor class, hit points, and a bit of magic resistance to boot, and Column of Frost since you are now grouping with others most likely and may fight multiple opponents, this will help to hurt all of them in one stroke.
<p>
I cannot stress what you will miss if you simply skip some of these other great spells, but those listed above are good enough to get you by.  From here on out you are on your own.
<p>
<center><font size="4"><b>TIPS</b></font></center>
Following are a few tips that might make life a bit easier for you.
<ol>
 <li>Con everything (in order to do this you left click the target and then right click in order to find out its difficulty).  This is especially important for a wizard because of the low amount of hitpoints you start with.</li>
 <li>Figure out what looks like the easiest creature to fight.  Near Felwithe it is a bat.  Fight about ten of these and you will reach the 2nd level.  Stick to the easy stuff at first in order to get a hang of things.</li>
 <li>Do you jump into the water to grab a fish?  Nay you bring the fish to you.  I would suggest casting a spell at a creature from afar in order to lure it to yourself.  Stay near the guards, if things go wrong you wont have a long run to safety.</li>
 <li>Save your money in the bank.  Spells get really expensive and its better to plan ahead. </li>
 <li>Finally if you are in a group dont burn all of your mana.  If the fighters in the group look like they are ok then you dont really need to cast.  This will lessen the time they have to wait on you for your mana to replenish.</li>
</ol>

Well my friend I hope I did not scare you away.  The wizard is one to be feared and respected.  Many of literatures most memorable and powerfull characters were wizards.  Gandalf, Raistlin, Fizban, Elminster, the list goes on.  I hope that you consider this path for it is a rewarding one indeed.  As my master Tarker Blazetoss says, "Go out and bring honor to our guild!"
