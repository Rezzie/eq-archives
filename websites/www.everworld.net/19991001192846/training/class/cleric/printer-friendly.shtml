<center><h2>The Cleric</h2></center>
Of all the classes in Norrath, perhaps none are as valuable in a group as a cleric.  While alone, the cleric can hold his or her own against a small group of monsters, a cleric's true strength is shown while in a group.  While the fighters take the brunt of the attack, the cleric can alternate between healing the fighters and taking a few whacks at the enemies.
When a cleric is alone he will often have trouble casting his spells as almost all of them, until they have been used quite a few times,  take time to cast.  My dwarven cleric had major problems getting spells off in between the attacks of most monsters.  Also, because of the nature of a cleric, he or she is best adept to handle skeletons and the other undead of Norrath.  This is where the true strength of the cleric is apparent.  From their first level to their fourteenth level, they are given a spell to combat the undead minions that abound in Norrath.
<p>
Well, now for the bad points.  First off, the clerics have the hardest financial situation of all.  Their ability to wear armor and cast spells puts them in a class all by themselves when it comes to needing money.  Be prepared to save every copper piece you find.  Buy bags upon bags so that you can carry every scrap of treasure (even if it's only worth a couple of copper) you find.  The clerics also get a very poor schedule of "spell levels".  The cleric can learn new spells at level 1 of course, level 5, level 9, and level 14.  After that, new spells are apparently only found outside of the cleric's training houses.  I don't know, I've only gone as high as level 11 with my clerics.  But, you can only buy cleric spells up to level fourteen from any vendors I've found.
<p>
Once you reach about level nine, you will start taking on stronger creatures than other classes could simply because you can prepare yourself for the battle with defensive spells, and heal yourself during battle.  And should you find yourself outmatched after all, then the cleric has a nifty little "get away" spell called "Divine Aura" which prevents the cleric from casting any other spells or attacking, but makes him or her invulnerable to any kind of attack.  This spell doesn't work for long, so make sure you run as fast as possible towards a guard.
I for one found that a few of the spells a cleric gets are practically useless.  So, to make sure you get the ones you really need first, here are my suggestions:  
<p>
Level one:  Minor Healing, Courage, and Divine Aura.  (You start with the first two)
<p>
Level five:  Light heal, Holy Armor, Gate, and Ward Undead.
<p>
Level Nine:  Center, Hammer of Wrath(Useful when you have just died and need to retrieve a corpse), and Root.

<font size="1">Here are two cleric training houses. One in Kaladim, another in Felwithe.</font></center>
<p>
In addition to spells, you will have to train in a few different areas as you progress.  At level one, throw everything into one handed blunt.  Your starter club isn't very useful, and you will need to kill things quickly or risk dying.  Also, don't let your courage spell lapse, it will definitely make a difference in battle at the lower levels.
When you hit level two, you can spread the points out between some trade skill and fighting skills.  After all, you will need all the cash you can get.  When you start to make some trade items, see if you can sell them to other players if possible.  You will get more cash than if you sell them to a vendor.
Once you get to level eight, head straight to the nearest cleric's training house and learn just the basics of meditation.  If you train in meditation once, you will increase the skill further just simply by meditating later on.  At level fifteen, you can learn how to dodge enemy attacks.  Learn this one as well, perhaps even blow all five points on it.  This skill will help you to dodge attacks and hopefully avoid so many interruptions during spellcasting.  At level thirty, you can begin to train in specialize.  Although I'm not sure, I would assume that this means specializing in certain spell types.  The cleric gets a total of 5 areas in which he or she can specialize.  And since there are 5 types of spellcasting skills a cleric has, it makes sense to me.
<p>
Here's a chart showing the different skill levels of the cleric:<p>
