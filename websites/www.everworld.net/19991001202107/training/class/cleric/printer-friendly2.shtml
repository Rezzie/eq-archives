<center><h2>The Cleric</h2></center>
So you might want to become one of Norrath’s many Clerics? In this beginner’s
guide I hope to help you decide if being a cleric is a good choice for you, and help you
along the fist few levels. First and foremost I must state that being a Cleric isn’t easy
money wise. Right now I’m still a beginner and I’m pinching every copper for that new
set of armor or that new spell. Here is a short lost of pros and cons:
<UL>
Pros
<LI>Although there are a lot of Clerics you will probably ALWAYS find a party.</LI>
<LI>Your health is usually the last bar you are watching.</LI>
<LI>After level 9 it’s free food and drink!</LI>
<LI>You can battle Undead that a warrior of the same level wouldn’t touch! (I would take
on yellow mummies alone.</LI>
<LI>You can buff yourself enough to be at par with most “tanks”.</LI>
<LI>You get good offense & defense spells but you can also dish out damage in melee.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
Cons
<LI>While pure tanks sit around waiting for their health bar to fill you do the same for your
mana bar. Really level 7 is hell waiting for your meditate skill.</LI>
<LI>Money! You never have any! At level 8 I was torn between saving for armor and those
nice 5 plat spells. It’s a balancing game.</LI>
<LI>You can become a zone’s food, water, and cure center (This can be a pro but I’m not
fond of it, but it comes with the job. You can charge for this, but I never do unless it’s for
RP reasons [i.e. my Cleric hates Dark Elves so a cure doesn’t come cheap.])</LI>
<LI>Picking up a trade is hard because you never have money to spend on it.. at least in the
lower levels. I am a blacksmith cleric and have never done more than sharpened a few
maces.</LI>
</UL>
Sure.. that list may of helped but here is why I chose to become a cleric:
<p>
	In Phase 4 I started out as a Human Rogue. I got to level 7 and lost my corpse
during a crash -- because it was beta I had no choice but to start over. I decided to
become a Barbarian Rogue (More of a Fighter/Thief). I got to level 7 again and I realized
that I was getting bored with this hack and slash nonsense, I wanted to play with magic,
and I wanted to travel! At the end of  P4 I became an Erudite Magician. It was quite the
change from the Barb Rogue.. too much. I was accustom to dishing out damage and
taking it. I liked the spells but not my ATK/HP. So I decided that for final I would
become a Cleric (I chose High Elf because my good friend was going to be a High Elf
Paladin). Being a cleric allows me to solo good and group good. I can “tank” a party if
really needed or I can sit back and let the tanks do their job.
<P>
NOTE: If you decide you want to be more of a fighter than a Cleric probably a Paladin is
a better profession for you!
<P>
At level 10 (yes that’s it! I don’t know how there are level 20 something’s already!) do I
have some regrets about being a Cleric? Yes! When I got a full set of leather armor I was
so happy... until I saw that 10 Warrior with almost a full set of Ringmail (not quite.. but
still). But, you have to remember, that 10 Warrior can’t add 20 HPs to his total and buff
up his AC alone! And when he’s out of health during battle he’s out of health for good!
<P>
Now that you want to be a cleric (I hope) what race should you be? There are only 7
races that can be clerics. They are: Dark Elves, Dwarfs, Erudites, Gnomes, Halflings,
High Elves, and Humans. Barbarians, Ogres, and Trolls should check out the Shaman
class. Half Elves or Wood Elves should choose between being a Human, High Elf, or
Dark Elf -- No hafies in this class <g>. The three main requisites of a cleric are: Strength,
Stamina, and Wisdom. Below is a chart of the different races and bases.

Race is really personal preference. It’s all how you want to play the game. If you want to
be more of a tank and less then a healer be a dwarf! If you want to have the most mana be
a High Elf (also the weakest). If you don’t like your base stats you can always modify
them enough. I wanted my High Elf Cleric to have a little more pow in his hits so I put
his strength up a bit. If you wanted your human to have a little more mana put some
points into wisdom. So really any race can be a good Cleric.
<P>
Now we have race, where to begin? The first levels of any class are about the same and
consist of beating up monsters in the newbie fields. Buy a backpack and a bag and LOOT
EVERYTHING -- even if it’s worth a copper or too! Remember that 100 copper is one
gold! A Cleric starts with Courage and Light Healing. Keep Courage always on! It adds
HP and AC! At level 4 you get to drool over the pure spell casters who get a new set of
spells, you don’t get new ones until level 5. So what spells should you get? I’d
recommend: Divine Aura (30 seconds of Invulnerability is a LIFESAVER I still have it
memorized at level 10), Strike, and I enjoyed Yaulp (18 seconds of +10 STR for 5 mana,
what a deal!). When you hit level 4 you can also get the ability to Channel, or recover
when distracted during a spell.
<P>
At level 5 prepare to cash in on 5 GP spells. I got and enjoyed: Minor Healing, Summon
Drink (Saves on money!), Holy Armor (Adds AC, nice buffing spell), Furor (an Improved
Strike), Ward Undead (Let’s you take on the Undead nicely! Take on black undead with
no fear!), and cure disease (I helped those poor saps in Ro from Rabies). Now you have a
problem. What spells to keep memorized and what ones to leave in the book. This
depends totally on your zone and takes a lot of testing.
<P>
Now between level 5 and 9 you have to do three things money wise. Improve armor,
attack, and keep money for those 5 plat 9 spells. I chose to get filled up on patch work
and got a few leather articles (and covered everything else with cloth from Orc pawns --
being an elf is nice because you can wear small and medium making about everything
you find and a newbie useable). By level 4 you should have gotten a rusty mace or worn
great staff. Between 5 - 9 you should either tarnish your weapon or I got a bronzed mace
for 4 plat. Remember though, at level 9 you get a spell that summons a weapon better
than a bronzed mace. If you go 1H weapon you may want a shield. I ended up getting a
buckler cheap and kept it until late level 9 when I found a wooden shield off of
something. Saving of spells is hard too. I ended up barely getting 3 level 9 spells when I
turned 9 (mostly because of luck! I killed a madman in a group and got a bronzed long
sword that sold for 3 plat. Also I sold my bronzed mace for 3 plat to get the Hammer of
Wraith spell)
<P>
At 8 run to your temple and learn the basics in meditate. THANK TUNRE!
<P>
For level 9 spells I recommend (currently. I haven’t tried them all out), Word of Pain
(radius damage that does about 24 per person), Summon Food (Aye I can spend days
from a city!), Hammer of Wraith, Center (Adds TWENTY Hit Points!! You become a
popular man if you give this to your tanks!), and Root.
<P>
Now I’m at level 10. Pinching copper for ringmail. Perhaps at level 23 or so I’ll write an
intermediate guide to priest hood!
<P>
P.S. at level 14 I am getting the bind spell to travel across Norrath! Perhaps I’ll see you
on Xegony!
<P>
Oh! Just a reminder that a kind Cleric is a remembered Cleric. Trust me! Saving a poor
sap from a certain death usually comes right back at you someday! On the other hand,
watching a person die is remembered too for a long time and comes back at you too.
