        The demon, he says, will cause The Sundering. Before the beggar can answer

        from the cave, falling on Praxi from above. The beggar taunts Praxi into 
        a duel. Praxi easily binds the beggar, and knocks him down after a few 
        solid blows. The beggar crumples. Praxi, thinking the beggar dead, returns 
        to Rivervale to rest and recover from the fight. The beggar lies motionless

        in a duel.</font></p>

        Mystykyl, charged her with a raised pick-axe. Ursin stepped in swinging 
        his broadswoard, and in a single stroke laid the beggar to rest, ending 
        his maddening rant one more time.</font></p>

        Kaanen has a vision and tells Saavedra and Viyy that the Begotten walk 
        the land and prepare for battle. Kaanen sees a conflict on the sandy plains

    <td width="71%" height="231"> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The forces of the Chosen assembled on the plains of Ro, expecting the
battle foretold of the seer Kaanen. Unfortunately, like many prophetic
visions, Kaanen could not separate the pre-Sundering events from the
Post-Sundering events to come. The war he saw will come, but it was not
what was to happen before The Sundering.<P>
     The mad Beggar appeared and taunted the Chosen and their followers,
finally revealing himself as the spawn of the Begotten. After a time of his
ranting, Mystykyl, Viyy, and Saavedra destroyed the beggar, ending his
madness.<P>
     The Begotten did not show. In their stead appeared the prophet Rezzak
who had seen that the Begotten were sent (by who's orders are unknown) to seek an artifact of great power to
use to eliminate the Chosen and their followers. It was said by him that one Begotten would come: Ghuratan to seek his brothers blood.
Not long after Rezzak left it was he who did appeear--Ghuratan, the dark brother, and the
leader of the Begotten. Again, he rained down curses on the Chosen, and
demanded that they divulge the whereabouts of his brother Dhuratan.
Mystykyl confronted Ghuratan asking what he would do if Dhuratan did not
come. Ghuratan said that he would then slay the Chosen and their
followers one by one until his brother was handed over.<P>
     Quietar, the pacifist monk, approached Ghuratan insisting that he end
his violent tirade. Ghuratan would have no ear for the monk, and, to set
and example to the rest of the assembled, slew Quietar.  Quietar did not
even lift his staff in defense as Ghuratan's killing blows fell on him.<P>
     With Quietar killed, Dhuratan appeared, not wishing any more harm upon
his brother's enemies. Ghuratan and Dhuratan once more dueled, but this
time, Dhuratan bested his brother with the help of those sympathetic to the cause of the Chosen.  With his brother barely clinging to life, Dhuratan emplored him to fight the maddness that had befallen him.  His pleas fell upon hate deafened ears. Dhuratan felled his brother. As he wept over his
brother's dead body it sunddenly vanished! A short while later, still kneeling on the spot his brother had fallen, his sorrowed eyes came to meet the horizon.
In the sun he could see the sillouette of a robed figure moving closer to the place where he knelt.  The Wizard Vesuvian hailed "Dhuratan I would speak to you", and they did so speak... Vesuvian told Dhuratan that his brother was not lost... if he sought to save his brother he would journey to the Plane of Fear, and it is there that Dhuratan must go to rescue his brother from the evil that besets him.
<P>    Vesuvian would reveal one more dark truth--the Begotten knew of the
death of their leader, and would also be going to the Plane of Fear to
reclaim Ghuratan to their own. Dhuratan, his hope for his brother
rekindled, resolved to beat the Begotten to the Plane of Fear and save his
brother's soul.<P>
Who will be the first to the Plane of fear? What will become of the Chosen
after the Sundering? Will the Begotten recover their leader, or appoint one
anew? All these questions will be answered in Chapter 2...<P>
