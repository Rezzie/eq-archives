<p>  If you go talk to one of the Paladins on the top floor of the temple of divine light, he will tell you
to fetch a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian tells
you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he
tells you that the person who checked out the book is names Modorro and that he was executed in Qeynos
for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the
Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is
still alive.  She'll then tell you how Moodoro got corrupted by a halfling named Flynn Merrington. They used to sell the valuable Vasty
Deep Water, till Moodoro got caught.  Here's where there is a catch, part of getting to the
quest requires asking a question that is not in brackets. Some people may miss it that way. Nolusia says that she created a doppleganger to
die in Moodoro's place.  You must ask Nolusia 'What is a doppleganger' or 'What about the
doppleganger?' Even though it is not in brackets. She'll tell you it died in Moodoro's place and he relocated to Qeynos, and that she is
afraid that he's started up again because of Flynn.  Lanken Rjarn knows, and they're
both afraid that the High Council will learn of it. So she wants to murder Flynn Merrington.  She wants you to return a bottle of Vasty deep
water to her, so that she can poision it to give it to Flynn.   If you say yes, she tells
you to find out how they get their Vasty Deep Waters and to bring a bottle to her and she will poison the lip you are then to take it to Flynn not
Moodoro and that will end everything.  You can get Vasty Deep Waters by talking to the Bank manager and asking
him for it  (it may be that only an enchanter can use it for this quest though). He says your guild must have
sent you to get it.  Bring me a guild coin and I will give you the water.  Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin which will
be given with the message remember this is not currency.  The coin is a lore item that gives
+10 mana.  Give this to the banker and he will give you the water and some experience and some faction.  Then go back and gave the water
to the sister.
