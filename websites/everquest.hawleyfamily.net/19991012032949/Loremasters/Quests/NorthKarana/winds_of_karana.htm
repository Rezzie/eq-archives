<p>  This is another of the multiple part quests. When heading into Southern Karana, from Northern
Karana mind you, there is a tower just before the bridge. Just outside the tower doors are four very large horn like
structures. Standing beside one is a female bard. If you talk to her, and ask if there is
anything you can do for her, she relays a sad story of a hermit who stole her flute. Now, head into Southern Karana. Head straight south, making sure
to give a wide berth to the Grave Yard of Lord Grimrot. About half way through the zone is a fountain, with Vhalen
standing there. Vhalen, who is also the object of the broken Lute quest for bards, has an offer for you. He
will complete his latest masterpiece for you. Of course, he needs something for this. Two sheets of a song. Pages 1 and 2
of the Winds of Karana. He tells you of a man who has stolen these pages. A vile man of a Hermit. Sound
familiar eh? Now, head southeast till you see a cottage. It has a hexagonal wall of stone surrounding it, so it's not hard to find.
Inside the walls is "a hermit." A very unfriendly sort. Here's where the quests takes one of two
paths. The door to the hermits house is either locked, or broken and won't open. So it's hard to get to him. If you slide past the door
slowly you may be able to see him and target him. Now, if you want to talk to him, you can go
behind the house, stand EXACTLY against the chimney that protrudes and banter with him. He's very hard to convince to talk, and the
sentence basically has to say something to the effect of "where is the flute" though
this isn't the exact wording, (I got it right once out of 6 attempts) Now, if you do talk to him, he has
two quests you can achieve from him (More on these later) in which you kill two people and bring proof to him for the
Flute and the Page. Now, as it's hard to get through the door, and thus hard to exchange the items to him, there is ONE other manner to do this quest.
Target him, as before, and begin an attack. Spells will draw him out just fine. After he is dead, his body will contain the Flute, Page 1
of the Winds of Karana or just one or the other. At this point, some factions will go up,
down and you will no doubt gain some good experience. I estimate him to be around level 19-20. Now, head back into Northern Karana, and hand
the flute over to the bard sitting against the pillar. She, as thanks, will give you
Page 2 of the winds of Karana, some experience, faction and occasionally a small cash reward.  You are almost complete. Head back into Southern
Karana and hand both the pages to Vhalen at the same time. You will gain Faction, a small amount of money, and a Bard song.
This song appears to be random. I got the 3rd song, another got the 4th song.</p>
