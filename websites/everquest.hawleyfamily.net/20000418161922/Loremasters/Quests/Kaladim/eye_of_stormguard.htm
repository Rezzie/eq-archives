<p>  This is the quest for the Avenger Battle Axe.  After returning the clockwork
remains (Cleaner clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard. He will give you a letter to give to
the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep.  Of course the prisoner has escaped but she
does give you part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that &quot;Bronin&quot;
has the other part, the "Emerald Shard".  Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.
When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to you if you do a small favor.  Apparently a bounty hunter by the name of
Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he will give you the
emerald.  Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.  He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!  He hops around between the Orc camp and
the wall.  You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn.  If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few
gold, and the following faction adjustments:  Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of
Kurnak and Iskar get better.  When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the emerald shard in one of
the highkeep strongboxes. and gives you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.  The key is
labeled H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the following faction adjustments:
Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and
Merchants of River Vale gets worse.  When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience,
and the following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better.   Bronin
also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."  Upon further
questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.  In Kelethin, go to
the Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the Gem of
Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at
the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron
and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos,
probably to work for the thieves guild there.  Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north
Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to kill him to get the
gem. Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.  If
you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speech about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving you a
"warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite.&quot;  He then will give you the
Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.  It is likely that you need to have a very high
faction with him to get the axe.
