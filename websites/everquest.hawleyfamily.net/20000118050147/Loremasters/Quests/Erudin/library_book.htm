<p>  If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine light
in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book from the library. This starts either
the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.   The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last
checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos
for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the
Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is
still alive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her brother is at Crows  (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.  This is a side quest).  Ask him about
The Testament of Vanear.  He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold.  If you give him the 2 gold
he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in it.   He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole
pages 30 and 34 and the book is worthless without them.  He also says that the thief sold the pages to
someone named Ran.  If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass.  If you go to
Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a
man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this
guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had
page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and
swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dynil
Fireshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in
Freeport).&nbsp; Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.
After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro and said I want page 34. He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip
out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.  He then offers to
play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will
give you the page.  Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.
Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10
mana, but can't be used.  Return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some
platinum.</p>
