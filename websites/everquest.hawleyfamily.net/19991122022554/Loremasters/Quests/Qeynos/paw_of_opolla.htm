<p>  This is the quest for the Paw of Opolla.  In the Fish Ale pub in South Qeynos
there is a man named Micc Koter standing at the bar.  His companion (whose name I forget) will occasionally mumble about someone
"foolish going after the Paw of Opolla".  When you ask the companion about it, he tells you to
mind your own business, but Micc will tell him to behave.  Ask Micc about the Paw of Opolla and he will tell you it is a magical item
and it belongs to "some gnoll bitch".  He will offer to tell you where to find it if you buy him a
brandy.  I had to buy 2 to get him to talk.  He then says that someone calling himself Caninel went to find it in the Plains of Karana.  Caniel is
located in West Karana, along with two named gnolls, along the mountains near the
border with North Karana.  When you talk to Caninel, he will demand 3 gems before telling you about the Paw of Opolla (Moonstone, Bloodstone, and a
Star Rose Quartz). He will then tell you about how when the humans from Everfrost first met the Blackburrow
Gnolls, the Shaman Opolla greeted them warmly and had her hand cut off by Gynok Molter. She placed a curse upon
the Molter descendants, the last of which can be found in under Qeynos.  He tells you to ask him about the paw and
also about the rings on the paw. When you find him (Vin Molter), he will demand 3 bottles of Khalish and a
rat meat pie for the paw. He will deny any knowledge of the rings and say that his father probably sold them, mentioning his
father's travels in Odus. You can get the pie in Qeynos Hills, or you can kill him to get the paw
container. This is not the actual item, since it seems it is the rings that activate its magic.  There are four rings that need to be put in the
paw container and combined to get the true paw:  platinum, gold, silver and copper.  Look for rings with a +1 xx, -1
char stat.  The platinum ring is definitely on a mummy in befallen named Gynok Moltar.  I have been told
that as many as all three of the other rings can be looted from the Kerran priest Mitty on Kerra Island.  I have also been told
that the silver ring has been found in the lake in Blackburrow.   Others have said they purchased
some of the rings from merchants.  To make sure you have the right ring, cast identify on it and see if it is a ring of
Opallo.</p>
