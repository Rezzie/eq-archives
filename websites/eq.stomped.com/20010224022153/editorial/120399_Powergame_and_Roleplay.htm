<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Introduction:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>When roaming the lands of Everquest, the inexperienced and well-seasoned
traveler come cross many different playing styles. Shades of gray are prevalent,
but occasionally extremes will be encountered. Treat this guide as a dark
satire, but with the knowledge that it is the truth found within that brings
forth the comedy.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>What is Role-playing?</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>We know that "acting" has existed before recorded history and can
be evidenced from cave drawings displaying primitive ritual dances to written
plays of the Greek era moving all the way up to present time to your favorite
TV show. Though this may be the beginnings and development of acting, the
start of our fantasy role-playing games started much more recent. Before
Dungeons and Dragons became so popular, people used to write fantasy authors
such as Robert E. Howard and Ursula K. Le Guin who would in turn place
them into a role of a merchant, traveler, soldier, etc. Correspondence
between the author and admirer would actually weave a small story.</b>
<p><b>What makes up the classic role-player? Well, a "Role-player" is an
actor who manages to place himself or herself in the "skin" of a minimally
outlined persona, giving that persona depth and life. The Role-player is
interested in weaving a small story as they develop their character. This
story does not have a plot, but there is a constant depth created through
interactions with their peers. Role-playing is hard work from the beginning
where the character's foundation is established to the actual continual
maintaining and development of that persona. The "True Role-player" cares
not for game rules, but instead only cares about the image that they portray.
In Everquest, the "True Role-player" is not interested about advancing
higher in levels for that is simply a mechanical aspect of the game. Sure,
they will gain experience and become more powerful, but that is a side
aspect. Now the "True Role-player" is very rare since we, as people tend
to crave some sort of accomplishments. Not only that, but simply the awareness
of ones peers outgrowing you while you simply spend your days online fishing
or hanging out at the tavern becomes rather depressing. Classically, role-players
tend to mix in interaction with advancement with advancement being of a
slightly lower priority. These are the people that we will focus on when
we talk about "Role-players".</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>What is Power-gaming?</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Power-gamer recognizes Everquest (or any role-playing game online
or not) as simply a game, nothing more nor less. Everything outside of
the scope of the game is superficial for what is the point of a game, but
to win? A person does not sit down to play a hand of cards or to run a
race without at least the hopes of victory. Now this does not mean that
the power-gamer does not have fun, but it is the accomplishments that motivates
this person. Power, items, levels are the fuel that drives the power-gamer
down the track.</b>
<p><b>The Power-gamer has been the victim of much harassment by the role-players.
The role-players have abused their sister players with such elementary
name-calling and snide remarks as to label them greedy, twinkers, unimaginative,
or even cheaters. The power-gamer of course knows better and understand
that they are, but competitive and ambitious unlike their passive sister
players. Regardless, when the dust clears it will be the power-gamer with
all their "toys" and levels that will be remembered while the role-player
is still hanging out having fun with their friends. Now lets face it, people
will always look up higher to the level 50 character (even if they made
this level in a month- great for them!) over the level 20 that has been
in the realms for a year.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Getting into the mind of the role-player:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>As was mentioned above, role-playing is the development of a minimally
outlined persona, but this is just a general outline. So what goes on through
the role-player's mind when they pick out a persona to develop and how
do they go about developing it? Well, first of all they need to visualize
how they see the character taking initially into account race, profession,
and starting stats. Though it is possible to role-play anything, the player
will still have preferences on whom they would like to be over the course
of a few months to perhaps a few years. Given this, it is of the highest
importance to have a clear understanding of the all the details of the
character one will pick and how it will relate to its surroundings. This
incorporates what strengths along with what weaknesses that a given profession
or race might claim. Things that are considered are whether one desires
to play an evil or good race, a melee type, pure caster, or hybrid. Also
of extreme importance is having a clear understanding of racial hatred
and faction within the realms.</b>
<p><b>After the role-player has looked over these most basic features of
their character they will then decide on how it will represent itself to
their peers. This is the most difficult part for the role-player for they
will now need to establish a personality, develop it, then continue to
maintain it. Some people role-play kind-hearted people, snotty people,
give their character's lisps, perhaps only talk in their character's native
language, or even act out simple-mindedness. Now another thing that a role-player
quickly realizes is what is permissible to role-play and what is not. There
are certain guidelines that the realms are built around. Understanding
these guidelines and adhering to them makes the game more realistic for
the role-player. Of course, all role-players understand that the realms
are but a computer game, but like the actor in the play, they would like
to stay "in character" for the realm is not only for their enjoyment, but
also for the enjoyment of others. By acting within the set boundaries that
the realms are built upon they not only help create a more in-depth story
surrounding themselves, but also provide a better background for other
role-players. For example, a role-player accepts the fact that the troll
is an evil race and as such they would not role-play a "good" one simply
because it would make things more convenient to form hunting parties. On
the same note, a role-player paladin would not care to group with a troll
during a hunt since being a paladin they would consider this act bastardization
of their profession and at the same time the act of doing such things only
adds to the deterioration of the realms. It is without doubt often difficult
to remain loyal to one's role-playing convictions when it becomes increasingly
difficult. Since the power-gamer does not follow the boundaries of the
realms, the role-players see them as a direct threat to their "world".
The environment that the power-gamer creates is a constant reminder that
Everquest is simply a computer game.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Getting into the mind of the Power-gamer:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>When the power-gamer looks at a character they do not see such things
as how that character is going to relate to its fellow peers, but instead
they look at combinations. They ask themselves how a certain race/profession
combination is going to work and how hard is it going to advance then compare
that to the end result of how powerful such combination will be when it
hits level 50.</b>
<p><b>Unlike the passive role-player, the power-gamer is a very competitive
sort. They are out to win and even though the realms are open-ended they
will fight, claw and conquer until whatever goals they have established
for themselves have been obtained. You see, the power-gamer is very goal
oriented. The power-gamer from the beginning does not attempt to role-play
their character, but instead plays them with extreme efficiency. Without
the constant anchor that role-playing places upon a player's neck, the
power-gamer is free to act however they choose. This is represented in
a great many forms from talking about what teachers they have in high school,
discussions on what football team they feel will make it to the superbowl,
or going into game mechanics. Talk is not the only freedom that the power-gamer
gains, but also a complete freedom to act however they chose given a certain
moment or feeling with their peers.</b>
<p><b>Knowing that the power-gamer tends to be of a competitive nature,
mentally has complete freedom in word or action, and treats the realms
as a purely a game, they can take advantage of the more passive role-players
by stealing their kills. Hey, it is simply the survival of the fittest
to the power-gamer and the role-players are often prey. This is a very
advantageous upper hand the power-gamer possesses and it only takes a bit
of mental freedom.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Secondary characters. Why they are important to the power-gamer:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Life for the power-gamer is very sweet since they reap the rewards
of being mentally free of word or action. Their competitive nature tends
to excel them quickly up levels and they also tend to acquire great amounts
of wealth and items. Even with both of the above statements there is a
price to be paid and that is boredom. The role-player is not as prone to
boredom as the power-gamer since they integrate themselves into the world
and create a variety of relationships with other characters. The power-gamer
is more independent because of their competitive nature. Even though they
often have other friends racing up the level ladder with them it is all
work and tedious work to boot. This creates a burnout syndrome. By the
time the work is done, the level limit of 50 is reached, and a wealth of
items have been acquired the poor power-gamer is thinking, "what next"?
Well, if that was it then the power-gamer would treat the realms like any
other computer game that has been bested and put it aside. Fortunately
for the power-gamer, that is not it! Oh no, the power-gamer can latch onto
one of the many other professions/race combinations and once again race
up the level ladder, but this time with a decided advantage.</b>
<p><b>Secondary characters are the second, third, fourth life of the power-gamer.
Now the power-gamer, being of a competitive nature, is going to use any
advantages that they can muster. The two strongest tools that the power-gamer
have in their arsenal when starting up a secondary character are known
as "twinking" and being "power-leveled".</b>
<p><b>"Twinking" in the most elementary form is the giving a young character
a leg up by equipping them with high level items. A well-equipped character
has a decided advantage to overcome the trials of an often harsh world.
While the role-player is struggling to find rusty weapons and make pathetic
patchwork armor, the power-gamer is handing over items of extreme value
to their youths. It is the comparison of paupers to kings.</b>
<p><b>Power-gamers, just in the same manner of role-players (but with completely
different reasons), often seek one another's company. Through numbers often-greater
wealth and more powerful items can be obtained for the power-gamer then
hunting individually. Sympathizing with the need to start up a secondary
character, one power-gamer will often help a younger power-gamer's character
quickly advance through the levels. This act of rapidly pushing one character
up the ranks is called "Power-leveling" and is the most effective means
of advancement. An advanced character casting spells of protection and
enhancement upon a younger character or magically holding a critter in
place to make for an easy kill can quickly benefit a young character. Of
course, many an advanced power-gamer can not afford the time to perform
these altruistic tendencies for their brethren, unless it is for a future
investment.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>The non-progressive role-playing guild:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>We now know that interaction with one's peers is a necessary aspect
of role-playing. This becomes obvious when you ask yourself the simply
question, "Can a person role-play by themselves?" Well, whether a person
technically "can" or "not", we will assume in this writing that for the
most part, role-players will not totally isolate themselves from one another
even if they choose to role-play social misfits. Even the hermit comes
down off the mountain (or out of the dungeon) to hit the town for supplies.</b>
<p><b>Now because role-players act out their personas with one another
doesn't mean that they will automatically seek to form guilds and create
governments, but when they do it will always be a role-playing guild that
they form. What is a role-playing guild? Well it is a guild that, within
the outlines of the realms, has a common purpose and mindset. Guilds of
this nature often are rather political and might have set meeting times
to discuss issues of importance to the members as a whole. They might give
out awards, have many guild activities with prizes, abide by strict codes
of conduct, or simply enjoy socializing in drunken revels. There is a strong
comradely that often grows between the members as they develop and strengthen
their personas, have relationships and start to feel like they have a place
in the realms. These people tend to be loyal to their guild (of course
there are all sorts of different personas a role-player might choose to
act) and readily will come to the aid of a fellow member. The belonging
and/or building of a reputable role-playing guild, one of respect, is often
the highest goal of a role-player. Here they will feel a sense of belonging
and contentment, as they many times shall refer to their fellow members
as "family."</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>The progressive power-gamer's guild:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The power-gamer tends not to be after a "family" like their passive
role-playing counterparts. The power-gamer considers themselves "winners"
and "achievers" and as such is not going to be wasting their time talking
about trivial matters when they can be obviously be spending their time
more effectively. Now though the power-gamer doesn't want to wrap themselves
up in a bunch of political "garbage", they still see the advantages of
grouping together and having a bigger pool of people of like-mind to hunt
for items of great value. Unlike the role-players, power-gamers are not
burdened with strong loyalties and so are free to change guilds without
guilt. There tend to be two very general types of power-gaming guilds,
the "loosely configured" and the "dictatorship".</b>
<p><b>The "loosely configured" power-gaming guild tends not to have a strong
leader to guide the other members, but instead is a group of people that
work well in hunts. Guilds of this configuration tend to attract power-gamers
that are of a more independent nature. The bigger the guild the more likely
that an efficient, well-balanced group can be formed so there is often
recruitment of other power-gamers without real interest in profession with
only level being the deciding factor.</b>
<p><b>The "dictatorship" power-gaming guild is a bit more involved then
their sister guild, the "loosely configured." The dictatorship, as the
name indicates, has a strong leader who governs over the guild with a firm
hand. This person guides, directs, and commands the other members of the
guild. Acceptance into a dictatorship style guild generally will be based
on what the applicant can provide for the guild. Normally this is how crucial
the applicant and their profession is needed to aid in higher level hunting.
Once in the guild it is not always easy to remain for justice is often
swift and decisive. Now this might initially sound bad since the members
tend to be at the mercy of an often temperamental, excessively strong-willed
and overly competitive power-gamer, but guilds ran in this fashion generally
are destined to become the most powerful and most prone to provide great
wealth to their followers. Of course, when the "toys" stop coming, there
tends to be not much reason to stay. If a power-gamer discovers that the
wealth is not flowing then they can simply move on most assuredly better
off then they joined the guild and often more then not leave with their
pockets lined in platinum. Many power-gamers choose to temporarily give
up their rights in the hope of being richly rewarded for their service.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Real life monetary benefits of the power-gamer:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Players that power-game a character up the ladder of levels quickly
possess quite an asset not only in the game, but also in real life. There
will always be new players of highly competitive nature that would like
to enter the realms, but do not want to deal with the embarrassment of
starting out as a "weak" or "small" character. Now the almighty dollar
can alleviate much if not all of this unneeded pain. Players of monetary
means can literally transfer their real life success directly to the realms
and go from one day having a first level character to the next being the
proud owner of a 50<sup>th</sup> level character. The character itself
does not even need to be sold, but can be used to find rare or heavily
sought after items. These items in turn can be sold to lesser fortunate
players to equip their characters. Yes, life can be real sweet for the
successful power-gamer.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Dedication:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I would like to recognize a few people or guilds on the Karana Server:</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Ethereal Order, who chose to strive after excellence and quality
above all else.</b>
<p><b>The honorable Vale Patrol guild for their dedication to role-playing.</b>
<p><b>The members of the ex-Clandestine guild and future Bloodguard guild,
for their lack of fear to have fun in the realms.</b>
<p><b>And to my dear friend "the sold Kalleon"/"and current Deyth" (the
famous dictator of the all-mighty Combine) for his dedication in perfecting
the art of power-gaming. "I am not greedy, just ambitious!"</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>About the author:</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I have been role-playing since 1976 where I was introduced to the
old Dungeons and Dragons boxed set. Since then I have had the pleasure
to play a great many over the counter games and online games. How do I
see my playing style? Am I the role-player or the power-gamer? Well, like
the vast number of people in the realms, I am a mixture of them both. I
see myself as a role-player, but the intoxication of advancement, new spells,
new items is strong. Whether I choose to strive for the next level or sit
on the docks talking to a friend, I recognize that there are other players
in the game who have equal rights to have a good time. If I had anything
to really pass down, it would be to ask everyone to respect another person's
rights within the realms by helping to provide a pleasant gaming environment.
