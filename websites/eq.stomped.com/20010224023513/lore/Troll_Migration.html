Troll Migration</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Of the ancient trolls and the dragon Trakanon:</b><b></b>
<p><b>The present day kingdom of Grobb has always been fairly secretive
about it's heritage, but common trollish lore tells us that the kingdom
has it's roots in the blasted continent of Kunark, a land of venomous rivers,
gray wastes, and seething deadwood forests. It is written that here, nestled
on the banks of the Murkdweller river, Innoruk chose to taint the bodies
of man with cruel magics in his attempt at further having a hold on the
prophecied surge of human power in the third age. But with the advent of
the war of the broken crown, sages tell that Innoruk eventually forgot
about his trollish abominations and left them to die on Kunark. What followed
for the trolls was decades of brutal combat as they struggled for the scarce
natural resources of their dead continent.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was at this time that the ancient dragon Trakanon took notice
of the slowly dying race. To call the ancient one a dragon is purely speculative,
as no one has ever seen the terrible beast many think is reponsible for
the present condition of Kunark, but the garbled texts of the trolls describe
him as one. The dragon is said to have gathered the entire population of
Kunark onto one island in the broken teeth chain and there offer the trolls
a pact: Trakanon would supply the forgotten children of Innoruk with food
and water from his personal jungle lands if they would become his servants.
The trolls agreed, regarding Trakanon as a powerful savior, king, and god.
Trakanon organized the trolls into separate tribes each to occupy a certain
part of eastern Kunark so he could control them better. It was at this
time his servants adopted the name "troll" which is a shortened form of
the phrase "troll quel'dom gik Trakanon" which meant "the green children
of Trakanon" in dragonish.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Trakanon's seclusion and the wars of the seven tribes:</b><b></b>
<p><b>It has never been in the power of either man or troll to determine
the great dragon's reason for his abandonement, but we can't hope to understand
the ways of the immortals. Every text simply states that Trakanon may have
just changed his mind. Nevertheless, after centuries of relative peace
and harsh rule under their godlike king, the twenty-five tribes of Trakanon
entered the second age with their food supply dwindling and shipments coming
in less and less frequently. At first there was no panic, the tribal leaders
sent messengers to their king to ask forgiveness for whatever they had
done wrong, but the messengers started to come back with word that they
had been denied an audience with the great dragon. Trollish caravans by
the hundreds started to crowd the dark hills of disdain, waiting for the
gates to open into Trakanon's hidden kingdom, but that day never came.
When word of Trakanon's seclusion started spreading throughout Kunark,
each tribe began to move closer and closer to the east where food had once
come through. They arrived next to Trakanon's kingdom only to learn that
the great dragon king had not been seen for more then 50 years and just
recently had closed his gates to all messengers and caravans. The trolls
were confused, distraught, and starving, and so they waited in the Kunark
east for some word to come from their god.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When that word never came, the tribes of Trakanon started to grow
restless. Battles started to erupt haphazardly and tribal villages were
attacked and plundered. In the shadows of the mountain range "Trakanon's
teeth" a new trollish war erupted. The 25 tribes of Trakanon attacked eachother
viciously for food and water, and for ten years they battled nonstop until
only 7 tribes were left. These 7 tribes retreated to every corner around
what is now called the field of bone, named for the countless trollish
skeletons which cover the ground. For centuries more the surviving trolls
would fight what has been called the war of the seven tribes in their attempts
at stealing whatever they could for food and drink, even the flesh and
blood of other tribal members. Trollish shamans say that every day while
the war raged beneath him, Trakanon sat perched high above his jungle throne,
watching his trolls die with a grin on his face. The war would almost cause
the complete destruction of the troll race.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The Troll Migration</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Chief Nalikor and the end of the tribal wars:</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the middle of the third age, the tribes of Trakanon were all but
completely destroyed. The wars had continued for a century or more and
when the seven tribes began to finally die out, mostly from starvation
and disease, the trolls moved completely to the north of the field of bone
and away from the swamp of no hope, the spot of their creation, forever.
There the starving tribe of chief Kateera and the desperate followers of
chief Nalikor squared off in one final confrontation. Across the northern
shores of Kunark raged a battle so terrible elven bards dare sing of it
only in the dark hours of the night. Troll was pitted against troll in
the end of a war that would prove what tribe would rule Kunark, and each
tribe fought with the single goal of completely destroying the other. Slowly,
the two tribes began to die. Trolls began to consume the flesh of slain
enemies, as was the accepted custom of the tribe wars, but also the flesh
of fallen comrades. In fits of madness, trollish warriors would attack
their own tribesmen and then commit suicide. The fights degenerated into
scenes of utter insanity as trollish warriors started attacking anyone
around them, friend or foe, to eat whatever they killed and to steal whatever
they could grab.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The two most unaffected by the insanity around them, being veterans
of the tribe wars themselves, were the two chiefs: Kateera and Nalikor.
Realizing that the battle they had begun would be the beginning of the
end of the troll race, both leaders met face to face with a host of their
most trusted warriors on what is named Nalikor's Mound by the ancient trollish
texts with the simple intent of ending the war once and for all. Every
text says Kateera was the one who issued the challenge, and some troll
shamans describe Kateera as a foolish, rash young leader who could have
never stood a chance against the older Nalikor. Others, however, say that
Nalikor and Kateera entered in on an understanding that in order for the
trolls to stop the war the young leader had to die. Either way, while the
rest of the trollish camps settled down from the war if only for a brief
rest under a new moon, the young chief Kateera was run through and beheaded
by the old Nalikor. Rather then carry out trollish customs and consume
the bodies of his enemies, Nalikor only took Kateera's head as proof of
his victory, then buried the young chief and his fallen guards on top of
the highest hill in the field of bone, the one most stained with blood.
Here the old chief stacked the weapons of warriors that had been dead for
centuries and the place was called Nalikor's Mound, a monument to the old
tribes of Trakanon and the mark of a new age for the troll race. No one
has reportedly seen the mound, but the texts speak of it as a horrible
site: a small red mountain with spears and swords thrust through it, surrounded
on all sides by the endless troll-skeletons which cover the field of bone.
At it's top Nalikor set Kateera's severed head, grinning as it hung from
a metal pike.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Trakanon's chosen and the fleet of bone:</b><b></b>
<p><b>The tribe of the now defeated Kateera surprisingly did not put up
much of a resistance when they were told about the death of their leader
and their loss in the war. For a week, the survivors of both tribes rejoiced
in the end of centuries of warfare, feasting and dancing over the corpses
of the dead, but many questions still remained unanswered and many problems
were left unsolved. For decades troll shamans had prophecied that the tribe
to win the wars would be given unimaginable riches and power by their dragon
lord, but Trakanon never revealed himself to the last tribe even after
the war was over. Kunark was now completely a blasted land and a graveyard.
All the creatures were dead and the undrinkable rivers were red with blood.
The tribe of Nalikor thought themselves the sole rulers of their continent,
but their continent was left with nothing they could use to survive. When
tensions started to rise again among members of the same tribe, Nalikor
realized that his followers were ready once more to destroy themselves.
Powerless and desperate, the old chief then decided to commit an act of
trollish blasphemy: he would cross Trakanon's Teeth, steal his way into
the jungle kingdom of the great dragon, and speak to the king of the trolls
personally.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Many different stories are written about the month-long journey of
Nalikor into the forbidden territory of his once-god Trakanon, but all
have these few things in common: It is said that the old chief did actually
meet the great dragon and that he told Trakanon all but one of the tribes
had been killed. The ancient beast obviously admired the chief, as he awarded
Nalikor with a magic blade and a key into his eternal kingdom, but the
dragon also told Nalikor bluntly that he would give no aid to the trolls.
It was then that Trakanon told Nalikor of the other continents and the
other races, and that the chief could either lead his people away from
Kunark or watch the last tribe die. Nalikor was especially outraged at
the mention of more fruitful continents and the elder races, and it is
speculated that the hostility trolls have towards all other Norrathians
is spawned from this scorned jealousy, like a grown man emerging from a
troubled childhood. When Nalikor returned to his tribe he found it in chaos,
split among five different leaders each with different plans for Kunark.
The old chief killed each would-be-leader quickly, his flaming sword easily
cutting them down, and when word of Nalikor's new-found power spread the
trolls once more united behind him and gave him the title "Trakanon's chosen."</b><b></b>
<p><b>The old chief told all four hundred of his remaining followers what
Trakanon had told him, and quickly began to lay out the plan for an escape
off their island-continent. With a very limited supply of natural resources,
Nalikor and his men built a fleet of five massive ships entirely out of
wood, steel, and the bones of dead trolls. With nothing left on Kunark,
the trolls gladly boarded the fleet of bone, leaving behind them their
entire culture of war and death, and sailed aimlessly for many weeks until
coming to the broken skull rock off Antonica, in the middle of the gulf
of Gunthak.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of the Ogre attacks and the treaty of the burning blade:</b><b></b>
<p><b>Even before they had landed, the ogres of Oggok knew of the formidable
and ivory ships sailing for their borders. Thinking they had something
to fear from the mysterious troll fleet, which was landing next to the
weakest part in the natural defense of Oggok, the ogres immediately gathered
a large force of warriors to stop the trolls from advancing. To their complete
surprise, the ogres found the strange trolls to almost be their exact equals
in combat and the warriors were turned back by the massive tribe of Nalikor.
Over the next few days, the ogres would continue their attacks on Nalikor's
tribe. The fierce troll warriors, still homeless and starving, were able
to fight off the ogres many more times but were only barely keeping Oggok
at bay. The Greenblood river is named for the many trolls who died in it's
waters as a result of ogre raids. Nalikor, not fully understanding the
ogre race or these recent skurmishes, sent word of a treaty to Oggok. To
the surprise of all the other races, king Gharn, the eighth warlord of
the ogres, whole-heartedly agreed.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The ogres and trolls shared a mutual respect, as much a respect as
members of those two races can possibly produce. The ogres saw the trolls
as merciless warriors with strange powers, but with a harsh and warlike
attitude the ogres found pleasing. The trolls, also, respected the strength
and kill-or-be-killed ways of the ogre kingdom. Soon the two races found
themselves fast allies. On the very place where Nalikor and his followers
first landed, broken skull rock, the ogres and trolls signed an agreement
that neither force would attack the other. Instead, the ogres would help
the trolls establish a kingdom and routes of supplies on Antonica in exchange
for troll military support and magical aid. To seal the kinship between
ogre and troll, Nalikor gave his own magical blade as part of the arrangement.
The sword is still kept on broken skull rock in that same secret meeting
place, encased in a magical field of crystal. On it's surface is etched
"Here the great alliance was formed between king Gharn the slayer and Trakanon's
chosen. May death come to those who seek to disrupt it." Thus the alliance
was called the treaty of the burning blade.</b><b></b>
<p><b>With the aid of the ogres, out of the ashes of the last tribe of
Trakanon sprang forth a new kingdom for the trolls. Nalikor chose the edges
of the Innothule Swamp for the trolls to live, which most closely resembled
the place of their creation: the swamp of no hope on Kunark. The ogres
taught the trolls how to hunt in their new land and how to build fortifications.
Nalikor himself was deeply involved in creating the new hierarchy of the
troll kingdom and ending the old tribal system of Trakanon, but he died
before he could completely achieve his goal. His death resulted in many
days of troll mourning, and the burial site of Trakanon's chosen was made
the foundation of the new troll city of Grobb- named for Nalikor's successor
and the first official king of the trolls. It is said that somewhere deep
inside the temple depths of Grobb the trollish shamans still keep watch
over Nalikor's key: the only remaining link between the trolls and the
ancient kingdom of the dragon Trakanon.</b>
