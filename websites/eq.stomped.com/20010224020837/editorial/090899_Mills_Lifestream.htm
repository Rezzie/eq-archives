&nbsp;
<p><b>Dear EverQuest Development Team</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am Mills Lifestream, level 50 cleric on The Rathe
server. I have been playing EverQuest for quite awhile now, since beta
4. I have no intentions, as of now, of leaving EverQuest, as I believe
it is the best thing out there MMRPG wise. However, the current state of
EverQuest disturbs me. Fixes for problems in the game don't seem to come
fast enough. I wish to address major problems within the game - problems
that players can't really deal with for long. I beg you to read each change.&nbsp;
Some do involve class balancing, but as a Level 50 char since April who
has also been running a guild for quite awhile now, I think I've got at
least a basic grasp on what changes need to be made ASAP.</b>
<p><b>General changes that should be made</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many heart aches have arisen from people looting
NO DROP items they can't even use on accident, or looting a LORE item because
they didn't check to see if it was LORE first. If the item is NO DROP,
and the person looting can't use the item, please don't let them loot it.
We lost a Bladestorm this way, and the person responsible still feels guilty,
but that's only the icing on the cake of the problems caused by this. I
would also like to see the same done with LORE. If they have the item already,
and it is LORE, don't let them loot it! Please, there are other people
in the party to think about, and most of the time people loot these items
on accident.</b>
<p><b>Party buff toggle - I don't know about shamans, the king of buffs,
but even as a cleric sometimes it does get a little annoying ( that is
putting it lightly ) casting the same buff, on every party member, repetitively.
Would it be THAT hard to make a toggle where the buff takes MANAREQUIRED
x PARTYMEMBERS and buffs the entire party?</b>
<p><b>On the note of buffs, the Endure / Resist spells do not last long
enough. They all fade so quickly it gets annoying having to put them back
up.</b>
<p><b>Enemy Poison - This gets me kind of annoyed as a cleric. It seems
that most high level poisons are dealt in DOT form, not poison form. What
does this do? Well, it makes all of those poison healing spells you gave
us useless. Is there really a reason to deal poison in a DOT form instead
of making it actual poison that we can cure?</b>
<p><b>City guards are currently the target for easy money and easy EXP.
They still drop steel weapons, which sell for a significant amount more
than fine steel weapons. They also seem easy for their level. You might
want to stop by Rathe sometime and check this out. Seems the way to a fast
50 is also coated with platinum now.</b>
<p><b>Ingame message boards are only in Qeynos and Highpass Hold. Please
place them in other cities.</b>
<p><b>Many people lose items to bugs in the game, and aren't given them
back by the GM, usually due to lack of proof. Exactly how are we suppose
to get proof? Just so some of you other web sites know, Evil Eye sacks
are NOT safe, and anything in your 1st melee slot that does not attack
isn't safe either. We have had many item loses due to Evil Eye Sacks going
poof for no good reason.</b>
<p><b>TRADE SKILL CHANGES</b>
<p><b>Blacksmithing -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Put banded glove molds on the vendors</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * studs and steel boning should be stackable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * weapon molds on vendors</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Mass production of metal bits with higher skill check</b>
<p><b>Tailoring -</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Add Mask, Bracer, Mantle, Cloak, and Belt on vendors</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; *&nbsp; Low Quality pelt + pattern SHOULD equal raw hide</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Put Quiver instructions in tailoring book</b>
<p><b>Baking</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Give the skill some sort of purpose</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Put snake eggs on vendors</b>
<p><b>Brewery</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Fire beetle eyes stackable</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Give this skill a purpose</b>
<p><b>Pottery</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Fix Clay Deity</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Fix typos in pottery book</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * small clay blocks SHOULD be stackable</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * regular vials should not require a skin</b>
<p><b>Alchemy</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Allow Shamans to GAIN skill in Alchemy</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * I feel STRONGLY that the following potions should be makable
via</b>
<p><b>Alchemy</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Regen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Gate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-Bind&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -SoW&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Invis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
-Cure Disease&nbsp;&nbsp; -Cure Poison&nbsp; -SoC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -See
invis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Water breathing</b>
<br><b>I don't care HOW much you make them cost, just make them makable.
(Well, nothing over 50p total for cost to make )</b>
<p><b>Tinkering</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Make more information available. Exactly where is a tinkerer
suppose</b>
<br><b>to figure out how to tinker?</b>
<p><b>Poisoning</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;* Make Poison + Apply Poison should be one skill ( Exactly
how do you miss applying poison on a dagger anyway? Make applying the poison
a low skill check )</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;* Since most if not ALL poisons have 1 charge anyway, make
them stackable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;* For all the work rogues go through, give them 5 - 10 shots
of poison for each successful completion. Not 1.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;* Make higher level poisoning reagents more available</b>
<p><b>Magicians - Without a form of evac, magicians are just lower level
wizards at high levels. Pets are usually too unpredictable to be</b>
<br><b>allowed in higher level dungeons, and usually end up chasing something
and getting the party killed. Even WITH pets, Magicians still need a form
of evac so they have a chance at getting in parties over druids andwizards.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Summonable Gate Ring - Level 40+ spell. 1 charge gate,
No drop.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Summonable Earring of Water Breathing - Level 30ish summon.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Redo the summon armor spells so they aren't a buff. The
buff does not seem to be as effective as the real stuff. So let them just
summon a suit of no drop equipment on the target char in their party (
Bah, this is just extra. I admit it. But it would be nice for corpse recoveries
to have a suit of chain armor and a summoned weapon. Nothing crappier then
a naked tank. )</b>
<p><b>Bard -&nbsp; Bards suffer from worthless spells, and AE spells that
upset the entire dungeon, thus training the party and getting the bard
kicked from the group. Other spells have AE that should not due to the
nature of the spell.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; * Give the following spells a ZONE effect, not a radius effect</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Speed song&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Water breathing
song&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Levitate song</b>
<br><b>Reason for these songs. Speed song is hell for a bard because of
the area effect, Making SoW or Jboots a better option. OH, on that topic</b>
<p><b>FIX THE SPEED SONG + SOW BUG</b>
<p><b>Water breathing song - Exactly HOW many people would group up with
a bard for water breathing purposes? That's right, none. Losing your bard
means you die, and that makes this song a total waste in water zones since
most people want endure breath or a fishbone earring.</b>
<p><b>Levitate song - Heh, don't look down. In fact, keep your eye on your
bard, because if he walks out of range, you are so ****ed.</b>
<p><b>Ok, and one last song that needs work. Invis song. Question, HOW
are you suppose to keep near your bard with invis song on without see invis?
Give see invis to this song please.</b>
<p><b>Bards need a single target sleep song, as the AE sleep song upsets
creatures behind walls in crowded dungeons.</b>
<p><b>--------------========*Intermission*==========---------------</b>
<br><b>* Be sure to visit the SNACK BAR</b>
<br><b>* Do not litter</b>
<br><b>* Just say No to Bleeding Brain</b>
<p><b>Zone specific problems -</b>
<p><b>Kedge Keep - Perfectly good zone going to waste. Now, I understand
you have to upgrade the AI, but placing a few rare spawns, and a few named
creatures with items never hurt a zone. I found my trip to Kedge enjoyable,
as I believe many others would.</b>
<p><b>Permafrost - Behind the Ice Giant Diplomat, NOTHING is itemized.
It would be nice to see one or two items behind here, or perhaps a rare
spawn. Also, it would be nice...&nbsp; if Vox didn't ****ing kill herself
like she has been for the past month.</b>
<p><b>Plane of Fear - Toning up the enemy difficulty, Good Making it so
enemies can see you from out of nowhere, thus you get</b>
<br><b>attacked by too many at once, making the zone near impossible -
Bad</b>
<p><b>Solusek B - I'm going to work on Nagafen some. I hope Nagafen is
doable by 3 - 4 partys, otherwise I'll come back and write a nice rant.
As if sorting loot in this game isn't hard enough as it is. Not only that,
but last big Nagafen raid I was in was one of the most unenjoyable experiences
to me due to server lag and too many people being there to control. You
really need to consider that the enemy has to be doable. Even then, you
have to realize that you can't just up the number of people required to
kill a mob to try to hide the server overcrowding problems we are having.</b>
<p><b>Dynamic Quests - Near Non-existent. I don't want to HEAR this as
a solution, because I rarely ever see a dynamic quest, and the loot from
the ones I have seen have been horrible for the level of the mob.</b>
<p><b>Universally needed items - Some items are needed by every player
in the game, and the rare nature of them has caused problems ingame.</b>
<br><b>* Fishbone earring - On approximately a 6 hour spawn ( yes we know
the spawn time, and yes, every time it is nearing spawn time, Qeynos Hills
fills with people ready to end poor little Hadden's life ).</b>
<br><b>* Journeyman Boots - Everyone wants a pair, but if you want a pair,
you better get in line. Najena is packed with Jboot campers all the time.&nbsp;
Period.</b>
<p><b>Solutions - Place the items ELSEWHERE. You did it with the Najenas
book, why not do it for these items?&nbsp; OR, how about a Quest for these
items since they are needed as much as they are?</b>
<p><b>Faction - Old dueling faction hit still effects many. Some faction
we lost is near impossible, if not impossible to regain. Not only that,
but many high level quests involve royally ****ing over your faction. Is
this our reward for wanting to do something new in the game? Just how many
paladins do you actually think won't want a Soulfire. PLEASE make town
factions a little more feasible to gain. Merchant faction especially.</b>
<p><b>Aviaks and Centaurs need a faction hit to them.</b>
<p><b>Lastly, this isn't real important as a whole, but my cleric put more
than 50 training points into 2 fields of specialization before you guys
fixed it. Now neither of those fields will train. Would be nice if I could
specialize in Alteration, being a cleric and all.</b>

<p><b>I guess thats all I have to say. To all of my readers out there besides
the Verant dev team, I really don't care about how formal this presentation
looks. I just care about changes that need to be made. Changes that should
have been made awhile back. I won't rest until I see at least an effort
made to try to correct some of these issues with EverQuest. I care too
much about the game to do otherwise.</b>
