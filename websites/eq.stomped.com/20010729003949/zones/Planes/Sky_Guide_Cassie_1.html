First Section</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>First, you're correct in comparing POA to the temple of Sol Ro.&nbsp;
That's really what it's like.&nbsp; The only real differences are that
the quests are all (we believe) to be completed in-zone and of course they
are much, much, much harder than anything one sees in Norrath proper. Also,
it's possible to see very nice item drops on the mobs without doing the
quests at all, so if one likes he/she can treat the zone like Fear/Hate
and simply kill stuff hoping for loot.&nbsp; The items we've seen drop
on Mith Marr so far are insanely nice.&nbsp; Think of Runed Bolster Belts
haste-belts off dragons, only with nice stats added like +5 str +5 agil
+5 vs magic.&nbsp; These are from the "lower" level mobs in Air too. When
the most mundane mobs in a zone drop stuff that's better than dragon loot,
it makes the mouth water as to what is available further up and in.&nbsp;
Only one person on our server has completed a quest so far (he happens
to be my guild leader and good friend) but since the warrior quests are
bugged he lost his items and the GM isn't going to be on to restore them
until Tuesday so we can't tell what the Azure Ruby Ring's stats are yet.</b>
<p><b>First things first:</b>
<p><b>Air, like Hate, is reachable only via a Wizard group gate spell and
it requires a "Cloudy Stone of Veeshan" as a reagent.&nbsp; The stone is
available only in Erudin to my knowledge and it costs around 250 plat.
Unlike Fear or Hate, which are basically one contiguous area like other
zones in Norrath, Air is a series of "islands", most of modest size, floating
in the sky.&nbsp; Each island can sort of be thought of as its own "mini
zone" in a way.&nbsp; Most islands are either higher or lower than those
around them.&nbsp; You can (with levitate on) always get to lower islands
by running over the edge and sinking down to them, but to get to higher
islands you need keys and you need to use them on the right teleporters.</b>
<p><b>The first island you reach upon gating in is filled with eight fairies
called Thunder Spirits, and these are ringed around the edges spaced equally
apart.&nbsp; They are exactly level 50 and will con indifferent to all
players.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the center of the island is a named PC called the
Thunder Spirit Princess, and she will con red to a 50 (meaning 53 minimum)
but also indifferent.&nbsp; The only other NPC in the island is a dwarf
named The Keymaster.&nbsp;&nbsp; On opposite ends of the island are two
pads set into the ground.&nbsp; Clicking on the reveals the message "It's
locked and you're not holding the key".&nbsp;&nbsp; If you click on the
Keymaster you will see he sells three items:&nbsp; a Key of Swords for
about 450 plat, another key (forget the name but it looks like a Minotaur
Horn) for 200ish, and a coffin (for Necro summon corpse spell) for 140
or so. The Sword Key will take you to island 2 higher up.&nbsp; The other
key (Key of Winds maybe?) will take you to Azarack Island even further
in.&nbsp; There is another way to get keys, however.&nbsp; Each Thunder
Spirit drops three rabbits' feet and three tiny swords upon being killed.&nbsp;
To use them, you have to first kill the Princess to get another NPC to
spawn in her spot.&nbsp; (This theme of killing one NPC to force the spawn
of another is common in Air it seems).&nbsp; It's a good idea to start
with the princess anyway because she will assist the Thunder Spirits when
they are attacked.&nbsp; Once the princess is dead, a little halfling will
spawn and he will respond to /hails.&nbsp; Keep /hailing him or he will
disappear.&nbsp; If you give him the rabbits feet and tiny swords (one
at a time), he will return one of each key the dwarf sells.&nbsp; Since
each Spirit drops parts for three of each key, and since there are eight
Spirits in all, a group of 24 can all gain 2 keys from this island.&nbsp;
There are NO faction hits at all for killing Thunder Spirits or the Princess,
so you will not be KOS if you do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, this process
seems to be intended by Verant in order to advance in the zone, because
items for the quests drop on the Thunder Spirits as well - usually "tesseras",
various types of which are required by almost every class.&nbsp; Another&nbsp;
bit worth knowing about this first island is that it contains the hidden
cave with the efreetis who dole out the quests.&nbsp; To see it, use 3rd
person view while on the island and look around.&nbsp; You will find it.&nbsp;
Once inside, you can talk to the NPCs until you find the one who gives
your quests.&nbsp; One caveat, though.&nbsp; Once in the cave, you cannot
get back to the first island. You must zone out and re-gate.</b>
<p><b>Speaking of zoning out.&nbsp; Air can be safely exited simply by
running off the edge of any of the islands and falling back to earth.&nbsp;
You will zone, then reappear in the OOT just outside the East Freeport
docks no worse for wear.&nbsp; You do not die from falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, any keys in your possession WILL disappear when you zone/log/go
LD.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Thunder Spirits seem to respawn every eight hours or
so.&nbsp; If you lose your keys and they are not spawned, you have to bite
the bullet and buy new ones from the dwarf (ouch).&nbsp;&nbsp; To use the
keys, hold them in your hand (on the cursor) and left click on the teleporter.&nbsp;
You will instantly appear on the&nbsp; destination island.&nbsp; Before
going onto them, though, some other things about island one.&nbsp;&nbsp;
First, you cannot bind there, though you may camp anywhere in the zone.&nbsp;
Second, when fighting the mobs there, do NOT use any AE spells, or you
will aggro the efreetis in the cave and they will kill you before you can
blink.&nbsp; This includes any AEs that will aggro mobs in normal zones,
including AE stuns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, and this goes for the zone in general,
summoning spells for casters are tricky in Air.&nbsp; The only pets mages
can summon are Air pets (makes sense), and these appear not as white elementals,
but as little female Efreetis with annoying laughs (think of Elvira, Mistress
of the Dark in genie gear). Necro pets seem to be heavily nerfed in this
zone.&nbsp; Some say their level 49 pet spell summons a level 1 pet (unconfirmed
though they are weak). Enchanter and Shaman pets conjure as normal. Using
the Key of Swords on the correct teleporter will take you to Island 2,
also called Noble Island or Windmill Island.&nbsp; This is a tiny one that
contains simply a large, vaguely sinister-looking windmill, and three NPCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The main mob is a large Efreeti called Noble Djorn who cons red and indifferent.&nbsp;
He will respond to /hails with greetings and an invitation to remain on
his island to keep him company now that his "relatives" are gone.&nbsp;
The other two NPCs are called "Bladestorms" and resemble the rare Blade
Dervish from unrest.&nbsp; They are basically a whirling circle of swords
and they also con red indifferent (to a level 50).&nbsp; These circle the
windmill in a repeatable pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Noble is attacked,
both bladestorms will aggro and vice versa.&nbsp; All three mobs are linked.&nbsp;
Djorn carries a mace in his left hand and an intriguing bag in his right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He is usually pulled to the next island over where there is room to fight,
but let me mention now that he is tougher than any mob outside of the Gods
in Fear and Hate, and maybe tougher than them (though he has been brought
down already).&nbsp; He hits for over 300 and will triple attack for 1000+
in one round.&nbsp; He is impervious to player spells.&nbsp; The nastiest
thing about him, though, is a wickedly deadly AE spell that will take 1000+
HP off in one shot.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bladestorms are easier kills if they
can be pulled solo and are doable by a group of 24.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other
interesting thing about island 2 is that the windmill can be stopped and
started by clicking on the shaft inside.&nbsp; Whether this is for "show"
or part of a puzzle is unknown.</b>
<p><b>There are no teleports on Noble Island.&nbsp; Directly across from
it, though, is a larger island with a temple on it and multiple mobs.&nbsp;
This island is slightly lower and can be reached with levitate and SOW
(or jboots) by running and floating down to it (though it's a close thing
-make sure you keep looking up and running the whole way).&nbsp; This is
the next island most groups clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has four main types of
mobs.&nbsp; The first look like harpies.&nbsp; The second look like air
elementals.&nbsp; The third look like evil eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth
look like giant red willowisps. All are 53+ and indifferent, so this island
can be explored in safetylike the first two.&nbsp; Inside the temple are
three "named" mobs and these are much tougher than the roamers.&nbsp; In
the left front corner is an "avenging gazer" (evil eye type), a "heart
harpie" in the middle and "Gorgalask" in the right front corner.&nbsp;
Gorgalask will respond to /hails, but don't carry the conversation all
the way or she will aggro on you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other feature of
this island (called "Gorg Island" by most, or Island 3) is the teleporter
near the edge in front of the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most groups camp near
the teleport and pull and kill single roamers.&nbsp; Of the "harpy" type
roamers, there are two flavors.&nbsp;&nbsp; First are "spirited harpies",
which are casters with pets.&nbsp; Second are "a gorgalask" which seem
to be melee only mobs.&nbsp; These mobs are handled fairly easily by groups
of 24, as are all roamers on this island.&nbsp; They hit in the 200's but
they are vulnerable to player DD spells and debuffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
are two types of air elementals - crystalline clouds and "a gust of wind".&nbsp;
These are melee mobs as well (I believe - meaning I don't recall seeing
them cast - but I could be wrong).&nbsp;&nbsp; They are annoying in that
like good air elementals they can invis themselves, making them impossible
to target unless you have see invis up or use /assist on someone with it
up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that they are no harder than the harpy-types.&nbsp;
The evil-eye types, called Watchful Guards, are enchanters and have pets
and damage shields.&nbsp; These cast a lot as well as hit for high damage.&nbsp;
Their magic resist seems a bit higher than the others, though they are
vulnerable as well to PC spells.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling singles is straightforward
if you wait until they are somewhat isolated.&nbsp; The aggro ranges in
Air so far seem normal-sized, not ultra-huge like in the other two planes.&nbsp;
The only caveat to this is with the three mobs on the back ledge of the
temple (North side). Pulling these can aggro the heart harpy through the
back wall, which in turn aggros the other two temple mobs.&nbsp; One very
nice thing about the zone being non-KOS, however, is if a pull goes bad,
you can let the puller die and rez him without the rest of the party being
attacked.&nbsp; In fact, your puller can aggro any mob and haul it back
to the group and the mob will ignore the other players even if the puller
dies.&nbsp; This makes pulling in Air heaven compared to Fear or Hate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The roamers drop quest items, rarely drop very nice class-specific loot,
and always drop "an animal figurine".&nbsp; Have everyone loot one figurine
if you plan to go higher up.</b>
<p><b>In any event, once these mobs are cleared, you have the meteors (the
wisps) hovering above the temple, and the temple mobs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
wisps are special cases and so far we mainly leave them alone.&nbsp; They
are very magic resistant and therefore hard for caster-heavy groups to
handle. They can be meleed to death with 10 tanks or so, but we have yet
to see any loot of note on them other than research pages and minor quest
items.&nbsp;&nbsp; That leaves the temple mobs.&nbsp; The Gorgalask queen
can be pulled by aggroing the temple, pulling it to the group, and having
the puller die or Feign.&nbsp; Keep /hailing the Gorg and the other two
will return to the temple.&nbsp; Rez the puller if he/she died, and hack
away.&nbsp; Take note that the Gorg queen is a very tough fight.&nbsp;
She will resist practically all PC spells so it's melee-only for the most
part.&nbsp; She is doable with a very tank-heavy group of 24, but 30+ is
safer.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's necessary to take her down, though, if you want
to get higher up, because she is analogous to the Princess on Island 1.&nbsp;
Killing her forces a second NPC to spawn in her spot, and this one will
hand out keys when given the animal figurines.&nbsp;&nbsp; These keys work
on the teleporter in front of the temple.&nbsp; As mentioned before, the
Noble, if attempted, is usually fought on Gorg island since it has a big
"backyard".&nbsp; He can be pulled analogously to the Gorg queen, by aggroing
the whole island and /hailing him until the bladestorms go back (they most
likely move into the temple, amusingly, rather than go back to Island 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;
When Djorn is killed, a nasty uber-mob called the Overseer of Air (or something
like that) spawns in his place and he is aggro and reputed to have a DT
like Cazic.</b>
<p><b>The next island up from Gorg island is (I've heard) full of Pegasi
that are tough fights.&nbsp; The theme seems to be clear the boss of each
teleport island to get the keys to the next, with the mobs getting tougher
on each one.&nbsp; I believe only a few servers at this point have even
begun to fight on Island 4 so I know little of its secrets or loot.</b>
<p><b>This leaves only the second door on Island 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the
mino-horn key is used on this teleport, the player is transported to an
island full of very red, very aggro little fire imps called "Azaracks"
who hit for 200.&nbsp;&nbsp; This island is viewable (and I'm betting reachable
via levitate) from Gorg Island.&nbsp; It contains one door and presumably
there is some way to get keys on that one as well, but to my knowledge
no one has cleared it yet.&nbsp; It is the only easily-reachable island
in Air with aggro mobs on it.</b>
<p><b>It should be noted that this zone has only been up for four days
and that it likely has innumerable secrets to it that haven't even been
hinted at yet.&nbsp; As stated, POA is a giant puzzle in a sense, and my
opinion is that we've barely begun to sort the pieces out, let alone put
them together.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's generally felt that the majority of the
zone is geared toward higher-level players (level 55+ if not much higher)
once the expansion comes out.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one has even seen Veeshan
yet let alone conned her, but it's been rumored by those who claim to know
GMs that Veeshan is 75+&nbsp; (whereas Nag/Vox/Cazic etc are 53-55 mobs).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, Verant has stated bluntly there is loot in this plane that makes
gear from Fear/Hate look "like rusty broadswords".</b>
<p><b>The general reaction I've observed from most players in Air has been
very favorable.&nbsp; Most of us (including myself) will likely be camping
there (literally) every night as we figure out more and more stuff. Since
the early stages of the zone are not KOS, it's perfectly safe to log out
on Gorg island and come back the next day ready to go again. Verant is
to be applauded for making what looks to be a very very fun zone available
to tide us over until Kunark in April :)</b>
