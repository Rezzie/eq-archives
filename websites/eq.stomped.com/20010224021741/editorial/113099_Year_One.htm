<br><b><font size=+1>EverQuest, One Year On: What Awaits A New Player?</font></b></center>

<p><b>The expansion for EverQuest is likely to be sold as a complete package,
which includes the original EverQuest, in order to draw in new customers.
Existing customers will be able to order the expansion direct from Sony/Verant/989.</b>
<p><b>This editorial talks about what that new player is likely to see
and do, and will talk about a few pitfalls that will cause difficulty,
and maybe a lack of enjoyment.</b>
<p><b>First the good.</b>
<p><b>The player that opens up the game in March 2000 (aimed release date
as far as I know and is the one year anniversary of EverQuest) will get
to play one of the most addictive games out there right now. The game will
also have a large number of websites and guides devoted to it. Thus the
new player will not have to struggle through the mire of the unknown.</b>
<p><b>Now not all people will consider this good. Fair enough. However
the player that wants to wade through the mire will be able to. They don't
have to find spoilers on the internet and they don't have to ask for spoilers
from players within the game either.</b>
<p><b>They will also have far fewer bugs and problems to deal with. This
is debatable, but they will also be playing with a more balanced set of
classes than the early adopters of EverQuest.</b>
<p><b>They will most certainly have that feeling of awe as you first approach
Kelethin, Kaladim or as you first enter Neriak. They will also see the
tapering spires of wizard teleports for the first time and will cross the
wood link bridge to the Eastern Plains of Karana. They will get lost in
Highpass Hold and they will marvel at the scale of EverQuest.</b>
<p><b>They will also die, which is to be expected in this game, and die
horribly, which is not necessarily to be expected.</b>
<p><b>That is the bad. Verant, in their attempts to fine tune the game
for the mid to high level players, have made the game far harder for the
new players. Travel has always been hard thanks to the mobs that frequent
the Karanas (the griffon family), Highpass Hold (the Orcs and the Gnolls).
However now that Paw is to be upgraded to a mid to high level dungeon,
it's very likely that there will be a few higher level gnolls wandering
around the Southern Karanas. There's also Kithicor Forest and it is cursed.</b>
<p><b>No one is safe in Kithicor. Invisibility vs. Undead gives you a greater
chance of survival, as does Spirit of the Wolf, however should an enraged
dread wolf catch your scent, you are, very likely, dead.</b>
<p><b>However, there are three routes between Qeynos and Freeport aren't
there?</b>
<p><b>Route one (and the most commonly known route):</b>
<p><b><i><font size=-1>North Qeynos - Qeynos Hills - West Karana - North
Karana - East Karana - Highpass Hold - Kithicor Forest - West Commonlands
- East Commonlands - West Freeport</font></i></b>
<p><b>Route two :</b>
<p><b><i><font size=-1>North Qeynos - Qeynos Hills - West Karana - North
Karana - East Karana - Gorge of King Xorbb - Runnyeye Citadel - Misty Thicket
- Rivervale - Kithicor Forest - West Commonlands - East Commonlands - West
Freeport</font></i></b>
<p><b>Route three :</b>
<p><b><i><font size=-1>North Qeynos - Qeynos Hills - West Karana - North
Karana - South Karana - Lake Rathetear - Rathe Mountains - Feerott - Innothule
Swamp - South Ro - Oasis of Marr - North Ro - East Freeport</font></i></b>
<p><b>Routes one and two contain Kithicor Forest and it is very likely
that you will die if you stick to the path. Whether it is daytime or nighttime,
the path will very often get you killed. As I said earlier, should you
see an enraged dread wolf, you are very likely dead.</b>
<p><b>Route three contains Lake Rathetear and the entrance from South Karana
into the Lake takes you through a pack of gnolls. There are some level
18 gnolls here and they will attack on sight. Come night, this little area
is populated with undead including level 20+ drybone skeletons and exhumed
gnolls. Drybone skeletons cast spells and are dangerous adversaries.</b>
<p><b>Route two takes you through some predominantly good areas. Evil races
will find it hard to go through Misty Thicket and Rivervale. The deputies
are numerous.</b>
<p><b>Route three takes you through some predominantly evil areas. Feerott
and Innothule are hunting grounds for Ogres and Trolls. Bouncer Hurd will
turn you into paste if you are a low level traveller.</b>
<p><b>Contrary to common sense, the undead (and the particularly nasty
wolves) in Kithicor do not 32K themselves (for those that do not know,
when a mob has a forced despawn it slashes itself for 32000 hit points,
similar to a pet that is faced with an invisible master).</b>
<p><b>Travel should be hard seeing as you are crossing a continent. Travel
solo should be quite dangerous. Travel in a group should be relatively
safe (assuming it isn't a group of level ones) with some element of danger.
At no point in a computer game should travel be another term for suicide.
For a new player who would (as you would expect) take the path through
unknown zones to be penalised for doing this (as in the Kithicor case)
is not acceptable and, quite frankly, does not make for a rewarding experience.
Someone who has finally reached Freeport from Qeynos (okay lets be realistic
here, someone who has finally reached the West Commons zone border from
the Highpass Hold zone border in Kithicor) is not going to feel elated,
they are going to be cursing and spitting at Verant for making Kithicor
such a hellhole. How can they call EverQuest a game of exploration and
have this insane difficulty placed on travel?</b>
<p><b>Even my level 20 warrior groans when he know he will have to cross
Antonica and my first thought is to find a wizard or a druid friend that
can teleport me. You have to have a network of friends to be able to have
this solution.</b>
<p><b>The new player to EverQuest will also hear legends about the Plane
of Fear, the Plane of Hate and possibly the Plane of Sky (which from all
intents and purposes is a wasted zone - home to the GMs and Guides. This
is a chance for Verant to create a Plane that is quest driven, and a change
from the norm of planes). They will also hear of Lord Nagafen, Dracoliche
and the elegant Lady Vox. There may be even bigger, and badder, dragons
on Kunark (which seems to be the case from the rumours heard about the
new continent). However that player will have next to no chance of ever
reaching those places or besting a dragon. Why? Well, it seems that Verant
have consciously decided to cater to the high level populace over the low
to mid level populace. You can argue that the people who started in March
1999 are now higher level and are running out of places to go to due to
a lack of proper high level play testing by Verant. While that is true,
there is also the problem of a never ending journey to a goal.</b>
<p><b>What I am talking about is that Verant are continually bumping up
the higher level mobs to keep them to the standard of the high level players
(of the higher level guilds, to be honest) and disregarding the rest of
the playing population. Dragons have been made far more powerful than they
were when Fires of Heaven bested their first dragon. The Planes have been
made far harder than they were when they were first taken over. The gods
have been made harder.</b>
<p><b>Now, all mobs should not be simple and easy to beat. A god is a god
and should be able to kill a player just by looking at him. Likewise with
a dragon to a lesser extent. What should not happen is what is happening
with the dragons now.</b>
<p><b>In order for Fires of Heaven, a high level Veeshan guild by the way,
(who I believe bested the first dragon) to have beaten a dragon, they had
a period where they tried different methods, failed, collected their bodies
and tried again.</b>
<p><b>That is no longer possible.</b>
<p><b>Should you wish to take down your first dragon, you must group with
people who have done it before, you must play your role in the hunt to
perfection, and you must not make mistakes. If you die, prepare for a lengthy
and perilous and level losing experience getting your corpse back. Dragons
can now see invisible (not so much a problem), their minions can now summon
you before them (this is a problem), they are much more resistant to magic
and much stronger than they used to be.</b>
<p><b>In short, dragons are now tailored to the dragon slayers and not
the people who want to be dragon slayers.</b>
<p><b>Expect, when the expansion comes out, the dragons to be boosted in
strength. It may not be a visible boost (ie /con reflected change) but
may end up so that the dragons undercon badly. The end result will still
be the same: the dragons will be extremely hard for those that have not
done it before. This is bad news for the new servers that recently popped
up, and will pop up as time goes on.</b>
<p><b>The Planes are hard, and will get harder. Verant does this to cater
to the guilds that routinely hold a Plane. However, when a new server attempts
it, they will most likely fail miserably (unless they have already attempted
it on a different server, or have been forewarned and carried out research
- which does not make sense from a role-playing perspective).</b>
<p><b>With Verant's new GM policies, in that they will not help with corpse
recovery from dangerous places such as dragon lairs and the Planes, it
is looking like, official or no, they have a mandate of "player character
death is good, more money for us!" This probably isn't a fair assumption,
but with all the changes that have been made, many of them undocumented
in the patch messages (which in turn result in a player character death
due to something being changed), this is the one of two conclusions we
can draw. The other, that Verant is inept, is not an acceptable conclusion.
Now I'm not going to taint all GMs with the same brush. I have personally
been helped by GMs who did not have to help me and I will always be grateful
for those people. They have commonsense, which is the best compliment you
can pay a GM.</b>
<p><b>Fair enough, Verant is in this business to make money as well as
provide a game that they have put their hearts into. This is clear and
is the only way a company will succeed in this industry, but it is foolish
to increase revenue by making the players frustrated. Once in a blue moon
camps are not a good thing, in fact they are a very bad thing. So what
if every level 50 character gets a fishbone earring because Hadden spawns
once every 3 game hours. So what if Dvinn drops his dagger every time he
spawns. That brings back the fun element that is missing for many people
and causing them to quit. It would also remove the immense frustration
someone feels after waiting for a named mob for 10+ hours only to have
a higher level player enter the zone minutes before it spawns and proceed
to take it. Having a GM tell the player off does not compensate for 10+
wasted hours.</b>
<p><b>Now after complaining (pretty much) for 3 pages, it would not be
right for me to leave it without proposing a solution to the problems.
Sure, there may be various reasons why the solution is not feasible but
I have to try.</b>
<p><b>Problem one: travel from Qeynos to Freeport.</b>
<p><b>Have all the Kithicor night spawn 32K themselves come 9AM and stop
spawning at 6AM. This will give the people who are hunting the stragglers
time to finish off the fight. One relatively safe route out of three will
be an acceptable solution.</b>
<p><b>Problem two: continual goal creep.</b>
<p><b>This is a much harder problem to solve. Dragons must not be soloable
by a player character that has reached the maximum expansion level. The
Planes must not be takeable by a tiny group. However, having a zone that
is buggy and results in corpse retrieval exercises that are doomed to failure
due to ridiculous aggro ranges is not acceptable. Fix the bugs in the Planes,
fix the pathing of mobs. Do not make the player pay for poor pathing algorithms
by allowing mobs to summon players before them. This is cheating and would
get a player banned.</b>
<p><b>Problem three: quest frustration.</b>
<p><b>This is another easy solution. Make things pop more often. The "faulty"
Meldrath spawn was how all the quest spawns should be. Quick, consistent
popping. The Wiltin spawn in Ocean of Tears is how it should not be. This
is one of the most frustrating quests there is (in that the arrows are
fairly good fun to get and then the quiver is frustrating as anything)
and it simply doesn't have to be. The cleric armour quests are most certainly
not how the quests should be. Sitting around, waiting for an object to
appear on the ground and then race to be the first to click on it is an
exercise in tedium.</b>
<p><b>The main feature of EverQuest has always been the social side, and
this will still be there (more so in fact) if there was no constant infighting
over every single spawn. Sure, have a few quests be extremely hard if you
must, but the quest armour and minor to midrange camps should be accessible
to all, including the player that can only play for 1 to 2 hours a night.
No rent items in a quest that lasts hours on end is also a big way to frustrate
the casual player.</b>
<p><b>That's my three step plan for making Norrath just as fun for the
new players in March, 2000 as it was for the players in March, 1999. If
you want to give the level 45+ players a challenge, create new mobs, don't
take the lazy option and bump up the existing mobs. Don't push away the
fact that the Planes (and Mistmoore, Unrest etc) are bugged zoned by stating
that "Zone suchandsuch is dangerous. Approach at your own risk". In other
words, the mobs in the bugged zone exploit the bugs to get at the players.
That is the equivalent of a player exploiting the bugs in the sand giant's
pathing to dispatch it with ease. The player would get banned in this case.
Why not fix the zone and make everyone happy?</b>
<p><b>Happy. That's the keyword for this editorial.</b>
<p><b>Make the players happy, Verant. There are a lot of happy players,
but there could be a lot more. There is nothing better than EverQuest out
there right now, but that does not mean that EverQuest is as good as it
can be. There are problems.</b>
<p><b>Well, I welcome all responses, be they flames or no, and will answer
them, either directly or via a forum of some sort. This is my opinion and
as such, I am entitled to it.</b>
