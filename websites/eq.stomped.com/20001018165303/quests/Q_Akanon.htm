Speak to Larkon Theardor in Ak'Anon, who is is standing with a Gnome Mechanic
on the right side of the Library Mechanimagica.&nbsp; He should be next
to a mechanic.&nbsp; Hail him and say you want the clean job.&nbsp; He
will tell you to go and look for&nbsp; Fodin, a gnome located in the observatory
in Steamfont to the left of the tunnel to Ak'Anon as you are coming out
of the tunnel.&nbsp; Hail him and say "Larkon sent me."&nbsp; (you can
really just start at this point).&nbsp; He will give you an "Air Tight
Box."&nbsp; Put 10 infected rat livers inside and hit combine, then deliver
them back to Larkon Theardor for xp, money and the following faction changes:&nbsp;
GemChoppers, KingAkAnon and EldrichColective increase and DarkReflection
and TheDead decrease.&nbsp; After you complete this, he asks for the bozonite
pestle found on the clockwork rat that spawns near the bank, which gets
you some gold and a low level spell.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>

Xokez, cleric trainer of the dark reflection faction in the mines of malfunction,
Ak'Anon.&nbsp; No brackets are provided, but if you are "willing to learn"
she will give you a vial and instruct you to spread the plague by using
it to infect a female rat, a new mob type in Steamfont.&nbsp; It is necessary
to charm this mob in order to complete the next step, otherwise the rat
will reject the vial due to unsuitable faction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps there
is some cleric spell which will adjust faction to the point where a solo
player can complete this step, but I do not know of it.&nbsp; Give the
vial to the charmed female rat, and receive an empty vial and experience
in return.&nbsp; Give the empty vial to Evah Xokez, and she will reward
you with faction, experience, a container, and another task.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The second task is to collect four items and
combine them in the container, then return the combined container for the
Initiate Symbol of Bertoxxulous.&nbsp; The four items are gnomish spirits,
a sprig of wormwood, and two diseased bone marrow portions.&nbsp; The spirits
can be brewed using the brewing trade skill, or purchased in Ak'Anon.&nbsp;
Diseased bone marrow is found on brittle skeletons, a new gnome sized skeleton
mob in Steamfont.&nbsp; They can be found in the area north and west of
the windmills.&nbsp; I noticed a great many more spawning after I began
to buff the newbies in the area, so I presume they have place holders.&nbsp;
Not every skeleton has the marrow, perhaps one in five do.&nbsp; The sprig
of wormwood is obtained by hailing a NPC in the Steamfont Mountains named
Ennixy Frennor, and asking about wormwood.&nbsp; She is a static spawn,
found north and west of the windmills in the vicinity of the brittle skeletons.</font></b><b><font color="#000000"></font></b>

Hall will tell you that the Cargo Clockwork goes from Ak'Anon to the windmills
every five days at 8 am.&nbsp; A group of 3 highwaymen (it is rumored that
one is Bugglegup) have been attacking it.&nbsp; A reward is offered for
the bandits' heads.&nbsp; Zondo Hyzill in Steamfont is standing next to
where the Cargo Clockwork spawns.&nbsp; The clockwork makes a trip every
5 days from there up the path to the windmills.&nbsp; He gets a little
fix there from one of the gnomes.&nbsp; Then, he starts on his way back
to his normal sitting spot.&nbsp; He gets about 1/4 of the way back, does
a few circles, then takes off and poofs.&nbsp; There are no bandits. However,
if you check the ground where he was spinning, you will sometimes find
a Clockwork lockbox.&nbsp; Giving the lockbox to Jarah and Zondo does not
seem to have any effect, so I'm not sure where you go from here.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Duster Models"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Duster Models:</font>&nbsp;
This is sometimes given after you complete the 27 C Blackbox quest.&nbsp;
It is a very nice quest for this level.&nbsp; If Jogl doesn't give you
the Red V report, he will probably give you the Duster Model report.&nbsp;
If you give this to Drekon Vebnebber in the Gemchoppers Hall, he will tell
you that two of the obsolete Duster Models have escaped and must be destroyed.&nbsp;
There are two duster models -- numbers V and X.&nbsp; They are both around
level 6 or 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must give the proof of their destruction
to Sanfyrd Featherhead.&nbsp; He's the guy that's on the other side of
the river from the Mines of Malfuntion.&nbsp; The Duster Model quest is
tough because the Dusters appear infrequently and they move around a lot.&nbsp;
To make things worse, once you start fighting one, nearby guides, etc will
often 'help' you by killing it.&nbsp; Of course it won't leave a corpse
then.&nbsp; If you kill a Duster Model, you will get a piece of scrap metal
that is lore, no drop.&nbsp; This is what you need for the quest.&nbsp;
Duster V spawns near the receptionist and travels to the pod area and back
before despawning.&nbsp; It can sometimes be seen walking down the path
through "the wall" just inside the city entrance and around the priest
of discord area.&nbsp; At a certain point in his usual path he goes from
walk speed to run speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duster X is triggered by your
giving the report to Drekon and spawns by the mechanic by the tinkerer
and travels up to the bridge then back near the paddlewheel.&nbsp; Your
best bet is to bind near the spawn and gate there as soon as you give him
the report.&nbsp; Give him the two scraps.&nbsp; Your reward for this is
usually either a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics5/Forging_Hammer.htm">Forging
Hammer</a></font> or a <a href="../equipment/graphics8/Bootstrutters_Framed_Pack.htm">Bootstrutters

<p><a NAME="Gearheart (A)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Gearheart:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
Baxok Curhunter in Ak'Anon will ask you if you will serve the crown, and
once you are about 5th level he will give you a quest to hunt down a stolen
clockwork named Gearheart who has been taken by the fae in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;
Gearheart is found at&nbsp; the faerie city.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seems to vary
between&nbsp; levels 15 to 25 and is tough to kill. When you kill gearheart,
you get a faction loss (faerie), some change and a 'blackbox XIVD' which,
when given to Baxok Curhunter, gives you some change, a couple of faction
changes, and an item, possibly a round shield.&nbsp; The quest is worth
a platinum or two.&nbsp; (Submitted by Wael and Toraque)</font></b>
<p><a NAME="The Gnome Take"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Gnome Take:</font>&nbsp;
Tell Jeet in Kaladim that you will run to the gnome city (after doing the
boog mudtoe quest I believe) and say you will collect the gnome take.&nbsp;
He will then give you a key. You have to find a clockwork scrubber in Ak'Anon
which responds to 628 and use the key on him to get the gnome take. The
scrubber was down in the zoo area when I found him and responded by saying
something like wiz... tik... 628... You give him the key and your faction
with clockwork goes up and you get the gnome take. Then you take the gnome
take to Jeet.&nbsp; You get a couple of silver and a minor item for completing
this quest, plus faction and experience.&nbsp; (Submitted by Quegos)</b>

Larkon Theardon, a gnome standing outside the Library Mechanimagica, has
tasks for young gnomes.&nbsp; He would like you to bring him 2 minotaur
horns or 4 basilisk tongues.&nbsp; He will also tell you to go see Fodin
(the gnome in the observatory next to the Cargo Clockwork) and tell him
that Larkon sent you.&nbsp; This starts the air tight box quest.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="The Regurgatonic"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Regurgatonic:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
The zoo keeper, Kimble Nogflop will give you a regurgatonic if you bring
him a flask of nitrates.&nbsp; You can get the nitrates from Gerael Woodone
in Surefall Glades.&nbsp; Give Kimble the flask and you get you get experience
and faction; +GemChoppers, +MerchantsofAkAnon, +KingAkAnon, -DarkReflection.&nbsp;
He then gives you the regurgatonic, and says to give it to "who may need
it and they will surely cough&nbsp; up whatever may be inside them with
no harm to them&nbsp; whatsoever."&nbsp;&nbsp; One known use for this is
to give it to frostbite the dog to get him to cough up the koalindl fish,
which is needed in several quests (most notably the stein of mogguk quest).&nbsp;
You can also use it on the Mammoth in Surefall to get the bayle list II.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="Red 5 Clockwork (A)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Red 5 Clockwork:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is sometimes given after the 27 C Blackbox quest.&nbsp; If you turn
in the correct report to Drekon you will be told that the "rumors of Red
V must be true".&nbsp; You need to get Red V's blackbox and give it to
Manik.&nbsp; Red V is usually about level 4-6 and spawns in the southeasternmost
room of the Mines of Malfunction. The corridors leading to and the room
in which Red 5 spawns are short, so only small and medium sized people
can actually fight or cast in there, since you have to be standing to cast
or attack. The spawning point for Red 5 alternates between "obsolete model"
and "Red 5". Kill all of them, only red 5 gives the box.&nbsp; If you let
the model wander off, you will be forced to kill every obsolete model in
the Mines to try to get the right one.&nbsp; Red 5 is killable by solo
lvl 8 or bunch of lvl 5's.&nbsp; When he gets low on hp, he will run off
and often get killed by the guards outside the mines, so be ready to use
root if you have it.&nbsp; If you kill him, his corpse will have an incomplete
blackbox.&nbsp; To fix the blackbox you have to put 4 blackbox fragments
in the incomplete blackbox and hit combine.&nbsp; You can get the blackbox
fragments from the obsolete models that also inhabit the mines.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When you combine the 4 blackbox fragments inside the incomplete blackbox
you will get a rusted blackbox.&nbsp; The rusted blackbox looks just like
the ones you get from the rogue clockworks in Steamfont, but it's actually
different.&nbsp; (The other rusted blackboxes are for a different quest.)&nbsp;
If you give Red V's rusted blackbox to Manik you'll get experience, faction
changes, a little money and a random item.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reward seems
to be random and faction may not play a role, but you should try to have
a high faction with the gemchoppers before doing the quest.&nbsp; Also,
you should know that this quest lowers faction with the Dark Reflection,
who happen to be the NPC's in the Mines.&nbsp; The item is often a piece
of cloth armor (hardly worth the trouble), but sometimes you'll get a potion
and sometimes you will get the </font><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Bullsmasher.htm">Bullsmasher</a></font><font color="#000000">

King Akanon, Merchants of Akanon and Gem Choppers standing gets better;

random items out of this.&nbsp; Often it is a rusty weapon.&nbsp; One unusual
item is the <a href="../equipment/graphics10/Gnome_Glow_Rod.html">Gnome
Glow Rod</a>, which acts as a light source.&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally you
get a "Tinmeizer's Fabulous Compactor", which is a 4 slot container with
a combine button.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can give this to Kozyn Gigglephizz, who
wanders around Ak'Anon and he will give you a couple of gems as a reward.

C Black Boxes:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Manik Compolten in the
gemchoppers hall will also ask that new warriors take keycards and go retrieve
blackboxes from series C clockworks.&nbsp; He asks that all four boxes
be returned simultaneously, meaning that you must return after getting
each one to get another keycard.&nbsp; This quest is performed by wandering
around Ak'anon and giving the keycards to Clockworks with a C in their
name.&nbsp; the locations of these clockworks are:&nbsp; XIIC)&nbsp; On
an island in the middle of the lake. (You'll have to swim to get to it.)&nbsp;
XVIIC)&nbsp; Just outside the Mines of Malfuntion (between 9:30am - 8:00pm).&nbsp;
(He's the newbie area 'guard'.)&nbsp; or also just inside the zone from
Steamfont.&nbsp; XXVIC)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the palace near King Akanon's room.&nbsp;
XXVIIC)&nbsp; Near the tunnel that leads to the Mines of Malfunction. (In
the paddle wheel room.), or at the top on the Akanon Wall.&nbsp; When you
give the series C card the following factions change: King Akanon, Eldritch
Collective and Gem Choppers standing gets better;&nbsp; Dark Reflection
and Meldrath standing gets worse.&nbsp; Return all four C blackboxes for
experience and the following faction changes:&nbsp; King Akanon, Merchants
of Akanon and Gem Choppers standing gets better; Dark Reflection standing
gets worse.&nbsp; Mantik then gives you a 27C Blackbox to take to Jogl
Doobraugh who is in one of the windmills.&nbsp; He then gives you a note
to take to the merchant Drekon Vebnebber in the warriors guild.&nbsp; These
factions will change when you give the black box to Jogl:&nbsp; King Akanon,&nbsp;
Eldritch Collective and Gem Choppers standing gets better;&nbsp; Dark Reflection
and The Dead standing gets worse.&nbsp; These factions will change when
you take the report to Drekon:&nbsp; King Akanon, Merchants of Akanon and
Gem Choppers standing gets better; Dark Reflection standing gets worse.&nbsp;
The quest FORKS at this point. There is MORE THAN ONE report you can get
from Jogl.&nbsp; The quest you get from returning the report depends on
which one Jogl gives you.&nbsp; You will either get the Red 5 quest or
the Duster Models quest.&nbsp; As an aside I have been told to be sure
to ask Manik about the Asylum of the Mad and about Meldrath.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Telescope Lenses (A)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Telescope
Lenses:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Tobon Starpyre, the Wizard
Guildmaster, wants you to collect four spare telescope lenses from four
observatories around the Steamfonts. He gives you a rolled up note with
the names of the four Royal Observers, three of which are located in the
Steamfont Mountains while the last is located in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;
These are supposedly the four lense locations&nbsp; 1) The gnome royal
observer just outside zone line in Lesser Faydark will give&nbsp; you one
if you ask.&nbsp; 2) The gnome royal observer in one of the observatories
in Steamfont will also give you one if you ask&nbsp; 3) The gnome royal
observer in another observatory tells you it was stolen by a Dark Elf female,
Zenita DRin.&nbsp; She is in Freeport in the poor section of town. You
can get the lense two ways.&nbsp; Kill her - she is approximatley level
15 and hard to kill.&nbsp; Or you can play cards with her (if you have
an OK faction with her) by continuously trading her Innoruk's Kiss of Death,
which you can purchase at the nearby tavern (she is even sometimes found
in the tavern where you get the drink), for a draw of a card until you
manage to draw a King.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) The final royal observer in Steamfont
tells you his brother, Bidl Frugrin, went to Kelethin to do some observations
with the spare telescope lens.&nbsp; He says he has likely found the local
tavern and has gotten drunk, wandering the forest by day, and hanging out
in the tavern by night.&nbsp; At night, he can be found in the tavern next
to Trueshot Bows in Kelethin and happily gives you the telescope lens.
Take the lenses to Tobon Starpyre and give all four to him at once.&nbsp;
He will give you a level 8 spell (Fire bolt being one) and approx 1 pp.&nbsp;
