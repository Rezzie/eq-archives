<b>Did you ever wonder with all those Frogloks in the Swamp of No Hope
why there are still so many mosquitoes?</b><b></b>
<p><b>Why is it I can run around all of Norrath my entire life in full
armor with 8 backpacks, but I jump 10 times in a row and "Whoa, I gotta
sit down a minute"</b>
<p><b>If madmen are so insane, how is it that they can cast spells so efficiently?</b>
<p><b>For a city hundreds of feet above the ground, why did the wood elves
build so many taverns?</b>
<p><b>Did you ever notice that the only thing every race in Norrath seems
to have in common is a local brew?</b>
<p><b>Norrath must be a great place to be a werewolf.&nbsp; The moon is
always full.</b>
<p><b>They say it's good to be the king ... unless you're an orc.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't you think that after swinging a 2 handed sword and wearing
plate mail for a couple of years you would get a little stronger?</b>
<p><b>Should a master forager really be digging up more junk than food?</b>
<p><b>It's amazing that most camps don't have a ring of dead grass around
them from all of the players sitting there.</b>
<p><b>You think the Design team at one point thought "Badgers, we don't
need no stinkin' badgers"?</b>
<p><b>Imagine what it would look like in real life to see someone run by
being pursued by a bunch of bears, lions and wolves.</b>
<p><b>I wonder what makes the insects grow so big in Norrath?&nbsp; For
the most part, every other creature type is a fairly normal size, but those
bugs seem to be on some serious insect steroids.</b>
<p><b>Shouldn't a bard be able to perform for his meal?&nbsp; You would
think a song would be worth a few muffins and skin of milk.</b>
<p><b>What is it about goblins and orcs that make them all think they are
such great poets?</b>
<p><b>With all the magic classes in Norrath, I bet the fireworks shows
are pretty spectacular.</b>
<p><b>Shouldn't an orc smoke a little after getting blasted to death by
a column of flame?</b>
<p><b>They say fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly, but in Norrath the
only birds run on the ground and build houses in trees.</b>
<p><b>Why is it that you never see a pirate actually sailing a ship?</b>
<p><b>If a Treant falls on the plains and there's nobody there ... then
what the heck killed it?</b>
<p><b>Do you really want to eat something you foraged from the basement
in Blackburrow?</b>
<p><b>You have to admire the gumption of most Norrath citizens.&nbsp; If
someone walked into your shop dressed in armor and carrying a pile of lethal
looking weapons, would you send him on an errand to fetch you some bone
chips or some other trivial item?</b>
<p><b>Haven't you always wondered what things like Blackburrow Stout and
Edible Goo really taste like?&nbsp; Then again, you probably don't want
to know.</b>
<p><b>Just think how goofy it would sound if the typically abreviated conversations
most people have in the game were actually spoken aloud.</b>
<p><b>Only in Norrath will you get on a boat, wait for it to sail, notice
that nobody is driving, and feel like that is perfectly OK.</b>
<p><b>Only in Norrath can you go to your local bank and not think twice
about seeing one or two dead bodies laying on the floor.</b>
<p><b>It's a good thing we can't smell things in the game.&nbsp; During
a hot summer day, I bet all those people running around in heavy armor
have to really make the cities and dungeons reek.</b>
<p><b>Given the length of the Norrathian day, doesn't it seem like a character
that was started over a year ago our time should be a little too old to
be running around slaying monsters and such?</b>
<p><b>For such an evil race, the Iksar actually look very friendly when
you see them.</b>
<p><b>You have to give the Erudites credit.&nbsp; They wanted to go to
a part of the world where nobody would bother them.&nbsp; Well, they couldn't
have made a better choice than the ever-empty continent of Odus.</b>
<p><b>Where do you get all those little bags you use to throw things on
the ground?&nbsp; Imagine how many a typical druid goes through on grubs
alone.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be cool if you could actually hear the bards play their
songs?&nbsp; Then again, the twisting would probably drive you nuts.</b>
<p><b>Do the undead in the world come from the burial grounds of the common
citizens?&nbsp; If so, I wonder if they recognize them.&nbsp; "Hey, don't
hit that decaying skeleton.&nbsp; That's my Uncle Billy."</b>
<p><b>What are those NPC's thinking when they spawn?&nbsp; "Ouch.&nbsp;
Those people are here again.&nbsp; How do they always know I'm going to
apear at this spot?"&nbsp; You would think one of them would wise up and
change his bind point.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be nice to see one of the guards get promoted or something?&nbsp;
"Where's Guard Valon?"&nbsp; "He's now Sergeant Valon, patrolling the city
gate.&nbsp; And he's buffed up and looking for revenge on those people
who have been kicking his butt all these years."</b>
<p><b>Anyone who thinks Iksar don't have rogues has never met an Iksar
bandit.</b>
<p><b>The good races probably feel secure from the Iksar menace, knowing
that as a last resort they can always unleash a horde of killer merchants
to take the lizards out.</b>
<p><b>With all of the lizards, frogs, snakes and bugs running around, Kunark
is definitely a cold blooded continent.</b>
<p><b>Did you notice how everyone got off the boat or teleport and headed
straight to the nearest good place to start killing things?&nbsp; Poor
Karnor never knew what hit him.</b>
<p><b>How did a thousand years manage to go by without somebody sailing
a boat slightly southeast of the Oasis of Marr and noticing that huge continent
over there?</b>
<p><b>Isn't it kind of redundant to buff an earth elemental with skin like
stone?</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't you like to have the umbrella concession in the Karanas?</b>
<p><b>The game designers are definitely cat people.&nbsp; Cats get an entire
intelligent race and society, while dogs just get a few eternally camped
mutts.&nbsp; Even birds are better off than dogs.</b>
<p><b>Isn't it kind of cold running around Everfrost in a kilt?</b>
<p><b>With the Iksar race about to come out, all those monsters talking
about you not ruining their lands like you ruined yours will finally have
someone to yell at where that actually makes sense.</b>
<p><b>It's probably a good thing that the bears, wolves, and other wildlife
in real life aren't as aggressive as those found in Norrath.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be nice if real life school were more like training in
Norrath and you could just walk up to your teacher, train up your 5 new
skill points and be done with it?&nbsp; Congratulations.&nbsp; You have
become better at Math.&nbsp; Cool, lets go have fun.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be embarrasing if you could actually be crushed when
an elephant you just killed falls over on you.</b>
<p><b>With all those casters in Qeynos and Surefall, you would think they
would have built themselves a teleporter a little closer than Western Karanas.</b>
<p><b>When you loot a goblin and get yourself a pair of pants, doesn't
it make you wonder if all the other goblins you looted were pantless?&nbsp;
Yuck.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; And if they were, where did they keep their money?&nbsp;
Double Yuck.</b>
<p><b>In Norrath March Madness is probably a disorder that happens to soldiers
who get a little too tired of walking the same route all the time.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to consider people in real life? --
Your boss regards you threatingly.&nbsp; What would you like your tombstone
to say?&nbsp; Uh Oh.&nbsp; Break time.</b>
<p><b>Everquest has to be damaging to the railroad industry.&nbsp; There
are now several hundred thousand people who panic everytime they hear the
word train.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be cool if the animation showed all those meditating
casters truly so buried in their spellbook that they can't even see the
rest of the world?</b>
<p><b>How is it that creatures die and then shout out their words of revenge?&nbsp;
Shouldn't it be the other way around?</b>
<p><b>I think people are going to be real excited when they open Karana's
Plane, just to get revenge for all of that rain.</b>
<p><b>Think what would happen if you walked into a real life bank and tried
to deposit a severed head, several severed tongues and a backpack full
of weapons.</b>
<p><b>Imagine a classified ad in Norrath:&nbsp; Shopkeeper wanted. Must
be willing to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with no breaks or vacation.&nbsp;
Hazards include occasional death by giant or griffin.&nbsp; We pay minimum
wage, but will train you to be able to kill any customer who enters the
store.&nbsp; Rudeness a plus.</b>
<p><b>How is it the people of Erudin never found the Heretics when there
was a big columned entrance to the Heretic city not far from their city
and regular hunting grounds?</b>
<p><b>Did you notice how all of the banks, including the ones in evil cities,
are interconnected and share items and money?&nbsp; I guess even in Norrath
doing business with evil has never bothered a banker.</b>
<p><b>How do bards manage to whistle a warsong while swimming underwater?</b>
<p><b>Don't you wish you could actually grab those bottles downstairs in
the ship's bar?&nbsp; It might make the long trip a little more interesting.</b>
<p><b>I wonder why aviaks, who are smart enough to have built their own
village, are too stupid to notice all of the people sitting around waiting
to kill them?&nbsp; Brings a new meaning to the phrase bird brain.</b>
<p><b>Shouldn't giant skeletons have deeper insane laughs?</b>
<p><b>How is it that you can safely wander around just about any city in
wolf form, but when a real wolf comes by it gets pounded by the guards?</b>
<p><b>It seems likely that when the groundhog comes out of his hole in
Norrath, he probably gets blasted so fast he doesn't have time to see his
shadow.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Wonder what type of loot he drops?</b>
<p><b>When you get attacked by a werewolf, shouldn't you run the risk of
becoming one yourself?</b>
<p><b>Zoning is such a great concept, I wish we could use it in real life.
-- "The boss is coming" -- Zone.</b>
<p><b>Why can't you wear a backpack on your back?&nbsp; Or a wrist pouch
on your wrist? Kind of like the old why do you drive on a parkway and park
on a driveway conundrum.</b>
<p><b>Did you ever notice that all of Norrath is in the same time zone?</b>
<p><b>I wonder if the dogs and cats in Norrath get a complex when they
see the other pets they are competing with.&nbsp; Then again, nobody wants
to cuddle with a fire elemental, and playing fetch with a skeleton is just
likely to get you trained.</b>
<p><b>It's probably a good thing we can't smell things in the game.&nbsp;
All those houses in the cities and not one bathroom.</b>
<p><b>Where do the vendors get all that milk they sell to us players?&nbsp;
Has anyone ever seen a cow in Norrath?&nbsp; Kind of makes me wonder what
they are really milking?</b>
<p><b>Can an ogre really trust a halfling as far as he can throw him?</b>
<p><b>How does a shark's feet adhere to the ground when it gets rooted?&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has no feet and swims in the water.&nbsp; Wouldn't it at least drift
a little?</b>
<p><b>When you're walking invisibly through the Desert of Ro wouldn't you
leave some pretty tell tale footprints?</b>
<p><b>Considering there are more players than orcs in Crushbone at any
given time, and the slavers can measure their life expectancy in minutes,
why don't the slaves just run for freedom?</b>
<p><b>I'd worry about Y2K in Everquest, except the last time I did a /time
the year wasn't anywhere near 2000.&nbsp; Besides, chaos is pretty much
the norm in Norrath.</b>
<p><b>Imagine if there were orcs or gnolls roaming around our cities attacking
everything in sight like we roam through theirs.</b>
<p><b>To repeat an old Norrathian Saying:&nbsp; "Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good fight."&nbsp; -- I hope Santa leaves a powerful lore
item under your tree.</b>
<p><b>I'm thinking the Island of Misfit Toys is somewhere in the Ocean
of Tears.&nbsp; And that Charlie in the Box hits for some pretty serious
damage.&nbsp; And don't even think about attacking the flying lion king.&nbsp;
Probably makes Griffins look tame.&nbsp; But the loot...</b>
<p><b>When Santa visits Norrath do you think the kids leave him muffins
and milk?</b>
<p><b>Imagine what it would be like if getting drunk in real life made
the room sway as much as it does in Everquest.</b>
<p><b>Where do those Deathfist Orcs live anyways?&nbsp; There are way too
many of them to just be from the camps.</b>
<p><b>I'm surprised there are any orcs, gnolls, kobalds and the like who
make it to maturity.&nbsp; After all they let their children play near
the cities of their enemies while the toughest ones in the tribe hide deep
in their lairs.</b>
<p><b>Since Taunting basically relies upon insulting and enraging your
foe, it brings to mind one question ... What can you possibly say that
would insult an orc?</b>
<p><b>The most dangerous profession in all of Norrath almost has to be
the farmer.&nbsp; Who was it that convinced those people to move way out
there?</b>
<p><b>Can't you almost hear the irony in the guildmaster's voice as he
hands the newbie character his ragged, barely wearable guild tunic and
tells him to wear it with pride?</b>
<p><b>Is it just me, or does the&nbsp; rain in the game fall mainly on
the plains? - of Karana that is.</b>
<p><b>How is it that wolves don't seem to have Spirit of the Wolf?&nbsp;
Or have all those SOW spells simply sucked the spirit right out of them?</b>
<p><b>What is it about dark elves that causes such a fascination with neon?</b>
<p><b>A twist on a common thought:&nbsp; The only two things you can count
on in Norrath are death and trains.&nbsp; And they usually come in sequence.</b>
<p><b>Norrath is just like real life.&nbsp; There is never a cop (guard)
when you need one, but when you don't want them around...</b>
<p><b>Don't you think the wood elves would be smart enough to install hand
rails in their city so that you can't just randomly fall off the ledges?&nbsp;
There are obviously no plaintiff's lawyers in Norrath.</b>
<p><b>Don't you wish they would increase the spawn rates of the GMs?</b>
<p><b>Imagine if the monsters started camping your spawn points.</b>
<p><b>When a Monster is getting ready to spawn, where does it wait?&nbsp;
Is there some big orc holding area located somewhere?&nbsp; Whew. How would
you like to be in charge of that operation?&nbsp; The smell alone would
probably kill you.</b>
<p><b>A Cruel Thought.&nbsp; Imagine what your level would be if you had
never died ... Arrrgh</b>
<p><b>Did you ever notice that orc pawns often carry more loot than their
superiors?&nbsp; Maybe pawning pays after all.</b>
<p><b>Norrath merchants may be tough, but they aren't great businessmen.&nbsp;
A pretty face and a little charm and their prices start to plummet.&nbsp;
Plus they'll buy just about anything, no matter how many they have or how
little need there is for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool, another bat fur.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'll take it.</b>
<p><b>Why do Gypsies in Norrath stay in one stationary camp?&nbsp; Not
very gypsy-like is it?</b>
<p><b>Would you want Chef Dooga catering your Wedding?</b>
<p><b>If you pickpocket a fairy and steal its wings, how does it keep on
flying?</b>
<p><b>Whoever said money doesn't grow on trees, has obviously never killed
a treant</b>
<p><b>If nobody ever permanantly dies in the game, where do all the undead
come from?</b>
<p><b>How would you like to write the Norrathian obituary column?&nbsp;
Imagine the size.&nbsp; 10-06-99 AllaKhazam died today.&nbsp; 10-07-99
AllaKhazam died five times today. 10-08-99 AllaKhazam died twice today.</b>
<p><b>What do skeletons spend their money on?&nbsp; And why bother carrying
it around with them?&nbsp; It's not as if they may run across a bargain
they can't resist.</b>
<p><b>Imagine what you would look like in real life hauling around 8 backpacks,
several weapons and a pile of armor.</b>
<p><b>As you endlessly camp the same spot hoping to catch that elusive
spawn, you really start to feel empathy with the coyote.</b>
<p><b>How could a society so advanced not have invented some means of land
transportation other than teleportation and sow?&nbsp; Must be tough for
the farmers to get their produce to the markets.</b>
<p><b>Don't you wish that in real life you could just step across an invisible
zone line and all of the people bothering you in the other zone would then
go away.</b>
<p><b>If bandits are such great outlaws, why do they keep setting up their
camps in the same spots where anyone who wants to can track them down and
kill them?</b>
<p><b>Why is it that Orc Pawns think they're important enough for the Entire
Orc Legion to seek revenge for their deaths?&nbsp; You would think that
the fact that they are called "pawns" would give them a hint as to their
actual importance.</b>
<p><b>Wouldn't it be nice if your pet could do 32,000 points of damage
to something other than itself?</b>
<p><b>What an orc thinks:&nbsp; Yippee.&nbsp; It's good to be alive, and
in this nice sunny spot in&nbsp; Highpass too.&nbsp; Hey, look at&nbsp;&nbsp;
all those people down there.&nbsp; I wonder what they want.&nbsp; Hi people
... *blam*, *slash*, *crunch*... Urrgh.</b>
<p><b>Why is it that fire doesn't seem to do any more damage to mummies
than any other spell?&nbsp; Aren't they wrapped in old rags?</b>
<p><b>Did you ever notice that when you finally manage to gain a level
every monster in the zone seems to zero in on your location and bash on
you until you drop back down again?</b>
<p><b>What did the world look like before the various races destroyed their
own lands?&nbsp; Must have been pretty stunning.&nbsp; And I wonder how
beautiful the presumably still undestroyed lands of all those monsters
look in comparison?</b>
<p><b>Where do skeletons keep their money?</b>
<p><b>Whoever set up the system of paths in Norrath must have slept through
the class where they taught that the shortest distance between two points
is a straight line.</b>
<p><b>I'd hate to set up a restaurant in Norrath, since everyone seems
pretty content to live on bread and water.&nbsp; Not to mention that the
typical Norrath restaurant would probably serve something like Rat Kabobs,
Bixie Crunchies and Hot'n Spicy Toelings.&nbsp; Drool, Drool.</b>
<p><b>Did you ever wonder why skeletons laugh when they attack you?&nbsp;
What's so funny about being dead?&nbsp; Why don't zombies laugh? Maybe
skeletons know something the zombies don't, and that's what they think
is so funny.</b>
<p><b>Judging from the lack of things to do on the ships, I don't think
the Norrath Cruise Industry will be gaining many new converts.&nbsp; This
definitely isn't the love boat.</b>
<p><b>I bet Nillipus has the shortest life span of any creature on Norrath.&nbsp;
I guess going through&nbsp; life taunting everyone around you doesn't get
you too far.&nbsp; "Catch me if you ... *blast*, *slash*, *bash*... urrgh"</b>
<p><b>Don't you wish someone could cast spirit of the wolf on your isp?</b>
<p><b>It ain't easy being an orc.</b>
<p><b>Shouting for help will let everyone know you are about to die.&nbsp;
Asking for help may actually save you.</b>
<p><b>Stop and help out someone in need.&nbsp; It is good for your character
in more ways than one.</b>
<p><b>Pay attention to whose faction drops when you kill something and
make sure you don't mind making him an enemy.</b>
<p><b>Maybe size does matter.&nbsp; Wisps, the smallest creatures in Norrath,
are probably the most widely hunted.&nbsp; And giants...</b>
<p><b>Judging from all the empty buildings there must have been a time
when there were a lot more people in the world.</b>
<p><b>Can there be anything more boring than the life of a guard?&nbsp;
Imagine the recruiting poster for that job.&nbsp; "Don't see the world.
Stand in one spot and kill things."</b>
<p><b>Griffins don't make very good housepets.</b>
<p><b>Shopkeepers sure aren't making a living off their ability to suggest
purchases.&nbsp; "Hi there AllaKhazam.&nbsp; You look like you could use
a nice orc pawn pick."&nbsp; Yeah right.&nbsp; Very perceptive of you.</b>
<p><b>Don't you wish that once you got to a really high level you could
tame and ride a griffin? Imagine how that would look cruising through the
Commonlands.</b>
<p><b>Go out and see the world.&nbsp; In the long run, you will gain more
knowledge, experience and equipment than those who stay in one place.</b>
<p><b>How is it that the average butcher, baker and candlestick maker can
kick the stuffing out of an experienced adventurer? What kind of tests
do they have to pass to get into the merchant's guild?</b>
<p><b>Why are there no children in Norrath?&nbsp; Is there some secret
cloning factory somewhere that churns out citizens?&nbsp; I guess that
explains why everyone looks so much alike.</b>
<p><b>Norrath must have one great communications system.&nbsp; How else
can everyone in the world learn instantly that you killed their friend
or enemy.</b>
<p><b>Did you ever notice that Qeynos is SonyEQ spelled backwards?</b>
<p><b>A bard in hand is worth two (or more) kills in the bush.</b>
