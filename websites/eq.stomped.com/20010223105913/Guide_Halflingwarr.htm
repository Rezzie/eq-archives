<br><b><font size=+1>Halfling Warriors</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>By Tanlen Bosenberry</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>The Warrior in EQ</font></b></center>

<p><b>Warriors are made for combat, period. They are made to be able to
wade into the thick of battle able and withstand more punishment without
being healed than any class out there. Many refer to them as "tanks" because
of their staying power in a battle. As a warrior you have more of a chance
to survive when things go very bad than any other class. When I say, "things
go very bad" I'm not referring to a losing fight and where people need
to run. I'm referring to the unexpected situation where multiple "reds"
are around you at close range. I've hunted in Unrest and had a huge train
come by and wipe out everyone in my party except me. Warriors have more
hit points and a higher AC than any other class out there. They also get
all the best defensive skills and at levels before any other class. Warriors
can wear all forms of armor and have the best armor at higher levels. As
far as physical offense (with a weapon) or defense they have no equal.
The ability to absorb or even completely duck damage is the warrior's number
one advantage and asset in EQ.</b>
<p><b>So now that we know what the warrior's strongest point is we can
cover the second best thing that they are good for, (and the reason why
most people play them) melee offense. They get to use the biggest and best
weapons out there. They can deal more damage with a weapon than any other
class. The problem is, most people have an ideal in their head of what
a warrior "should be" but it usually doesn't match up to what they are
in EQ. Most people don't think "ability to survive in combat more than
60 seconds", they think "Conan the Barbarian, slicing through anything
that stands up to them". If you want to deal raw damage you might be more
at home with a caster. If you want to deal the most melee damage, you may
want to think about a monk. But if you want to be in the "thick of battle"
where all the action is at then a warrior has no equal! At this point in
time, Warriors are not the masters of melee offense in EQ, at least not
the way that most people set them up (I'll get into this later). Maybe
one day that will change, but for now they are a strong second.</b>
<p><b>Mages do much more instant damage at those higher levels. They can
finish creatures faster thus equaling shorter fights. Problem with mages
is they usually come out of a battle with full health or none at all. Older
mobs will tear a mage to shreds if it gets in close enough for melee. So
what do we know? Mages have better offense later in life whereas warriors
have better defense and can actually survive after 60 seconds of melee
combat. Everquest is definitely group oriented. Mages need tanks to keep
the mobs off them so they can destroy the mob, while warriors need mages
to keep the fights quick and to finish off fleeing mobs. This means that
a warrior's strongpoint later in life (in a group is defense) What's important
to defense? AC, agility, stamina, and defensive skills. We will get more
into these later.</b>
<p><b>Halflings</b>
<p><b>Halflings are about half the size of a human thus the name. Many
people don't want to play Halflings because they don't look as "imposing"
or "cool" as many other races. A lot of people have a short complex also.
There are a lot of advantages of going with a halfling. They are extremely
agile and dexterous. They naturally have the ability to hide, which can
keep you out of a lot of hurting. Hide is excellent when you need to sit
down and heal up or are in a dangerous area and need a minute to get your
wits about you. Halflings also get the innate ability to sneak. Basically
being able to move without a mob noticing you. Another excellent skill
for getting out of potentially bad situations. Let's say you are deep in
a zone and get cut off from your party. You are too weak or injured to
solo in this area but you can sneak your way out of the zone or to where
you think your party is. Another plus to halflings is that they have infravision.
Infravision helps you immensely at night. From being safer running around
to finding stuff to hunt, it always helps if you can see what's in front
of you. Another good thing about Halflings is that they can wear small
armor, which is cheaper and lighter. Finally, the last really good thing
is their starting city, Rivervale. I'll cover Rivervale later.</b>
<p><b>Halflings as Warriors</b>
<p><b>Where are they? You don't see many about. You see a lot of barbarian
warriors. I've read about five different warrior guides and have never
seen they words "halfling warrior" mentioned once (at least not in a positive
light) I see ogre, troll, and barbarian mentioned in almost every guide.
I guess because they have the highest strength, and stamina. Plus they
look real tough and powerful. If I asked you what a halfling looks like
in platemail, chances are you don't know or it would take you a few minutes
to conjure up a picture. If I asked you about an ogre or barbarian, chances
are you could picture it right away.</b>
<p><b>In my OPINION halflings make the best warriors, and I'll tell you
why. The reason is defense and offense. Higher defense means getting hit
less and when you do, taking less damage. That means, if you have a healer
in your group they don't need to spend as much mana on you as they do on
the clumsy barbarians, ogres, or trolls who seem like they have a big bulls-eye
on their chest. More mana usually equates to more buff spells for the party,
more mana to heal other members, and more mana for offensive spells. All
that equals less chance of someone or a whole party ending up dead. Survival
or Victory. Whatever you want to call it. Usually around now someone's
screaming, "yeah but I have a lot more hit points then a halfling". Yep
sure do. When you get older and mobs start whacking you for over 100 points
a shot, every other swing because you can't get out of the way via dodge,
parry, or riposte those extra hit points get sucked up pretty fast. If
the party can't take the mob down as fast because they need to heal your
damage receiving arse, who cares if you have more hit points? I'd rather
not get hit in the first place, or when I do not for as much. If the tank
dies the party usually follows if you are fighting formidable foes. The
next argument I hear is "Yeah but I hit for more damage than halflings
at older levels". That's the biggest misconception there is. A halfling
maximized for offense will destroy the large sized warrior later in life
(I'll get into this more later). Also the mages do a lot more damage than
warriors. Warriors will not be able to take mobs down as fast as a mage
at older levels. If you want to deal out the most damage in the group than
be a mage. Why try to be the offensive hero when you can't compare to the
mage standing behind you? The main reason why halflings have such great
defense is agility. If you maximize your agility it will be 125 if not
100. Another nice thing about having a high agility is finishing ability.
You notice that when you are down to your last bar of health your agility
starts dropping like a rock and your trying to run while getting whacked
in the back? I can't imagine what it's like to have a low agility to start
with and then lose agility on top of that. Doesn't give you much hope of
survival. Taking this into account I can usually stick it out in a fight
a little longer before I'm forced to run or back out, and if I do run I
usually have a better chance of escape.</b>
<p><b>Statistics</b>
<p><b>The people at EQ say that the most important stats for warriors are
strength, stamina, and agility. In my opinion that statement is wrong.
I believe the two most important stats are agility for defense and dexterity
for offense. Dexterity is the most under-rated stat there is for a warrior.
I bet you 90 percent of ogre warriors out there have a 150 strength and
a 147 stamina because they dumped all there points into those stats. I'm
telling you that after level 30 a halfling warrior would eat that ogres
lunch in a duel if certain conditions were met. The conditions being 1.
Similar equipment on each, 2. Both being of the same level, 3. The halfling
with a maximized dexterity of at least 180 or so (not hard to do if the
warrior game planned for a high dexterity) 4. an agility of 120 or so,
and 5. The halfling wielding 2 one handed weapons with decent procs (special
effects that randomly go off based on dexterity).</b>
<p><b>Here's what a 40<sup>th</sup> level shaman posted on the subject
of warriors in regards to agility and dexterity:</b>
<p><b>"My opinion is that all classes start to shine after level 30, and
this includes small race Warriors. MOBs really do get tougher at 30+ and
if your agility sucks, your healer is going to notice regardless of how
many hit-points you have.&nbsp; At 40+ it's even more important to have
a good agility. At this point most casters have SEVERE down times due to
mana recovery. You will want a Bard or Enchanter in your group, or use
a manastone/Cleric combo. And at this level the secondary priests (Shaman/Druid)
do not cast Greater Heal for recovery. You get Chloroplast, then you have
to sit and wait for your HP. GH just makes a dent in ANY race Warrior at
40+, not just large races.&nbsp; Last, but not least, at 40+ Warriors will
be dual wielding proc weapons in most battles. You will want a high Dex
for that. The picture of a big strong Warrior wielding a shiny 2H silvery
axe is romantic. But the fact is that the agile and dexterous Warrior is
just as valuable at 40+. And ANY Warrior at those levels is always welcome
in a group.</b>
<p><b>Snowbeard Blackprophet"</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Ok back to stats. One last thing about dexterity that most don't
know. It influences the rate at which you learn combat skills. Now lets
touch on the other stats. Your strength can be buffed pretty easy by group
members and is high enough, as it is to comfortably wear plate mail. Adding
points in strength aren't going to add as much damage as getting some good
proc weapons that go off a lot more because of your high dexterity. Stamina
is a waste if you have the mindset of not being hit in the first place
and you will have plenty of hit points with your starting stamina as it
is. Intelligence, wisdom, and charisma just aren't worth the points. As
far as stat placement I recommend to either dump all the points into dexterity
(for offense) or all into agility (for defense) or a balance between the
two.</b>
<p><b>Using Training Points</b>
<p><b>I cringe every time I read a guide that tells you at level 1 to go
put training points in skills that go up on their own. In my OPINION there
are 2 ways to use training points. First way is to develop a trade skill
or a skill you wouldn't use much, which would be expensive or hard to develop
otherwise. Second way is to learn the basics of a skill (by spending 1
point ONLY on it) you do not have such as a language your trainer offers
you or a skill you obtain once you reach a certain level (such as dodge
at 6).</b>
<p><b>Choosing your weapon(s)</b>
<p><b>Ok this is very important. Your choices are 2handed slashing, 2handed
blunt, 1handed slashing, 1handed blunt, piercing, and archery. You should
work on keeping EVERY weapon skill there is maximized for your level. As
a warrior you can use any weapon. You'll use archery for pulling creatures
from a distance and finishing fleeing ones off. You'll use two-handers
when fighting mobs with damage shields. You'll want to be able to use any
one hander out there because there are nice blunts and piercing weapons
out there too and you may come across one that's better than the one handed
slashing weapon you are using.</b>
<p><b>Starting Location</b>
<p><b>Halflings start out in Rivervale, which has a great hunting area
for levels 1-10. Rivervale is a one zone, easy to get around in town unlike
Freeport or Qeynos. Rivervale is probably the most central location in
the world that you could start in. If you want to go hunt in Runnyeye,
Beholder, Befallen, Highpass hold, Kithicor forest, West Commons, the Karanas,
or Paw they are all close. Rivervale also has one of the best lower level
quests for warriors, the squad ring quest. I'm not going to spoil it so
you'll have to figure it. It's definitely worth doing. That's all I'm going
to say about Rivervale. There are good city guides out there if you want
more info.</b>
<p><b>A Couple Group Basics</b>
<p><b>A few things I wanted to mention about fighting in groups.</b>
<p><b>1. Learn the assist command. This is especially important if you
are fighting with an enchanter or bard who are mesmerizing the extra mobs.
Nothing is more frustrating to the player who takes a mob out of the combat
equation only to have you put them back in.</b>
<p><b>2. Learn to watch your cleric or casters in combat. If the mob gets
on them and they can't get off spells then you need to step in. Do everything
thing you can by attacking and taunting to get them off the caster. A warrior
who watches out for the casters and healers are very appreciated and not
the norm.</b>
<p><b>Closing</b>
<p><b>One thing I wanted to mention but didn't want to do a section on
was etiquette. If someone helps you out try to give him or her a tip. Most
people won't take tips but it's the thought that counts. You want a faction
increase between you and your fellow players? That's one way to earn it.
Don't bug people about buffs, especially if they aren't in your group.
Help people out when they don't expect it.</b>
<p><b>I didn't go into group strategy, hunting areas, or a lot of other
things that warrior guides usually cover because there are plenty of resources
out there for that stuff. There was a gap in the warrior guides concerning
halflings. The average person thinking about playing a warrior whom reads
one of them guides may think I need to decide between a barbarian, troll,
or ogre. I wanted to make sure halflings get their fare shake. The people
who designed this game aren't stupid. Many come from a long time mudding
background. They know what works. They understand balance. They didn't
make any bad race/class combos.</b>
<p><b>If anyone wants to look me up I mostly play on the Erollisi Marr
server. If you ever need help feel free to ask or drop me a line my email
is <font color="#0000FF">Jennalea4@aol.com</font> I hope you got something
out of this guide even if you don't play a halfling warrior. Good hunting!</b>
