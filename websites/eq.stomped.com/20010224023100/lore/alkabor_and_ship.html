<br><b><font size=+1>The Tale of Al'kabor and the Sunken Ship</font></b></center>
<b></b>&nbsp;<b>This happened tonight, September 4th 2000 at 11:00 PST.&nbsp;
I was playing a lower level character of mine named Wump and was wandering
aimlessly, eventually ending up at the front of Felwithe.&nbsp; People
were sitting around talking when suddenly two GM's appeared.&nbsp; They
said "come in for a tale" and walked into Felwithe.&nbsp; Apparently they
didnt want many because only 10 or so were there at the time and they stayed
mere seconds, so a select crowd got to go with them and it was keept a
small event the whole time.&nbsp; We walked into Felwithe (all the players
on walk) and eventually entered a tavern. Rahgoths asked us if we would
like to hear a tale, and told us that no items were going to be rewarded,
and that no quest lead from this...it was simply a tale of old.&nbsp; Everyone
quickly agreed and found their seats, many got drunk.&nbsp; I had the good
mind to turn on eq.log and captured everything he said from begining to
end.&nbsp; I edited the log to remove all the worthless spam and castings
and such that were there.&nbsp; Heres what was said that night, preceeded
by a list of those in attandence.</b><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>&nbsp;

<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'This story is called Al'kabor and the Sunken ship'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Has anyone heard this one?'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Aha.'</b>
<br><b>Wotash says, 'No'</b>

<br><b>Rahgoths smiles.</b>
<br><b>Freybawe says, 'me too'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths clears his throat.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The story of Al'kabor and the sunken ship'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Is Al'kabor a person or a place?'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'Hush hush'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Many moons ago'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'In the great city of Erudin...'</b>
<br><b>Ghann listens intently.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The great wizard known as Al'kabor learned of a
shipwreck in the Ocean of Tears'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Ah, so hes a person'</b>
<br><b>You say, 'Al'kabor is a Gnome Wizard, he founded many of the spells
we still use today'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Correct Alain.&nbsp; Al'kabor is a great Erudite
wizard actually'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'question'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Wood?'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'if hes an erudite'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'then how is he agnome'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths smiles.</b>
<br><b>You say, 'He is a gnome, he visted not to long ago'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Good question. '</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'Erudite mother, gnome father'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al'kabor is indeed a Erudite.&nbsp; That I promise.'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'ahhh'</b>
<br><b>You shrug unknowingly.</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Wump said he was a gnome.&nbsp; Obviously he was mistaken.'</b>
<br><b>You say, 'Aye....I must have been I appologize'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Well, Wump did have one part right, and he should
be congratulated for that'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'What about this shipwreck?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Ah yes...'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'Indeed'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'the tale...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al'kabor learned of some great shipwreck in the
Ocean of Tears'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'But, he also learned by way of a messanger that
there was something special in the cargo hold of this ship.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'So, that bright sunny morning Al`kabor went to his
storage chest and gathered his robe, staff, spellbook, and a few other
wizard items'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'is the water in odus salty?'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'i have never tasted it'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Woodsmoke, not quite as bad as the Ocean of Tears'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'What did Al'kabor do next?'</b>
<br><b>Europe says, 'go on rahgoths'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al'kabor learned from the messanger that there was
a survivor of this shipwreck.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The survivor's name was Tillerman Janck.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'There was only one problem...'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'What was the problem?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor only heard rumors of where he may now be,
so he knew he would need help finding Tillerman, for he was the only one
who knew exactly where this wreckage was'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Ah...Woodsmoke that part is yet to come.'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'What kind of help could he get to find this Tillerman?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor decided that he would find aid in the great
city of Qeynos.'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Qeynos is quite a way away from the OOT.&nbsp; Why
did he go there?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Alain, he needed to hire help'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Ah...there is more friends'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'What kind of help did he find in Qeynos?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Well,'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'When Al`kabor arrived to the great city of Qeynos...rumor
has it the old powerful wizard's voice boomed through the halls of the
great stone city of Qeynos as he called for the help of six brave ones'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Brave ones...just like many of you'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'And did 6 brave ones respond to his request for help?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor mentioned that he needed help of at least
a ranger and an enchantress'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Aye...after some time....six brave ones did agree
to help Al`kabor.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'They were not quite sure why, but when Al`kabor
calls upon people, many do try ot aid'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Did he threaten them?&nbsp; Or the city of Qeynos?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor explained that the six brave ones could
have whatever was on this wreckage, except for one item which Al`kabor
would not name, which he badly wanted.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Well Alain, Al`kabor calls upon people as 'minons'
to put it mildly, very to the point he is'</b>
<br><b>Starky says, 'Ah so he had another motive besides to save Tillerman'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'continuing...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor did explain that he learned that this Tillerman
was rumored to be somewhere in the Commons.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Have you all seen the great Grasslands of the Commons?'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'AYE'</b>

<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'So, where we again friends...'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'He rumered to be in the commans'</b>
<br><b>Europe says, 'about the grasslands of commons'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Ah yes...thank you'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Al'kabor gathered the 6 heros.'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'And was going to take them to the Commonlands.'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'To find Tillerman.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Thank you Alain...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'So, they all set out...just as it began to rain...on
the path to the Commonlands'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'They as in the six brave ones, and Al`kabor'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Upon arriving at the Commons...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did begin to use his skills in the ways
of tracking.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Anyone here a ranger?'</b>
<br><b>Starky looks at Rahgoths and raises his hand.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths beams a smile at Starky.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Starky can relate then.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths smiles.</b>
<br><b>Starky says, 'Seems im the only here today'</b>
<br><b>Starky nods at Rahgoths.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Do you know what the Ranger's name was?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did begin to track and find signs of
disturbance of leaves and such'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Alain, that part has been lost in the tale...'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Alas.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did indeed lead them to a man...whom
was gathering berries'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Upon hailing him and some introduction.....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'It was indeed Tillerman Janck'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The brave ones and Al`kabor explained how they dearly
wanted him to lead them to the wreckage'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'Ooooo'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman however made it very clear he wanted nothing
to do with the Ocean again, as he now feared water, hence his moving&nbsp;
the the Commons'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Was Tillerman Janck a human?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Aye Alain'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Well,...acording to my book, but again my book is
old.'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Did he know what the cargo about the ship was?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths smiles.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'That part will come later Alain'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Well, it did take MANY ales to persuade Tillerman
to aid them'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'but...alas he did cave in and agree to lead them
to the wreckage'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'So, the next day, after some rest'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman, Al`kabor, and the six brave ones set
out for the Ocean of Tears'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'It was a fall day, the leaves brown...the smell
of the grasslands...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Let me ask you all this...have you ever acutally
paused to take a look around and be in Norrath? '</b>
<br><b>You say, 'Aye'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'indeed'</b>
<br><b>Europe says, 'aye'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'Yes\'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Sure, Steamfont is a particularly fascinating place.'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'always good to go back to the caves of akanon and
go for a swim in that green water'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths smiles.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths nods.</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'it keeps my skin soft'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Where were we again?'</b>
<br><b>You say, 'It was autum, leaves were brown....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'ah yes'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Tillerman was leading Al'Kabor and the heros to the
OOT.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'So they all set out...for the Ocean of Tears'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Upon reaching the shorline...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman began to tremble with fear...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'He began to walk backwards slowly...away from the
group and shore...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Indeed it was appearant that panic filled his heart
and mind'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Alas the enchanter in the group smiled softly and
began to cast some kind of enchnatment.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman became calm.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The enchanter did again cast another spell upon
the party...and Tillerman as well.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'They no longer fealt the need to breathe air like
mortals'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'what shoreline were they at?'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'sister isle? freeport?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Khaled, the Ocean of Tears, somewhere near Freeport's
edge'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'i see.. I see....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The enchantress began to cast this enchantment upon
Al`kabor as well..'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'but he smiled bitterly soft, calmly interupted the
enchantress and taped to his earing.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'He said "No need, I have my powers with this"'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Some say such an item exists in this land still....alas
I do not know what it could be'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths smiles.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'i've heard of such an item'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman began to wade into the water...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'leading the six brave ones and Al`kabor...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Down deep...deep into the murky waters ....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Then something began to appear...from the depths...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'It was a hull...or what was left of it....'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Was it Tillerman's ship?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths nods.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Then something else happened.....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The waters began to swirl violently around them,....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Something was not right....'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'uhoh'</b>
<br><b>Freybawe says, 'Not kood'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Then it happened all to fast...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The truth from the wreckage long ago began to unfold
to rapidly...'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Sirens?&nbsp; Zombie sailors?'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Killer sharks?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'You see friends, twas not storm nor rock nor pirate
that caused the wreck that day....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'No...worse'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Worse?'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'An ancient evil water elemental'</b>
<br><b>Freybawe says, 'Lol'</b>
<br><b>Freybawe says, 'Aek'</b>
<br><b>[Woodsmoke says, 'AHHHHHHH'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Yes, that would be worse.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'It was there to guard its claim form long ago'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'You see, it must have been the case where Tillerman
was knocked from the boat and knocked out cold into the water'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The God's did watch over him that day...'</b>
<br><b>Europe salutes the gods in pure admiration.</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'He floated to shore and there the Sisters did take
him in'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'kind sisters =)'</b>
<br><b>Freybawe says, 'Aye'</b>
<br><b>Khaled says, 'I feel bad for killing them now...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'So there they were...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The ancient elemental ranged fortha great wave of
attack on Al`kabor, Tillerman, and the heroes'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'A great battle, of what some say was epic broke
out...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor and the heroes...casting, fighting, and
healing...side by side...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Much like many of you have proven well in battle'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Then the waters calmed.......'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, '.....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, '....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Alas it was over....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The heroes and Al`kabor had WON!'</b>

allowing people to see it'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'ahhhhh'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'continue....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor immediatly went to search the hull of the
wreckage...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Then he produced something......'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'A parchment...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'A simple parchment friends...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Then Al`kabor slightly trembled..something rare
for such a man of his power....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'He muttered "The Kedge...it is true....The Kedge..."'</b>
<br><b>Wotash says, 'huh?'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'The Kedge?'</b>
<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'like the robe of the kedge?'</b>

<br><b>Alain says, 'Magical parchment.'</b>
<br><b>Wotash says, 'ahh. I see'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'He then noted a wooden chest in the corner'</b>
<br><b>You say, 'The Kedge are an ancient race of Gigantic Squidlike beings....they
went out of existance long ago save one who is roumered to still live in
the keep to this day'</b>

<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'They swam back to shore...Tillerman shivering and
a bit grumpy behind them'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'The warrior of the six brave ones brought his sword
down upon the wooden chest....'</b>
<br><b>Alain says, 'Warriors will do that.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'In it there was numerous gems, fine weapons, and
magic scrolls'</b>
<br><b>Vigor says, 'warriors will hit anything wether its dead or alive'</b>
<br><b>Vigor says, 'they are stupid like that'</b>

he casted a gate spell...'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'Tis unknown where Al`kabor went to for the rest
of that day.'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'But that ended his journy for the day....'</b>
<br><b>Rahgoths says, 'And so ends my tale.'</b>

<br><b>Woodsmoke says, 'and what did he mean by the kedge is true'</b>

<br><b>And that was it.&nbsp; The group dispensed, many of us stayed around
the pond and went fishing, others told stories...a few more went out to
Faydark to relay the tale.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, this is the begining
to the finding of the Kedge race, who must have been more ancient than
Al'kabor, and probably the begining to their ultimate downfall. Hopefully
I'll find more of this story someday :)&nbsp; Until then!</b><b></b>&nbsp;<b>Undaine
