<p><b>There are various pieces of information to be found in the game that
generally serve more as background than anything else.&nbsp; They come
in the form of books and scrolls and notes and other documents that can
be found or purchased, or through long conversations with NPC's.&nbsp;
While mainly background, they are interesting, add depth to the game, and
can be useful in figuring out quests and factions.&nbsp; Below is a library
of these stories.&nbsp; If you have any texts or other game lore or other
similar information, please e-mail them to me at <a href="mailto:Allakhazam@allakhazam.com">Allakhazam@allakhazam.com</a>
