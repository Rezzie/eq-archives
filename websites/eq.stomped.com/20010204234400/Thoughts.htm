All at the same time, you can walk, eat food, drink liquid, change your
weapons and armor, talk to your guild, friends and strangers, swing a weapon,
wield a shield, check your direction and probably a dozen other things,
but just try to step one step and still cast a spell.
<p>You know you are spending too much time playing Everquest when your
diet is even worse than your character's.
<p>You know you've been playing this game too long when you start memorizing
the positions of the local cops so you can run to them if you get in trouble.
<p>You know you've played this game too long when you see a sign at a hotel
that says pets are allowed and you think "great I can bring my skeleton"
<p>It's a good thing Clerics have magical means of reviving a character.&nbsp;
Imagine giving mouth to mouth to an ogre.
<p>If an item were truly no drop, how is it that you were able to loot
it from an NPC?
<p>Is it just me or are there more versions of alcohol available for purchase
than food?&nbsp; Then again, after dying 5 times in one day, which would
you rather buy?
<p>What could possibly have made the orcs think that setting up camp right
outside the wood elf city was a good idea?
<p>There is an old Norrathian proverb that goes "Give a man a fish and
he will eat for a day.&nbsp; Teach a man to fish and he will be bored for
a lifetime"
<p>In Norrath, do they say "a copper for your thoughts"?
<p>What do the merchants do with all of the snake skins, bat fur and other
junk they buy?&nbsp; Is there some hidden market for them that we just
haven't discovered?
<p>You would think it would be easy to battle a cyclops.&nbsp; Sure it's
big, but how much depth perception can it have with only one eye?
<p>Santa sure has it easy in Norrath.&nbsp; There are hardly any children
for him to keep track of, and if he wants to know if they've been naughty
or nice, he can just check their faction.
<p>How is it that even when it is just discovered, the banks in Velious
are still linked to every other bank in Norrath?&nbsp; Do you think those
bankers knew about Velious all the time and just never told anyone?
<p>As fast and far as he travels in one night, that jolly old elf, Santa,
just has to be a wood elf druid.
<p>The Ocean to Velious is full of ice floes.&nbsp; If I see a reindeer,
elf and human with a pack of dogs floating on some ice, I'm heading in
to see what I can loot.&nbsp; How about Rudolf's Nose (infravision and
a light source);&nbsp; or Herme's Dental Book (major intelligence boost);&nbsp;
or Yukon's Silver and Gold seeking Pick (item is broken of course).&nbsp;
Whaahoo.
<p>One more way Everquest differs from real life:&nbsp; In real life, if
you see a bear, you don't think "hey I think I'll just go bash that thing
with a stick".
<p>Don't you think that the single, tall guard tower on top of the hill
in Northern Karana should have been leveled by several lightning strikes
by now?
<p>I wonder what Chef Dooga is whipping up for her Thanksgiving feast.&nbsp;
Then again, I'm not sure I want to know.
<p>Every time I wander into Blackburrow, I can't help but ponder that musical
question: "Who let the dogs out?"
<p>How is a halfling able to wield a weapon he just looted off of a giant?
<p>You just know that when they were coming up with a song for&nbsp; Rivervale
the song "It's a Small World after All" kept going through their heads
and they finally&nbsp; just had to see if they could duplicate its effect.
<p>How is it that you can see a tiny coin that you dropped from a mile
away, but just try to find that long metal spear that you just threw.
<p>In the time it took you to beg for that gold piece you could have killed
enough Mobs to earn it, gained some experience and playing knowledge, had
some fun and, most importantly, retained your dignity.
<p>Wouldn't you think a Halfling running around Everfrost would get some
pretty cold feet?&nbsp; Then again, Halflings are not known for getting
cold feet.
<p>If real life shopkeepers were as tough as those in Norrath, I'm guessing
there would be a whole lot less shoplifting.
<p>I wonder what would happen if all of the bandits in the world really
started to go around and steal things.
<p>Why did the Ogres clear paths so narrow they can't run along them?
<p>Did you ever notice that there aren't any inns in Ak'Anon?&nbsp; Think
it might be that nobody except a gnome would ever be able to sleep through
all that ticking?
<p>Unrest seems like the perfect place to go to stock up on&nbsp; Halloween
decorations.
<p>When Lord Soptyvr says he is going to keep an eye on you, it is really
time to start worrying.
<p>If everyone just comes back to life after they die, where do all the
undead come from?
<p>Is it just me or do all those taverns in Kelethin with no bathrooms
make you just a little uncomfortable when you're walking underneath the
city platforms?
<p>I bet the grown up gnolls were the best behaved children in the world.&nbsp;
That's because the bad ones were sent to a fun new playground right next
to the big city.
<p>Just when I thought I had seen everything, I saw a Bull Elephant dodge
my arrow.
<p>Only the orc army would consider standard issue shoulderpads and bracelets
a great way to outfit their legionnaires.
<p>Imagine if you really went through life thinking "Hey there's someone
I never saw before.&nbsp; I wonder what loot I could get from his corpse."
<p>Imagine the skill level of a Giant Blacksmith.
<p>Think of what level most Mobs would be at if they lost experience every
time they died.
<p>When you practice alcohol tolerance with your guild master, shouldn't
you head to the nearest bar?&nbsp; And did you notice that after the first
couple of rounds, he always makes you buy?
<p>How can there be so many giants and yet not a single beanstalk to be
found?
<p>Think of the whelt you would get after you get bitten by one of the
mosquitoes in the Swamp of No Hope ... Hey, are you growing a new head?&nbsp;
Nope, just a mosquito bite.
<p>The most ruthless creature in the game has to be Krak Windchaser.&nbsp;
He'll stand there and watch you slaughter his family and them calmly make
a profit by buying the stuff you strip from their corpses.
<p>It's probably time to start worrying when you summon a pet and his name
is Goner
<p>Shouldn't the Vengeful Musicians be bards?
<p>Why do Ogre shado nites talk lik dis when dey as smart as sum classes
in udder races?
<p>For those of you complaining of how long it takes to run around the
world, think of how long it would take if your stride was truly proportionate
to the sizes and distances in the zones.
<p>For a corrupt organization, the Freeport Militia sure seems enthusiastic
about their jobs.
<p>Are sand giants supposed to look like Saddam Hussein?
<p>Bugs is wrong.&nbsp; Monsters really don't lead such interesting lives.&nbsp;
I mean how much living can you do in 10 seconds?
<p>I'd sure hate to take on the Iksar olympic swimming team.
<p>Did you ever wonder with all those Frogloks in the Swamp of No Hope
why there are still so many mosquitoes?
<p>Why is it I can run around all of Norrath my entire life in full armor
with 8 backpacks, but I jump 10 times in a row and "Whoa, I gotta sit down
a minute"
<p>If madmen are so insane, how is it that they can cast spells so efficiently?
<p>For a city hundreds of feet above the ground, why did the wood elves
build so many taverns?
<p>Did you ever notice that the only thing every race in Norrath seems
to have in common is a local brew?
<p>Norrath must be a great place to be a werewolf.&nbsp; The moon is always
full.
<p>They say it's good to be the king ... unless you're an orc.
<p>Wouldn't you think that after swinging a 2 handed sword and wearing
plate mail for a couple of years you would get a little stronger?
<p>Should a master forager really be digging up more junk than food?
<p>It's amazing that most camps don't have a ring of dead grass around
them from all of the players sitting there.
<p>You think the Design team at one point thought "Badgers, we don't need
no stinkin' badgers"?
<p>Imagine what it would look like in real life to see someone run by being
pursued by a bunch of bears, lions and wolves.
<p>I wonder what makes the insects grow so big in Norrath?&nbsp; For the
most part, every other creature type is a fairly normal size, but those
bugs seem to be on some serious insect steroids.
<p>Shouldn't a bard be able to perform for his meal?&nbsp; You would think
a song would be worth a few muffins and skin of milk.
<p>What is it about goblins and orcs that make them all think they are
such great poets?
<p>With all the magic classes in Norrath, I bet the fireworks shows are
pretty spectacular.
<p>Shouldn't an orc smoke a little after getting blasted to death by a
column of flame?
<p>They say fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly, but in Norrath the only
birds run on the ground and build houses in trees.
<p>Why is it that you never see a pirate actually sailing a ship?
<p>If a Treant falls on the plains and there's nobody there ... then what
the heck killed it?
<p>Do you really want to eat something you foraged from the basement in
Blackburrow?
<p>You have to admire the gumption of most Norrath citizens.&nbsp; If someone
walked into your shop dressed in armor and carrying a pile of lethal looking
weapons, would you send him on an errand to fetch you some bone chips or
some other trivial item?
<p>Haven't you always wondered what things like Blackburrow Stout and Edible
Goo really taste like?&nbsp; Then again, you probably don't want to know.
<p>Just think how goofy it would sound if the typically abreviated conversations
most people have in the game were actually spoken aloud.
<p>Only in Norrath will you get on a boat, wait for it to sail, notice
that nobody is driving, and feel like that is perfectly OK.
<p>Only in Norrath can you go to your local bank and not think twice about
seeing one or two dead bodies laying on the floor.
<p>It's a good thing we can't smell things in the game.&nbsp; During a
hot summer day, I bet all those people running around in heavy armor have
to really make the cities and dungeons reek.
<p>Given the length of the Norrathian day, doesn't it seem like a character
that was started over a year ago our time should be a little too old to
be running around slaying monsters and such?
<p>For such an evil race, the Iksar actually look very friendly when you
see them.
<p>You have to give the Erudites credit.&nbsp; They wanted to go to a part
of the world where nobody would bother them.&nbsp; Well, they couldn't
have made a better choice than the ever-empty continent of Odus.
<p>Where do you get all those little bags you use to throw things on the
ground?&nbsp; Imagine how many a typical druid goes through on grubs alone.
<p>Wouldn't it be cool if you could actually hear the bards play their
songs?&nbsp; Then again, the twisting would probably drive you nuts.
<p>Do the undead in the world come from the burial grounds of the common
citizens?&nbsp; If so, I wonder if they recognize them.&nbsp; "Hey, don't
hit that decaying skeleton.&nbsp; That's my Uncle Billy."
<p>What are those NPC's thinking when they spawn?&nbsp; "Ouch.&nbsp; Those
people are here again.&nbsp; How do they always know I'm going to apear
at this spot?"&nbsp; You would think one of them would wise up and change
his bind point.
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to see one of the guards get promoted or something?&nbsp;
"Where's Guard Valon?"&nbsp; "He's now Sergeant Valon, patrolling the city
gate.&nbsp; And he's buffed up and looking for revenge on those people
who have been kicking his butt all these years."
<p>Anyone who thinks Iksar don't have rogues has never met an Iksar bandit.
<p>The good races probably feel secure from the Iksar menace, knowing that
as a last resort they can always unleash a horde of killer merchants to
take the lizards out.
<p>With all of the lizards, frogs, snakes and bugs running around, Kunark
is definitely a cold blooded continent.
<p>Did you notice how everyone got off the boat or teleport and headed
straight to the nearest good place to start killing things?&nbsp; Poor
Karnor never knew what hit him.
<p>How did a thousand years manage to go by without somebody sailing a
boat slightly southeast of the Oasis of Marr and noticing that huge continent
over there?
<p>Isn't it kind of redundant to buff an earth elemental with skin like
stone?
<p>Wouldn't you like to have the umbrella concession in the Karanas?
<p>The game designers are definitely cat people.&nbsp; Cats get an entire
intelligent race and society, while dogs just get a few eternally camped
mutts.&nbsp; Even birds are better off than dogs.
<p>Isn't it kind of cold running around Everfrost in a kilt?
<p>With the Iksar race about to come out, all those monsters talking about
you not ruining their lands like you ruined yours will finally have someone
to yell at where that actually makes sense.
<p>It's probably a good thing that the bears, wolves, and other wildlife
in real life aren't as aggressive as those found in Norrath.
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if real life school were more like training in Norrath
and you could just walk up to your teacher, train up your 5 new skill points
and be done with it?&nbsp; Congratulations.&nbsp; You have become better
at Math.&nbsp; Cool, lets go have fun.
<p>Wouldn't it be embarrasing if you could actually be crushed when an
elephant you just killed falls over on you.
<p>With all those casters in Qeynos and Surefall, you would think they
would have built themselves a teleporter a little closer than Western Karanas.
<p>When you loot a goblin and get yourself a pair of pants, doesn't it
make you wonder if all the other goblins you looted were pantless?&nbsp;
Yuck.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; And if they were, where did they keep their money?&nbsp;
Double Yuck.
<p>In Norrath March Madness is probably a disorder that happens to soldiers
who get a little too tired of walking the same route all the time.
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to consider people in real life? -- Your
boss regards you threatingly.&nbsp; What would you like your tombstone
to say?&nbsp; Uh Oh.&nbsp; Break time.
<p>Everquest has to be damaging to the railroad industry.&nbsp; There are
now several hundred thousand people who panic everytime they hear the word
train.
<p>Wouldn't it be cool if the animation showed all those meditating casters
truly so buried in their spellbook that they can't even see the rest of
the world?
<p>How is it that creatures die and then shout out their words of revenge?&nbsp;
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
<p>I think people are going to be real excited when they open Karana's
Plane, just to get revenge for all of that rain.
<p>Think what would happen if you walked into a real life bank and tried
to deposit a severed head, several severed tongues and a backpack full
of weapons.
<p>Imagine a classified ad in Norrath:&nbsp; Shopkeeper wanted. Must be
willing to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with no breaks or vacation.&nbsp;
Hazards include occasional death by giant or griffin.&nbsp; We pay minimum
wage, but will train you to be able to kill any customer who enters the
store.&nbsp; Rudeness a plus.
<p>How is it the people of Erudin never found the Heretics when there was
a big columned entrance to the Heretic city not far from their city and
regular hunting grounds?
<p>Did you notice how all of the banks, including the ones in evil cities,
are interconnected and share items and money?&nbsp; I guess even in Norrath
doing business with evil has never bothered a banker.
<p>How do bards manage to whistle a warsong while swimming underwater?
<p>Don't you wish you could actually grab those bottles downstairs in the
ship's bar?&nbsp; It might make the long trip a little more interesting.
<p>I wonder why aviaks, who are smart enough to have built their own village,
are too stupid to notice all of the people sitting around waiting to kill
them?&nbsp; Brings a new meaning to the phrase bird brain.
<p>Shouldn't giant skeletons have deeper insane laughs?
<p>How is it that you can safely wander around just about any city in wolf
form, but when a real wolf comes by it gets pounded by the guards?
<p>It seems likely that when the groundhog comes out of his hole in Norrath,
he probably gets blasted so fast he doesn't have time to see his shadow.&nbsp;
Hmm.&nbsp; Wonder what type of loot he drops?
<p>When you get attacked by a werewolf, shouldn't you run the risk of becoming
one yourself?
<p>Zoning is such a great concept, I wish we could use it in real life.
-- "The boss is coming" -- Zone.
<p>Why can't you wear a backpack on your back?&nbsp; Or a wrist pouch on
your wrist? Kind of like the old why do you drive on a parkway and park
on a driveway conundrum.
<p>Did you ever notice that all of Norrath is in the same time zone?
<p>I wonder if the dogs and cats in Norrath get a complex when they see
the other pets they are competing with.&nbsp; Then again, nobody wants
to cuddle with a fire elemental, and playing fetch with a skeleton is just
likely to get you trained.
<p>It's probably a good thing we can't smell things in the game.&nbsp;
All those houses in the cities and not one bathroom.
<p>Where do the vendors get all that milk they sell to us players?&nbsp;
Has anyone ever seen a cow in Norrath?&nbsp; Kind of makes me wonder what
they are really milking?
<p>Can an ogre really trust a halfling as far as he can throw him?
<p>How does a shark's feet adhere to the ground when it gets rooted?&nbsp;&nbsp;
It has no feet and swims in the water.&nbsp; Wouldn't it at least drift
a little?
<p>When you're walking invisibly through the Desert of Ro wouldn't you
leave some pretty tell tale footprints?
<p>Considering there are more players than orcs in Crushbone at any given
time, and the slavers can measure their life expectancy in minutes, why
don't the slaves just run for freedom?
<p>I'd worry about Y2K in Everquest, except the last time I did a /time
the year wasn't anywhere near 2000.&nbsp; Besides, chaos is pretty much
the norm in Norrath.
<p>Imagine if there were orcs or gnolls roaming around our cities attacking
everything in sight like we roam through theirs.
<p>To repeat an old Norrathian Saying:&nbsp; "Merry Christmas to all and
to all a good fight."&nbsp; -- I hope Santa leaves a powerful lore item
under your tree.
<p>I'm thinking the Island of Misfit Toys is somewhere in the Ocean of
Tears.&nbsp; And that Charlie in the Box hits for some pretty serious damage.&nbsp;
And don't even think about attacking the flying lion king.&nbsp; Probably
makes Griffins look tame.&nbsp; But the loot...
<p>When Santa visits Norrath do you think the kids leave him muffins and
milk?
<p>Imagine what it would be like if getting drunk in real life made the
room sway as much as it does in Everquest.
<p>Where do those Deathfist Orcs live anyways?&nbsp; There are way too
many of them to just be from the camps.
<p>I'm surprised there are any orcs, gnolls, kobalds and the like who make
it to maturity.&nbsp; After all they let their children play near the cities
of their enemies while the toughest ones in the tribe hide deep in their
lairs.
<p>Since Taunting basically relies upon insulting and enraging your foe,
it brings to mind one question ... What can you possibly say that would
insult an orc?
<p>The most dangerous profession in all of Norrath almost has to be the
farmer.&nbsp; Who was it that convinced those people to move way out there?
<p>Can't you almost hear the irony in the guildmaster's voice as he hands
the newbie character his ragged, barely wearable guild tunic and tells
him to wear it with pride?
<p>Is it just me, or does the&nbsp; rain in the game fall mainly on the
plains? - of Karana that is.
<p>How is it that wolves don't seem to have Spirit of the Wolf?&nbsp; Or
have all those SOW spells simply sucked the spirit right out of them?
<p>What is it about dark elves that causes such a fascination with neon?
<p>A twist on a common thought:&nbsp; The only two things you can count
on in Norrath are death and trains.&nbsp; And they usually come in sequence.
<p>Norrath is just like real life.&nbsp; There is never a cop (guard) when
you need one, but when you don't want them around...
<p>Don't you think the wood elves would be smart enough to install hand
rails in their city so that you can't just randomly fall off the ledges?&nbsp;
There are obviously no plaintiff's lawyers in Norrath.
<p>Don't you wish they would increase the spawn rates of the GMs?
<p>Imagine if the monsters started camping your spawn points.
<p>When a Monster is getting ready to spawn, where does it wait?&nbsp;
Is there some big orc holding area located somewhere?&nbsp; Whew. How would
you like to be in charge of that operation?&nbsp; The smell alone would
probably kill you.
<p>A Cruel Thought.&nbsp; Imagine what your level would be if you had never
died ... Arrrgh
<p>Did you ever notice that orc pawns often carry more loot than their
superiors?&nbsp; Maybe pawning pays after all.
<p>Norrath merchants may be tough, but they aren't great businessmen. A
pretty face and a little charm and their prices start to plummet.&nbsp;
Plus they'll buy just about anything, no matter how many they have or how
little need there is for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool, another bat fur.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'll take it.
<p>Why do Gypsies in Norrath stay in one stationary camp?&nbsp; Not very
gypsy-like is it?
<p>Would you want Chef Dooga catering your Wedding?
<p>If you pickpocket a fairy and steal its wings, how does it keep on flying?
<p>Whoever said money doesn't grow on trees, has obviously never killed
a treant
<p>If nobody ever permanantly dies in the game, where do all the undead
come from?
<p>How would you like to write the Norrathian obituary column?&nbsp; Imagine
the size.&nbsp; 10-06-99 AllaKhazam died today.&nbsp; 10-07-99 AllaKhazam
died five times today. 10-08-99 AllaKhazam died twice today.
<p>What do skeletons spend their money on?&nbsp; And why bother carrying
it around with them?&nbsp; It's not as if they may run across a bargain
they can't resist.
<p>Imagine what you would look like in real life hauling around 8 backpacks,
several weapons and a pile of armor.
<p>As you endlessly camp the same spot hoping to catch that elusive spawn,
you really start to feel empathy with the coyote.
<p>How could a society so advanced not have invented some means of land
transportation other than teleportation and sow?&nbsp; Must be tough for
the farmers to get their produce to the markets.
<p>Don't you wish that in real life you could just step across an invisible
zone line and all of the people bothering you in the other zone would then
go away.
<p>If bandits are such great outlaws, why do they keep setting up their
camps in the same spots where anyone who wants to can track them down and
kill them?
<p>Why is it that Orc Pawns think they're important enough for the Entire
Orc Legion to seek revenge for their deaths?&nbsp; You would think that
the fact that they are called "pawns" would give them a hint as to their
actual importance.
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if your pet could do 32,000 points of damage to
something other than itself?
<p>What an orc thinks:&nbsp; Yippee.&nbsp; It's good to be alive, and in
this nice sunny spot in&nbsp; Highpass too.&nbsp; Hey, look at&nbsp;&nbsp;
all those people down there.&nbsp; I wonder what they want.&nbsp; Hi people
... *blam*, *slash*, *crunch*... Urrgh.
<p>Why is it that fire doesn't seem to do any more damage to mummies than
any other spell?&nbsp; Aren't they wrapped in old rags?
<p>Did you ever notice that when you finally manage to gain a level every
monster in the zone seems to zero in on your location and bash on you until
you drop back down again?
<p>What did the world look like before the various races destroyed their
own lands?&nbsp; Must have been pretty stunning.&nbsp; And I wonder how
beautiful the presumably still undestroyed lands of all those monsters
look in comparison?
<p>Where do skeletons keep their money?
<p>Whoever set up the system of paths in Norrath must have slept through
the class where they taught that the shortest distance between two points
is a straight line.
<p>I'd hate to set up a restaurant in Norrath, since everyone seems pretty
content to live on bread and water.&nbsp; Not to mention that the typical
Norrath restaurant would probably serve something like Rat Kabobs, Bixie
Crunchies and Hot'n Spicy Toelings.&nbsp; Drool, Drool.
<p>Did you ever wonder why skeletons laugh when they attack you?&nbsp;
What's so funny about being dead?&nbsp; Why don't zombies laugh? Maybe
skeletons know something the zombies don't, and that's what they think
is so funny.
<p>Judging from the lack of things to do on the ships, I don't think the
Norrath Cruise Industry will be gaining many new converts.&nbsp; This definitely
isn't the love boat.
<p>I bet Nillipus has the shortest life span of any creature on Norrath.&nbsp;
I guess going through&nbsp; life taunting everyone around you doesn't get
you too far.&nbsp; "Catch me if you ... *blast*, *slash*, *bash*... urrgh"
<p>Don't you wish someone could cast spirit of the wolf on your isp?
<p>It ain't easy being an orc.
<p>Shouting for help will let everyone know you are about to die.&nbsp;
Asking for help may actually save you.
<p>Stop and help out someone in need.&nbsp; It is good for your character
in more ways than one.
<p>Pay attention to whose faction drops when you kill something and make
sure you don't mind making him an enemy.
<p>Maybe size does matter.&nbsp; Wisps, the smallest creatures in Norrath,
are probably the most widely hunted.&nbsp; And giants...
<p>Judging from all the empty buildings there must have been a time when
there were a lot more people in the world.
<p>Can there be anything more boring than the life of a guard?&nbsp; Imagine
the recruiting poster for that job.&nbsp; "Don't see the world. Stand in
one spot and kill things."
<p>Griffins don't make very good housepets.
<p>Shopkeepers sure aren't making a living off their ability to suggest
purchases.&nbsp; "Hi there AllaKhazam.&nbsp; You look like you could use
a nice orc pawn pick."&nbsp; Yeah right.&nbsp; Very perceptive of you.
<p>Don't you wish that once you got to a really high level you could tame
and ride a griffin? Imagine how that would look cruising through the Commonlands.
<p>Go out and see the world.&nbsp; In the long run, you will gain more
knowledge, experience and equipment than those who stay in one place.
<p>How is it that the average butcher, baker and candlestick maker can
kick the stuffing out of an experienced adventurer? What kind of tests
do they have to pass to get into the merchant's guild?
<p>Why are there no children in Norrath?&nbsp; Is there some secret cloning
factory somewhere that churns out citizens?&nbsp; I guess that explains
why everyone looks so much alike.
<p>Norrath must have one great communications system.&nbsp; How else can
everyone in the world learn instantly that you killed their friend or enemy.
<p>Did you ever notice that Qeynos is SonyEQ spelled backwards?
<p>A bard in hand is worth two (or more) kills in the bush.
