<br><b><font size=+1>On Roleplaying and Other Random Assorted Matters</font></b>
<br><b>by Fippen the Happy Halfling Druid</b></center>

<p><b>I would like to say that my life in Norrath is just a wonderful thing.&nbsp;
I spend my days and nights <i>(why is it I never need to sleep?&nbsp; I
would like to sleep, perchance to dream.&nbsp; Do halflings dream?&nbsp;
what do we dream about?)</i> wandering the zones near my lovely little
town, killing those evil gnolls and orcs, protecting my river from rampaging
piranha and doing all types of cool happy halfling things.&nbsp; <i>(Though
once a big froglock attacked me.&nbsp; Then there were a whole swarm of
froglocks, all with the same name.&nbsp; That was a lot of fun, but they
attacked me and I died and had to run through all of the froglocks to get
my corpse and they just didn't seem to like halflings.&nbsp; Or other races
for that matter.)</i>&nbsp; But the behavior of the big people who come
to the town seems odd to me.&nbsp; They stand around talking about isps,
lag, movies and other strange and odd things that don't really belong in
my world.&nbsp; Moreover, they forget who they are and just group up with
any creature who comes along.&nbsp; Why I once saw a party with a dark
elf, high elf, wood elf and troll.&nbsp; How strange is that?&nbsp; They
should fight each other not together.&nbsp; <i>(and those trolls are really
ugly.&nbsp; do trolls have sex?&nbsp; have you seen a troll woman?&nbsp;
I mean could you?&nbsp; ugh.)</i> .&nbsp; Yet people seem to forget who
and what they are.&nbsp; I went into Misty Thicket once and this dark elf
was wandering around killing our bears.&nbsp; Now that isn't right.&nbsp;
Those bears didn't do him any harm.&nbsp; <i>(Why bears are the nicest
things around.&nbsp; Well wolves and lions are nice too.&nbsp; They are
all so cuddly.&nbsp; I love to go up and pet them and rub my face in their
fur and dance beside them with my hairy toes rubbing in the grass and give
them a nice warm bear hug)</i>.&nbsp; So I yelled at him to stop harming
the bears and to get out of our forest and then I cheered the bear on while
the bear killed him.&nbsp; That dark elf was not happy with me.&nbsp; He
thought I should be healing him while he fought the bear or even helping
him kill the bear.&nbsp; But while I have nothing against dark elves <i>(except
that they are evil aren't they.&nbsp; Funny they don't usually act evil.&nbsp;
I see dark elves healing people and helping them out, even of good races.&nbsp;
Don't the dark gods dislike their powers being used to help good people
shouldn't they be hurting people instead?&nbsp; Oh well who can understand
the reasons behind those of evil)</i>, I love my bears.&nbsp; He started
yelling at me so loud everyone in the zone could hear.&nbsp; All he had
to do was stop killing the bears.&nbsp; Of course he at least talked to
me.&nbsp; How many people just stop to talk?&nbsp; We halflings love to
talk.&nbsp; Why we can go on and on about many things.&nbsp; Have you ever
talked to a guard?&nbsp; You should at least thank them when they save
you from sure death.&nbsp; They are great listeners.&nbsp; They will stand
there and listen and listen and only say something if you say hail<i> (Why
is that?&nbsp; why hail and not hello?&nbsp; or Hi? or Yo? Is it some kind
of guard and shopkeeper initiation?&nbsp; See how many people they can
get to say hail to them?&nbsp; Is someone keeping score?).&nbsp;</i> And
you should talk to the monsters too.&nbsp; "It's gnolls like you that ruined
your own lands and I'm not going to let you ruin mine."&nbsp; That should
get their attention.&nbsp; And don't forget to emote things.&nbsp; "/e
moons the gnoll."&nbsp; "/e kicks the gnolls hairy butt."&nbsp; "/e takes
a mighty swing and lands flat on his rear."&nbsp; Adds a little excitement
to the battle.&nbsp; Brings your character to life.&nbsp; And that is what
we are.&nbsp; We are characters and should have out own distinct personalities.&nbsp;
It's so much more fun that way.&nbsp; Compose a history.&nbsp; Pick a phobia.&nbsp;
Develop a personality tick.&nbsp; <i>(now there's something we don't see
in Norrath.&nbsp; You would think with all of these animals running around
that there would be lots of ticks.&nbsp; And if there's giant rats, why
not giant ticks?&nbsp; big hairy blood sucking monsters with mean nasty
teeth - Oh no that's my mother in law)</i>.&nbsp; Let loose a little.&nbsp;
Stop and smell the roses.&nbsp; <i>(are there roses?)</i>&nbsp; And maybe
you will have even more fun in the process.&nbsp; Well I've spent enough
time in this dreary outside world.&nbsp; It's time to get back to the happy
carefree world of Norrath.&nbsp; Someone has to keep the piranha from overtaking
the town.&nbsp; Look for Deputy Fippen on the job.</b>
