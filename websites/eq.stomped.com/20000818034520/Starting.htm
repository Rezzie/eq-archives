OK.&nbsp; You just created your character and popped into your
home town.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you read the manual,
because I'm not repeating any of that information.&nbsp; OK.&nbsp;
First, press F10 and check out the view.&nbsp; Then, go to options
and adjust your display to the largest setting your 3D card can
handle.&nbsp; Check out the view again.&nbsp; Pretty amazing difference
eh?&nbsp; Next go to the chat options and set ooc and shout to
on so that you can hear all of the goofy things people are yelling
in your zone.&nbsp; You can always turn them off later.</B></P>

  Before you go anywhere make sure you scribe your spells to your
  book and memorize them and equip any starting weapons or armor.&nbsp;
  Right click on the quest note you are given to read it and see
  who you are supposed to give it to and where to find him or her.&nbsp;
  Important - Do not give that&nbsp; note to anyone else since
  you will never get another one.&nbsp; If you never plan to go
  PK (player killer or PVP) just destroy the PK note now.&nbsp;
  If you may wish to PK someday, you should put the PK in the bank.&nbsp;
  One note on pvp.&nbsp; If you chose to go pvp, better learn to
  be self reliant, since you can't be healed, buffed or helped
  in any way by non pvp players.</B></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Quick Buttons.</FONT>&nbsp; In the
  lower left hand corner are your quick buttons.&nbsp; You have
  6 sets of 6 buttons.&nbsp; Read the manual on how to program
  them. These are very important, since you don't want to travel
  in windowed mode, and you can't see most functions in the limited
  full screen mode.&nbsp; This is your chance to program in some
  basic functions.&nbsp; You may change it later as you learn more
  about what certain things do.&nbsp; I would suggest you assign
  the following functions to the first 6 spaces: melee, persona,
  spells (for a magic user) or special fighting attack (for a fighter),
  sit/stand, invite/join, and view.&nbsp; These are the buttons
  you tend to use most frequently.&nbsp; Some classes may want
  different buttons here.&nbsp; Just experiment as you play.&nbsp;
  I would then assign these to the second set of 6: run/walk, split,
  time, who, wave (because it's fun) and cheer (ditto).&nbsp; As
  you go up in levels and learn new skills and techniques, you
  may want to change your button layout.&nbsp; With these buttons
  assigned, most of the game can be played in partial full screen
  mode.&nbsp; You are now ready to walk around and see the world..</B></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Your guild master.</FONT>&nbsp; Read
  your quest scroll again, and head out to find your future.&nbsp;
  Somewhere nearby should be the guy in the note, your beloved
  guild master.&nbsp; Try and find him on your own.&nbsp; It is
  a good excuse to explore your home town, since you will be spending
  a lot of time there from now on.&nbsp; If you get desperate,
  look for a member of your class on the street and ask the way,
  or if you have to, /shout for help.&nbsp; Once you find him,
  give him the note, and he will initiate you into his guild and
  give you a robe/armor to wear, along with a little experience.</B></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Training.</FONT>&nbsp; You now have
  the option to train up to 5 points in your skills.&nbsp; See
  the discussion above on skills.</B></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Food and Drink:</FONT>&nbsp; Food
  and drink are necessary to survive, Although you won't die if
  you run out, you will eventually stop regaining hit points and

  <P><B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make your way out of the town gates to the
  nearest wilderness.&nbsp; This is often not easy to find.&nbsp;
  Explore the city on your way out, and remember where your guild
  is in relation to where you are going so that you can go back
  to train.&nbsp; Once you get to the gate, make note of where
  the guards are.&nbsp; They are your best friends.&nbsp; Go out
  and kill snakes or rats, but always keep within sight of the
  guards.&nbsp; When you get in trouble, run to the guards. When
  you get below &frac12; of your hit points, go back to the guards
  to sit and regenerate.&nbsp; If something other than a snake
  or a rat takes notice of you, run to the guards.&nbsp; If more
  than one snake or rat comes after you, run to the guards.&nbsp;
  Getting a picture here?&nbsp; At this point you are basically
  fodder for just about everything you meet.</B></P>
  <P><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Snakes are probably the best things to attack
  in the beginning, since the skins are worth decent money, and
  you often get several skins off a single snake.&nbsp; Bats and
  rats can also be worthwhile.&nbsp; Every zone has slightly different
  newbie monsters, and you just need to experiment.&nbsp; As soon
  as you are able to safely start killing them, attack the decaying
  skeletons, especially ones carrying a weapon.&nbsp; These are
  the best monsters for lower levels.&nbsp; They are worth decent
  experience and will get you good gold through selling their bones
  and the weapons they carry (which are also a slight upgrade from
  your newbie weapon).</B></P>
  <P><B>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a magic user, cast your spells
  as often as possible.&nbsp; If you find yourself low on hit points,
  but with extra mana, stand around and cast the same spells over
  and over again while you heal.&nbsp; If you are a fighter, practice
  your fighting moves.&nbsp; Practice makes perfect, and you need
  to increase your skills.&nbsp; It is your increased skills more
  than your increased levels that make you more powerful.</B></P>
  <P><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoard your money.&nbsp; Magic users need
  all they can find to purchase spells, and fighters need more
  armor and better weapons.&nbsp; By all means, upgrade your stuff
  if you can afford to, but don't bankrupt yourself in the process.&nbsp;
  A good early purchase for all classes is a pouch (though there
  are several monsters around level 4 or 5 that drop pouches).&nbsp;
  Also, humans should buy a torch or lantern as soon as possible
  to help see in the dark.</B></P>
  <P><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point, probably pretty quickly after
  you start fighting, you are going to die.&nbsp; Even as you go
  up levels and get more confidence, one good rule of thumb is
  to always know where you are in relation to the city gates.&nbsp;
  If you die, you are transported to the newbie zone outside your
  home city without any of your possessions (at low levels you
  get a weapon and some food and water).&nbsp;&nbsp; You then have
  to find your corpse, and you really want to know where it was
  before venturing out again.&nbsp; The /loc command can help you
  here if properly used (see below in commands for a full description).
  I know people who have spent many futile hours looking for their
  corpse.&nbsp; Also the constant /shouts of &#147;have you seen
  my corpse&#148; can get annoying.&nbsp; Along these lines, at
  least prior to level 5 when you start to lose experience, if
  you are losing a fight and know exactly where you are, you are
  better off dropping dead on the spot than running away and dying
  somewhere unfamiliar.&nbsp; It's a tough world out there.&nbsp;
  You will be killed over and over again.&nbsp; You can make your
  life a lot easier if you always know about where your corpse
  is.</B></P>
  <P><B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you attack anything, right click
  (/con) on it to see how tough it is.&nbsp; You will get one of
  several <A HREF="eq_consider.html">Consider Messages</A> .&nbsp;
  Your best bet is to only take on monsters that con blue.&nbsp;
  Whites are sometimes possible, but often get the best of you.
  Yellows will almost always kill you and reds are instant death.&nbsp;
  Get into the habit of doing this before every battle.&nbsp; You
  should also start to make note of which monsters are more sociable
  than others.&nbsp; Some monsters seem to always have a bunch
  of friends around ready to bash in the head of someone who attacked
  their pal.&nbsp; Knowing this will save your life.&nbsp; For
  example, spiderlings always seem to attract help before they
  are killed, and your nice easy battle against a single blue spiderling
  can suddenly turn&nbsp; into a bloodbath with several spiders
  of different types all bashing on you at once.&nbsp; You don't
  want to be the one running back to the guards with 5 creatures
  in hot pursuit while all the players around shout train and scatter.</B></P>
  <P><B>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Change your view once the battle starts
  so that you can see if anything is sneaking up behind you.&nbsp;
  You may be able to handle one fire beetle, but add another plus
  a kobald runt or two and you're dead meat.</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
