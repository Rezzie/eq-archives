<center><b><font face="Old English Text MT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>The
First Ogre - Dwarven War</font></font></font></b></center>
<b></b>
<p><b>Of the Rakthokian Kingdom and general Dagnor:</b><b></b>
<p><b>For centuries while the elven empire grew to the east, the dwarves
and ogres had thrived in the mountains to the west, surrounding the forest
presently known as "Lesser Faydark." The dwarves settled into the jagged
cliffs of what is known as the butcherblok mountains and there had established
their golden kingdom of Kaladim, "The forge of Norrath." The ogres were
able to wrestle control of nearby lands from the orcan hordes of Faedwer
after a decade of warfare and established the first ogreian kingdom in
the nearby Rakthokian ridge mountain range, named after the first ogre
leader "Rakthok the Warlord." There in the Faydark west the dwarves and
ogres lived in an uneasy peace.</b><b></b>
<p><b>While the immense empire of the elves could have easily crushed either
one of the kingdoms, the ogres saw the dwarves as a primary concern. Raised
in a culture where only the strength in your arms and the size of your
weapon mattered, the ogres of the kingdom of Rakthok considered only the
dwarves to be their equal and thus a very large threat. The ogres were
also greedy of the gold-rich mountain mines and the stone cutting skill
of the Kaladim kingdom, and to make matters worse, the friendly disposition
of the dwarves did not agree with the savage and chaotic tendencies of
the Rakthokian ogres. What resulted was an intense racial hatred and many
small fights between the two kingdoms.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the beginning of the second age, when the elven rebels against
the god Innoruk began to surface, Dagnor the Butcher was chosen as the
5th warlord of the Rakthokian Kingdom. Clearly the most ambitious of all
the previous Rakthokian kings, Dagnor was the first to realize that the
small skurmishes between dwarves and ogres would never solve anything and
that for the ogres to gain anything substantial, the dwarves would have
to be completely overcome or slaughtered. He saw the mines of Kaladim as
an infinite source of limitless wealth and power. Almost immediately after
he seized the throne Dagnor began to assemble the largest combined army
of ogres since the orcan clans had been overthrown. Dagnor was held in
check for a long time, however, because Kaladim was a chief source of gold
and weapons for the elven empire and the dwarves would find the elves a
strong ally if war broke out. The ogre king was smart enough to realize
that his kingdom could not survive an attack from both sides and so he
did not advance and the dwarves did not regard him as much of a threat.
While the indomitable elven empire loomed over western Faedwer, war was
not an option for either the dwarves or the ogres.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of the attacks on Northern Kaladim:</b><b></b>
<p><b>Dagnor is sometimes referred to as the destroyer of two empires.
When he began his campaign against the dwarven kingdom of Kaladim he began
the fall of his own kingdom of Rakthok, but also he stopped the dwarves
from giving aid to the elven empire against the ever increasing elven rebel
armies. Many historians surmise that if the dwarves had not been pulled
into war with the ogres, their help would have caused the downfall of the
rebel army and the old elven empire would still be in existence.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In any case, with the war of the broken crown raging to the east,
Dagnor knew the elves could not afford to lend aid to the dwarves and he
took the opportunity to launch his own campaign against the kingdom of
Kaladim. The warlord knew that the key to beating the dwarves was through
the less guarded lands of northern area Kaladim where the dwarves had primarily
established trading centers and peaceful mining villages. So in the middle
of the second age, the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian kingdom marched his
army of ogres and orcan slaves west across the hills of shade directly
to northern Kaladim without fear of elven intervention.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Old dwarves still tell the horrible tales of the first ogre attacks.
Ill prepared to meet such an invasion force, the peaceful cities of northern
Kaladim were swept over with tremendous speed. Ogre warriors burned everything
they could put a torch to and killed every dwarf they saw be it man, woman,
or child. In little less then a week the forces of Dagnor had surprised
Kaladim and caused the deaths of hundreds of dwarves. The warlord had found
the weakness in the impenetrable kingdom of Kaladim and now marched directly
for the capital.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of king Grimmly Fireforge, and the battle on the hills of shade:</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was Dagnor's unnecessary need to stop and make sure everything
was dead in the wake of his army that gave the time the dwarves needed
to prepare. Word reached the capital city of Kaladim days before the ogres
arrived. Hearing the startling news of the advancing army, the 12th dwarven
king Grimmly Fireforge, an excellent fighter and brilliant military tactician,
began to assemble a defensive force. Dagnor also did not anticipate the
speed by which the dwarves could gather into a force large enough to repel
his own. It was the warlord's first mistake.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When the army of ogres reached the Crakthorn ridge, just one mile
from the capital city of Kaladim, they were met by an equally large force
of dwarves lead by king Grimmly. The fighting on the ridge was savage and
brutal, but being less skilled at fighting in tight tunnels and with low
light then the dwarves, the ogres were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered his
army into the hills of shade where the dwarves and ogres could fight on
equal ground.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Day and night the battle raged across the hills of shade above the
lesser faydark and the grass was bleached red with the blood of the fallen.
Both armies were fueled by soldiers from their respective kingdoms and
soon the war had ground into a stalemate.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of the orcan betrayal and the battle of the shattered spear:</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thinking that the war would either be won or lost on the hills of
shade, Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the forest of lesser
Faydark to move north and add more strength to the army in the hills. He
left instead a handful of ogre soldiers and mostly a host of orcan slaves.
It was Dagnor's second and most fatal mistake.</b><b></b>
<p><b>For the first time in history dwarves and orcs came to an agreement
and entered in on an alliance. The dwarves promised the orcan slaves of
the defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would not interfere in the
war in favor of both sides. Completely in favor with the plan, which gave
the orcs freedom but did not require them to fight, the orcan slaves retreated
from lesser faydark to the east, deserting the armies of Dagnor and leaving
the southern hills wide open. King Grimmly took this opportunity to assemble
a second force to the south and then attacked Dagnor's army from both the
front and the undefended flank. The ogre forces on the hills of shade were
demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and the Rakthokian kingdom was
now completely vulnerable. Grimmly gathered his remaining forces and headed
straight for the ogre capital, leveling any fortresses he came to and burning
Rakthok to the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The last official battle took place beneath the forest of lesser
Faydark as the remaining ogre forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted to flee
to the south. They were met there by a small force of vengeful dwarven
soldiers who were able to hold them off until the arrival of the main dwarven
host. When King Grimmly and his army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought
viciously and were able to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A story
tells that Grimmly and Dagnor met eachother face to face on the shores
of a lake to the south of lesser faydark during one of these fights, and
that Grimmly stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity and ferociousness
that the weapon shattered into thousands of pieces even as it cut straight
through the ogre lord's chest. The story goes on to say that the warlord
fell to his death immediately in that same lake and that the evil in his
blood made the water boil and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed
the lake Dagnor's Cauldron and thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven
war was called "the battle of the shattered spear."</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of the trail of blood and the new kingdom of Oggok:</b><b></b>
<p><b>Barely more then three hundred ogres had survived from a host of
thousands and, saying their prays of forgiveness to their god Rallos Zek
for loosing the war, the survivors hastily retreated to the south-west.
For two weeks the ogres fled and the forces of king Grimmly hounded them
at every step, killing all those they could catch up with. The ogres plundered
every small city they came to, even the shattered ruins of the elven capital
of Caerthiel where they found ships and supplies they could use. Finally
fleeing all the way across the Loping Plains, they set sail across the
eastern oceans and away from the closing dwarves. The first Ogre-Dwarven
war had officially ended.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The ogres: beaten, wounded, and without a leader, reached the then
barren continent of Antonica a month after setting sail from Faedwer. Day
and night the forces of a once great Rakthokian Kingdom marched tirelessly
through the endless desert of Ro and soon to the empty mountain range of
what is now known as the serpent's spine. Wanting some time to rebuild
and recuperate, the ogres found the mountain's natural geography a good
advantage over any invasion force. Here they started the foundations of
a new ogre capital, guarded on all sides by two rivers, a desert, a lake,
jagged mountains, and a thick jungle, where they could start to assemble
again and build a new army for the second ogre-dwarven war. They called
their new kingdom "Oggok" which in ogreish means "Revenge."</b><b></b>
<p><b>The second age ended in war and death with the promise of a new beginning.
The petty squabbling of the elder races on the continent of Faydwer had
ended tragically and none of the kingdoms would ever fully recover. The
seeds for revenge had been sewn and the entire world had changed for all
the elder races. With the immigration of the dark elves to Neriak on Antonica
and of the ogres to Oggok, new lands had been discovered and none of the
elder races had the power anymore to stop the kingdoms of the gnomes and
halflings of expanding nor did they have the strength to control the ever
increasing population of the humans. The second age was a time of death,
sadness, and change for Norrath.</b>
