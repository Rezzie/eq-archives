<b><font color="#FF0000">Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">A
collection of various camps and towers make this a good hunting area.&nbsp;
There are very few wandering monsters, so you are pretty safe sitting and
resting in most areas of the zone.&nbsp; This is an excellent area to hunt
for players in their mid teens to low 20's.&nbsp; It has the major advantage
of being right next to the arena zone, where binding is allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The most popular hunting area is probably the gnoll camp near the Southern
Karana zone which spawns darkbone skeletons (level 20 - 23) and various
gnolls, including the gnoll embalmer who drops the skull of jen'tra,&nbsp;
an occasional high shaman wielding a runed totem staff, and undead gnolls
at night.&nbsp; Also popular are the various aviak towers around the lake.&nbsp;
The nice thing about these towers is that the aviaks,which are relatively
easy to kill and their spawn is predictable, if a bit slow.&nbsp; Aviak
guards range from levels 17 to 20 and there are also regular aviaks that
are in the low teens.&nbsp; The bad thing about the towers is that they
are almost always camped.&nbsp; There is also a bandit camp and an orc
camp that can be hunted.&nbsp; Be aware that the lake is now full of deepwater
goblins, who are a much higher level than the aqua goblins who used to
frequent the lake.&nbsp; Their home is a tower under the island in the
center of the lake, but they also roam the rest of the zone. There is a
tunnel under water which leads to the underwater tower and there are several
chests in the tower, but I don't know what, if anything, is in them.</font></b>
