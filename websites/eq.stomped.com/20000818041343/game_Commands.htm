target for you whoever that player is fighting at the moment -- this can
be very useful in heavy combat.&nbsp; you may want to set this as a Social

--&nbsp; Gives that person permission to loot your corpse or drag it using
/corpse.&nbsp; The permission is not open ended, so the person can only
loot you once.&nbsp; Good command if you died far away and have a magic
user you trust who can gate to and from your corpse to get your stuff for
you.&nbsp; Warning.&nbsp; Only use this if you trust the person.&nbsp;
There are some who will take advantage of you and steal your stuff, and

<li>
<b><font color="#FF0000">/loc (or /l)</font> --&nbsp; You may want to put
this command in your hot keys so that you can use it when you are about
to die.&nbsp; Then you only have to scroll back up to see where your corpse
is located.&nbsp; You can also use /loc to keep track of important locations
within a zone or to coordinate positions with a friend.&nbsp; It gives
you an X-Y set of coordinates of where you are or where the object you
are targeting is.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works as follows:&nbsp; X - This is your
North/South direction.&nbsp; The higher the number, the further North you
are, and the lower the number the further South you are.&nbsp; Y - This
is your East/West direction.&nbsp; The higher the number, the further West
you are, and the lower the number, the further East you are.&nbsp; If you're
trying to track down something and you have the coordinates but don't want
to deal with the North/East/South/West thing, all you have to do is start
walking around while rapidly using the /loc command and see the difference
in x,y while you walk in different direcitions.&nbsp; If your current x
is higher than the x you're trying to find, change directions until x starts
to get smaller.&nbsp; If you keep using /loc you should narrow in on an
x,y location very quickly.&nbsp; Remember to be in the same zone though.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Thanks to Zauron for the input on /loc)</b></li>
