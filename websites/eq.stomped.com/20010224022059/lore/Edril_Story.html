<center><b><font face="Old English Text MT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>The
Story of Edril</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Of Carandril's death and Edril's journey to Antonica:</b><b></b>
<p><b>At the age of 450, Carandril became deathly ill. The emperor fought
death for more then a year before his passing into the next realm. High
elves and wood elves crowded the busy streets of Felwithe for a full day
to witness the funeral procession, and Edril was saddened greatly by the
loss of his mentor and friend. As per elven tradition, when Carandril passed
away a new emperor was chosen by the council and the new emperor, after
being crowned, chose a new head for the imperial army. Edril was awarded
estates in the surrounding imperial lands, a hero's send off, and a large
amount of gold coins for his retirement wealth. Nobody, however, expected
Edril ever to lay his sword to rest. "He has the blood of a hero," emperor
Carandril used to say, "try as you might, you could never keep Edril from
the adventure." Thinking there was nothing left for him in the empire of
the elves, Edril gathered what wealth was given to him and set sail for
the far-off human lands of Antonica.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Arriving in the city of Freeport, Edril was recognized as a wealthy
elf only. His name was unknown to these western lands, but that quickly
changed. Edril became almost instantly renowned in the Freeport area for
his fighting prowess, as he helped many of the villages along Lake Neriuss
against the raider Zellain and his band of dark elves. His real fame, however,
came as a desert fighter. Edril held a chief role in defending an outpost
in the Kithicor woods against a large goblin attack, and it was during
this battle that Edril became infatuated by the deserts of Antonica. Whether
it was because they were so foreign to him or whether he loved the danger,
Edril spent most of his remaining time on Antonica wandering it's deserts,
from the eastern desert of Ro all the way to the dead hills in the west
and the plains of Karana. His most noteworthy exploits in these areas included
capturing Ragoth the sand giant and his "dust marauders" in the desert
of Ro as well as flushing out an entire nest of frogloks around lake Rathetear.
He soon was recognized back in Felwithe as a remarkable cataloguer of strange
creatures, as he would write notes about all his adversaries and send them
to the imperial library. As he made his way to Qeynos, he even fell in
love with an erudite female mage named Almaril and they were wed.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Almaril and Zisstrik the insane:</b><b></b>
<p><b>For a time in Qeynos Edril forgot about adventure or Carandril or
his home back with the elves. He loved Almaril deeply and she took him
back and forth from Erudin to Antonica, teaching him everything he wished
to know. He was as much interested in her crude but powerful magic as she
was his graceful fighting styles. For the first time in a long time Edril
was satisfied and happy, and to the astonishment of all it seemed that
the elven warrior would actually settle down in Qeynos with his wife forever.
But fate moves unpredictably and Edril was called into service once more.</b><b></b>
<p><b>An old merchant noble from Freeport, a long time friend of Edril,
sent him a letter detailing the problems he was having with a band of local
trollish thieves. The thieves, however, were not everyday thugs. Goods
from merchant caravans had increasingly been stolen to fund for a splinter
trollish army somewhere in the desert of Ro. The army, whom the kingdom
of Grobb wanted destroyed very much, was lead by an obnoxious would-be-preacher
troll named Zisstrik the insane, who lead his band of trolls on what he
called a "religious crusade." Edril agreed to help with the problem. The
troll bandits were easily found and easily dispensed with, but more important
was what Edril learned during the hunt. Zisstrik spoke at length, before
he was killed, about the troll dragon-god Trakanon and how the dragon told
Zisstrik in his dreams to steal and kill the local human merchants who
"pollute the desert and the swamps with their presence." Edril dismissed
most of what the troll said as crazy dribble, but he became increasingly
interested in the tale of Trakanon. In return for the destruction of the
splinter army, Edril only wished in payment that he be allowed to speak
with the shamans of Grobb about the great dragon. The trolls, however bitter
and tentative, agreed.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Edril's research and his quest for Kunark:</b><b></b>
<p><b>The elven warrior was immediately in love with the story of the troll
heritage. He was fascinated by the idea of dozens of glorious armies dessimating
eachother because of hunger and confusion, fascinated by the imagery of
the far off and blasted land of Kunark, but even more fascinated by the
character of Trakanon, a powerful being once a god to the trolls and only
seen by a single chief. He immediately thought Trakanon was evil both for
what he did to the trolls and because of what Edril knew about all dragons.
The elf silently vowed to make the hunt for Trakanon his final and most
glorious quest. Utilizing ancient trollish texts and learning what he could,
Edril soon had plotted a course to and over Kunark. Almaril protested greatly
and called Edril crazy for trying to carry out such a silly fantasy, but
the elf couldn't resist the pull of perhaps the greatest adventure he would
ever have.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Leaving his wife sobbing behind him on the docksides of Freeport,
Edril set sail for several weeks before arriving at what he hoped was the
lost continent of Kunark. Frightened by the horrible site of the field
of bone before them, the crew of Edril's ship told the warrior they would
remain on the coastline until his safe return. Packing what he needed for
a long and arduous journey, Edril made his way alone across the dead fields
of the ancient trollish homeland until he arrived.at the jagged cliffs
of Trakanon's Teeth. What happened next no one knows for sure, as Edril
was careful not even to divulge it to his wife before his death, but it
is rumored Edril had to escape many clever traps and fight through several
horrendous challenges before reaching the throne of the great beast. Even
then, he did not kill Trakanon because what the dragon had to tell him
was of far greater importance then any quest. Herein lies the complete
text of Trakanon's prophecy, as Edril himself never forgot the words of
the great beast and later told his wife in order that the whole of Norrath
may read the message:</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Trakanon's prophecy, excerpt from "The Book of Edril" by Edril's
late wife Almaril:</b><b></b>
<p><b>The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on his son and smiled
widely. "So," Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook the very ground, "at
last you have come." Edril, great among the elves, felt himself begin to
tremble as he stared deep into the dragon's fiery eyes. "You have no reason
to fear me, warrior, even though you have come here to kill me. But I doubt
that even you could perform such a task. You see, child, I was born before
the stars were made, before the foundation of this world was ripped by
Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth to the elder races. I have
been and always will be the eternal mystery between life and death and
gods and man." With that said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow
knew the great beast spoke the truth. "And yet," the dragon continued,
"I am but a watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden
by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse of all
my kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it die. Take heed,
warrior, because Norrath's death is fast approaching." Edril lifted his
head, his eyes wide in a look of shock and fear. The dragon simply nodded.
"Yes, Edril, Norrath's fate was decided long ago, or so the gods think.
But the visions of your gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness,
the future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong.
The gods made you all as a means to an end in their struggle and as the
wars of the elder races escalate, so shall the gods descend from their
planes of existence and make the whole of Norrath suffer. But there are
those among the races untouched by the taint of immortals whom I have chosen
as the saviors of man." Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with
his left claw and ripped the bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one
powerful stroke of his arm. Edril looked over the sides of the newly formed
chasms and noticed the walls glowing a bright red. A face began to form
from the blackness deep within the cracks, and Edril could clearly make
out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad eyes, gaunt cheeks,
and long silvery hair. "His name is Miragul," said the dragon, "a human
mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend the laws of life
and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell, wandering his tombs
filled with powerful magics." The next face that formed was that of a troll,
but surprisingly it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran from both eyes
down to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and unwavering.
"He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my kingdom and
find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest among his soldiers,
and was able to lead his people from death and starvation to a powerful
kingdom." The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. "You, elf, are my third
chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier and great hero.
Death haunts you at every turn but you are always able to overcome your
obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer of Norrath, and a lord
among elves. And now I award you with a much bigger destiny." Trakanon
spoke deep in a language Edril couldn't understand, and suddenly a small
pendant flashed into existence around Edril's neck. "To Miragul I revealed
the existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane
arts. To Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior prowess.
To you I give this: a small pendant that will allow you to talk with me
always. But it does much more. My strength is finite, Edril, and already
my powers begin to weaken. Soon either the gods or the elder races will
find the means to my destruction, and when that happens then the final
war for Norrath shall be waged. But when I die, before I leave for the
afterlife, I will impart my power to the bearer of this pendant, and he
shall have all the wisdom and the strength of the most ancient of creatures."
Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the floor of his cave. "That
time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy, young one. Everything I
say now shall soon come to pass. When the wars of the elder races begin
to come to fruition, the gods shall take notice and plan for their coming
into the world. Then, on the third day of the third season, in the dark
of the night on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn
my chosen in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues:
good, evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will arise to
the call of a fourth chosen, great among them, who will collect my gifts
unto himself: the magic enhancements of Miragul, the flaming sword of Nalikor,
and your dragon pendant. The peoples of Norrath will revere this one as
Trakanon's chosen, and he will watch the whole world burn."</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of Edril's last days:</b><b></b>
<p><b>When he returned home he was changed forever. With his greatest achievment
completed, Edril the warrior, feared of the orcan clans, slayer of the
plague dragon of Akanon, first soldier of the empire, and desert wanderer
of Norrath, hung his sword to rest forever. He lived many happy years in
the arms of Almaril, his wife, and they even gave birth to a son, something
no one thought possible between a erudite and elf. But whether it was fate's
choice to test Edril one last time or because erudites were enough "non-human"
so procreation was near impossible, Edril's son was taken by disease at
an early age. The event crushed the indomitable elf and at the age of 405
the warrior passed away. "No spear or sword or arrow, fang, claw, or spell
could ever hope of killing the elf known as Edril," recounted Biddyn at
the funeral of his friend, "but for a father, the death of an only child
is the worst poison the world can give." The lord of Qeynos thought it
best to send his body back to the elven empire and there gathered a very
ecclectic funeral procession: Merchant friends from Freeport and Qeynos,
human lords of Antonica, almost the entire gnomish population, and even
troll shamans from Grobb to bear witness to the last warrior to ever lay
eyes on Trakanon. Some said the dark elves were also present, spying on
the funeral from the shadows just to make sure Edril had actually lost
the battle with death. Dozens of elven trumpets sounded his passing and
his casket was floated over the top of the Elizerain Lake to sink into
it's depths forever, an honor normally reserved only for the emperors.
It is written that even now, at the bottom of the lake in that same casket,
the dragon pendant of Trakanon waits, grasped tightly in Edril's cold,
dead fingers.</b>
