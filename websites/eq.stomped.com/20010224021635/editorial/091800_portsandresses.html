<p><b><font size=+1>How to get a Port or a Res.</font></b></center>

<p><b>This is a guide written by a player who has both a high level druid
and a high level cleric. I had written this quite some time ago, and in
the last few weeks there was a post on the official EverQuest message board
that put it into very good words. Since the community took so well to this
post, I thought that I would revise and submit mine. Most of the tips presented
here follow closely with what was posted. And a few were simply good ideas
and should be included here.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here are some tips on getting a druid/wizard to port you, or a cleric
to res you.</b>
<p><b>1. Look for someone who isn't busy. See what zone they are in. It's
common sense that a level 50 druid in West Commons is probably less busy
than a level 50 druid in Lower Guk. It is simply rude to ask someone in
a full group in a dungeon zone to leave his or her group and help you out.</b>
<p><b>2. Use proper english. Like mentioned in the post, a "Yo man can
you port me plz?" isn't very effective. I thought that using role play
was a great idea. For example, "Hello fair traveller, it seems that luck
was no on my side this day, I was wondering if you could spare the time
and mana to aid in my troubles." That's much better, don't ya think? Also
it is very good to ask if the person can "spare the time and mana" because
that shows that the player isn't selfish and understands the burden that
it puts on the person that you are requesting services from. It generally
makes them feel more obliged to help you out, trust me.</b>
<p><b>3. Never just offer money. Unless you are desperate and have the
funding to offer 1000pp for a res, 300pp for a port. Sure it happens sometimes
and I'm sure most of the people wouldn't have a problem with, "Hey, I'll
give ya 300pp for a port to Sro, whatcha think?" But... 10pp for a port?
50pp for a res? That alone is simply not worth it. Plus the person you're
asking doesn't want to just be bought off with little money. They value
the skills the Gods bestowed upon them, and you 10pp just won't make them
jump on it. They want a person who is appreciative, polite, and patient.
Most people who offer money figure, "I'm giving you money, lets go right
now." And on the other hand the more successful people will be patient
and wait for the Cleric to finish banking, buying food/water/gems, whatever
they may need to do before they are ready to port. Sure, it's no problem
to give the person helping you platinum, gems, FS maybe, anything you may
want to give. But never just offer that and that alone right off. Don't
agree on something before, if you want to add it in the end it would be
appreciated and accepted kindly.</b>
<p><b>4. Do not be anonymous. The first thing I do (and many other people)
when they get asked for a port/res is do a /who all. First and foremost
they want to know what zone you are in. If you're hanging out in South
Karana, and someone in Everfrost asks for a res, I doubt its going to happen.
Second they want to know what level you are. No offense to players with
younger characters, but a person is going to be more willing to help a
level 53 with a ressurection than a lvl 17. It's simply because experiance
loss in earlier levels is not nearly as signifigant as loosing experience
in higher levels. And lastly, and most unimportantly, they may want to
know your class. Personally, I really like Monks, if you're a Monk and
ask me for something, your chances are higher. It probably doesn't mean
much
in the end, but it may to some people like myself. But the 2 main factors
are Location and Level.</b>
<p><b>5. No means No. Sure, my druid may be sitting at Kelethin's Bank,
not auctioning, seemingly doing nothing. Yet I refuse to port anyone because
I claim I'm busy. Who says there isn't a good discussion going on in the
Guild channel? Who say's I'm not catching up with an old friend in tells?
Who says I'm not practicing a few skills like sense heading, forage and
fletching all at the same time? Just because someone doesn't look busy
doesn't mean that they aren't. And if they tell you No then they probably
have good reason. Be polite about it and say "Thanks anyway, good travels."
and your chances of getting a port either at a later time, or in the future
increase.</b>
<p><b>6. This goes for a lot more than just getting ports and resses as
common sense would deduct. Always be an honorable, kind player. If you're
in a Guild, don't be in one that is known as a trouble Guild on the server
(*cough*guilty parties of rodcet nife*cough*losers). Don't be annoying
in /shout, /ooc. And the like. I could go on forever about this but I feel
that you players know what I mean.</b>
<p><b>7. After you have gotten your port/res, try to replace the casters
mana in any way possible. Any spell that sleeps a breeze through the mind,
a foreign surge of mana, or modulation rods. Anything that you can do.
These things take a lot of mana. 300 mana for a port, 700 mana for a full
ressurection and a heal afterwards. So especially with clerics.</b>
<p><b>8. Be informed on what you are requesting. Know where the closest
place to port is to your final destination. Know the difference between
Revive, Resuscitate, and Ressurection. Know that the cloest port to Rathe
Mountains is Feerrott for druids. Be educated on this and it will be more
to the point and you will have more of a chance.</b>
<p><b>9. More common sense. Thanks the person heartily. Only a few times
have I ever helped someone and they didn't thank me well. I found it insulting
and rude. It will almost eliminate the chances of that person ever helping
you again. I also know that I complain to the Guild when someone does that
and your name may get remembered. It's simple, it's quick, so just do it.
There is one minor execption I can see, very rarely I will be in such a
hurry, and the person takes a while to zone, that I leave before the person
gets a chance to thank me. Usually a simple thank you is sent in /tell
but please realize that it isn't rudeness, it's just being in a hurry.
But also be simple about your thank you. I usually don't like getting into
some giant conversation with someone after I help them out. Unless the
person is some outgoing social person a simple thank you and be on your
way is usually the best way to go about it.</b>
<p><b>10. Let's say the person helping you is around your level, and you're
headed over to Dreadlands to have a small drachnid group. Offer the person,
just to see if they want to. Personally I love it when I port someone to
South Ro and they ask me if I would like to join the FG group waiting for
them in Lower Guk. As long as there isn't previous plans the offer will
usually be accepted.</b>
<p><b>I think that that about covers it. If anyone would like to add to
this I invite them to. I hope you find this guide informative and helpful,
and I'm sure all of us porters and clerics out there will find this nice.
Again, I would like to thank the person who posted this (a high level cleric
I believe) on the Everquest message boards. You inspired me to finish my
guide of this and did an excellent job yourself.</b>
