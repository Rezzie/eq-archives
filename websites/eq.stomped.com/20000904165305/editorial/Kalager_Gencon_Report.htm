<p><b>While attending GenCon this weekend I spent some time watching and
listening to Brad McQuaid and some of the EQ development staff as they
gave us a guided tour of the new island of Kunark and a few other areas.</b>
<p><b>We were given a brief history of the island.&nbsp; Apparently long
ago the Iksar came to the island and created quite an advanced and sprawling
civilization (technologically equivalent to Rome).&nbsp; All this came
to an end when the dragons from the frozen continent of Velious took an
interest in the Iksar and laid waste to their civilization.&nbsp; The dragons
then took up residence in Kunark.&nbsp; The Iksar now struggle to survive
from the ruins of their old civilization.</b>
<p><b>At GenCon there were only two zones up and running on the new island.&nbsp;
The first is Warslik's Wood.&nbsp; It consists of a forest with a river
gorge cutting through the middle.&nbsp; There are large statues lining
the river along it's length.&nbsp; There is at least one bridge that crosses
from one side of the canyon to the other.&nbsp; Stones jut up out of the
landscape with carvings and runes on them.</b>
<p><b>A large number of creatures inhabit the forest.&nbsp; The goblins
were very interesting. Each type of goblin (worker, shaman, warrior, etc.)
had it's own unique clothing and armor.&nbsp; The animation for the goblins
is great fun to watch.&nbsp; They walk with a funny loping gait (instead
of the stiff legged approach other goblins use).&nbsp; Their tongues hang
out of their mouths and slabber around while they are in battle.&nbsp;
Little bits of cloth tied to arms whip around as the goblins move.&nbsp;
There is a new race of giants called the forest giant.&nbsp; They look
like a cross between their hill and sand cousins.&nbsp; Giant misquitos
buzz around much like the giant wasps.&nbsp; Cockatrices are hard to miss
with their bright orange, red and green bodies.&nbsp; There is a creature
that looks like a large orange (and very mean) baboon.&nbsp; I saw a few
giant leeches slithering around.&nbsp; You also see the occasional Iksar
roaming the forest.</b>
<p><b>The other zone is the Field of Bone, a rather desolate area with
a large arena in the middle covered with the bones of dead creatures (including
a dragon like that found in the Steamfont Mountains).&nbsp; A very large
tower lies on the edge of the field of bones.&nbsp; We were unable to see
the interior of the tower since it is in another zone which hasn't been
added yet.&nbsp; At one end of the zone is a cliff that overlooks the island's
coastline.&nbsp; There is at least one path leading down to the beach.&nbsp;
Underneath all this (but still in the same zone) is a large complex of
caves.&nbsp; Supposedly, once they are finished, this will be the home
to a group of followers of Veeshan (the Guild of Scale?).&nbsp; Entrances
to the caves are hidden around the the upper level.</b>
<p><b>The only creatures I saw in this zone were in the field of bones
itself.&nbsp; It appears that the rest of the creatures that will populate
the zone haven't been finished or haven't been added yet.&nbsp; The best
looking creature I'd have to say is the rhino.&nbsp; The animation and
skin is top notch.&nbsp; It moves very much like its real world counterpart.&nbsp;
Many nice touches have been added.&nbsp; The ears will occasionally twitch
and the tail sways back and forth when the rhino is walking or fighting.&nbsp;
It raises its horn to gore its opponent in battle.&nbsp; The demilich is
also interesting.&nbsp; When not fighting it resembles the bones of an
Iksar whirling around like a small tornado.&nbsp; It's only when it physically
attacks that the bones briefly reform into a skeleton.&nbsp; Very cool.
There were also a few giant scorpions and Iksar wandering around the field.</b>
<p><b>I picked up a few details concerning the rest of the island's zones.&nbsp;
As others have stated, Kunark is going to be about twice the size of Faydwer
in terms of land area with probably about 30+ zones.&nbsp; The home city
of the Iksar (which we were told will be impressive to behold) will be
surrounded by at least 4 newbie zones in order to handle the expected large
influx of new players wishing to play this race.&nbsp; Since the island
will be geared toward higher level players, the difficulty of the zones
will increase the closer one is to the outer edges of the island so as
not to overwhelm new Iksar players.&nbsp; Visitors take note, once past
the elven outpost on the coast, players will be met by the toughest creatures
on the island.&nbsp; Because of the dragon theme we were told to expect
quite a few high level dragons to be scattered around the island, as well
as other younger dragons.</b>
<p><b>In addition to touring Kunark, Brad gave some of us a special treat
by giving a tour of the planes.&nbsp; I'd seen screenshots of the Plane
of Fear before, but it was interesting to see it for myself first hand.
After that he took us to the Plane of Air.&nbsp; This zone is a sight to
behold.&nbsp; It is made up of a group of floating stone islands.&nbsp;
Giant chains dangle from some of them.&nbsp; Giant windmills sit atop the
islands.&nbsp; It's hard to put into words, but the view is breathtaking.&nbsp;
A friend of mine said travel between the islands would be done through
teleporters like the ones in Erudin.&nbsp; It might also be interesting
to see if those with the levitate spell could drift down from some of the
higher islands to the lower ones.&nbsp; The last plane was the Plane of
Hate, and it looked unlike anything else I'd seen in the game.&nbsp; The
whole plane is one large, gothic city.&nbsp; The buildings are stunning.&nbsp;
There are carvings everywhere (dedicated to the Prince of Hate himself).&nbsp;
Innoruuk's tower lies in the center of the city rising above everything
else.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he was not in residence, nor were any of the
other creatures.</b>
<p><b>There was also one new notable feature that is supposed to be added
in the expansion.&nbsp; For others like myself who have been bothered by
the problem of pop-in graphics in EQ (distance objects just all of a sudden
appearing), the game designers have decided to make the "fog" that causes
this an adjustable option.&nbsp; When the fog is turned off distant objects
are viewable across the zone.&nbsp; It give the game a much more realistic
feel, but it comes at a heavy price.&nbsp; When it was demonstrated on
one of Verant's computers the game became very choppy.&nbsp; I imagine
only those with the newest, fastest 3D accelerators will be able to play
the game this way.</b>
