Founding of Ak'Anon</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Of the gnomes and the empire of Felwithe:</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ever the since the first days of the elven rebellion, it had been
decided by the emperor of Felwithe that the gnomes would be a free race
allied with the elven empire and able to live on elven lands, much unlike
the almost slave-like persecution the little tinkers suffered under the
rule of the dark elves. The gnomes had been granted lands surrounding the
fertile Elizerain Lake and there existed for a century or more in peace
with their elven neighbors. However, being on elven lands also meant the
gnomes would have to follow elvish customs, and increasingly the gnomes
began to feel out of place. The gnomes were builders, not artists, and
they could not sing or dance or play musical instruments. Elves prided
themselves on their use of the bow and their long, graceful blades but
gnomish arms couldn't support the lengthy elven weaponry. And while the
elven language was meant to be spoken in long, descriptive, and fluid verse,
the gnomes were always prone to speak in jittery and incredibly fast sentences.
Slowly, a general concensus began to form among the gnomes that someday
a separate gnomish kingdom would have to be formed. The gnome most responsible
to bring about this change was named Biddyn.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Biddyn was born the fourth son to a poor farmer on the east of the
Elizerain Lake, the gnomish territories closest to the heart of the empire.
Almost immediately he recognized how much he, and even his brothers and
father, hated farm work. The most joyous times in his life, as he later
wrote, were the monthly festivals the gnomes held where they would gather
and build all manner of fascinating machines. This, he thought, is what
gnomes should be doing and he bestowed upon himself the responsibility
to make sure this came to pass. Studying elven mannerisms and rhetoric
on his market voyages to Felwithe with his father, Biddyn soon became a
speaker the likes of which no gnome has ever equaled. His very charisma
charmed everyone around him into the idea of a separate gnomish kingdom,
and he soon was ready to bring his demands before the emperor.&nbsp; The
emperor at this time was none other then Carandril, past lord of Kelethin,
who had appointed the warrior Edril as his first soldier long ago and also
as the head of the imperial army. Edril had served loyally and skillfully
as Carandril's guard for more then a hundred years, the warrior elf being
only a little more then middle-aged for his race.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Charmed by his determination and skillful speaking, Edril supported
Biddyn for a separate gnomish kingdom. Even the emperor was attracted to
the proposition, as a new allied kingdom would open new opportunities for
trade while the gnomish loss would not be a big drain on the imperial economy.
After only six days of deliberation, Carandril granted Biddyn's request
and plans were immediately formed for the creation of a new gnomish homeland.
The emperor severed the southern part of his empire, mostly unused and
barren fields beyond the steamfont mountains, and gave it to the gnomes.
The land was renamed "Akanon" which is elven for "Gift" and ten gnomish
settlers as well as five elven guards were prepared to make a journey into
Akanon and chart the lands.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Of the plague dragon and the formation of Akanon:</b><b></b>
<p><b>The fifteen settlers rode out surrounded by the cheers of elves and
gnomes alike, but were not heard from for many months. Finally after the
fifth month of their disappearance, only one elven soldier, his clothes
torn to pieces and his weapons shattered, rode solemnly through the gates
of the empire. He was the last of the settlers who remained alive, and
recounted his tale before an astonished imperial council. A plague dragon,
with scales of an oozing black, had attacked the party soon after they
had crossed into the southern lands and had claimed that the lands of Akanon
were his own. For months the plague dragon chased them and hunted the gnomes
and elves down. The soldier had watched each man die a slow and horrible
death, and believed the dragon only let him go to give this message to
the elves.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The gnomes were instantly furious that Carandril had given them cursed
lands to settle, and the emperor immediately ordered the death of the dragon.
Frightened by the terrible story of the soldier, most of his warriors were
reluctant to volunteer, as Carandril would not force anyone to fight such
a terrible beast. Edril, however, immediately offered his services as a
personal favor to the gnomes. When Biddyn himself volunteered five more
gnomes joined the hunt, and together with his gnomish friends, Edril rode
to the steamfont mountains to meet the terrible beast. What happened next
is best summed up by Biddyn's own "The History of the Gnomes":</b><b></b>
<p><b>I admit as much, that even my legs were shaking when we approached
the mouth of the demon's great cave. From our previous encounters, and
from the memories of our lost friend Dolyn, we were all terrified of the
beast. All of us, that is, except for Edril, but I don't think Innoruk
himself could scare that elf. He thrives from fear as much as I do the
tobacco in my pipe, it is to him as some sweet nectar that clears his thoughts
and hones his blade. So while we trembled before the plague dragon's domain,
Edril simply lifted his sword to his shoulder, looked back at me, and said
"wait here." With a proud determination he marched toward the black cave
entrance, a portal to the lower planes if ever there was one. He marched
to his death, or so we thought. But when we saw him next in two days time
he pulled behind him the head of the evil beast, which left thick trails
of a green poison behind it. He breathed heavily, and painful scars covered
his body. I laughed, thinking that while Edril was obviously hurt, the
dragon must have felt much worse before his death. Anything that inflicts
that much pain to the elf must be prepared to receive the same thrashing
tenfold.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The skull of the dragon sits still on the entrance to the gnome's
own Fortress Mechanus. Edril and his band of gnomes would be written into
gnomish lore forever as for the next weeks they rode tirelessly through
the lands of Akanon, fighting back fierce creatures and charting the perfect
hillside location for the first ever kingdom of gnomes. Edril spent much
more time in Akanon then originially expected, personally overseeing the
kingdom's construction. When the first houses were made and the first gnomish
settlers came pouring in, Biddyn was selected as the first king of the
gnomes and he in turn erected a statue in honor of Edril. The statue depicts
Edril's battle with the great plague dragon, and gnomish craftsmanship
made it enormous and actually useful: it sits in the heart of Akanon even
today, acting as the central part to Akanon's extensive irrigation system.
When Edril returned home to Felwithe he was greeted by hundreds of proud
soldiers and again proclaimed a hero.</b><b></b>
