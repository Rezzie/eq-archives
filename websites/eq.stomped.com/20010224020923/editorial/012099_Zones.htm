<center><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Where are Those Underpopulated
Zones?</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>With the general overcrowding of many servers, people need to search
further to find zones and camps that are not crowded.&nbsp; I know Verant
is constantly saying that it is overpopulated zones, rather than overpopulated
servers that are causing the lack of spawns.&nbsp; I still think we need
more servers, but there are definitely a number of zones which don't get
the crowds they should.&nbsp; When places like Oasis, Crushbone, The Aviak
Village, Blackburrow, etc. get jammed, it is nice to know there may be
some places not overflowing with people.&nbsp; I figured I would write
about the ones that I have discovered in order to help out people looking
for more out of the way areas. This is based strictly upon my personal
experience and I welcome any additions or corrections.&nbsp; Also, keep
in mind that my highest level character is level 22, so I can't speak for
the higher level areas.&nbsp; If you have anything to add about these or
other uncrowded zones, please e-mail me and I'll consider tacking it onto
the list.</b>
<p><b>1.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Kerra Island:</font> I don't think
many people even know this zone exists. No, this is not the island in Erud's
Crossing. You need to swim straight out from the dock in Tox Forest and
you will come to this zone. I was there the other night when there were
about 1900 people on the server and the only people in the whole zone were
two level 40's doing the paw of opolla quest. A level 9 or so player can
easily solo the kerran males and females at the front of the zone, groups
in their teens can hunt further in, and groups into their 20's can hunt
the heretics. If you can convince your group to take the boat ride over
here, you will have a whole zone pretty much to yourselves. Hard to beat
that.&nbsp; Of course, there's a reason nobody goes here. First, it is
probably the worst designed zone in the game. The Mobs are clustered together
in no discernible order and other than the front section, there are very
few places to safely set up a group to lure or camp without bringing an
Unrest-sized train on your head. Next, the Kerrans are a poor race and
the loot is terrible. Finally, it's in Odus, so you have to take the boat
ride to get there and need to bring along someone who can bind because
there are very few players in the whole continent at any given time. (and
you don't want to have to take that boat ride back just to get your corpse).&nbsp;
It would be nice to see this zone fixed up and the treasure tables changed
a little. In the meantime though, if you are frustrated with the crowds,
this is a great place to get away for some quick experience.</b>
<p><b>2.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Runnyeye:</font> I'm really not sure
why nobody goes to this zone. Do a /who on a crowded night and you might
only see 10 people here.&nbsp; In off hours, it is virtually empty.&nbsp;
Yet, the goblins are good experience and often carry decent loot. My theory
is that most people are so used to doing the Kithicor to Highpass to East
Karana route that they forget there are zones past Rivervale as well. In
fact, all three of those zones are on this list.&nbsp; If you are in your
high teens to low 20's, this is as good a place to hunt as any and often
far less crowded. There is also some limited hunting for characters in
their low teens.&nbsp; Plus, you can bind and sell in Rivervale, which
is only one zone away, so there is little reason to avoid this area.&nbsp;
The biggest drawback I can see is that because of the layout of the dungeon,
it seems likely that too many people would quickly make the zone unhuntable.&nbsp;
But it has never reached that point when I have gone there.</b>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Beholder:</font> I think people forget
about this zone for much the same reason they forget about Runnyeye. Yet
this is a great zone. The minotaurs are relatively easy to kill for their
level (I'd guess 16 to 21) and can drop as much as several plat in loot
(not to mention the occasional axe). Also, there are goblins at the runnyeye
entrance that are great soloing for a level 9 to 11 character. The evil
eyes are usually camped, since there are only two spots for them, but if
you can get one, they are also great loot and xp.&nbsp; I soloed my wizard
here a lot through levels 19 to 21, even on busy nights. This zone does
have some drawbacks. The spawn rate of the minos is pretty slow, so it
can't accommodate too many mino hunters, and the other spawns, the muddites,
are not worth hunting. Muddites hit far harder than they con and drop relatively
worthless blocks of clay and such. Thus, nobody even tries to hunt them.
This zone would really be nice if they revamped the muddites a little to
make them worth killing. Even so, if you are in your mid teens to low 20's,
this is a nice zone to hunt in. Well worth checking out when the rest of
the server gets overcrowded.</b>
<p><b>4. <font color="#990000">Misty Thicket:</font> Rounding out the trilogy
of Rivervale zones, this zone is not unknown, but is, in my opinion, underutilized.&nbsp;
This is probably the best newbie zone in the game.&nbsp; It is easy to
get around in and the guards are easy to find when you get in trouble (and
unlike in some zones, they aren't constantly being killed by a group of
high level NPC's).&nbsp; More importantly, you can easily hunt here with
a character up to level 12 or so, but most people leave here by level 6
or 7.&nbsp; Therefore, the wasps, yks and scarabs are often unhunted and
available even when the server is crowded. Also, most people don't realize
that there is an orc camp here similar to the ones in EC, and I often find
that to be uncamped.&nbsp; This zone is not as empty as some of the others
on this list, but it is still generally workable even on the most crowded
nights.</b>
<p><b>5. <font color="#990000">Tox Forest:</font> Much like Kerra, nobody
ever hunts in this zone. You may see a handful of level 1 or 2 characters
who haven't given in yet and moved over to Qeynos, but that's all.&nbsp;
This is because it is probably the worst newbie zone in the game and everyone
leaves it as soon as they can get bound to Qeynos. Yet there are two kobald
camps here that are pretty good hunting for level 5 to 8 or so, and they
are never camped. Of course, the biggest problem is that the kobald's loot
is terrible and the zone is so dark and full of similar looking trees that
it is very difficult to get around and keep your bearings. Still, if you
are having trouble finding kills in other zones, you can be pretty sure
this one will be wide open.</b>
<p><b>6. <font color="#990000">Upper Guk:</font> Lots of people hunt in
Lower Guk, but very few hunt Upper Guk.&nbsp; I have a feeling that most
people do what I did and go there at too low a level hoping for mesh or
netted armor and die so many times that they swear they will never go back.&nbsp;
If you did that and are now around level 20 or so, give it another try.&nbsp;
The froglocks are worth good experience and drop some of the best loot
in the game for their level.&nbsp; There are also plenty of places to hunt.
The zone does have several problems with it. First, the lower level frogs
are way too close to their upper level kin and it is too easy for them
to run and bring back help to stomp you flat. (Hence my swearing the zone
off after my first trip there).&nbsp; Trains here can be real nasty. Second,
most people are KOS in Oggok or Grobb, leaving the Arena as the closest
place to bind - a long run if you get caught by that nasty train.&nbsp;
Still, if you can get a group together in the mid teens to low 20's, this
is a good place to go when things get crowded elsewhere.</b>
<p><b>7. <font color="#990000">South Ro:</font> The desert part of South
Ro is fairly popular, although nothing like North Ro, but did you know
that there are several orc camps down here?&nbsp; You're probably not the
only one, since nobody ever seems to hunt them.&nbsp; The orcs here are
not as strong as the ones in Oasis, and are more like the ones in EC.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are also two bandit camps which, while not completely unknown, are
still much less likely to be camped than most dervs.&nbsp; Of course, the
biggest drawback is that you are a long way from the nearest bind point
if you happen to die.&nbsp; Still, if you have a group around level 8 to
10 or so, this is a place you may find open camps.</b>
<p><b>8.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Lavastorm:</font>&nbsp; This is a
great place to hunt for people in their low teens.&nbsp; The zone may appear
more crowded than it really is when you do a /who because of&nbsp; people
sitting outside the three dungeons that border the zone.&nbsp; In fact,
there are often very few people actually hunting within the zone itself,
yet the hunting cam be pretty good here.&nbsp; You can use the entrance
to Najena or Nektulos as a camping area and have a place to run when you
get in trouble.&nbsp; Most of the creatures are fairly easy to kill for
their level and can drop some decent loot.&nbsp; I soloed my wizard here
at level 11 and 12 with no real difficulty.&nbsp; Also, you can sell at
the gypsy camp and bind in Freeport, which is not too far away, or Neriak,
if you are not KOS there.&nbsp; The biggest drawback is that you have to
run through Nektulos to get here and need to dodge the dark elf guards
who don't really like most races.</b>
<p><b>9.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Najena:</font>&nbsp; This has the
same problem as Lavastorm in that you need to sneak past the dark elves
in Nektulos to get here, but this is a seriously underutilized zone with
good hunting for levels 10 to 30.&nbsp; I have logged on and been the only
person in the entire zone on several occasions.&nbsp; Other than the tentacle
terrors, which are pretty popular to hunt, and Najena himself (herself?),
this zone is usually pretty empty of players.&nbsp; A group in their low
teens can camp the skeletons in the beginning, which are almost always
uncamped.&nbsp; Groups in their 20's can hunt in several different areas
further in.&nbsp; You can sell to the gypsy camp in Lavastorm and bind
in Freeport or Neriak.&nbsp; The only reason I can see that this zone is
not more crowded is that is is not on the way to anywhere popular, so people
forget it exists.&nbsp; If you're frustrated by the crowds in Oasis or
the Commonlands, this is a good zone to check out.</b>
<p><b>10.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Dagnor's Cauldron:</font>&nbsp; Very
few people actually hunt in this zone, but it is not a bad place to hunt
if you are in your mid to upper teens.&nbsp; Aqua goblins can drop some
nice loot and give pretty decent experience points.&nbsp; The spawn rates
seem pretty fast and you can often sit somewhere, send out a runner, and
keep a pretty steady battle going.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that the
loot is usually in the form of weapons and you have to run all the way
back to Kaladim in order to sell.&nbsp; [Addition:&nbsp; I have been told
that there is a dwarf on the island in the middle of the lake that will
buy from you].&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, it is worth checking this out if you
are getting crowded out of the more popular zones surrounding this one.</b>
<p><b>Well, there you have 10 places that may be promising areas to hunt
when things get too crowded.&nbsp; I'm sure there are others that I just
am not familiar with.&nbsp; I hope it helps relieve some of the Friday
night frustration.</b>

<p><b>ADDENDUM:</b><b></b>
<p><b>I recieved a lot of feedback on this article and after going through
the suggestions, can add these zones as well:</b><b></b>
<p><b>1.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Permafrost:</font>&nbsp; Several people
pointed out that this zone is often unused, possibly because people assume
it is a higher level than it actually is.&nbsp; In fact, there is good
hunting here from the mid to upper twenties on up and a number of good
spots to hunt.&nbsp; I am told that, like most dungeons, it can get some
pretty serious trains, but it is still likely to be available when the
other zones are jammed.</b><b></b>
<p><b>2.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Ocean of Tears:</font>&nbsp; This
zone is also said to be relatively unpopulated with players.&nbsp; Several
people pointed out Aviak Island as a good spot for players in their mid
teens to low 20's that is almost never camped.</b><b></b>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Solusek's Eye:</font>&nbsp; Apparantly
this zone is used more by upper level players, and the lower level (25-35)
creatures near the entrance are often untouched, even when the server is
fairly crowded.</b><b></b>
<p><b>4.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Lesser Faydark:</font>&nbsp; This
zone has orc camps, bandit camps, fay drakes and other critters which can
often be uncamped even when people are filling up the surrounding zones.&nbsp;
My guess is that most people not playing a gnome stop when they get to
Greater Faydark and never take the time to explore this one, and once they
do find it they are past the low to upper teens range of most of the creatures
here.</b><b></b>
<p><b>5.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Kedge Keep:</font>&nbsp; I've never
been here, but I am told that there are rarely more than a handful of people
in the zone.</b><b></b>
<p><b>6.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Eastern Karana:</font>&nbsp; Several
people pointed out this zone.&nbsp; I have spent some time here and agree
that it is less populated than many, but at least on my server it is definitely
not unknown.&nbsp; Still it is worth checking out.&nbsp; There is pretty
good hunting here for characters in their mid to upper teens.</b><b></b>
<p><b>7.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Befallen:</font>&nbsp; Several people
pointed out this zone, and I agree it is generally less crowded than many
others.&nbsp; Of course, I know from experience that you do not want to
die in the lower levels of this zone, as it can be a real pain to get each
key and make your way back down to your corpse.</b><b></b>
<p><b>8.&nbsp; <font color="#990000">Rathe Mountains:</font>&nbsp; This
zone is huge and it has hunting for a wide variety of levels, with a variety
of camps.&nbsp; Yet several people noted that it is often uncrowded.</b>
