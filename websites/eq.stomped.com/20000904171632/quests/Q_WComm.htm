<p><a NAME="Paladin Message"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Paladin Message:</font>&nbsp;
Theron Rolius, in the Hall of Truth, standing next to the paladin guildmaster
in the rear raised section, is the person who initiates this quest. He
asks you to meet a messenger named Mojax Hikspin "near a lake in the Commonlands".&nbsp;
When found in West Commonlands, he is usually sitting next to the fisherman
on the lake - the one that won't talk or sell to you.&nbsp; He needs a
flask of milk, which you can get from the office of the people or at Greenleaf's
in Freeport.&nbsp; As soon as you give him the milk, he starts to hand
you a note, but a fast NPC named Duggin Scumper comes by, insults the Freeport
king or something, and runs off, yelling that You'll never catch him, and
that he's taking this to his superior in the Quenos Royal hall or something.&nbsp;
In order to get the note, you have to attack the man, kill him (he's around
level 3 or 4) and loot his corpse to find the note.&nbsp; Then you return
the note to Eeyana Neastra, a sentry on the top level of the temple of
Marr (she may be in the Hall of Truth now).&nbsp; He is very tough to catch
without magic.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, sometimes if you stop chasing him and
return to Mojax, he will walk down the path to a pillar and drop the note
for you there.&nbsp; Each time you give Mojax milk, you restart the sequence
so that you can try again if you mis the first time.&nbsp; You get a little
gold, a item (sometimes a potion), experience, and increased faction standing
with the Knights of Truth.&nbsp; (Submitted by Saidan)</b>
<p><a NAME="Reserve Militia"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Reserve Militia:</font>&nbsp;
Talk to Armorer Delin in the Freeport Militia House and he will ask you
to show him your reserve militia token.&nbsp; If you don't have one, he
tells you to go talk to Guard Valorn out at&nbsp; the tollbooth in West
Commonlands.&nbsp; Valorn gives out the 4 orc picks quest then will give
you the bracketed&nbsp; keyword for the next quest.&nbsp; Which is to bring
8 cutthroat rings combined in a bag he gives you.&nbsp; Give him that and
he gives you a reserve militia tolken, which when you give that to Armorer
Delin in the militia house results in a <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Reserve_Militia_Tunic.htm">Reserve
Militia Tunic</a>.&nbsp; After giving you the tunic, the Armorer tells
you to be careful of north freeport.&nbsp; Coalition of TradefolkIII, and
Freeport Militia go up.&nbsp; Knighhts of Truth and Mithaniel Marr go down.</b><b></b>
<p><img SRC="iconnew.gif" height=12 width=31><a NAME="Wallin's Message"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Wallin's
Message:</font>&nbsp; Hail Wallin Slyfoot and tell him " I will assist
you" and he will give you a letter to deliver it to Master Whoopal in Nektulos
Forest.&nbsp; Whoopal is located at -927 , 1227.&nbsp; He has a place holder
at times in the form of a questor.&nbsp; Your reward for this is some faction
and minor coin.</b>
