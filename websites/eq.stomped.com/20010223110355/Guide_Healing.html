<p><b>So you decided you wanted to be a cleric? Well simmer down that blood
lust and hand that book. "How to be a Hero" back to your paladin friend
because you just chose a life of service. Don't get me wrong, friend, you
will be harrolded many times over as a hero and saviour but via a slightly
different route. But as you read this, don't get too focused in on all
the numbers and what not. How you use your skills, and the style you chose
do so in will dictate your success and happiness with this class more than
anything. But I would say that if you are not willing to stand your ground,
giving up your last mana in a heal so that a party member might escape
knowing it is your doom, don't play the class. I'm not saying do this everytime,
but I would suggest that the willingness needs to be there.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>So let's take a cleric from birth at the character creation screen.
If you want to play a cleric that is basically a "mana cannon" you can
generate a high elf cleric with a 130 wisdom from the start. There are
others that check in around 115, but the high elf has the highest starting
wisdom possible. This guy/gal would experience a little more difficulty
at the lowest levels, but would be the ultimate champion of "Oh ya well
my wisdom is . . ." competition that captures the minds of so many high
level clerics, druids and shamen. But, as with so many things in your healer's
life, it is your choice, balance over focus. You will see that there are
many paths for your cleric to take and the road branches many times. But
wisdom does mean mana, and mana is more important than hit points to a
cleric. So play with the numbers, but keep in mind that to say your wisdom
is important would be putting it mildly.</b>
<p><b>I come to fight!!! . . . uh . . .&nbsp; I mean Heal!!!</b>
<p><b>So you plop down on to planet Norrath with your splintered club in
one hand, a candle in the other and a handful of spells that take forever
to scribe and then memorize. Greatness awaits you, but it chooses to wait
for you quite a bit further down the road. The first order of business
for you will be to get your hands on the spell Strike. You will begin with
a Minor Heal and Courage in your inventory, but you need to buy strike
or earn it by questing for some decaying skeleton bone chips. You have
5 levels of bat, bug, and skeleton killing to look forward to and strike
is going to get you through it. At this point, your melee is just as pathetic
as everyone elses, so best to open with a Strike and then hope for the
best or run. Should you group? Do you have to group? You don't have to
group. A cleric can solo through to 25th level without a lot of difficulty.
I know some who are soloing just fine at 40th level. Granted there are
very few critters out there that this works for, but to each his own. At
the lowest levels you are not going to do a lot of damage nor do a lot
of healing nor do a lot of buffing. You are going to do a little of all
three and a lot of running away most likely so use the time to learn what
will later distinguish you as a great cleric, the art of casting in combat.
But realize that at this point you are like every other class, just some
weakling trying to survive long enough to get a few coppers and some experience
points. And as for armor at this point, cloth or patchwork will help a
lot, but</b>
<br><b>be sure you save up money for those level 5 spells.</b>
<p><b>Welcome to Level 5, some new spells, and poverty</b>
<p><b>After surviving your infancy, you are now ready to head down the
healer path starting at level 5. You will get a few nice spells at this
level that will make you in truth a real healer. Obviously, Light Healing
is going to be a spell that defines who you are, but Cure Disease and Cure
Poison are going to be spells that will earn you the thanks of many sword
swingers and casters. These spells also help you to be quite independent
at this point. Also the spell furor is going to be your difinitive battle
spell for quite some time. Your role in a group starts to become more defined
at this point as healing, curing, and supplying support melee and casting.
Solo you will be using your melee and damage spell while throwing in a
few heals for yourself to make up for weaker melee skills and fewer hit
points than those big rough and tumble types. Now is the time for you to
truly face the fact that no one, and I mean NO ONE, is going to ever be
impressed with your combat skills or spells. If you solo, it will take
you longer to kill things, but eventually you will get the job done. If
you are grouped you will see that your damage, melee or spell, is not quite
what the others are doing, but you have a slightly different role now.
A caster is going to do spell damage, a tank is going to do melee damage,
you will do a bit of both while keeping the other two alive and functioning.
The druid and shaman are doing much the same function you are at this level
so learn to work with these folks so that you are not wasting mana healing
and curing the same people. For the next 20 levels, you start to set the
standard of your existance. You will buff out AC and hit points, you will
heal and cure, and you will become less and less of an offensive threat.
But don't think that you can't solo at these levels. You can if you want
to. So shrugg off that snide remark of, "Wow, you really take forever to
kill something don't you?" Your day is coming my friend.</b>
<p><b>Your main issue at this point really becomes poverty. You have to
buy spells and armor and weapons and jewelry to augment your stats. At
9th you get Hammer of Wrath - I highly recommend it. You are the only class
that comes equiped with its own magic weapon at that level. My advice is
summon your hammer and go smash wisps to solve your money problems. And
feel free to put a lot of miles on that hammer. Why not? Your melee isn't
that great anyway. I think I was still summoning that hammer at lvl 24
because I kept putting my money into other things. But be aware that money
is going to be tight. Armor isn't cheap, nor are your spells.</b>
<p><b>Bring out your Undead!!</b>
<p><b>At level 5 you get Ward Undead and you become an undead killing machine.
Ghouls explode if you walk too close to them, and mummies just turn to
dust if you glance in their general direction. Actually, that doesn't happen
for quite sometime. But you are better equiped to fight undead than most
at this point. I highly recommend Befallen. Your mana to damage ratio on
your undead spells is going to save you mana on offense and that means
more healing power for your defense. Groups will frustrate you at times
when you hunt undead because your divine inspiration screams "Vanquish
the evil minions!" while your group members tend to argue, "Calm down,
and save your mana to heal us as we kill everything." Well a quick offense
can make for a good defense so mix it up a bit and find your balance. But
delight in the blue lights my friend, and remember to wear your endure
fire/cold for those drybone/icebone skeletons. And should you one day find
yourself in Unrest with a group of all clerics and paladins, I can promise
you that a fine time will be had by all.</b>
<p><b>Greatness awaits!!</b>
<p><b>By this time you should have discovered your role in the group and
now comes the time that you really begin to live it. Your soloing days
are drying up now, and you will find that not only do you need to group
more but people want you to group with them. Around level 25, it becomes
very hard for anyone to solo, and the wise adventurer has learned his/her
strengths and limitations. So lets look at the cleric's strengths and weaknesses
at this point. Your melee is quite weak friend. Here is the bad news on
that score. By the time you reach 50th level, your abilty to hit will at
best be somewhere on par with a 35-40th level warrior but you are doing
half the damage at best. You have some direct damage spells and some area
effect spells, but they are not going to do nearly the damage you will
see wizards and magicians fielding. And your friends the shaman and druid
are now sprinting around the country side with their Spirit of Wolf spell
as they cast their damage over time spells, leaving you wondering why you
don't have a DoT yourself. And not only that, but these upstart rangers
and paladins are now healing, curing and buffing people. So why does anyone
want to group with you?</b>
<p><b>Well don't delete yourself just yet, you have a value. Let's look
at your strengths now You will get your Great Heal spell (about 300 points
in healing power) at least 5 levels before any other classes. And from
there it only gets better because that is the last heal spell that any
of the other "healer" classes get. Also learn to use your stun spells an
appreciate that you have a better AC than the other healer types. Fewer
hites mean easier casting and less damage to heal. You will group with
people who will boom and hack and smash to their heart's content as you
maintain them and contribute a few points of damage to the cause. Treat
it with a little humor, and do your victory dance when you actually score
the killing blow on a creature your party is fighting. Have a laugh, share
a smile with your party, and a good time is had by all. But there comes
a time when every party is in trouble and you are the one who will be in
a possition to save your fellows. Killing is not your thing, but dying
and keeping people from dying is. Maybe you throw a few greater heals that
give party members enough strength to finish a fight as the opponents now
turn their anger on you for denying them their kill (And believe me this
happens a lot. If you cast a great heal while standing next to an attacking
creature, tag you are it!), and then you pop your divine barrier and endure
safely as party</b>
<br><b>members turn the tide of battle. Or perhaps you throw out stuns
and roots that give casters time to get away from a nasty as you heal them
and your melee types then have time to surround the offender again. Or
maybe it is as simple as plopping down, calling "Medding for heals!" as
everyone starts to call "OOM!" and tossing out enough heals to keep your
party alive as they finish the fight or run. And if your druid or wizard
is casting&nbsp; the evac, you have the greater AC and can cast a mass
heal that gets attention on you and off the person casting evac for the
nine seconds they need. There are many ways that a wise cleric can save
his/her group when things turn nasty if they have held some emergency mana
in reserve. Many classes just do one or two things, a cleric can do a lot.
It pays to know who you are fighting with, what they are capable of and
how your skills compliment theirs. Higher level mages and wizards are going
to cast spells that do about 600 points direct damage if not more. They
will draw fire everytime they cast that spell so if you cast a stun when
you see they are casting the big DD (and stun has a much shorter casting
time) then the target will be immobilized when that heavier spell hits,
and you just saved your caster a lot of pain and suffering - pain and suffering
you of course would have had to heal eventually.</b>
<p><b>Also your buffs become highly prized by all. Casters are going to
want every hit point they can claim when they start taking damage, and
the tanks love it when you pile on the AC and hit points so they can hack
and slash longer and in greater comfort. Just realize that your fun and
glory as a cleric comes from making sure a good time was had by all&nbsp;
and not by "Hey, did you see how much damage I just did?" So if you have
not created a macroed /emote of "Healer Scores a critical hit!(99999) or
"Healer Scores a critical miss! (You have injured yourself)" I highly recommend
that you do and enjoy your short comings.</b>
<p><b>Clericing and the Good Life</b>
<p><b>Welcome to level 39, you just became the best friend of everyone
in Norrath. You think I am kidding? When I turned 39 and took myself off
/anon, In the next two hours I had many invitiations by people I did not
know to come visit them, and they were willing to pay me to do so. The
total offers were above 250pp in just that few hour period. And it kept
on, everytime I logged in. Well they were not asking me to come kill something
for them, quite the contrary really. At 39, you gain the ability to ressurect
people so that they gain back some of the experience points they have lost.
At level 29 you gained Revive and the ability to raise the dead without
any reclaiming of experience. And while that one may save some folks some
time and effort (particularly if they are bound far from where they died),
Resuscitate will curl their toes. Also at this point you are now armed
with Superior healing and Complete Healing as well as buffs that will raise
AC ratings and saves by 40 points and hit points by 400-500 points. You
are now the glue that holds parties together. Your DD spells are doing
respecable damage, your stuns and roots are sparing people a few choice
hits and kicks, and you can stand up and take a beating for a few moments
when you make an attacking creature mad with your masterfully timed Complete
healing that just healed a warrior two thousand hit points (Are there any
others out there casting spells that can do two thousand hit points of
anything?). But use the wisdom (and I don't mean your wisdom stat) you
have developed over the many levels of how to mix up offense and defense
to maximize your mana and your effectiveness. Know when to stand and fight
and when to sit and med. Know when a quick offense is a good defense and
when your party is just going to need all the healing it can get. Your
strengths are unmatched at higher levels so use them wisely, and you will
be cheered and cherished by many.</b>
<p><b>So bask in your glory; you earned it by toughing it out level after
level while others claimed the title of hero . And remember,&nbsp; your
casting Resuscitate costs you 500 mana, but, to the person you just rezzed,
you just gave someone the only thing in all of Norrath that money can't
buy and everyone wants, experience points.</b>
<p><b>Quests, Armor, Weapons, and Wisdom</b>
<p><b>There has been a lot of debate, arguing, and even protest regarding
the quests for "cleric" armor and items. Anyone familiar with the quests
knows that they are time consuming and that in the end, you basically have
gold colored plate armor that rounds out your stats and saves a little.
Many people have been angered that this armor did not give them the all
cherished wisdom points in massive quantities. Considering what is already
in the game, if someone wants to run their wisdom score up to over 200,
they can do it without the no drop Ethereal Mist armor from the Plane of
Hate. If you compare that to the other clases, that keeps the clerics in
balance on their main stat with other classes. I really would not expect
Verrant to change this in anyway. We have lots of choices as clerics when
it comes to armor since we can wear everything from cloth to plate. Some
have chosen to wear a mostly "leather" armor assortment so that they can
get the wisdom bonuses of the Foreman Tunic, Gator Leggings, and the new
Split Paw Gloves. This, of course sacrifices some AC points and possible
increases to other stats, but&nbsp; does raise the wisdom by about ten
points (A sizable chunk by any measure). A person should go with what works
with the way he/she likes to play the character. Personally I prefer a
balance - more mana is nice, but won't get you anywhere if you are constantly
being hit for huge sums of damage. I like to be able to get my spells off
as I am being attacked and not watch my hit point bar dropping in massive
chunks as I do this. But there are many people who play a cleric more like
a caster and so do what they can to avoid being hit altogether. Again,
it is up to your style of play. Weapons works very much the same way. I
prefer a one handed weapon myself so that I can have a shield (A Mistmoore
for the save bonuses) or wisdom augmenting item in my off hand. You are
not going to do a lot of damage in melee either way, and I think it is
worth it to have that boost to my mana or my AC and saves, depending on
what I am fighting and with what kind of group.&nbsp; The wisdom jewelry
is a must in my mind regardless. But keep in mind that these things are
simply available to you. As I said before, there are many paths for the
cleric that range from pop-up healer to wannabe paladin. Pick your equipment
to match your style of play and most importantly enjoy the class.</b>
