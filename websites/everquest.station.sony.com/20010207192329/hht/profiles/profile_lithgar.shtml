<p>Lithgar was born in Halas the Barbarian hometown. He along with his older brother 
Ozzmar and best friend Bandlor started hunting small gnolls and ice goblins when 
they were still shorter than a two handed sword. The three made an incredible 
team, until one day Bandlor wandered into Everfrost alone and never returned. 
Lithgar and Ozzmar both looked for him, Ozzmar eventually having to rescue Lithgar 
from the cold barren wastelands as he had passed out from fatigue and the cold. 
Somehow Ozzmar was able to harness the power of nature and his mind to heal his 
brother. Lithgar developed to be a masterful warrior, while his older wiser brother 
began to harness the power of nature. Lithgar's prowess in battle soon spread 
as almost a legend to Qeynos, then to Freeport and even across continents to Kaladim. 
One day Lithgar caught word from Qeynos about a tournament that was going to be 
held at a newly built arena near Lake Rathetear. Lithgar immediately set out for 
the tournament along with his older brother by his side, Ozzmar had now harnessed 
the power of animals putting the spirit of the wolf into them letting them get 
to the arena quickly. Lithgar quickly entered the tournament and was put on the 
top bracket. The tournament then started, Lithgar on one end of the bracket and 
a Barbarian known as Fardian on the other end. Fardian was almost only a myth 
to the Barbarians of Halas as he was banished from the city and doomed to live 
in Everfrost for the rest of his life. Both Lithgar and Fardian showed great skill, 
defeating their opponents in the arena with great skill. Then it was time for 
the final battle, Lithgar and Fardian one on one to determine the winner. </p>
<p>The two begun to fight both making masterful moves, both then locked blades 
and came face to face. Lithgar looked down and noticed the necklace that hung 
from Fardain's neck; it was the necklace that he had given his old friend Bandlor. 
Lithgar stepped back questioning where Fardain had gotten the necklace, Fardain 
openly admitted that he saw a young man walking through Everfrost alone so he 
came behind him and stabbed him through the back with his long sword. Lithgar 
stood in disbelief for a few moments thinking of his lost friend, he then realized 
what Fardain was saying. Ozzmar and the rest of the crowd stood quietly not knowing 
what to think. All of the sudden Lithgar started to look down and begun to breath 
heavily, his body starting to glow. He then looked up and let out a might yell 
and charged at Fardain. He swung blows as hard as any man had ever seen breaking 
Fardain's long sword in half with his own. He then pinned Fardain to the ground 
with his sword to Fardain's neck. Host yelled for Lithgar to kill Fardain, but 
Lithgar showed mercy and let Fardain go. Lithgar lifted up his blade and started 
to walk away from Fardain, who was still laying on the ground. Fardain then grabbed 
what was left of the lower half of his long sword and came at Lithgar from behind, 
Ozzmar shouted out for Lithgar to defend himself. When Lithgar turned he tried 
to dodge but was to late, Fardain had missed Lithgar's chest but had hit him on 
the right side of his face. Lithgar begun to bleed and was blinded in one eye, 
but quickly picked up his blade and blocked Fardain's next swing. After blocking 
Fardain's swing Lithgar quickly stabbed Fardain through the heart killing him. 
Lithgar fell over in pain blood gushing from his face, most thought he would perish 
also. Ozzmar walked over to Lithgar, closed his eyes and started to mumble words 
in and old language nobody could understand. Ozzmar then began to shimmer, small 
blue particles started to fly around him. He was able to heal his brother but 
the injuries to Lithgar's face left him blind in one eye and with a large scar 
on the right side of his face. After the tournament Lithgar was given the title 
of "the Honorable" for his prowess in battle and his showing mercy to even his 
greatest foe. Lithgar now wanders the face of Norrath not only as an explorer 
but also as a legend.</p>
