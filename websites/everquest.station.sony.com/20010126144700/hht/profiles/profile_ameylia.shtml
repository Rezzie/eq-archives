<p>Ameylia was born into a troubled marriage between a clansman from Halas, in 
the icy wastes, and a farmer's daughter from Freeport. She got her name Ameylia 
SunRise even before she learned to walk - delighting on riding her father's shoulders 
at the morning hunt, to catch the first glimpse of the new sun. She doted on her 
father, yet he died before she reached her 5th summer. To ease her pain her mother 
told her simply that he had gone on a long journey. Not long after, her mother 
took them far away back to her homelands of the Freeport commonlands.</p>
<p>At first Ameylia hated it there but soon met friends, and made her mother very 
proud by embracing both cultures of the cold north and the more cosmopolitan Freeport. 
At her 15th summer, she joined with a small group who were bound for Halas, and 
left her mother. Back in her birthplace she fell in love again with the snow and 
bleak mountains. In two short years she learned to hunt, swim, to fight, track, 
and survive. Her quick-learning, cheerful nature and intuitive knowledge of lore 
and the ways of the Shaman, impressed the many barbarian lads that sought her 
company. Amongst the adventure and frivolity she first discovered the double-edged 
blade of love.</p>
<p>At age 17, and with her newest love, she made the long and hard journey back 
to Freeport and reunited happily with her mother. Her life smelled of roses until 
one tragic night at the festival of New Year. A midnight adventure into the dark 
and spooky commonlands with some friends turned into a bloodbath from which only 
she was spared. The orc invasion took many lives that night, including her mother's, 
and suddenly she was alone in the world.</p>
<p>For a year she wandered from place to place, seeking meaning in her life and 
helping others in a vain attempt to help herself. Sometimes she worked alone, 
sometimes with other good souls. Time and again she crossed paths with the same 
warm, quiet, kind-hearted and humble bard from the forests of the Faydark. The 
Bard Loviane became Ameylia's mentor, her guide. Loviane introduced her to Eliath, 
a wise and calm-natured man. Once again Ameylia learned how to love and smile 
again. Eliath showed her the world, until one fateful dawn when the evil, icy 
touch of a spectre struck her lover dead. Ameylia's world fell apart once more. 
From that fateful dawn until the next time the sun rose, she sat on the shore 
of the ocean oblivious to the world. At that next dawn she disowned her own name 
of SunRise, and when a trio of skeletons came rattling along the beach, she embraced 
the death they brought her - her last living sight, the sun rising over the ocean.</p>
