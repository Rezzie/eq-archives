<p>- The Birth -</p>

<p>When Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, abducted the High Elf King and Queen from city of Takish Hiz, he imprisoned them on the Plane of Hate where he tortured and broke them recreating them according to his own design.  The Dark Elves were born and deposited into Nektulos Forest to spread their hatred throughout Norrath. </p>

<p>Innoruuk, not trusting the race he created long ago from peaceful High Elves, decided he needed to create a being that he could be sure that would be full of hatred.  He begins to gather bones of the many victims off the ground.  Needing something to connect the bones, the dark prince pulled several pieces of hair from his head.  Once the bones were connected, he used his fingers to cut flesh from his own body and wrapped it around cold bones.  He placed this mold of hatred onto a long table and began to gather his priests for a resurrection ceremony. </p>

<p>The Clerics of Innoruuk formed a circle around the table and held one hand over the table.  Innoruuk cut a finger off each of the clerics and the blood poured into body.  He then cut a slice into one of his own fingers and watched the blood flow into the body.  He picked up some torches off the ground and burned this mold with the flames.  The flesh began to attach itself to the bones and formed a layer of skin.  After the flesh was complete, The Prince picked up this being and rinsed it off in a pool of blood and placed it back on the table.  The Clerics started casting the spell resurrection on the body.  Innoruuk then casted a chilling spell on it, which froze the skin turned it deep blue. </p>

<p>The being raised up from the table and open its eyes.  Innoruuk placed black plated armor on it and gave it the two torches that he had used to form the skin.  With the blood of the Clerics and Innoruuk's blood flowing through the body, this creature would become a superior Cleric of hatred with high resurrection skills to bring back the hated dead.  He called this being Zatozia and told her that she was to torture followers of Marr as well as any others that had peace in their hearts. </p>

<p>Thus, the Birth of Zatozia the Torturess</p>

<p>- Chamber of Torture -</p>

<p>Deep within the Plane of Hate is an area from which there is no return. </p>

<p>As you enter, you see dark dreary walls with bloodstains dripping down them.  You can almost make out scratches on the wall that says, "HELP ME!!!"  You hear a voice whisper "The Shadows of Darkness will come for you.  You have been marked!"</p>

<p>As you walk farther in, you wonder why you are burning for 200 points of damage with each step.  You look down and find that you are sinking into a pit of fire hotter than any lava you've ever seen. </p>

<p>You finally manage to jump out onto a ground of slime that causes you to slip down a ramp of toxic fluid.  You fall for 500 points of damage into a room.  Above, you see the chute from which you came.  Below, you see wet blood and skeleton bones, and a long staff with a crystalline tip.  Four barred walls with no exit cage you. </p>

<p>As you stand in this cage-like cubical room, you start hearing screams in the distance. The sounds of dripping blood and cold winds trickle through the halls.  All of a sudden, you see a faint shadow in the dark mist filled air with glimmering lights.  You hear the footsteps bringing this figure closer as you move to the back wall. </p>

<p>The image of torches can finally be seen as this figure comes out of the shadows.  It is a Dark Elf female wearing a black suit of armor and fresh blood on the boots from walking through pools of victims.</p>

<p>She reaches for a lever on the wall and pushes it down.  The barred walls lift up as chains drop down and cuff your arms.  You try to break loose but are unsuccessful.  Chains come up from the floor and cuff your legs.  </p>

<p>As she takes a step forward, she points her torches toward you and flames shoot out slowing burning you with agonizing pain.  She raises her torches and begins to turn a wheel, which stretches your arms and legs farther. As the cuffs get tighter around your wrist and ankles, you can fill sharp metal spikes push their way through your skin.  You scream as loud as your pain-filled body will allow, but to no avail.  She lowers her torches toward you once more and the flames begin to burn what's left of your pitiful flesh.</p>

<p>As the last drops of blood drop from your body, she begins to smile with an evil grin and says, "The Shadows of Darkness are before you."</p>
