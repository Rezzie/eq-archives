<dt><span class="subHeader">What is the Harpy's Head Tavern ? </span> 
<dd>The Harpy's Head Tavern&#153; is an official EverQuest&#153; site that will 
provide in-character content related to EverQuest. Some of the things you will 
find while visiting the Harpy's Head Tavern are Historical Character Profiles, 
Official Historical Quest Summaries, GM Profiles, a weekly &quot;Dear Mennix&quot; 
column, an official Events section, and an In-Character forum. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">What is a "Static" Quest? </span></dt>
<dd>A Static Quest is any sort of quest in the game that solely involves NPCs 
(Non Player Characters) that are controlled by the AI of the EverQuest servers. 
A good example of this sort of quest is the &quot;Newbie Note&quot; quest that 
all new characters can complete to obtain their guild tunic, robe or other starting 
item. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">What is a "Dynamic" Quest? </span></dt>
<dd>A Dynamic Quest is a broad term that describes any sort of quest where the 
NPCs are played by live actors, rather then being controlled by the AI of the 
EverQuest servers. Dynamic Quests can range from simple invasions lasting just 
a few minutes to complex and intricate stories spanning the course of several 
weeks. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">What is a Historic Quest? </span></dt>
<dd>Historic Quests are a special sort of Dynamic Quest. Often complex and spanning 
the course of several weeks, they often result in temporary or even permanent 
changes to the game world's story line. Historic Quests advance the ever-evolving 
plot line of the world of Norrath. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">Can I petition in game, send e-mail or contact anybody 
to get a special Dynamic Quest for either my Guild, or myself?</span></dt>
<dd>As much as we would love to be able to be able to offer impromptu Dynamic 
Quests for specific players or guilds, it is something that would be impossible 
to accomplish. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">Will Dynamic Quests ever be announced ahead of time? 
</span></dt>
<dd>Dynamic Quests are never announced ahead of time and will always be a surprise. 
However, frequent visits to the &quot;Rumors and Whispers&quot; section of the 
Harpy's Head Tavern may give you clues about who to look for in game and where 
the action may take place next. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">What is the "Rumors and Whispers" section of the Harpy's 
Head Tavern™? </span></dt>
<dd>Rumors and Whispers should be visited often to give you the inside scoop on 
current events and the on-going changes to the game world, through the perspective 
of well-known residents of the world of Norrath. You'll find clues, rumors and 
sometimes just wild speculation that can help you to complete both Static and 
Dynamic Quests. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">What are the "Annals of History"?</span></dt>
<dd>The &quot;Annals of History&quot; retell important Historic Quests and Events 
that have shaped the world of Norrath up until the present day. Here you can find 
information about why the world is the way it is, often told through the Historical 
Characters themselves, who were present as the events transpired in the evolving 
history of Norrath. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">What is the difference between a "Quest" and an "Event"?</span></dt>
<dd> Events are almost always pre-announced, with rules, times, and dates scheduled 
by server, and are run by GM's and Guides acting as Event Coordinators. Events 
do not involve GM Quest actors, adventure, or historic storyline. An example of 
an Event would be the Test of Steel, where warriors gather to duel according to 
strict rules before a GM Event Coordinator. Role-playing is encouraged at Events, 
but GM Event Coordinators will generally not be in direct conflict with the players. 
Players who wish to participate in an Event should follow the directions in the 
Event Announcements. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>Quests are almost never pre-announced, and usually have very limited rules 
for players. Quests are run with GM Quest actors, and/or controlled NPC's that 
can be anything from Gnolls to Dragons. GM's involved in a Quest will customarily 
interact with the players in a strict role-playing manner, according to the dynamic 
or historic storyline for the quest. This may include conflict, and GM actors 
may often slay, or be slain by players to further the storyline. Players may best 
successfully experience a Quest (and possibly obtain its rewards) by following 
the clues, and interacting with GM Quest actors and NPCs, as appropriate. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt class="subHeader">What are Historical Characters? </dt>
<dd>A Historical Character is a character who is intimately involved with the 
ever evolving and dynamic history of Norrath. Many of these characters are featured 
on both the EverQuest and EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark&#153; box. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">Will I ever run into these characters during normal 
game play? </span></dt>
<dd>You just might! It is possible that you could run into, meet, and interact 
with these Historic Characters in your adventures throughout the world of Norrath. 
You may see them in a bar or tavern reliving stories of their past over an ale 
or five, walking through a city street on business, or giving speeches at the 
city gates on the finer points of magic. Keep your ears to the ground and your 
eyes peeled! </dd>

<dd> The Dwarf is named Thubir Axebringer. He usually goes by his nickname of

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>The Halfling rogue is named Dreezil Stickens Pocketdip, usually just known 
as Dreezil. He became skilled at the &quot;art&quot; as a young child but now 
a little older, he has given up thieving for profit and is generally an honest, 
good natured and down to earth fellow. </dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><span class="subHeader">Who is the Barbarian woman featured on the EverQuest 
and EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Box? </span></dt>
<dd>The Barbarian woman is warrior named Dagda Icefury. A woman of strong will

Box? </span></dt>

bound the troll Rogkasth to herself, and he is now her eternal servant. She has

<dd>&nbsp;</dd>
<dt class="subHeader">Who is the troll featured on the EverQuest and EverQuest: 
The Ruins of Kunark Box?</dt>
<dd> The Troll is known as Rogkasth Vr`l. A Shadow Knight and a cold and cunning

Veeshan from the treacherous Lady Vox, and helped to perform the ritual which 
tore the veil seperating the Norrath from the Plane of Sky. She often appears 
as a High Elf, as she finds the arrogance of the Koada`Dal amusing but respects
