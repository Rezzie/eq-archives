<p align="center"><b><font color=#ff9900 size=4 class="header">The Swashbuckler’s 
Homecoming</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>To continue his 
search for immortality, the wizard Al'Kabor needs certain items to replicate a 
most heinous ceremony. In his studies in the library of Erudin, he has read about 
a scroll of great power, and the fateful journey leading to its loss at sea.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ship "Shark's 
Bane" was chartered to carry the scroll from Butcherblock to Freeport during some 
of the worst storms that ocean had yet seen. Despite being crewed by rough and 
seedy veteran seaman, none of whom were strangers to travel in treacherous conditions, 
the voyage turned disastrous.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon reaching 
the Ocean of Tears, the ship's captain determined it would be prudent to seek 
refuge at the Sisters of Erollisi Isle. His order to the tillerman to steer hard 
to port was met with no response. Turning, he watched as the poor soul was swept 
over the rail on the crest of a wave. The captain scrambled toward the rigging. 
A second wave breached the starboard side. The captain shut his eyes tightly and 
prepared for the impact. When none came, he opened his eyes. A muffled screamed 
escaped him as he watched the wave, now standing impossibly on the deck, sprout 
great arms and reach for him. The cacophony of snapping timbers and the thundering 
of water were all that bespoke the final voyage of the "Shark's Bane".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Al'Kabor's 
knowledge of the ship and its fate are the results of his studies in the great 
Library of Erudin. However, as is the case with tales of this sort, much of the 
text was based upon hearsay. But there was mention of one Tillerman Jairik as 
the only survivor of the tragedy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excited at 
the prospect of adding this scroll to his "Shopping List of Armageddon," Al'Kabor 
once again recruits a party to seek out Tillerman Jairik, and convince him to 
return to the site of the wreck to assist in the retrieval of the lost cargo. 
The wizard's knowledge of Jairik is limited to his general location. "The wretch 
has reverted to the meaningless existence of an arms monger, peddling his wares 
in the cave of East Commonlands. Were it not for the fact that within his tiny 
skull is locked the key so conjunctive to my research, I would give no more thought 
to his death than I would afford a mosquito in Feerrott."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tillerman Jairik 
has no knowledge of the cargo of the ship, though he knew it was valuable. He 
avoided the hold of the ship when the item was loaded, and was issued strict orders 
by the captain not to snoop. He felt an eerie presence even as he boarded the 
ship that rainy evening. "Arr, what a man don't know about, won't show up later 
to bite him in the arse!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jairik has 
a mild fear of the sea now, but he overcomes it in order to accompany the adventurers 
to the location of the wreck. "Me ol' bones will feel more at ease knowin' me 
crewmates be at peace in their watery graves, aye." Because he was swept overboard 
before the attack of what Al'Kabor identified as a water elemental, he has no 
knowledge of the beast. He fully expects the ship to be in ruins with its cargo 
plundered long ago. Little does he know, the elemental has taken up residence 
aboard the lost ship.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the time 
the ship reaches the docks in the Ocean of Tears, Jairik has regained his sea 
legs, and has no problem swimming to the rocky isle. "C'mon, ye scurvy dogs! The 
salty brine will keep ya afloat, like an egg on a glass table!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Prexus! Don't 
be takin' me now!" Jairik exclaims when he sees the ghostly Shark's Bane docked 
at the isle, and the great Water Elemental floating upon its deck. "Ach, I dinnae 
want to be fish food!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The water elemental 
disembarks and attacks the adventurers. Jairik, overcome with terror, only assists 
in the battle when the party becomes overwhelmed, and even then only half-heartedly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the defeat 
of the water elemental, Jairik continues on with the party to the Sisters of Erollisi 
island, where Al'Kabor awaits them. Anxious to return to his laboratory and continue 
his research, Al'Kabor quickly rewards the adventurers. The party's questions 
annoy him, they being far too simple to comprehend his plans, and he rudely departs. 
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tillerman Jairik, 
the Swashbuckler, returns to the Commonlands and resumes his peaceful mercantile 
life.</font></p>
