<p align="center"><b><font color=#ff9900 size=4 class="header">The Council</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lord Tephys of 
the Koada`Dal and Carson McCabe of Highkeep stared at each other with long faces 
over the council table in Highkeep. The meetings were not going well. Upon hearing 
of the Teir`Dal's plans of conquest, Tephys had immediately dispatched word to 
Felwithe petitioning help. He had yet to hear a reply. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Carson's biggest 
problem in drafting forces for Highkeep was that most of the merchant lords on 
the council were just that, merchants. They spoke endlessly of buying their way 
out of the fight, that the goblin was lying, or that they should just cut their 
losses and leave. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Carson and Tephys 
suffered no delusions. They knew that the Teir`Dal would not bargain, and those 
that surrendered were doomed to a quick death at best, with a long life of torture 
and servitude being the alternative. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Have we received 
any word from Antonius Bayle yet?" Tephys asked not for the first time since the 
council had convened. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"I'm afraid that 
my messengers have returned with the same news we expected Lord Tephys," Carson 
explained. "He cannot lend us much support, if any, in our struggle. He is afraid, 
and with good reason, that were he to make any attempt to do so, the rival factions 
in and around Qeynos would be quick to take advantage of the city. He envisions 
everything from the gnolls of Blackburrow overrunning the city to the Bloodsabers 
taking it from underneath him. And the sad thing is, I can't really say I blame 
him." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"What of Freeport?" 
asked Taliman Yurick, the leader of the city's brewing merchants. "Surely they're 
in the best position to help us, practically bordering Nektulos and all." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Freeport is 
in no position to help us either," Lord Tephys pointed out. "The Militia and the 
Paladins keep each other in check constantly. Both know that if either were to 
support us the other side would only use it as an excuse to try and take complete 
control of the city. No my friends, I'm afraid it looks like both of the great 
cities of Antonica will not be aiding us in this fight. And we can count the dwarves 
out as well. As I suspected, my emissaries to King Kazon were met only by the 
damned dwarven logic of, 'all the more reason we should stay here and prepare 
to defend the shores of Butcherblock'." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"I too, have 
contacted my people across the sea," spoke Pracil Micus of the Erudites. They 
have agreed only to bring it up in the next High Council meeting for discussion, 
at which point they may decide to send some sort of help."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Great!" shouted 
Thubir Axebringer. The prominent dwarven smith from Kaladim jumped up from his 
seat fuming, "The way ye blasted Erudites discuss things in yer meetins we should 
be getting help just about this time next decade!" </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Indignant, Pracil 
Micus retorted, "Why you little bearded wretch, I suppose I should expect such 
manners from a…."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"SILENCE!" bellowed 
Carson as he banged his gavel upon the table. "I'll have no bickering between 
us, especially at a time like this. You think the Teir`Dal are fighting over which 
of them are going to attack us? No. They're not because they ALL want to attack. 
And if the stories I've heard of late are indeed true, that the Teir`Dal have 
indeed united under this prophet, this 'child of hate', then we may not just be 
facing a few Teir`Dal war parties, but rather the whole of Neriak itself!" </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"But Carson!" 
Taliman protested, "If what you're saying is true then we're doomed already. We 
have no armies save the guard of Highkeep, no allies to call upon, and all against 
an entire nation of Dark Elves!" </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Perhaps you 
are not alone as you think, my friends," said a voice from the crowd. Two high 
elves stepped forward, resplendent in their ornate armor. One was an older male 
with lines of battle etched into his face, the other a younger female with the 
beauty of a goddess herself. Both appeared to be a bit travel worn but fully armed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lord Tephys stood, 
an obvious wave of relief flashing across his face. "Ladies and Gentlemen of the 
council, allow me to introduce Galeth Veredeth, High Paladin of Tunare and chief 
advisor to King Tearis Thex." The members of the council were impressed and quickly 
invited the newcomers to join their meeting. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Thank you Tephys 
my old friend," Galeth said with a look of sympathy for the tired elven Lord. 
"The young lady accompanying me is Firiona Vie, Paladin of Tunare and my finest 
student yet."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona bowed 
politely to the table saying, "The honor is mine your lordships." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Ah yes!" said 
Tephys with sudden recognition. "You have truly grown in the grace of Tunare since 
last I saw you young Firiona, we welcome you to our table. Now…please tell me 
you bring good news Galeth." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Indeed I do," 
replied the Paladin. "I'm pleased to announce that the entirety of the Paladins 
of Tunare are at your disposal."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Cheers erupted 
from the council and the crowd. Galeth holds up his hand for silence and continues, 
"As we speak our legions are sailing across the Ocean of Tears and should arrive 
in a fortnight. The remainder of the Fier`Dal forces shall have to remain in Faydark 
however, as we are constantly besieged by the orcs of Crushbone. This is all King 
Tearis can spare. The only stipulation we insist upon is that Lord Tephys lead 
the armies defending Highkeep." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lord Tephys attempted 
to argue against this at first, but was quickly and unanimously outvoted as the 
entire council, led by Carson McCabe, insisted that it was a grand idea. A messenger 
stepped forward and whispered something in Carson's ear. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Carson stood 
up with a smile on his face and spoke, "In addition to this most fortunate news, 
I've just been informed that adventurers from all over Norrath are volunteering 
by the dozens to aid our cause!" Again the crowd and council are swept away by 
rampant cheers of thanks. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lord Tephys once 
again stood and addressed everyone. "With that said gentlemen, I believe this 
council is adjourned. We all have a lot of plans to make and little time to spare. 
By the grace of Tunare, we just might have a chance."</font></p>
