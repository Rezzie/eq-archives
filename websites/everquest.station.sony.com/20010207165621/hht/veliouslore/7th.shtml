<p align="left" class="subHeader">&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" class="subHeader"> Day 7</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There has been dreadful news today. One of our 
party has been lost! It’s a woeful tale, and our party has been delayed in leaving 
Thurgadin because of it. Amazingly, the dwarves haven’t decided to punish the 
lot of them. Alas, it had to do with the Hall of Ancestors and the dwarves’ reverence 
for their history.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One member of the exploration party decided to 
try and manage to capture few of these miraculous images during the wee hours 
of the night. Deep inside the mountain, he made his way to the deepest part of 
Icewell Keep to gather an image of the Hall of Ancestors for us. The Coldain had 
mentioned in an off-handed manner that the Hall was sacred to them, and that they 
would prefer the adventurers not capture any images therein. The travelers, however, 
were not fully aware of the depth of the reverence in which the dwarves hold this 
shrine to their forefathers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_1.html', '484')"><img src="images/day7_1_lo.jpg" width=124 height=180 align="right" border=0></a>A 
bit of explanation about the images is in order here. The gnomes have long been 
known for their tinkering and mechanical skills, and this curious device they 
have created enables them to preserve the images they see in such a way that they 
can be transmitted, magically, over great distances. The receptacle of the images 
remains in the hands of our party’s historian who, in turn, sends them to us. 
Images are transmitted from the minds of all the explorers to the historian via 
small devices they wear on their helms. In this way, we have been able to see 
exactly what our explorers have seen, and in this case, it was very enlightening, 
if dreadful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The youngest of the gnome adventurers, barely 
over a century and with the brashness of youth, padded down to the lower levels 
to obtain a picture. On his way down, he was curious to see a large ice creature 
at the bottom of the ice well. The velium walls of the well are nearly transparent, 
so he was able to send back an image of that as well, though it seems a bit fuzzy, 
no doubt due to the Icewell’s walls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_2.html', '775')"><img src="images/day7_2_lo.jpg" width=320 height=240 align="left" border=0></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He managed to get a clear shot of three of the 
frozen monuments to historical figures, only one of which did not contain an actual 
body! The image he sent back was followed shortly by another in which he was confronted 
by the custodian of these shrines, one Loremaster Solstrin. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_3.html', '775')"><img src="images/day7_3_lo.jpg" width=320 height=240 align="right" border=0></a>As 
you can see in the image the gnome youth returned (apparently he was quite confident, 
this youngster!), the loremaster was vigilantly guarding the Hall. That worthy 
gave him a sound verbal thrashing, along with a lecture on the sanctity of the 
Hall. He was warned that violating the boundaries set for him in his explorations 
could result in severe punishment.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, our young friend must not have 
taken the warnings to heart. At least he had the presence of mind to send along 
numerous shots, just in case he wasn’t able to return to his quarters later. As 
it turned out, sadly, he was unable to do just that.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_4.html', '775')"><img src="images/day7_4_lo.jpg" width=320 height=240 align="left" border=0></a>The 
next shots sent back by the youngster showed, of all the forbidden areas, the 
Dain’s <i>own chamber!</i> He returned a scene showing the royal bed, treasure 
chest, keg, and guards. Apparently, his invisibility potion wore off shortly thereafter, 
and he was apprehended. To make matters worse, his tendency to stutter in tense 
situations was misinterpreted by the guards who found him, and he was brought 
before the Dain in council. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The crime of entering the Dain’s chambers, particularly 
after having violated the sanctity of the Hall of Ancestors proved too much for 
the dwarven community to accept. They meted out the usual punishment for any crime 
against Coldain society, banishment to the Pit. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_5.html', '775')"><img src="images/day7_5_lo.jpg" width=320 height=240 align="right" border=0></a>The 
poor young gnome was tossed down the Icewell where he found himself face to face 
with the very creature he had seen from above! His next images were horrifying, 
filled with the spectre of death at every turn. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Monsters abounded in the caverns branching out 
from the Pit, and a few were captured in the images returned to us. An eerie testimony 
to the viciousness of these creatures can be found in one picture, that of a collection 
of skulls found along the walls of one tunnel. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_6.html', '775')"><img src="images/day7_6_lo.jpg" width=320 height=240 align="left" border=0></a>The 
image of a huge, icy, cuboid monster digesting the remains of some hapless dwarf, 
perhaps, was caught while he was underwater, briefly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most distressingly, the images were suddenly 
cut off after a particularly gruesome encounter with one such hideous creature. 
The rest of the adventuring party has been unable to contact him in any fashion, 
and the dwarves of Thurgadin refused to allow anyone to search. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day7_7.html', '775')"><img src="images/day7_7_lo.jpg" width=320 height=240 align="right" border=0></a>So 
far, the explorers have not decided what to do. They may stay on another day or 
so in Thurgadin to seek the Dain’s mercy and assistance in recovering their friend, 
but as yet, we do not know. Hopefully, tomorrow’s news will be better...</font></p>
