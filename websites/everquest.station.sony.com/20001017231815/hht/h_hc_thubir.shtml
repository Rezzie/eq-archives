<P><font size="4" color="ff9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thubr Axebringer</font></P>
<P><font size="4" color="ff9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Thubir)</font></P>
</font><FONT SIZE=2> </font></B><FONT SIZE=2> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thubr Axebringer was born Thubir 
Axebringer to his parents Mor and Vanka Axebringer. Thubr's younger sister, Laka, 
had trouble pronouncing the "ir" sound in his name, so she called him Thubr (pronounced 
Thoob-r). The nickname has remained with him since that day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Growing up in South Kaladim, Thubr 
spent many hours playing in the areas around the arena. Fascinated by how weapons 
were made, he would often peek through the windows of the Staff & Spear weapon 
shop to watch the storeowner, Didek Stormhammer, cousin of King Kazon, hard at 
work. When he wasn't peeking into windows, he sat on the rooftop of the building 
to watch the great warriors fight in the arena nearby. He did this not merely 
for entertainment, but Thubr studied their fighting techniques, committing them 
to memory, developing his own skills.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day, Thubr sat in his usual spot 
atop the Staff & Spear, waiting for the battles to start, while banging a small 
pipe with his hammer. He had carefully shaped the dull piece of metal into a tiny 
dagger. Hearing the noise on his roof, however, Didek Stormhammer went up on the 
roof and pulled Thubr back down by his ear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Child, what were you doing on the 
roof of my shop?" Didek asked. Before Thubr could answer, Didek spoke again. "Where 
did you get this from?" He pulled the tiny well-crafted dagger from a pocket in 
Thubr's pant leg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Siirrr…" Thubr stammered, "I made 
that from an old pipe I found behind the shop. 'Tis mine, give it back t'me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In disbelief, Didek asked again, 
"You are too young to have made such a finely crafted weapon, where did you get 
this from?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Aye, I did make it," said Thubr, 
undaunted, "give it back, 'tis mine. I learned how to make it by watchin' weapons 
bein' made through the window o'ye shop."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Didek, seeing promise in the lad, 
asked Thubr to come work for him as an apprentice. Through the years, the young 
dwarf learned how to make many weapons. He also continued his rooftop study of 
the arena combatants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was years later that King Kazon 
Stormhammer came to the shop to look for new weapons for his Stormguard. Browsing 
over his cousin's inventory, the king found nothing that sparked his interest. 
About to leave, he spotted Thubr standing before his workbench. The King told 
Thubr to step aside that he might examine the weapons upon his table. "Didek!" 
the King shouted over his shoulder as he perused what lay before him, "Why did 
you not show me these weapons?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Cousin, those are just ones that 
the boy is working on," said Didek, gesturing toward Thubr, who was now a young 
man. "I did not deem them of the best quality."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">King Kazon turned to Thubr and told 
him he wanted the weapons for his Stormguard. After pausing but a moment, Thubr 
responded, "The high quality weapons I make on me own time are too good t'give 
to anyone else. I keep 'em for m'self because I am a 
great warrior and deserve the best."</font></p> 
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marveling at the audaciousness 
of the youth, the King asked, "What is your name, boy?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"He is Thubr Axebringer, 
milord," interrupted Didek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">King Kazon studied the young 
man, sizing him up. The pause was awkward only for Didek, for Thubr stood steady 
under the scrutiny. Finally, The King said, "If you are truly a great warrior, 
as you say, you should be in the Stormguard." Lifting his sword, the King beckoned 
Thubr to kneel before him and tapped him on the shoulder, proclaiming, "Thubr 
Axebringer, the great warrior, is now a member of the Stormguard." He sheathed 
his sword and said to Thubr, "Report for duty immediately. And bring the weapons 
with you!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr, for once, was speechless. 
He stood then bowed. "Yes, Sire," was all he said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr spent many years with 
the Stormguard, learning new tactical skills and honing the ones he had acquired 
on his own. He also continued to improve his blacksmithing skills, creating stronger 
and better weapons for the Stormguard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In South Kaladim, at the 
Pub Kal, owned by the Darkfoam family, he ran into many interesting people while 
drinking. It is here that he was tricked into becoming an ambassador for Kaladim. 
Although he was good at getting the job done, Thubr was not the typical ambassador. 
He shares the traditional dwarven qualities of stubbornness and love of drink. 
When he is drunk, however, he is very friendly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr became a master brewer 
through his years as well, adding to his reputation as an expert blacksmith and 
fierce warrior. The owner of the Grub & Grog, Retchin Krundd, a decidedly unattractive 
but friendly and flirtatious female Dwarf, lost a bet with Thubr and, consequently, 
part ownership of the pub to him as well. Located in East Freeport, this establishment 
is considered one of the roughest taverns on all of Norrath, frequented by course 
adventuring types and the notorious Freeport Militia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout his adventures 
and difficult battles, Thubr has traveled with many people. Some of these he even 
regards as friends. He has battled along side the likes of Firiona Vie, Al'Kabor, 
Dreezil Pocketdip, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, Dagda Icefury, Lorisyn Oakwynd, 
Lyirae Oakwynd, Sionachie Heartsinger, and Sir Jevik Isqual to name a few. Of 
these, he would speak most highly of Firiona Vie, Al'Kabor, and Dreezil Pocketdip. 
Though he views Al'Kabor as an arrogant and longwinded Erudite, Thubr gains much 
entertainment from him, often following him around. Firiona Vie he respects, as 
most do, and is always concerned for her safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dreezil Pocketdip, a shady 
halfling, is one of Thubr's favorite drinking buddies. After long battles, the 
two can be found visiting the nearest bar to guzzle down many types of ale together.</font></p>
