                  <p>I was born in the chaos of war and destruction. The time 
                    is but a shadow of a memory. I remember as a young child, 
                    my parents, my family, my tribe. Then the Ice Giants came 
                    and took everything that was my life. It became my lifequest 
                    to seek revenge against the Ice giants that slaughtered my 
                    tribe! I will take from them what they have taken from me. 
                    Life. Kneeling on the blood covered snow, I pledged myself 
                    to Rallos Zek in exchange for revenge. For several years, 
                    I survived alone with no tribe, on my own wits and strength. 
                    I learned many things, and lost some as well, in the harsh 
                    snow plains. I learned to never underestimate an opponent. 
                    My torn eye serves as a constant reminder. The tests of wind 
                    and cold have I passed. With every foe I slaughtered, it was 
                    an offering, in hopes that one day when the time came my time 
                    came in battle, I would be judged worthy to enter the realm 
                    of Rallos, away from this mortal land. This was before the 
                    Great Merging, into what is now known as Halas. I eventually 
                    found others of my kind, and joined the Ice Giant War with 
                    Geranel McVaxius, and helped in the overthrow of the accursed 
                    giant taskmasters and driving them back across the plains! 
                    The taste of revenge was sweet and yet, I was unfulfilled. 
                    And the sudden realization came to me that I would never regain 
                    what I lost, my family, my tribe. So I began my life anew. 
                    I sought solace in the midst of battle and gore, the stench 
                    of death permeating the air and the screams of my foes, the 
                    only things familiar to me. I became a mercenary, a soldier, 
                    even a bodyguard. Anything to quench my savage bloodlust but 
                    it was never enough. And so my adventuring days began. My 
                    party and I were waylaid by a group of Ice Giants as we sought 
                    to explore the newly discovered depths of Permafrost. My comrades 
                    fought valiantly and in retaliation the giants collapsed the 
                    tunnel in which they in, thus killing them and us. The cowards!. 
                    And as I shouted to Rallos that I was at last coming to join 
                    him, a voice spoke to me, "You will not be purged from the 
                    Realm just yet, my warrior. Your usefulness has not ended 
                    yet." I found myself outside the cave, alone. It was then 
                    that I noticed I was unaffected by the cold winds. I felt 
                    no physical pain. From that point on, I never again felt the 
                    need to neither eat nor sleep. My mission was never made known 
                    to me, and so I wandered, trying to find what it was. I have 
                    fought in wars all over Antonica and even the land of the 
                    elves and the small folk, Faydwer. I have even traveled to 
                    far off lands, where scaled monsters ruled the lands with 
                    an iron grip so tight; the earth itself seemed to scream with 
                    anguish. I have bathed in the blood of many foes and still, 
                    this does not please Him. My mind wanders to do something 
                    more and so I still fight, not for bloodlust, but for Justice. 
                    I have tried to right the wrongs on this land. I have helped 
                    those who cannot help themselves and defended the meek from 
                    the overpowering. And yet, my purpose is made unknown to me. 
                    For how long I may never know. </p>
