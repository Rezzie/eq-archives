            <p align="left" class="subHeader"> Day 11</p>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day11_1.html', '500')"><img src="images/day11_1_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" hspace="8" border="0"></a>Before 
              the dawn even raised a blush on the horizon, the gnomes’ guides 
              had them up and ready to travel, as anxious as they were to enter 
              the Storm Giant city. Kael Drakkel, like the Coldain city of Thurgadin, 
              is built into the mountains. Security here, too, seems to have been 
              of primary concern.</p>
            <br clear=all>

            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day11_2.html', '500')"><img src="images/day11_2_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" hspace="8" border="0"></a>Having 
              passed through the second outer gate, which was much smaller and 
              not heavily guarded than the one the group viewed at sunset, a long 
              icy passageway was traversed, down to the inner gate. Our explorers 
              provided us an image of it, well-guarded and sturdy.</p>
            <br clear=all>

            <p>The frost giants explained (with what our party felt was barely 
              disguised scorn) that the storm giants prefer to entrench themselves 
              in this fortification rather than pursue a nomadic lifestyle as 
              they do. They come here to trade and visit, but don’t generally 
              stay long unless they are recovering from some battle.</p><br clear=all>

            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day11_3.html', '500')"><img src="images/day11_3_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" hspace="8" border="0"></a>The 
              frost giants promised the adventurers an audience with the king, 
              but until such time as the king saw fit to greet them, they toured 
              the city. More than one member of the party found the footing precarious 
              in Kael Drakkel. The ice underfoot proved to be very slippery, causing 
              more than one fall before the giants decided to once again transport 
              the explorers. As we can see in this image returned to us, velium 
              is as much prized and utilized by the giant races as it is by the 
              Coldain dwarves. The magical ice is just as slick as, if not more 
              so than, the ice we are more familiar with in places like Halas.</p>
            <br clear=all>

            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day11_4.html', '500')"><img src="images/day11_4_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" hspace="8" border="0"></a>The 
              explorers, being inclined to strong interests in building, have 
              been fascinated with the sheer immensity of the giants’ furniture. 
              Here, two of their guides prepared a table with food for them to 
              enjoy before they continued their tour of the city.</p>
            <br clear=all>

            <p>The giant races are warlike and enjoy both watching and participating in combat. The arena boasts daily competitions and our party was treated to a sample.</p><br clear=all> 

            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day11_5.html', '500')"><img src="images/day11_5_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" hspace="8" border="0"></a>For 
              the small price of a ticket, the entire band entered the arena, 
              the entrace to which is adorned with the symbol of Rallos Zek. Here, 
              we see that banner hanging between two storm giants guarding the 
              arena gate. </p>
            <br clear=all>

            <p>The event was sparsely attended, no doubt due to the great number of such events. These combats can be held at any time two local residents choose. The giants are also believed to decide differences in the same manner. </p><br clear=all>

            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day11_6.html', '500')"><img src="images/day11_6_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" hspace="8" border="0"></a>The 
              gnomish party was unsuccessful in their attempt to explain that 
              more money could be collected if the events were held less frequently. 
              The concept of supply and demand is not one held in high regard 
              by the giants of either storm or frost, it seems.</p>
            <br clear=all>

            <p>Shortly after the evening’s event culminated, the party returned to their hosts cavernous home for the night, to send us the day’s report. Their audience with King Tormax, they had learned, will be granted early on the morrow...</p><br clear=all>
