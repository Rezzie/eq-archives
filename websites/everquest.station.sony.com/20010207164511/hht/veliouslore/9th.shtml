            <p align="left" class="subHeader"> Day 9</p>
            <p>The mountains are filled with dangers, as our adventurers are finding 
              in their travels. In an attempt to escape the ravages of the frigid 
              weather, the party has made use of various caves. They’ve come to 
              expect each one to house one or more extremely dangerous creatures, 
              and they have not been disappointed.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day9_2.html', '500')"><img src="images/day9_2_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>One 
              image provided to us by the explorers, we are told, is of a great 
              lizard the Coldain refer to as a "wurm." As you can see, the gnome 
              who discovered this beast was leary of approaching it directly, 
              capturing the shot from a safe vantage point. It seems the monster 
              noticed him peeking around the corner. One must assume they are 
              able to see very well, accustomed as they are to the dim light of 
              the caverns in which they live.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day9_1.html', '500')"><img src="images/day9_1_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>The 
              most frightening encounter yet had to be the giant cave bear seen 
              in the next image provided to us. What had been planned as a short 
              break in the journey turned out to be a very short one as the party 
              was interrupted while settling in. Perhaps the smell of their tiny 
              fire brought this fearsome ursine to the group’s location. Clearly, 
              he was not happy to have uninvited house guests. These great bears 
              and wurms seem to have claimed all of the caverns in the Great Divide 
              that are not already filled with Coldain.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day9_3.html', '500')"><img src="images/day9_3_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>Dire 
              wolves of unusual coloration are found in the mountains, as well. 
              On this unusually mild morning, while resting momentarily in the 
              snow to sip melted snow, the group was surprised by this one, his 
              red eyes glowing fiercely, caught in the act of leaping toward the 
              poor cleric. We hear he managed to heal himself without undue difficulty 
              after the ill-mannered beast was dispatched.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day9_4.html', '500')"><img src="images/day9_4_lo.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right" border="0" hspace="0"></a>One 
              member of the party ran across a great hunter of the Coldain, by 
              the name of Vores, while exploring. He provided us an image of his 
              camp, and explained that he entertained them for an hour or so, 
              informing them about the local beasts. </p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day9_5.html', '500')"><img src="images/day9_5_lo.jpg" width="200" height="166" align="left" border="0" hspace="0"></a>While 
              they chatted, he spotted a wurm casually ambling by and captured 
              its likeness for our benefit. We’re told the gnome in question departed 
              the camp immediately thereafter to rejoin the group, no doubt for 
              security!</p>
            <br clear=all>

<p>The explorers are finding the going slow through the mountains, but their adventures keep them from becoming discouraged by it. There is still so much to explore! We here at home are becoming anxious to be permitted to join them in their journey of discovery ourselves! Hopefully, soon, the adventurers will declare the continent safe enough for the bravest of veteran travelers to visit...</p><br clear=all>
