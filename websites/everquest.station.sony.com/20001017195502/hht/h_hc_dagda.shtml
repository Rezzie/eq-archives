<P><font size="4" color="ff9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda Icefury</font></P>
</B><FONT SIZE=2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda is a strong woman, firmly rooted 
in the physical world. She is most comfortable dealing with things she can touch, 
hear, and smell. A follower of The Tribunal, she believes in the tenants of absolute 
justice, but, for the most part, has little use for the gods. The realms of spirit 
and magic are best left to those who have the time to worry about such intangible 
things. The extent of her mystical experiences consist of a single dream she received 
from Tunare, though she never knew nor cared about its source, that foretold her 
meeting the gnomes, Ognit and Dabner. Other than this, she has found that obstacles 
are best met head-on where she can see them face to face, smell their breath, 
and hear the crunch of their bones. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda saved the gnomes Ognit and 
Dabner in Everfrost many years ago when raiders attacked them. She has grown very 
fond of, and indeed loves, them both. She respects them for their inherent mystical 
and spiritual abilities, but she is keenly aware of their physical frailties. 
She vowed to defend them both, and does so with the ferocity of a bear defending 
her cubs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda is by no means simple, and 
is truly a genius in the realm of tactics and combat. She is literate enough to 
read the common tongue with little difficulty, and speaks both the common tongue 
and her native tongue fluently. Her knowledge of other languages is generally 
limited to curses and taunts, of which she has gathered quite an arsenal. She 
generally communicates in a short and very direct fashion, leaving no room for 
misinterpretations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda knows that Ognit is very intelligent 
and respects his knowledge, though she sometimes questions its use. She is most 
impressed and thoroughly fascinated by his ability to tinker and create wondrous 
things. Indeed, this is the medium through which she can relate to him best. The 
useful objects he builds allow her to perform any number of tasks, so useful, 
in fact, that she thinks he would be better off giving up the study of wizardry 
to become a full-time tinker. After all, it's just fine to call down the very 
fire of Fennin Ro upon the mighty Glacier Bear at 300 yards, but when it is mauling 
your head off it's of little use. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda shares a healthy sibling-like 
rivalry with Ognit. Being an accomplished tactician, she is aware of the simple 
fact that at a distance Ognit would have the clear advantage, and would win were 
they to ever do battle. However, she also knows that if she got her hands upon 
him, she would be the victor. Despite being quick to anger at times-and she and 
Ognit have often exchanged heated words-Dagda would never raise a hand against 
either of the gnomes she has sworn to protect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dagda views Dabner in a much different 
light. She has on countless occasions felt his healing touch as a cleric. For 
one who is so firmly rooted in the phycial world, it is for her a wonder to watch 
wounds disappear. She sees him as a very simple, yet very compassionate and loving 
soul. She loves him as a brother, and treats him in a somewhat patronizing manner. 
She would never consider speaking an unkind word to him, nor will she tolerate 
those that might. She is aware of, and also a bit saddened by, a crush Dabner 
has upon her. Dabner is simply too short for her tastes. She would much prefer 
a man of might with whom she would not worry. However, as a warrior she respects 
his raw courage in battle and his unfailing loyalty to his friends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though she is closest to the gnomes, 
Dagda also shares a strong respect for her companions. It is Firiona Vie, Sir 
Jevik, and Thubr Axebringer she most deeply admires. They are all mighty warriors 
in her eyes. She acknowledges the skills of the rogue Dreezil Pocketdip, and views 
him as a skilled fighter. His ways of stealth are an effective way of dealing 
with his natural halfling handicaps in her eyes. Though she is not a warrior and 
not as skilled as the others with a sword, the bard Sionachie is a valuable asset 
to the group. Her rousing battle songs inspire a zeal that makes combat that much 
more exciting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the wizard Al'Kabor, Dagda has 
little love. Respecting the immense power he wields, she has a healthy fear of 
him. After his recent threats against Ognit, however, her opinion of him has since 
plummeted.</font></p>
