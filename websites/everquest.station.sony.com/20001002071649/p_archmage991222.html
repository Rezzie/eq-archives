<STRONG>
Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check.  There is always a 5% chance of 
succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of 
failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is).  What modifies a fizzle 
check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) 
your primary statistic (Intelligence for Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and 
Charisma for Bards) (c) the difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell.
<P>
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% 
chance of fizzling.  This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill (Evocation, for 
example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum of 75 in your 
appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did not set the difficulty 
of the spell to less then average (some spells we assign a lower difficulty, making 
them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty).
<P>
If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.), we 
reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your statistic above 75.
<P>
Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell).  A 
Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 
12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes 
of casting.  With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 
intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind 
Affinity.  For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of 
fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling.  Thus, three 
levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max 
out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell.  
<P>
A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind Affinity 
without fizzling earlier.

Q: How many HP does the Paladin ability Lay On Hands heal?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: Lay on Hands (Paladin ability, useable once every game day) heals 25 HP per 
level of the Paladin.

</font><A NAME="fullheal"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Did you ever consider giving the Paladin a Full Heal with Lay on Hands?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: No.  It was decided very early on (pre Alpha) that giving the Paladin a Full 
Heal would be too easy to abuse.  We didn’t want people making “throwaway” Paladin’s 
to pop full Heals on their primaries, nor did we want people bringing hordes baby 
Paladins on Dragon Raids to keep other characters alive.  Giving the Paladin a Full 
Heal would also have taken away from the primary healing class of EverQuest - the 
Cleric.
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
From an RP standpoint, we decided that it made sense to have the Paladin’s healing 
abilities increase as her power and faith grew.

<STRONG>
Q: How do Focus Objects work?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: A recent addition to EverQuest are Focus Objects - objects that let you focus your 
powers of Conjuration and summon more powerful pets.  Magicians may quest for four 
different Focus Objects in the Temple of Solusek Ro.  Powerful Magicians and 
Necromancers may find more potent Focus Objects during their travels.
<P>
All Focus Objects can be identified in that they have the <B>Reclaim Energy</B> spell 
on them.  [Warning - other objects may also have Reclaim Energy]
<P>
Most Focus Objects only work on a specific type of summoning.  The Magician’s <B>Torch 
of Alna</B>, for example, will only enhance the Conjuration of Fire Elementals.  Other 
Focus Objects will only work with high levels of Conjuration - they will not enhance 
low level summonings.
<P>
Focus Object must be held to work.
<P>
Pets summoned with Focus Objects tend to have greater skills, better ability scores 
and more HP.
