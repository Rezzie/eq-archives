<p>Mist clings to the ground in a desperate attempt to remain a part of the city. 
It knows that its visit will be ended in the ritual fashion. The sun will takes 
its place, holding court over the noise and the stench that is Freeport once wakened. 
The mist will add its strength to the stifling heat, amplifying the magnificence 
of its vanquisher, all the while waiting for the day's end. It waits for the opportunity 
to fulfill its favorite part of the cycle. As the sun falls the mist will settle 
down between the buildings. It will mask the activities of rogues and other murderous 
creatures of spite. As I rub away the mist that dampens the hangman's noose, I 
come to understand it and with it myself.</p>
<p>Once a servant of Hate, I now understand the balance of things. The roguish 
follower of Bristlebane is as much a part of the order of things as the warrior 
that chivalrously follows the Lightbringer, Marr. This order permeates my being 
and is what drives my existence. You see, dear seeker, I have seen the amazing 
strength that my once beloved Knights of Innoruuk would carry with them into battle. 
I have watched as we plowed through villages behind the ranks of our undead. I 
have also witnessed the daunting strength of faith and sacrifice as a single follower 
of Rodcet leapt before a finishing blow only moments after saving the life of 
a fellow adventurer. A person who would eventually ponder the memories of that 
day in a sanctuary that only sacrifice seems to provide.</p>
<p>All things have a place and a purpose… the rogue, the Paladin, the innocent, 
and the follower of Hate. They all make up the fabric of our reality here in Norrath. 
I gained understanding of this as I was called from my flesh. I found enlightenment 
as I lay looking up from the warm sticky field of combat. I was shown the way 
of balance and order. It is cool and soothing. Calmness now surrounds me as I 
walk among you, unnoticed. I have little recollection of what my life was. I do 
understand this, dear seeker; there is a power more knowing than the gods. There 
is a purpose that you should never try and cheat. I will be looking over the shoulders 
of all of those seeking to disrupt the natural order of things. My sword is swift 
and my smile is kind. Serve your purpose within the boundaries of its true intent 
and you will likely see neither, for I am the whisper in the mist filled shadows 
and the sparkle on the sun-red sea. I will watch over your safety… or end any 
attempts at tricking your fate.</p>
<p>You see, dear seeker, I am merely a servant of balance and thus a servant of 
yours. May your gods watch over you and may all of your days be filled with amazement. 
It is a beautiful world that you live in. Waste not a single discovery, for it 
can only happen once. Seek out the adventures that most definitely lie ahead and 
follow your purpose. </p>
