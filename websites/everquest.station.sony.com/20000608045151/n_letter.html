              <p><font size=2>Hello all,</font></p>
              <p><font size=2>On behalf of the entire EverQuest Team, it is with great pride that I announce the launch of the first EverQuest expansion – The Ruins of Kunark. This project was a labor of love for us, and I would like to say a few things about it for those of you who may be curious as to what it has to offer.</font></p>
              <p><font size=2>A little more than one year in creation, The Ruins of Kunark expansion adds breathtaking new zones, graphics, and enhanced abilities for high-level characters. The expansion is designed to take advantage of today’s higher performance computers, and offers an amazing and immersive visual experience, which we hope will captivate and delight Norrath’s inhabitants. In addition to offering amazing new vistas, The Ruins of Kunark will allow players to interact with many new creatures and monsters, including the new player race, the darkly enigmatic Iksar, the reptilian rulers of this forgotten continent.</font></p>
              <p><font size=2>The team responsible for The Ruins of Kunark includes the experienced development staff of the original EverQuest game, as well as the new EverQuest Live Team, who will be responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of the game after the expansion. The Ruins of Kunark represents the fruits of years of experience of the original staff, integrated with the fresh new ideas of the EQ Live Team. As a team we have learned much, and grown with the help of our players, and we feel that it shows in this product. As a result, the lands of Kunark offer great adventure and excitement for everyone in Norrath, from lower level players, all the way up to the 60th level characters now possible with the purchase of the expansion. </font></p>
              <p><font size=2>We encourage you to take ship and explore this fascinating and dangerous new continent with us. We feel that the expansion will offer players both new and old a truly remarkable and rewarding experience. If you are one of the many thousands who have already opted to explore these uncharted lands, then we eagerly look forward to seeing you there. We have made every effort with the Ruins of Kunark expansion to provide the most compelling and complete content possible, and we hope that you will find this addition to the continually evolving world of Norrath to your liking. </font></p>
              <p><font size=2>Though we expect that the launch of the expansion will proceed smoothly, we will maintain the staff here at Verant Interactive around the clock to insure that everything will be performing as expected. As we anticipate customers in record number over the next few days, we ask for your understanding should any problems arise. We will do our utmost to resolve any issues quickly, and with a minimum of downtime or inconvenience.</font></p>
              <p><font size=2>In closing I would like to thank our loyal players, without whom this expansion would not be possible. We sincerely hope that you enjoy the new continent of Kunark as much as we enjoyed creating it, and we look forward to the future of EverQuest and hope to see you there as it unfolds.</font></p>
              <p><font size=2>Welcome to EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark! You’re in our world now!</font></p>
