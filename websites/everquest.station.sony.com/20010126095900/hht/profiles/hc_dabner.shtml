            <p align="center" class="header">Dabner Drednever</p>
            <p> Dabner Drednever is a cleric of Brell Serilis. He is a compassionate 
              and simple man, light of heart and jovial in spirit. He does not 
              share the intelligence of his close friend Ognit, nor the physical 
              strength of his sworn protector, the barbarian woman Dagda. He is 
              generally an air-head but this is off-set with a natural wisdom 
              that shows itself in the form of the occasionally profound and significant 
              insight. He is most comfortable in a nice cavern with some good 
              solid earth over his head. As fate would have it, this is seldom 
              possible. He takes this in great stride though. As long as he is 
              with his friends, his inherent agoraphobic, gnomish nature usually 
              does not bother him. </p>
            <p align="justify">Dabner views Ognit as a role 
                model. He wants to be more like Ognit but realizes that he lacks 
                the intense schooling that Ognit has had. Indeed, he knows he 
                is too old to pursue those things and he also knows that he lacks 
                the mental acuity that Ognit possesses. He is comfortable in that 
                knowledge, however. Dabner is the stereotypical side-kick to Ognit. 
                He marvels at his ability to channel great magical energies in 
                a most efficient manner (Ognit speaks often of efficiency). He 
                will go along with just about anything that Ognit does and he 
                trusts his judgement implicitly.</p>
              <p align="justify">Dabner has convinced Ognit 
                to show him a bit of tinkering. The reason for this is both a 
                means for him to be more like his role model Ognit, and also as 
                a way to impress Dagda, upon whom he has a crush. Dabner is taken 
                by Dagda's raw strength and physical prowess. She is his Knight 
                in Shining Armor, in a manner of speaking. A word of encouragement 
                from her ignites a spark within him that sets him aflame with 
                unparalleled courage. Yet as much as he loves her, his nature 
                prevents him from making even the slightest sort of statement 
                of desire towards Dagda.</p>
              <p align="justify">In an odd way, a way that he 
                does not acknowledge in a conscious manner, he views himself as 
                solely responsible for the welfare of his companions. He has occasionally 
                brought down the wrath of Brell upon a foe in order to call its 
                attention upon him and to draw the enemy away from its target. 
                This fact has garnered him great respect with Dagda and she does 
                view the small gnome as one who is surprisingly brave for his 
                size.</p>
              <p align="justify">Though Dabner is completely 
                devoted to the worship of Brell, he also has studied, and is quite 
                knowledgeable about, the religions of other cultures in Norrath, 
                as well as the lore of the gods they worship. He finds that by 
                studying and understanding the beliefs of others, they are not 
                as scary to him.</p>
