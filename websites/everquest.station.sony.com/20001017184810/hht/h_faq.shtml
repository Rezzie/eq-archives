      <dl> 
        <dt><b>What is the Harpy's Head Tavern ™ ?</b> 
        <dd>The Harpy's Head Tavern&#153; is an official EverQuest&#153; site 
          that will provide in-character content related to EverQuest. Some of 
          the things you will find while visiting the Harpy's Head Tavern are 
          Historical Character Profiles, Official Historical Quest Summaries, 
          GM Profiles, a weekly &quot;Dear Mennix&quot; column, an official Events 
          section, and an In-Character forum. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What is a "Static" Quest?</b> </dt>
        <dd>A Static Quest is any sort of quest in the game that solely involves 
          NPCs (Non Player Characters) that are controlled by the AI of the EverQuest 
          servers. A good example of this sort of quest is the &quot;Newbie Note&quot; 
          quest that all new characters can complete to obtain their guild tunic, 
          robe or other starting item. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What is a "Dynamic" Quest? </b></dt>
        <dd>A Dynamic Quest is a broad term that describes any sort of quest where 
          the NPCs are played by live actors, rather then being controlled by 
          the AI of the EverQuest servers. Dynamic Quests can range from simple 
          invasions lasting just a few minutes to complex and intricate stories 
          spanning the course of several weeks. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What is a Historic Quest?</b> </dt>
        <dd>Historic Quests are a special sort of Dynamic Quest. Often complex 
          and spanning the course of several weeks, they often result in temporary 
          or even permanent changes to the game world's story line. Historic Quests 
          advance the ever-evolving plot line of the world of Norrath. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>Can I petition in game, send e-mail or contact anybody to get a 
          special Dynamic Quest for either my Guild, or myself?</b></dt>
        <dd><b></b>As much as we would love to be able to be able to offer impromptu 
          Dynamic Quests for specific players or guilds, it is something that 
          would be impossible to accomplish. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>Will Dynamic Quests ever be announced ahead of time?</b> </dt>
        <dd>Dynamic Quests are never announced ahead of time and will always be 
          a surprise. However, frequent visits to the &quot;Rumors and Whispers&quot; 
          section of the Harpy's Head Tavern may give you clues about who to look 
          for in game and where the action may take place next. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What is the "Rumors and Whispers" section of the Harpy's Head Tavern™?</b> 
        </dt>
        <dd>Rumors and Whispers should be visited often to give you the inside 
          scoop on current events and the on-going changes to the game world, 
          through the perspective of well-known residents of the world of Norrath. 
          You'll find clues, rumors and sometimes just wild speculation that can 
          help you to complete both Static and Dynamic Quests. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What are the "Annals of History"?</b></dt>
        <dd><b></b>The &quot;Annals of History&quot; retell important Historic 
          Quests and Events that have shaped the world of Norrath up until the 
          present day. Here you can find information about why the world is the 
          way it is, often told through the Historical Characters themselves, 
          who were present as the events transpired in the evolving history of 
          Norrath. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What is the difference between a "Quest" and an "Event"?</b></dt>
        <dd> Events are almost always pre-announced, with rules, times, and dates 
          scheduled by server, and are run by GM's and Guides acting as Event 
          Coordinators. Events do not involve GM Quest actors, adventure, or historic 
          storyline. An example of an Event would be the Test of Steel, where 
          warriors gather to duel according to strict rules before a GM Event 
          Coordinator. Role-playing is encouraged at Events, but GM Event Coordinators 
          will generally not be in direct conflict with the players. Players who 
          wish to participate in an Event should follow the directions in the 
          Event Announcements. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>Quests are almost never pre-announced, and usually have very limited 
          rules for players. Quests are run with GM Quest actors, and/or controlled 
          NPC's that can be anything from Gnolls to Dragons. GM's involved in 
          a Quest will customarily interact with the players in a strict role-playing 
          manner, according to the dynamic or historic storyline for the quest. 
          This may include conflict, and GM actors may often slay, or be slain 
          by players to further the storyline. Players may best successfully experience 
          a Quest (and possibly obtain its rewards) by following the clues, and 
          interacting with GM Quest actors and NPCs, as appropriate. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>What are Historical Characters?</b> </dt>
        <dd>A Historical Character is a character who is intimately involved with 
          the ever evolving and dynamic history of Norrath. Many of these characters 
          are featured on both the EverQuest and EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark&#153; 
          box. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><b>Will I ever run into these characters during normal game play?</b> 
        </dt>
        <dd>You just might! It is possible that you could run into, meet, and 
          interact with these Historic Characters in your adventures throughout 
          the world of Norrath. You may see them in a bar or tavern reliving stories 
          of their past over an ale or five, walking through a city street on 
          business, or giving speeches at the city gates on the finer points of 
          magic. Keep your ears to the ground and your eyes peeled! </dd>
