                          We added rough names, including most of the starting 
                          cities I think (Steve is really good with fantasy names,

                          As visitors to EverQuest.com have noticed, we have now 
                          started putting up a weekly poll. With the addition 
                          of this poll on this site, we now have two EverQuest 
                          polling systems-the EverQuest.com poll, and the Log-in 
                          poll. This EverQuest.com poll is mostly for entertainment 
                          purposes and is created by the writers and editors of 
                          the site. The other polling system, the log-in poll, 
                          is seen when logging into EverQuest and is created by 
                          Sony/Verant management in order to gather information 
                          on various subjects and issues. -Steve “Mennix” Fuller</p>
                        <p align="justify"><b>GM Staffing Changes<br>
                          </b>To keep the EverQuest community better informed 
                          of changes in customer service staffing regarding GMs 
                          and servers, we will now be posting news items when 
                          staffing changes are made. Following are the most current 
                          changes to date.</p>
                        <p align="justify">First, let’s start with the new Game 
                          Masters. Before any GM is given a server, he or she 
                          must first be fully trained as a GM and a Customer Service 
                          representative. Once all the training is completed, 
                          including time serving as a chat GM, available servers 
                          are assigned. GM Ozuri, after going through extensive 
                          PvP training will be taking up the reigns of the Rallos 
                          Zek server. GM Zrinic jumps on board on Prexus. Nangwaya 
                          is looking forward to being Terris Thule’s new GM.</p>
                        <p align="justify">Not only new GMs find themselves on 
                          new servers, some of the more weathered ones are transferred 
                          to other servers. GM Exuro, the former GM of Rallos 
                          is now taking up duties on Vazaelle. GM Imia, who served 
                          as a SWAT/Chat GM will now be looking over things on 
                          Xev while GM Lirus assumes duties on Ayonae.</p>
                        <p align="justify">There is also a couple changes to the 
                          Lead GM structure, one is a new Lead, and the other 
                          changes shifts. Congrats to GM Axgoreth for his promotion 
                          to Lead GM who will now be responsible for supervising 
                          a team of Game Masters. In order to fill the night Lead 
                          position and to provide better coverage during those 
                          late night hours, Lead GM Delanus takes over the night 
                          shift.</p>
                        <p align="justify">And last but not least, changes to 
                          GMs that most do not see because their duties are mostly 
                          performed off server. GM Lithgar, the former GM of Povar, 
                          is stepping into GM Jhek’s shoes as the Guide Coordinator 
                          while Jhek takes over duties as Guide Liaison. </p>
                        <p align="justify">“We believe it is important for the 
                          community to be aware of these changes and from now 
                          on, will be keeping you informed as changes are made,” 
                          said Head GM Elionia.</p>

                          <i>ALL I was saying was that I, as a player and a person, 
                          don’t particularly like it as a tactic. As a Verant 
                          employee, my intention is to bring that up in a tuning 
                          meeting (as MY opinion, not as something that the players 
                          want changed). So, please, can we stop all the threads 
                          about how bad my idea is? I’ve got the message already, 
                          I know that many of you don’t want anything done to 
                          reduce quad kiting. I’ve received several e-mails explaining 
                          how it is a valid and balanced (from a risk/reward perspective) 
                          tactic. I will bring that with me to the meeting when 
                          I mention quad kiting, have no fear. And that meeting 
                          isn’t going to be next week, so don’t panic… </i></p>
