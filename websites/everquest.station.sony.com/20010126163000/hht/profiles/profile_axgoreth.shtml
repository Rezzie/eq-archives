<p>In the Dwarven City of Kaladim, known for its fine ales and as the home of 
the Great Butcherblock, Axgoreth was born. His mother worked as a barmaid, and 
his father was a champion in the dwarven army. It was expected that Axgoreth would 
follow in his father's path to become another of the proud, stout warriors representing 
the mighty Kaladim. </p>
<p>Axgoreth, however, was different, destined for more than the simple life of 
a myrmidon. He realized Brell had blessed him with a gift, the power to give life. 
Word spread quickly throughout the land about the young dwarf who performed miracles. 
The battles he led against the goblins that infest the mountains of his homeland 
are still talked about to this day. As his good deeds became more well known, 
his people regarded him as a hero. As a Dwarf of Trueheart and Valor, all those 
in training respected him. For his leadership, courage, and strength in the great 
battle between the Dwarves of Kaladim and the Bandits of Butcherblock, who were 
allied with the Goblins, he was awarded the title Axgoreth the Mighty.</p>
<p>Axgoreth continued to study the teachings of the great clerics of the Underfoot, 
as well as lead his troops to important victories recorded in the annals of the 
Dwarves. His good deeds were not overlooked.</p>
<p>One evening while studying ancient scrolls before retiring for the night's 
rest, he was addressed by a voice he believed to be none other than his creator 
and god for whom he fought for with honor since he could lift a blade. Brell was 
in need of an Avatar. He required someone who was kind, but stern, and capable 
of bearing the mantle as protector of Brell's children in this realm. Upon awakening 
the next day, still at his desk, Axgoreth left to tell his close friends about 
his sign. It was the will of Brell that he should serve the fine citizens of Norrath.</p>
<p>Axgoreth is well known as a lover of fine music and fine brews, as well as 
the occasional elf maiden that catches his eye. A fighter for most of his days, 
he enjoys his free time relaxing and fishing, or sharing a brew and a story with 
old friends. A joker at heart, he will always greet a stranger with a smile, and 
perhaps a riddle. The stranger is left with the impression that he has been lucky 
enough to meet one of the finest defenders of Kaladim.</p>
