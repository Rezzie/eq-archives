            <p align="left" class="subHeader"> Day 6</p>
            <p>It has been a few days since we received a report from the exploration 
              team, but their current missive explains this. It seems that the 
              Coldain were so happy to learn that there are others – both dwarf 
              and otherwise – out in the world that they declared a day of thanksgiving! 
              The party was treated to a banquet of epic proportions! Having recuperated 
              from the festivities, they have finally managed to continue their 
              explorations of the city of Thurgadin.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day6_1.html', '775')"><img src="images/day6_4_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>The 
              banquet was held in the Great Hall of the Coldain castle known as 
              Icewell Keep, a picture of which is shown from just outside one 
              end of the hall. During the fête, smaller wooden tables took up 
              most of the room, providing seating for the revelers during the 
              feast. Sadly, no images were recorded of the occasion – we expect 
              the Coldain are perhaps even more fond of ale than the residents 
              of Kaladim, if that is possible.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p>Icewell keep is located in the heart of the city. All the members 
              of the council reside therein, along with the Dain himself. It lies 
              in the most easily defensible area of the caverns the dwarves could 
              find. Its architecture and decor are formidable and inspiring. Our 
              party gathered some images for us to view, to share that inspiration 
              with us, beginning with the impressive great hall shown above and 
              continues with the throne room, the council and barracks.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day6_2.html', '775')"><img src="images/day6_3_lo.jpg" width="247" height="320" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>The 
              throne room is dominated by a large throne crafted of velium. That 
              sturdy, ice-like material was the obvious choice both for beauty 
              and symbolism here in the mountains of Velious. The throne room 
              is where the Dain holds court, tries civil matters, and dispenses 
              justice. An image of the throne itself is shown at left. Another 
              image was provided of this room, which shows the council in session 
              along the rear of the throne room. Between council and Dain lies 
              the ever-present reminder of the severity of Coldain justice.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day6_3.html', '775')"><img src="images/day6_1_lo.jpg" width="320" height="147" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>There 
              is a nearly cylindrical shaft which opens from the throne room floor, 
              dropping through the floors of the castle, and into the Pit. Apparently 
              there was once a natural spring well in this location which dried 
              up long ages past. The Pit below, which is a natural cavern, which 
              may well have housed an underground body of water at one point, 
              is now used as a means of maintaining law and order in Coldain society. 
              Enemy prisoners, too, have screamed on the way down to their just 
              rewards.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p>The Coldain rarely take prisoners and so they took it upon themselves 
              to populate the pit with some particularly nasty creatures. The 
              pit can be entered only by jumping off Breakstone Bridge or falling 
              down the Icewell, not something any of our adventurers cared to 
              test. The Coldain explained that the pit holds terrors unknown, 
              even beyond what they have released into it, and we’re satisfied 
              with that information. We will simply accept their word for it!</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day6_4.html', '775')"><img src="images/day6_2_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>Quarters 
              for the Dain and the council members are always heavily guarded, 
              and so, though assured these rooms are beautifully appointed as 
              befitting their residents, were not readily available for touring 
              by the party. The group did, however, manage to get a look at the 
              royal guard barracks. This group is made up of the most elite of 
              Coldain warriors.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p>Our adventuring reporters tell us that there is a great wonder 
              of the city which lies in the lower caves beneath Icewell. It is 
              known as the Hall of Ancestors. There, the great Dains and Coldain 
              heroes of the past are buried within the ice wall, creating a macabre 
              museum of sorts. We have learned that there are four icy monuments 
              to past leaders. Within the frozen displays are preserved the bodies 
              of all three previous three Dains, Dain Frostreaver I, II, and III.</p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p>They, and the current Dain, are all named for Colin Dain, to whom 
              the fourth display is dedicated. He was the original expedition 
              leader who was responsible for discovering this continent. He and 
              his men volunteered to remain behind when their brethren fled for 
              safety during a massive attack by giants. Since Colin’s body was 
              never found after his suicide ambush, only mementoes of this great 
              dwarven hero remain, creating an eerily moving tableau in the ice 
              wall. Alas, our adventurers neglected to obtain an image for us 
              due to the sanctity of this place to the Coldain. Perhaps one of 
              them will be able to sneak in a shot before they leave for further 
              exploration...!</p>
