              <p> Welcome back! 
              <p> Well, it's been an even busier than normal week and I'm pretty excited about what we've accomplished. 
              <p> First, as many of you have undoubtedly already noticed, we've temporarily turned our Test server into a 
                prototype PvP Teams server. The twelve races of Norrath make up four teams, and a member of one team can engage 
                in player vs. player combat with any member of the other teams. We are hoping this adds an exciting dynamic 
                to the EverQuest world for those of our players who enjoy the added danger of player vs. player and believe 
                that the creation of teams based on both race and geographical location offers many great opportunities to 
                enhance Role Playing. Please keep in mind that both the code and rules specific to the PvP Teams server are 
                new and untested and will be kept on the Test Server until we feel comfortable making them live. We don't 
                have an exact date as to when the official PvP Teams server will be going online, but it should be within 
                the next few weeks (and even then we will consider the new server to be in Beta for a while, meaning rules 
                and features are still subject to significant change). In the meantime, I encourage anyone curious about the 
                Teams server to log onto the Test Server (run testeverquest.exe in your EverQuest directory), check it out, 
                give us feedback and let us know about any bugs. Oh, and the PvP Teams server will be called Tallon Zek, named 
                after Rallos Zek's son, the god of Strategy. 
              <p> Another change you'll find on the Test Server are some upgrades to the Warrior class. We've increased warriors' 
                hit points, given them additional magic resistance, and implemented critical hits above and beyond those that 
                already occur in combat. This brings up, of course, the popular subject of class balance. In general we feel 
                the classes in EverQuest are pretty well balanced, and that they each offer strengths and weaknesses the others 
                don't have. Also, some are geared more for parties, and some excel at solo play better than others. Now, that 
                said, because EverQuest is an ever-evolving dynamic game, the balance of power often shifts here and there 
                and we felt after talking to players and discussing the issues extensively with both internal testers, GMs, 
                and members of the development team, that Warriors needed an upgrade to make them more valuable in combat. 
                We hope all of your Warriors out there like the changes - let us know. 
              <p> And no, we're not forgetting Rogues. Just to let everyone know, we also feel that Rogues are in need of 
                some tweaks and we are enhancing their class by implementing the skills Apply Poison and Make Poison. Apply 
                Poison is technically done but in that it relies on Make Poison, we haven't really advertised the fact. Make 
                Poison will be a Rogue-only Trade Skill and will involve combining toxic components in order to make deadly 
                poisons the Rogue can then apply to his weapons, making them even more potent. The Game Designer responsible 
                for Trade Skills in general and Make Poison in particular is hard at work finishing this implementation, which 
                includes both creating an array of components and poisons, as well as placing them in-game, whether they be 
                on NPCs or found in stores or elsewhere. I think it's safe to say there are a few more weeks of work involved 
                before you'll see both skills in full swing on the Test Server. 
              <p> One of the things I want to do with the Producer's Letter going forward is feature some aspect of the game, 
                whether it be a dungeon or outdoor zone, and talk a bit about it every week, maybe giving out a minor game 
                hint or two (no, no major spoilers -- you guys know us better than that). I'll start by talking about Rare 
                Spawns which now populate many of the outdoor areas (and we're adding more all the time). Rare Spawns in this 
                context are generally wandering NPCs with proper names that only appear occasionally and typically are loaded 
                with some pretty decent treasure. A pretty well known example would be Lockjaw, a nasty and rather large crocodile 
                that appears occasionally in the Oasis of Mar. Anyway, here's the hint: the more NPCs slain in the zone the 
                greater the chance that the Rares will appear. Also, different Rares will spawn in different areas of a zone, 
                especially the larger zones, so my suggestion would be to keep moving while you hunt. That's it, it's pretty 
                simple - and I really think if more players try this method of hunting the more common NPCs in an outdoor 
                zone they'll find the Rares aren't quite as rare as perhaps some people think they are. 
              <p> Lastly, I wanted to announce that Verant will be at GenCon this year in Milwaukee, August 5th thru 8th. 
                We'll be showing both <b>EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#153;</font> 
                (yep, that's the title of the Expansion) and our new massively multiplayer real-time strategy called <b>Sovereign</b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#153;</font>.&nbsp; 
                I look forward to seeing many of you there, and we're also hoping to have a players' dinner during one of 
                the evenings - I'll keep you posted. 
              <p> I'll see you next week - there's lots more to talk about.
