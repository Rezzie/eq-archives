<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lieutenant Thorn 
had completed conducting his tour of the area surrounding the small elven encampment. 
With night falling he suggested they head back to the small encampment. "Well 
my friends, darkness falls. I think it is probably best if we make our way back 
to camp now. I'm sure you could use a good night sleep after all." Everyone nodded 
in agreement. They turned and began to head back down the stone path back toward 
the encampment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Suddenly, a strange 
voice cried out, "Visitors! Watch your backs, the Drolvarg are attacking!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Without warning, 
they were surrounded. The Lycanthropes, known as Drolvarg, surrounded the party. 
The Drolvarg were huge snarling brutish creatures. Saliva fell from huge fangs 
bared on their strange wolf-like faces. Standing more then eight feet tall, their 
enormous hands were ended in huge feral claws. The clawed hands swiped through 
the air viscously and with amazing speed. The smell of their damp matted fur filled 
their nostrils, almost choking them with their canine stench.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Reacting instinctively, 
the group sprang into action to defend themselves. Galeth, Firiona, Lieutenant 
Thorn and Sir Jevik immediately interposed themselves between each of the beasts 
and the rest of their friends. The hair on the back of Firiona's neck begun to 
stand on end from the huge surge of magical energy being channeled by the two 
wizards Al`Kabor and Ognit Eznertob.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>A mighty explosion 
of fire, as hot as the sun itself, enveloped one of the Drolvarg as Al`Kabor unleashed 
his attack. The wave of heat caused everyone to wince briefly as the shock wave 
surged past them. The Drolvarg fell to the ground, killed in one blow by this 
most powerful wizard. The smell of burnt fur hung sickeningly in the air and the 
corpse left was a mass of fused bone and ichor.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Ognit let loose 
his spell, causing two Drolvarg to fly high into the air, away from the party. 
The creatures flew back several yards and landed very hard and painfully upon 
the ground. Much to Ognit's horror, the creatures were back on their feet immediately 
and within seconds one of the huge beasts were standing, slavering and angry over 
the tiny gnome. It raised its terrible hand and sent it crashing down upon the 
head of the gnome, sending him sprawling, his head bleeding from the massive blow.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Instantly, Dagda 
spun around and kicked the creature in its backside. She shouted something in 
a guttural and obviously very primitive language. The Drolvarg turned toward the 
barbarian warrior, angrier then ever but no longer paying attention to the badly 
injured gnome. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Hearing the barbarian's 
shout, Al`Kabor cocked his head and asked, "You didn't just say what I thought 
you said did you? In the gnollish tongue of all things? That's not very lady like."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Without taking 
her eyes off of her opponent, Dagda answered the wizard, "That curse always works 
well in Blackburrow. Gnolls tend to be sensitive about that area of their bodies." 
She continued to direct her savage litany of insults at the Drolvarg, using just 
about every known language.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Running to the 
side of his fallen friend, Dabner Drednever called upon the healing power of Brell 
Serilis his hands taking on a soft blue glow. The glow moved from his hand and 
then encircled the wound on Ognit's head. The wound closed and stopped bleeding. 
Ognit rose again to his feet.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>While Dagda kept 
the Drolvarg she was attacking distracted, Dreezil had crept behind it. Drawing 
out his dagger, he sliced the Achilles Tendon of the beast bringing it instantly 
to its knees. The others quickly finished it off.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>As Firiona and 
Galeth did their best against the remaining two Lycanthropes, a strange thing 
happened. Suddenly, one of the beasts was enveloped in a greenish cloud. Pustules 
and oozing sores sprang up instantly on the beast, whose breath was suddenly rasping 
and labored. From no where a large staff, a skull adorning its tip, came crashing 
down upon the back of the creature's head.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The creature 
turned and upon seeing what had hit him, namely an Iksar wearing ornate armor, 
it's eyes grew wide with fear and it began to run. This Iksar gave chase and bringing 
its staff down hard onto the back of the creature's head once again, the Drolvarg 
was finished. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>It was then that 
they noticed a second Iksar that ran with the first to join the fight against 
the remaining Drolvarg. The second Iksar was dressed plainly, and wore nothing 
more then some modest leather clothing. Both wielding staves, they joined in and 
attacked the Drolvarg ferociously. The final Drolvarg was no match for such a 
sizeable force and quickly fell lifeless to the ground.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The creature 
felled, the two groups sat in silence looking at each other with uncertainty. 
The Iksar in the ornate armor then noticed the small wound on Dagda's arm and 
spoke. "Warrior, you are wounded," the strange lizard man said in perfect common 
with only the slightest hint of some accent. He closed his serpentine eyes and 
whispered something softly to himself. Then placing his hand over the wound on 
her arm, it disappeared without a trace.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dagda looked 
at the Iksar and raising an eyebrow said, "You are a healer. Thank you."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Iksar then 
addressed the rest of the group, "Are all of you ok? This is certainly not the 
welcome that visitors to our land should receive."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Galeth stepped 
forward and answered, "I believe we are all ok. We defeated them quite easily, 
with your help of course. Tell me, what is your name?"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The creature 
moved strangely. His motions were slow and graceful but at the same time it was 
capable of amazing speed, dodging quickly during the combat and moving with blinding 
speed. The Iksar looked at them, his head tilting from side to side. "My name 
is Danak Dhorenth. Friends, may I ask of you where it is you are traveling?"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Intrigued at 
the chance to meet such a strange and wonderful creature, Firiona stepped forward. 
She said, "Well, the Lieutenant here was simply taking us on a little tour of 
the area. However, tomorrow we begin our journey to confront the Ring of Scale."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Danak's serpentine 
eyes dilated upon hearing the words, "The Ring of Scale? Oh my, that is such a 
long way and so very dangerous as well!" Danak pulled an incredibly detailed map 
from his satchel.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona remarked, 
"That's a very nice map! Far more detailed then any I have laid eyes upon."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Al`Kabor raised 
an eyebrow, "Indeed it is, I've seen many a map of this continent in the archives 
of our libraries in Erudin but none as detailed as this!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Do you like 
it? Here, you may have it then," he graciously handed the map to Firiona, bowing 
as he did. Moving with serpent-like speed to her side, he quickly pointed to the 
bottom of the map. "This is where we are on the southern tip of the continent. 
Where you need to go is way over here on the Northeast corner. That's such a long 
way for you all to travel on foot."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The Iksar then 
took looked them all over and smiled showing a mouth full of pointed teeth, "I 
believe I can help you though. You see, over the centuries my people have perfected 
gate travel. I can open a gate for you right now that will take you within just 
a few miles of your destination."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Danak held the 
talisman dangling from his neck with one hand and moved his other hand in an intricate 
pattern over the ornate bauble. Closing his eyes, he whispered unintelligible 
words to himself. The talisman began to glow softly in his hands. Suddenly, a 
shining blue portal appeared in front of the Iksar, shimmering with cool blue 
flames. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Startled, the 
party looked in shock at the strange gate. Firiona took a step back from the gate 
and said with hesitation in her voice, "Well, I really appreciate the offer Danak. 
My friends and I are very tired from our trip. I'm afraid I must respectfully 
decline your offer of help."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>With serpentine 
speed, Danak Dhorentath grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm. Taking her by surprise 
he pulled her into the gate, which disappeared with a hiss leaving nothing more 
than the smell of ozone hanging in the air. Galeth jumped immediately toward Firiona 
as she was pulled in but he was left holding nothing more then thin air.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The party stood 
there for a moment in shock, each looking at the other and then to the place where 
Danak and Firiona Vie had once stood. They slowly turned their attention to the 
remaining and more plainly dressed Iksar that still stood there. This Iksar too, 
looked a little shocked and more then a bit frightened to be left so suddenly. 
Surrounded by twelve angry, scaleless visitors the creature cowered away from 
them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Galeth's face 
was reddened with rage. "I must return and tell King Thex the terrible news. Bind 
the vile Iksar at once! Dagda, Thubr, Jevik! We will escort the prisoner back 
to the mainland to answer for his crimes!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The party's short 
stay on the new continent came to an end that night. The party returned to the 
continent of Faydwer immediately. Shocked and worried about the sudden abduction 
of their close friend and the Chosen of Tunare, they kept a close watch on the 
Iksar Prisoner as the ship sailed back toward home.</font></p>
