</font></B><FONT SIZE=2> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The words spoken by Tunare were still 
fresh in Firiona's mind: "Seek them out, My Child, and restore them as you have 
been restored. First, find your chronicler. Remember the child who sought you 
first? Seek that one. She needs you and will be of great importance to you in 
the days to come. She still sings the history of the elves. Find her in the trees…" 
Immediately following the ritual and her meeting with Tunare herself, Firiona 
set out to find the one that the Mother called the 'chronicler'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wandering toward the massive tree-city 
of Kelethin, Firiona noticed a crowd of people surrounding a woman holding a mandolin 
and spinning tales. Curious, she walked up to the crowd to watch the troubadour 
perform. The woman strummed a few notes on her mandolin and then put it away. Settling 
herself comfortably, she began to tell a tale of blood and honor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Tunare, Mother of All, bids us maintain 
Balance in the world. Good cannot exist without Evil, nor can Death exist without 
Life. Tunare's Children are many. She cares for all, even though she may not have 
created their ancestors, and she loves even the worst, the most evil, of them." 
Looking out over the crowd gathered before her, she continued. "Tunare watched 
as the balance of Good and Evil was upset and knew that to sustain her Children, 
Balance had to be restored. Innoruuk, Prince of Hate, strove to tip the balance 
toward his own favor. His interests are not to preserve Norrath, but to serve 
himself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Innoruuk, in order to promote his 
own cause, spawned an evil creature on the land, who came to be known as Lanys 
T'Vyl, Child of Hate." The singer's voice resonated with the power of her words. 
"She grew in strength and hatred, rallying the dark elven-kind to her banner."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lowering her voice to a near whisper, 
she said, "Lanys and her mentor-guard, Laarthik K'Shin, heard rumors of the discovery 
of a strange metallic ore in the shape of a sphere, which gave off a mysterious 
blue glow. Innoruuk's fervent whispers guided them to take possession of it. This 
metal orb was a catalyst; though none knew at the time what terrible purpose it 
would serve. Laarthik kept it hidden away, sensing that it would be of critical 
value in his future.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The sphere had been uncovered by 
Pickclaw goblins, and where one is found, others are assumed to exist as well. 
The greed of Innoruuk drove Lanys and Laarthik to control the powers of this new 
element. Over many weeks, Lanys and the Teir'Dal forces grew in strength. Rumors 
flew, as on the wings of birds, that spoke of an invasion of Highkeep itself!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The woman stood suddenly, and Firiona 
recognized her immediately as the bard Sionachie, whom she sought. Eyes wide, 
Sionachie continued, "a mysterious silver-haired beauty appeared in Kelethin one 
fine day, on her own quest for information. She listened to ancient rhymes and 
tales and took a mystical creature for her familiar. Some say Firiona Vie, the 
shining paladin of Tunare, is goddess-born, and others that she is a royal child, 
taken from her dead mother's arms in the still of the night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Firiona Vie, the beautiful Firiona 
Vie…" Sionachie hesitated momentarily, a puzzled look on her face, as if she were 
trying to remember something important, but it lay just out of her mind's reach. 
Regaining her composure, she continued her tale. "A royal spirit, Queen of Felwithe, 
appeared at a banquet in Highkeep to announce the arrival of its Child, the one 
who would save Felwithe and aid in Tunare's crusade to restore Balance to Norrath. 
The King cried out in his concern for this child, whom he'd tried to destroy in 
his ignorance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Galeth Veredeth, ancient Paladin 
of Tunare and former advisor to the king, having been but recently restored to 
his own place in the kingdom, introduced the pale swordmaiden to the King. Galeth 
had been the one to protect and train her throughout her youth, and the one to 
raise her in the true spirit of Tunare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Firiona took her place by the side 
of King Tearis Thex in a joyous reunion." Sionachie began to strum a lively, festive 
tune upon her mandolin. Then, stopping abruptly, she leaned forward making a sweeping 
gesture. "The forces of Good and Evil raised their armies, trained and provisioned 
them. Lord Tephys led the army of Good to the crossroads of Kithicor to protect 
the lands of Highkeep Castle. A great Council met to plan strategies. Galeth Veredeth 
pledged the support of King Tearis Thex, in the form of the Paladins of Tunare."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sionachie balled one hand into a 
fist and shook it in the air. "Lanys T'Vyl and Laarthik K'Shin marched their armies 
across the Commonlands and attempted to breach the castle itself in High Hold 
Pass, but the main force met in the forest of Kithicor with Tephys' troops. Thunder 
crashed and powers coursed through the world as the enemies joined in battle." 
Sionachie's voice softened. "Lord Tephys fell to the wrath of Lanys T'Vyl on that 
field, and he will long be remembered by his people." Her head lowered with his 
memory.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Raising her head, she once again 
continued, her voice strong and renewed. "Firiona stepped up to take Tephys's 
place, and rallied the forces of Good. The strength of earth, power of the Mother 
of All, entered Firiona and she glowed with silvery fire. Lanys T'Vyl engaged 
Firiona Vie, both clad in the powers of their Deities, but the Mother's universal 
energies could not be outdone by Hate. Lanys began to falter and she cried out 
to her mentor, Laarthik."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gripping her chest, then thrusting 
her hand outward, Sionachie said, "Laarthik K'Shin reached into his breastplate 
and pulled out the shining blue metal orb and, held it to the sky, and screamed 
out a terrible invitation to the Prince of Hate himself!" Her hands moved in an 
arc above her, as if tracing the dome of the heavens. "The skies opened and flames 
enveloped Laarthik. A frightful rending took place, and therein a mighty rift 
opened between Norrath and Innoruuk's dwelling place, the Plane of Hate. Magic 
users all over the face of Norrath felt the energies pour out of that purgatory, 
heard the tortured cries, and realized their own abilities to enter that place, 
if they dared.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Laarthik was consumed in the flames 
as Lanys herself floated up into the sky, drawn inexorably into her Father's realm. 
Her triumphant laughter rang out across the lands. From that day forward, the 
Curse of Innoruuk has laid upon the forest of Kithicor. The tormented dead are 
doomed to wander the fearsome night's shadows in that formerly peaceful woodland. 
Danger lurks for all who seek passage there." Sionachie's face twisted into a 
scowl of disdain. "Some say that even Laarthik appears there, frightful and deadly, 
and believe that Lanys sits at the right hand of Innoruuk, to return one day and 
take her revenge."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sionachie relaxed slightly, the scowl 
melting from her face as she continued with the story. "Firiona Vie and Galeth 
Veredeth, protected in the power of the Mother Tunare, were of the few who survived 
the fateful battle now known as Bloody Kithicor." Pulling out her mandolin, she 
once again strummed the strings softly. The thoughtful expression on her face 
bespoke the sad memories, the blood shed, and the lives lost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sionachie relaxed and smiled then, 
though the smile never touched her eyes, and asked, "Who will buy this bard a 
drink? A story requires a drink!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bard!" called Firiona Vie. "A tale 
worthy of a drink indeed! Please, allow me to buy you whatever it is that pleases 
your palate!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sionachie looked up at Firiona, hesitated. 
Her formerly taciturn demeanor shaken briefly, she broke into a wide smile that 
this time reached her eyes and graced them with sincerest joy and unmitigated 
awe. She approached Firiona tentatively, until Firiona smiled and reached out 
toward her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sionachie, my storyteller, Tunare 
has guided me back to your side. The lady has sent me, that we might once again 
travel together." Firiona recognized the confusion that entered Sionachie's expression. 
"I can see that your memory, too, has been affected by the arrogance of the dragon-kind. 
Come with me, Sionachie, let us return to the Ring of Scale and have a reckoning."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sionachie, with wonder at Firiona, 
fell to her knees and bowed her head. "My Lady, I swear my fealty to you!" she 
cried, impassioned. "By my life and my voice, my skill and my blade, I pledge 
to fight for you and Tunare."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this, Firiona took the Life Guide, 
the Staff of Tunare, and touched Sionachie on both shoulders lightly. As she did 
this, a bright blue radiance surrounded Sionachie. The Power of Tunare, Mother 
of All, surged throughout the forest of Faydark as the bard regained her memories, 
lost to chicanery in times past. She shuddered as the memories cascaded through 
her like the sudden crescendo of a great symphony following years of silence. 
The weight of her responsibilities to Tunare, Firiona, and Norrath bent her to 
the ground.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moments passed, then Sionachie stood, 
and took her rightful place at the side of Firiona Vie as chronicler of the Paladin's 
accomplishments in Norrath. "Firiona," she said with the frank casualness shared 
by old friends, "it has been too long." She hugged her friend tightly then looked 
her in the eyes for the first time. "But what happened? The Ring of Scale, it 
was your promise to them that blurred our memories? Those mud-lizards have much 
to answer for! Aye, I'll accompany you in your quest, you can be sure of it!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sionachie stopped, her mind still 
clearing, and said, "What of Dreezil? We must find him! We'll need his skills, 
and I think I heard he had gotten himself in a little trouble over in Qeynos."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two walked off together as Sionachie's 
musical voice trailed away, plotting and planning a daring rescue.</font></p>
