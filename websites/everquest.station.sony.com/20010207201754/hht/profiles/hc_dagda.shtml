<p class="header" align="center"><b><font size="4" color="ff9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="header">Dagda 
Icefury</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dagda is a strong woman, 
firmly rooted in the physical world. She is most comfortable dealing with things 
she can touch, hear, and smell. A follower of The Tribunal, she believes in the 
tenants of absolute justice, but, for the most part, has little use for the gods. 
The realms of spirit and magic are best left to those who have the time to worry 
about such intangible things. The extent of her mystical experiences consist of 
a single dream she received from Tunare, though she never knew nor cared about 
its source, that foretold her meeting the gnomes, Ognit and Dabner. Other than 
this, she has found that obstacles are best met head-on where she can see them 
face to face, smell their breath, and hear the crunch of their bones. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dagda saved the gnomes Ognit 
and Dabner in Everfrost many years ago when raiders attacked them. She has grown 
very fond of, and indeed loves, them both. She respects them for their inherent 
mystical and spiritual abilities, but she is keenly aware of their physical frailties. 
She vowed to defend them both, and does so with the ferocity of a bear defending 
her cubs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dagda is by no means simple, 
and is truly a genius in the realm of tactics and combat. She is literate enough 
to read the common tongue with little difficulty, and speaks both the common tongue 
and her native tongue fluently. Her knowledge of other languages is generally 
limited to curses and taunts, of which she has gathered quite an arsenal. She 
generally communicates in a short and very direct fashion, leaving no room for 
misinterpretations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dagda knows that Ognit is 
very intelligent and respects his knowledge, though she sometimes questions its 
use. She is most impressed and thoroughly fascinated by his ability to tinker 
and create wondrous things. Indeed, this is the medium through which she can relate 
to him best. The useful objects he builds allow her to perform any number of tasks, 
so useful, in fact, that she thinks he would be better off giving up the study 
of wizardry to become a full-time tinker. After all, it's just fine to call down 
the very fire of Fennin Ro upon the mighty Glacier Bear at 300 yards, but when 
it is mauling your head off it's of little use. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dagda shares a healthy sibling-like 
rivalry with Ognit. Being an accomplished tactician, she is aware of the simple 
fact that at a distance Ognit would have the clear advantage, and would win were 
they to ever do battle. However, she also knows that if she got her hands upon 
him, she would be the victor. Despite being quick to anger at times-and she and 
Ognit have often exchanged heated words-Dagda would never raise a hand against 
either of the gnomes she has sworn to protect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dagda views Dabner in a 
much different light. She has on countless occasions felt his healing touch as 
a cleric. For one who is so firmly rooted in the phycial world, it is for her 
a wonder to watch wounds disappear. She sees him as a very simple, yet very compassionate 
and loving soul. She loves him as a brother, and treats him in a somewhat patronizing 
manner. She would never consider speaking an unkind word to him, nor will she 
tolerate those that might. She is aware of, and also a bit saddened by, a crush 
Dabner has upon her. Dabner is simply too short for her tastes. She would much 
prefer a man of might with whom she would not worry. However, as a warrior she 
respects his raw courage in battle and his unfailing loyalty to his friends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though she is closest to 
the gnomes, Dagda also shares a strong respect for her companions. It is Firiona 
Vie, Sir Jevik, and Thubr Axebringer she most deeply admires. They are all mighty 
warriors in her eyes. She acknowledges the skills of the rogue Dreezil Pocketdip, 
and views him as a skilled fighter. His ways of stealth are an effective way of 
dealing with his natural halfling handicaps in her eyes. Though she is not a warrior 
and not as skilled as the others with a sword, the bard Sionachie is a valuable 
asset to the group. Her rousing battle songs inspire a zeal that makes combat 
that much more exciting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the wizard Al'Kabor, 
Dagda has little love. Respecting the immense power he wields, she has a healthy 
fear of him. After his recent threats against Ognit, however, her opinion of him 
has since plummeted.</font></p>
