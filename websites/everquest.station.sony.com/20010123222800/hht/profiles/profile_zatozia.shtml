<p>- The Birth - </p>
<p>When Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, abducted the High Elf King and Queen from 
city of Takish Hiz, he imprisoned them on the Plane of Hate where he tortured 
and broke them, recreating them according to his own design. The Dark Elves were 
born and deposited into Nektulos Forest to spread their hatred throughout Norrath. 
</p>
<p>Innoruuk, not trusting the race he created long ago from peaceful High Elves, 
decided he needed to create a being that he could be sure that would be full of 
hatred. He gathered bones of the many victims off the ground. The Dark Prince 
then pulled several pieces of hair from his head, and used them to connect the 
bones. Once the bones were connected, he used his fingers to cut flesh from his 
own body and wrapped it around cold bones. He placed this mold of hatred onto 
a long table and began to gather his priests for a resurrection ceremony. </p>
<p>The Clerics of Innoruuk formed a circle around the table and held one hand 
over the table. Innoruuk cut a finger off each of the clerics and the blood poured 
into body. He then cut a slice into one of his own fingers and watched the blood 
flow into the body. He picked up some torches off the ground and burned this mold 
with the flames. The flesh began to attach itself to the bones and formed a layer 
of skin. After the flesh was complete, The Prince picked up this being and rinsed 
it off in a pool of blood and placed it back on the table. The Clerics started 
casting the spell resurrection on the body. Innoruuk then cast a chilling spell 
on it, which froze the skin turned it deep blue. </p>
<p>The being rose up from the table and opened its eyes. Innoruuk placed black 
plated armor on it and gave it the two torches that he had used to form the skin. 
With the blood of the Clerics and Innoruuk's blood flowing through the body, this 
creature would become a superior Cleric of hatred with high resurrection skills 
to bring back the hated dead. He called this being Zatozia and told her that she 
was to torture followers of Marr as well as any others that had peace in their 
hearts. </p>
<p>Thus, the Birth of Zatozia the Torturess</p>
<p> -Chamber of Torture- </p>
<p>Deep within the Plane of Hate is an area from which there is no return. </p>
<p>As you enter, you see dark dreary walls with bloodstains dripping down them. 
You can almost make out scratches on the wall that says, "HELP ME!!!" You hear 
a voice whisper "The Shadows of Darkness will come for you. You have been marked!" 
</p>
<p>As you walk farther in, you wonder why you are burning for 200 points of damage 
with each step. You look down and find that you are sinking into a pit of fire 
hotter than any lava you've ever seen. </p>
<p>You finally manage to jump out onto a ground of slime that causes you to slip 
down a ramp of toxic fluid. You fall for 500 points of damage into a room. Above, 
you see the chute from which you came. Below, you see wet blood and skeleton bones, 
and a long staff with a crystalline tip. Four barred walls with no exit cage you. 
</p>
<p>As you stand in this cage-like cubical room, you start hearing screams in the 
distance. The sounds of dripping blood and cold winds trickle through the halls. 
All of a sudden, you see a faint shadow in the dark mist filled air with glimmering 
lights. You hear the footsteps bringing this figure closer as you move to the 
back wall. </p>
<p>The image of torches can finally be seen as this figure comes out of the shadows. 
It is a Dark Elf female wearing a black suit of armor and fresh blood on the boots 
from walking through pools of victims. </p>
<p>She reaches for a lever on the wall and pushes it down. The barred walls lift 
up as chains drop down and cuff your arms. You try to break loose but are unsuccessful. 
Chains come up from the floor and cuff your legs. </p>
<p>As she takes a step forward, she points her torches toward you and flames shoot 
out slowing burning you with agonizing pain. She raises her torches and begins 
to turn a wheel, which stretches your arms and legs farther. As the cuffs get 
tighter around your wrist and ankles, you can feel sharp metal spikes push their 
way through your skin. You scream as loud as your pain-filled body will allow, 
but to no avail. She lowers her torches toward you once more and the flames begin 
to burn what's left of your pitiful flesh. </p>
<p>As the last drops of blood drip from your body, she smiles with an evil grin 
and says, "The Shadows of Darkness are before you." </p>
