<font face="helvetica" color="#C0C0C0" size="-1">Thank you for your interest in the EverQuest beta testing. The EverQuest beta is broken up into several phases, the fourth of which (Phase Three) began in early November '98. Phase Four will be open to all those who applied at a small fee.<p></font>

<strong><font face="helvetica" size="-1">Some Questions and Answers </font></strong></p>

<font face="helvetica" color="#C0C0C0" size="-1">
<font size="-1" color="#FFFFFF"><i>What phase of beta testing are you at currently?</i></font></p>
Phase 3 will officially end February 9th, with Phase 4 beginning the day after and continuing until shortly before commercial release on March 16th.</p>

<font size="-1" color="#FFFFFF"><i>Do I get to keep my beta character with all stats and items intact when the commercial version ships?</i></font></p>
This really hasn't been determined yet -- probably not, however we are planning on rewarding beta testers in the game after the commercial version ships. Keep in mind, though, that we also need to make sure that all things are fair for those who did not participate in the beta.</p>

<font size="-1" color="#FFFFFF"><i>How much will the beta CD cost? </i></font></p>
The CD costs $4.95, which is being charged to cover manufacturing, shipping, and handling.</p>

<font size="-1" color="#FFFFFF"><i>Will there be certain incentives in beta for reporting bugs to the GM's? Perhaps a reward (in-game or out) if a tester meets a certain bug report quota?</i></font></p>
The incentive will be that if a tester does not report bugs, they won't be a tester for long. Closed testing in EQ will not be an opportunity to play the game for free, but rather it will involve people making commitments to help us debug and balance the game, and those failing to meet those commitments will not be testers for very long. </p>

<font size="-1" color="#FFFFFF"><i>Will you be expanding the world during the test, or will bug issues and other things take precedent over it?</i></font></p>
Both.</p>

<font size="-1" color="#FFFFFF"><i>How severe will the NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) be? For example, can we maintain journals of our beta adventures if we do not make specific technical references or include pictures?</i></font></p>
The NDA for the first few phases had to be very strict, which meant no information regarding the game ccould be published without permission. The NDA will be lifted when Phase 4 begins.</font></p>
