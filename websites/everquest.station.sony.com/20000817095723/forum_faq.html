<p>FAQ stands for "Frequently Asked Questions".  The purpose of this FAQ is to provide answers for subjects that are frequently posed in EverQuest forums by the players of the game.  The focus of the FAQ will be persistent issues, or, things that are not likely to change.  Transient issues, or issues that are temporary or subject to change from day to day, will not be covered in this document, but will instead be discussed within the official EverQuest forums.  In order to establish some guidelines for posting within Official EverQuest Forums, the first part of this FAQ relates directly to conduct and etiquette on the boards.  It is important that everyone adhere to the rules of the board in order for them to serve their purpose.</p>

<p>This FAQ will typically not cover issues that are considered "class-specific" in nature.  Class-specific issues are typically extremely volatile and inflammatory, resulting in situations for which there can be no completely agreeable resolution.  There is always one more argument that can be made either for greater advantages or for lesser disadvantages for a specific class.  Instead, when addressing issues of this nature within this document, steps will be taken to insure that the response is broad enough so that it applies to most or all players, regardless which class they play.</p>

<a name="1.0"></a><h4>1.0 Official EverQuest Forums</h4>

<p>This section of the FAQ is primarily concerned with the Official EverQuest forums, and the conduct that is considered appropriate and inappropriate when posting to those forums.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is the purpose of the Official EverQuest forums?</p>

<p>The Official EverQuest Forums exist as a place for EverQuest players to gather and discuss issues related to EverQuest.  Some forums (e.g. Customer Service, General Discussion, Quality Assurance) are visited frequently by official representatives regularly, and serve as a place for players to communicate with some of the various EverQuest teams (e.g. Development, QA, and Customer Service).  These forums allow us, as developers, the opportunity to discuss issues that the players feel are important.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Who may post on the Official EverQuest Forums?</p>

<p>In the initial implementation, "Customer Service / Technical Help" will be open to the public.  While anyone may read all of the forums, the remaining forums will only allow posts from active EverQuest account holders.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Why is posting to the Official EverQuest Forums restricted?</p>

<p>While we would like to keep posting open to everyone regardless of their account status, in the past, the official EverQuest forums have had some problems maintaining a suitable posting environment due to the relative anonymity of the posters.  With little to no tangible reason to keep posting behavior in check, some posters took advantage of the anonymity provided by the forums to post often vulgar and otherwise inappropriate material on the boards.</p>

<p>As EverQuest is a family game, with people of all ages participating in the gaming community, we as developers have a responsibility to maintain a suitable environment to the best of our ability.  The only way to accomplish this goal in regards to the Official Forums is to reduce the relative anonymity of the forums, thus allowing us to eject posters who post material that is inappropriate for public consumption.</p>

<p class="question">Q: I'm concerned about security of my account.  If I must log in with a valid Station Name to post, doesn't that give someone half of the key needed to hack my account?</p>

<p>No.  Though you will be logging in (through a secure connection) with your valid station name and password, the station name will not be displayed.  Instead, entirely within our local network, the Station login server will connect to the registered account database and obtain the "Chat Handle".  This is a unique identifier that you chose when creating your EverQuest account.</p>

<p>All posts made to the board in restricted forums will display your "Chat Handle" rather than your "Station Name".  Should you wish to change your Chat Handle, you can do so within the EverQuest chat server.  Type #help within the chat server for a list of commands.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What are the rules for posting in these forums?</p>

<p>As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The Station, posting to these forums is bound by The Station's Terms of Service that can be found in their entirety at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml</a>.  In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that apply to the EverQuest Forums.</p>

<p>In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting.  This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game.  We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum.</p>

<p>You may not, however, post any material that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate the idea, but do not turn your disagreement into an attack upon the poster.</li>
<li>Engages in name-calling, harassment, or threats.  See above.</li>
<li>Contains obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity.  Though we do have a filter in place to catch the unintentional obscenity from time to time, this is not a license to abuse it.</li>
<li>Disparages any religion, race, nation, gender, or sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Is considered inappropriate for children 13 or over as governed by general standards of decency in the United States.</li>
<li>Infringes on anyone's privacy rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting attention paid to your issue.</li>
<li>Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to another thread on a different subject.</li>
<li>Monopolize the front page of any forum by "bumping" threads of the same or similar content to the front.  We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs.</li>
<li>Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest within the game (e.g. Sit-ins).</li>
<li>Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of EverQuest characters or items in exchange for real-world money.</li>
<li>Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, the EverQuest EULA, or the Station Terms of Service.</li>
<li>Advertise products or websites that are not related to EverQuest or other Verant/Sony Online Entertainment products.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">Q: What happens if these rules are broken?</p>

<p>Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on the Official EverQuest Forums will vary depending upon the transgression.  It could include any number of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing of the post.</li>
<li>Deletion of the post/thread.</li>
<li>Closing of the thread.</li>
<li>Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest for the duration of the suspension).</li>
<li>Banishment (results in the user's station account being canceled.  User will no longer be able to access EverQuest, or any Official EverQuest Forum).</li>
<li>Legal Action (I.e. Contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a threat.)</li>
</ul>
<p>People who violate the rules of the boards may or may not receive any warning before any action is taken.  In the event that a warning is given, the warning will be recorded upon the game account and may result in further action should the player show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct.  Philosophically and administratively, there is no difference between conduct in game, and conduct in the Official EverQuest Forums.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Ok, we know what we shouldn't do, what should we do?</p>

<p>Give your posts some thought, and try to be courteous and respectful.  Disagreeing with someone does not mean that you have to be anything less than courteous in your dealings.  Read over what you plan on posting before hitting the "Submit" button, and imagine how you would feel if the post was aimed at you.  Would you be personally offended?  If so, you should consider rephrasing the post or canceling it altogether.</p>

<a name="2.0"></a><h4>2.0 Customer Service Questions</h4>

<p>Everyone needs help once in a while, making customer service an issue important to all.  Included in this section are some of the more common questions that we see in regards to the Customer Service Department.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  What is the purpose of GMs and Guides in game?</p>

<p>GMs and Guides provide the in-game customer support for EverQuest.  The primary functions of a CSRep in-game could be categorized under the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative Functions</li>
<li>Disciplinary Functions</li>
<li>Gameplay Functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Administrative Functions include things such as creating guilds, answering questions, handling reimbursement requests, etc.  Disciplinary Functions include the investigation and arbitration of issues surrounding the actions of a player in regards to a CSRep or another player.  Gameplay Functions include organizing quests and events for the servers.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Under what circumstances can a GM or Guide assist me in game?</p>

<p>An all-inclusive list of every situation in which a CSRep can assist you in game would be impossible to list.  However, in general, CSReps are there to help you when you need something that is not a normal function of the game.  This includes assistance if you encounter a verifiable bug that somehow hampers your gameplay experience.</p>

<p>CSReps are not there to provide gameplay hints, or any service that can be performed by another player.  See the GM/Guide FAQ available off of the EverQuest Web Site.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Assuming that I can't get in game, or have a billing or technical support issue, what other customer-service options are available to me?</p>

<p>If you are having difficulty getting into game, our Customer Service Representatives are available to assist by either phone or by email. We can be reached by phone Monday - Friday 8:30 am - 5:30 pm PT (4:30 pm - 1:30 am GMT) by calling 1-888-STATION (888-782-8466) or for local and international customers, 1-858-537-0898. In addition to calling, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> for general issues or to <a href="mailto:eqtech@verant.com">eqtech@verant.com</a> for technical issues.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  If I am suspended or banned from the game, what level of contact concerning my case can I expect?</p>

<p>If you are suspended or banned from playing EverQuest, you will receive notification in game or via email if you are off-line. If you believe you received your suspension or banning unjustly, you may send an email to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> and your matter will be reviewed. Be sure to include all information necessary to process the investigation, such as your station name, character name, the server you play on, and the incident that occurred.</p>

<a name="3.0"></a><h4>3.0 The Vision</h4>

<p>Our vision for the game comes up quite regularly on the EverQuest Official forums.  Some of the more frequent questions can be found in this section.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  When reading about EverQuest on the net, people often make reference to "The Vision".  What is that?</p>

<p>Just about every project has some sort of plan or vision behind it.  Either a person or a group of people typically come together, discuss their common goals, and create a game plan.  EverQuest is no exception.</p>

<p>In March of 1996 Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover were hired by John Smedley, then Director of Development of Sony Interactive Studios, to design and implement a massively multiplayer RPG.  Brad and Steve, both avid MUD players, decided to attempt to capture the fun and compelling aspects of MUDs, including the lessons learned and the core systems developed over the years, and to combine them with a 3D graphical engine in order to create a mainstream commercial game.  They also wanted to recapture the comradery and teamwork they'd experienced playing paper and pencil RPGs in years past around the table with their friends.  To this end they wrote the original design document and decided upon several core fundamental tenets; for example, that EverQuest would primarily be a PvE (Player vs. Environment) game with optional and restricted PvP (Player vs. Player), and that EverQuest would be a game focused on cooperation and interdependence built upon a class system where grouping with others was heavily encouraged.</p>

<p>Over time the EverQuest team grew from two people to over thirty.  Team members from all different backgrounds joined, including game designers well versed in MUDs, paper and pencil RPGs, and single player computer RPGs.  Bill Trost, who became the lead designer on EverQuest, joined the team early on and set out to create a fantasy world that was original in both origin and content but also filled with familiar creatures and locales from traditional High Fantasy.   He and many other game designers developed rich story lines, intricate quests, and a wide variety of people and places with which to interact.  A revolutionary faction system was also developed to replace a more simplistic alignment system.  Late in development, a Trade Skills system was added to the design in order to appeal to players who wanted to involve themselves with non-combat oriented activities.</p>

<p>In the three years that it took to develop EverQuest, and in the time since March 16, 1999, that it's been commercially online, many aspects of the game have changed.  Many enhancements, alterations, and additions have been made to the world that is Norrath.  But the vision, the original purpose and goal, has been maintained.  John Smedley, a 10+ year veteran of game development, once commented that the end result that was EverQuest more closely resembled its original design document than any other project he'd experienced.  The EverQuest team is very proud of this fact and firmly believes that sticking to a vision, especially within an ever-evolving persistent online game, is key (along with passion, talent, and dedication) to creating a truly great game.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why does the game need a vision?</p>

<p>Vision is focus.  Without focus a project will usually lose consistency.  All games need a vision prior to release - it keeps the team together and focused, and it ensures that the tendency of a group of creative people to go off on wild tangents (which often threatens a product's completion) is kept in check.</p>

<p>A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), however, is more than a product.  It is also a service, and MMOGs live on and continue to adapt and evolve after they're launched.  For this reason a vision is even more important to games like EverQuest.  Not only are more people involved in creating them, but also teams often change after release.  Customers communicate and expect changes and enhancements.  Lessons are learned and better systems and solutions are developed.  The need to remain focused lest the game change into something it's not is therefore paramount.  While adaptation, enhancement, balance, and growth are all essential MMOG ingredients, they must be kept within the original parameters of the game's design.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  If enough customers want a particular change made to a piece of software, it would behoove the company to make that change.  Why doesn't that philosophy apply to EverQuest?</p>

<p>Actually, it often does.  Customer feedback and ideas are a very important part of an MMOG.  Many of the features found in EverQuest came from customers' ideas, both back in beta testing and after commercial launch.  It is, however, the responsibility of the teams behind EverQuest to make sure that the game remains balanced and fair for all.  Realizing that EverQuest and similar games are a product, a service, and a game all in one is very important in terms of perspective.  Were it merely a product then future products that reflected a change wouldn't necessarily affect owners of the older product.  But because EverQuest is a persistent and multiplayer game, changes affect everyone. Often, a change that might benefit one customer or even a group of customers in a positive way might also affect an even larger group in a negative way.  Essentially, we must abide by the fact that in an MMOG, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.   Bottom line:  as long as the majority of customers are relatively happy with the product, the fundamentals of that product should not change.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Games change, times change, and people change.  What of the vision?</p>

<p>The vision changes and adapts as well, but its core foundation does not.  As a product and service that people bought and continue to pay for, it is our responsibility to make sure EverQuest remains EverQuest.  For example, were a company to set out to create a sports car, it would behoove them to keep making that sports car better, listening to their customers wants and desires.   But were a subset of their customer base to decide over time they'd rather have an SUV, it would probably be a bad idea to change the sports car into an SUV.  As long as enough customers wanted sports cars to make their production profitable then the company should keep producing sports cars, making sure that changes and enhancements made their product a better sports car (as opposed to something else).  Perhaps if enough of their customers also wanted an SUV they would also look into making an SUV.  But that would be a second product, not a change to the first.</p>

<p>The same logic also applies to EverQuest.  Are there things we could do to make EverQuest a better EverQuest?  Absolutely, and we continue to pursue those ideas and appreciate the feedback we get from our customers to that end.  But there are also things we could do to EverQuest to make it a different game.  Many of the ideas that we receive would do just that.  Some are good ideas, some are bad, but whether good or bad, were they implemented, EverQuest would turn into a significantly different game.  That is something we cannot allow - it would be simply be very bad business.</p>

<p>As games, times, and people change, perhaps demands and desires for MMOGs will also change.  Certainly the number of people interested and able to play MMOGs will grow.  It is Verant/Sony Online's opinion that this emerging market will allow us and others to create games in the future that are more specifically tailored to the variety of existing customer needs.  But in the meantime, given EverQuest's lead in the marketplace, its increasing sales and subscriptions, the fact that it needs to appeal to many different customers and play styles, and the importance of remaining focused, EverQuest will remain true to the original Vision and will continue to evolve and adapt into a better EverQuest.</p>

<a name="4.0"></a><h4>4.0 General Game Mechanics</h4>

<p>This section of the FAQ begins discussion on EverQuest gameplay, and the decisions that lead to certain designs in the game.  Many of these issues are considered volatile topics, and have led to strenuous debate on the Official EverQuest Forums.</p>

<a name="4.1"></a><h4>4.1 Experience</h4>

<p>There has been a good deal of debate from time to time concerning the way that the advancement system works in EverQuest.  Some support the current system, while others would prefer an alternate system.  The advancement system in EverQuest, however, is not subject to post-production changes.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why do some races and classes require more experience to level than others do?</p>

<p>When the races and classes were being laid out during the design-phase of EverQuest, it was decided that true differences would be present in both.  No one race or class should be a mere cookie-cutter of another (cf. equality), but should instead complement each other's strengths and weaknesses (cf. balance).</p>

<p>On the subject of races, since the concept of "equality" was not a goal, races were designed with strengths and weaknesses.  Ogres, for instance, excel at armed combat, while Erudites excel at magic.  Given this, some races will always be better at a certain class than another race will.  For instance, ogres will always make better warriors than gnomes.  Even though the extent to which ogres can be better warriors is limited (see the next Question), something was still needed to discourage people who wanted to play warriors from always choosing the ogre, in order to insure that classes from each race are played.  Though there are many ways to discourage everyone from choosing the same race (e.g. Faction, Size), the experience requirement is very effective.</p>

<p>On the subject of classes, much of the same applies.  Hybrids, for instance, are fairly well known to require more experience than their parent classes.  That additional experience requirement is there to discourage "everyone" from playing hybrids due to their versatility.  For instance, though a Paladin's combat skill isn't that of the warrior, it's close, and perhaps so close that a Paladin might often be a better choice than a warrior.  However, the lesser number of hitpoints, coupled with the increased experience requirement making Paladins less prolific, insure the warrior still has a place.</p>

<p>Experience requirements, much like faction, size, item availability, etc., do not contribute directly to the concept of balance, but still play an important part in insuring that the number of characters in the world is balanced.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  If my class requires more experience to level, shouldn't that mean that my character should be more powerful at a given level than that of another class which requires less experience to level?</p>

<p>No.  Back before EverQuest was in beta, one of the things that people were asking for on the public boards was for a class that required "4 or 5 times" the experience of other classes, but was ultra-powerful.  Though that may sound good on the surface, there will always be people who have the time to put in that 4 or 5 times more effort.  When these people who have that extra time finally reach the max-level, they would be so powerful that they would nullify the need for some other class, if not the need of several.</p>

<p>Even today, some people, with the help of friends or multiple accounts, can level a current class to 50 in a matter of a few played-days.  People have a reasonable expectation that at any given level, their class should be useful for something.  The mere existence of a super-powerful class, even with the extra experience requirement, would not be enough of a deterrent to insure that the particular class doesn't overwhelm the existing class-interdependence scheme.</p>

<p>Additional experience requirements are there, plainly, to give people a reason to choose some of the less powerful race/class combos.  As mentioned in the previous question, it is not a direct component of balance, but rather a minor contributor.  Though the difference in power is not tremendous for the reasons mentioned above, it exists, even to its minor extent, to the point that something was needed.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  What is done to keep those who require more experience to level from being unfairly penalized at death?</p>

<p>Experience loss upon death, for all classes, is based upon the experience that a human warrior would require for the previous level.  This has the effect of making classes that require less experience lose a larger amount of experience, relative to the experience required for the current level, than classes that require more experience overall.</p>

<p>It is set up this way so differing experience requirements don't translate to a double-jeopardy situation in death.  For instance, if experience loss on death was based as a percentage of current experience, hybrids, which require more experience to level, would lose more experience on death, and also take longer to make it back up.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  How is experience dealt out when in a group?  Why?</p>

<p>Experience is dealt out within the group based upon the amount of experience required for the current level, non-linear levels excepted.  It is set up in such a fashion that most race/class combos in a group, regardless of level assuming that they are all capable of getting experience given the current group makeup, will level at a similar rate.</p>

<p>It was set up in this fashion so that a group of friends playing the game, and always playing together, could maintain a groupable level-range regardless of their race/class choices.  Surely the downside of this design is that someone playing a high-requirement class will take more experience while in the group, causing the whole group to level slower.  However, since the additional requirement is shared by all in the group, the overall impact is probably in the neighborhood of a few percentage points to any one particular person.  It is certainly not a large enough difference that anyone should choose to exclude someone from a group on the basis of them playing a high-requirement race or class.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why do some levels require more experience than would seem normal?</p>

<p>The amount of experience required for advancement is not linear.  Some levels require more experience than would seem normal if the scale is assumed to be linear in nature.   This isn't a correct assumption.</p>

<p>The amount of experience required to level is based off of 4 values:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Level</li>
<li>The Racial Modifier</li>
<li>The Class Modifier</li>
<li>The Level Range Modifier</li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers are manipulated in an internal proprietary algorithm that determines the amount of experience required to level.  Though the RM and CM are constants, and the "Level" itself is linear, the LRM is not linear in nature, but rather moves in steps based upon the level range.  The end result is that the levels where the LRM increases require more experience than would seem appropriate were the system linear in nature.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it is quite possible that we should have made the formula such that the additional experience required by the LRM was spread over every level in the particular range in order to keep in line with customer expectations.  However, the experience required in the end would remain the same.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why, when dying in some levels, do you seem to lose more experience than would seem normal?</p>

<p>Experience loss on death is based entirely off of the amount of experience that was required for a human warrior to earn in the previous level.  Due to the stepping of the LRM mentioned in the previous question, dying in the level AFTER the step of the LRM will result in a greater experience loss.  Again, this is another situation where perhaps we should have spread the requirement across the level range, however the end result would be the same.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why does experience-loss even exist?</p>

<p>EverQuest is a game.  Games of this nature present challenges that must be overcome in order to reach an objective.  Though no one will ever "win" EverQuest, the concept of challenges and objectives are very much a part of the game.  Whatever your objective is in the game, whether it is reaching max level, obtaining a new item, or becoming a master baker, there are challenges over which you must prevail.  A challenge, in the context of a game, must have some risk in order for the objective to be meaningful.  For instance, who prizes a sword, regardless of its power, that can be bought off a vendor for a mere copper?v

<p>Challenges in EverQuest typically require both effort and risk.  Certainly there are situations that require a great deal of effort with little risk, and vice versa, but over all it remains a system of effort and risk.  The effort, in this case, is the time that you spend attempting to accomplish your objective.  The risk is the prospect of failure, being the experience, items, etc. that you might lose should you fail in your challenge.</p>

<p>Three things determine the final value of the objective:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inherent value of the reward.</li>
<li>The effort invested obtaining the reward.</li>
<li>The potential risk absorbed, whether realized or not, when attempting to overcome the challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final value of the objective is based upon its availability and its usefulness, which translates respectively to supply and demand.  An item (the objective in this case) that is very available and not very useful has a low value, whereas a highly useful item in low availability has a high value.  The "usefulness" of the objective is the inherent value of the reward itself, whereas its availability is tied to the effort and risk.  An item of high inherent value is also very useful, with the only thing to be determined is its availability.</p>

<p>As you can see, the value of any objective is tied closely to the potential risk that was absorbed when attempting the challenge.  Overcoming challenges and achieving objectives are widely agreed to be "fun" in games.  Since there can be no value in an objective if there is no challenge, and since there is no challenge if there is no risk, and since both challenges and objectives are necessary for there to be "fun", there must be risk for the sake of "fun".</p>

<p>Experience loss on death is the potential risk that is necessary for the game to be "fun".</p>

<p class="question">Q:  But experience loss is frustrating and not very much fun!</p>

<p>Precisely.  Realizing a risk is never fun.  It wouldn't be a risk if it were.  The fruits of a risk are by their nature something that you do not want to encounter.  It's the potential of realizing that risk, and then overcoming the challenge to reach the objective that is fun.</p>

<p>This is why the game provides many ways for the player to reduce their potential risk should they endeavor to do so, but not so many ways or to the extent that the risk itself would be nullified without likewise nullifying the objective itself. Players choose, for the most part, what risks that they wish to encounter.  They choose, for the most part, whether they wish to encounter those risks with or without the amenities necessary to reduce that risk.</p>

<p>The amount of risk absorbed by a player is almost entirely within their hands. The goal for us is to make sure that the inherent value of the reward is worth the potential risk in more cases than not.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  I still don't like the way experience is handled in any of these cases, what would it take to get you to change it?</p>

<p>Divine intervention.  The experience system in EverQuest, including the formulae used to determine advancement rates, race/class advancement modifiers, level range modifiers, nonlinear progression, and everything else related in this section, are not subject to post-production changes.</p>

<a name="4.2"></a><h4>4.2 Soloing</h4>

<p>The subject of soloing in EverQuest comes up quite often on the Official EverQuest boards, so often in fact that a section dedicated to it was appropriate for this FAQ.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  What is "Soloing"?</p>

<p>"Soloing" is the process of fighting or otherwise advancing in game without the assistance of other players or a group.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Is soloing possible in EverQuest?</p>

<p>Certainly you may, however one should expect that solo players should not be able to go everywhere and do everything like a sufficiently balanced and talented group could.  EverQuest is built primarily as a group-oriented game, and encounters, especially at more advanced stages, are geared specifically towards groups.  Some encounters are even expected to take multiple groups in order to be conquered.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some classes are more suited to soloing than others, and the ability of any particular class to solo may change as that class advances in levels.  Typically, soloable classes (classes having the ability to solo), are designed to be more self-sufficient in game.  However, due to their versatility, they are often less masterful at any particular aspect of their abilities then classes that are designed to be group-centric.  This can often make them less desired in balanced groups where masterful classes can be found.  For instance, the necromancer and druid, highly regarded as the "best soloing classes", are typically not among the top most desirable classes for a group, whereas the Cleric, the master of healing, has little soloing ability, but is greatly desired in a group.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, even the most soloable classes will not be able to go everywhere, do and acquire everything, without the assistance of a group.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why does EverQuest promote grouping over soloing?</p>

<p>We firmly believe that the vast majority of players choose to play Massively Multiplayer Online Games due to the endless possibilities that come with the prospect of interacting with other people.  These players will usually have a tendency to form "groups", even if the gaming engine itself doesn't provide that option.  Once formed into groups, if the game is not designed to handle them, there is little challenge left in the game, as they can move through any designed encounter with ease.  The end result is that this majority garners less entertainment from the game and is less likely to enjoy it for a long term.</p>

<p>Still, we recognize that there are those who prefer the ability to "solo", even in a multiplayer universe, which is why we provide classes that are capable of the feat.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  I think every class should be able to solo and make progress.  Why isn't this the case?</p>

<p>Once every class is given the ability to solo, the game is no longer oriented towards groups, and the problem illustrated in the last question comes to fruition.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  How about zones or creatures that don't allow grouping, but where everyone has the ability to solo?</p>

<p>Such zones would not be consistent within the gaming world, and present the same problems mentioned above.  We certainly have zones where "soloing" is supported more than others (e.g. Outdoor zones), however the focus in this case will remain upon the classes that are designed for soloing.</p>

<p>Having a warrior, a class highly regarded for their value in groups and their inability to solo at advanced levels, suddenly become more powerful for the purpose of fighting in a "solo only" zone wouldn't make sense in the world we have built.</p>

<a name="4.3"></a><h4>4.3 New Proposed Server Rulesets</h4>

<p>As people find aspects of the game that particularly interest them more than others, it is not an infrequent occurrence for an alternate server ruleset to be suggested.  The ideas and drives behind these alternate rulesets vary, but the end result is the suggested enhancement of the game for a niche of players.  Below, a few of the more common suggested rulesets are addressed.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How about a "Roleplay" server?</p>

<p>It is frequently suggested that we set up an alternate server ruleset called a "Roleplay" server.  Though the format of the server differs from suggestion to suggestion, the result that is aimed for by the proponents of this suggestion is a world where everyone plays their character from an in-character perspective, rather than by projecting their own identity upon the character being played.</p>

<p>Though we like to encourage "roleplay" in every form possible, building an alternate server ruleset to "enforce" the concept of roleplay would be a difficult if not impossible venture.  The diversity of our playerbase is such that there are many different definitions of "roleplay" out there, most of which are subjective.  It would be fair to say that roleplay is in the eye of the beholder.  Another player might not consider what one person considers roleplaying as such.  This makes the idea of consistently "enforcing" roleplay to the satisfaction of a large number of people a truly insurmountable task.</p>

<p>The choice to roleplay is a personal one.  We provide the world, rife with possibilities, from which you can develop the character that you choose to play.  We provide the races, political alignments, complex interactions and ideals  that form the depth of the game beyond the graphical layout.  In short, we provide a level of diversity yet to be matched in any game to date.  These things exist on all servers, regardless of ruleset, to promote roleplay throughout the game.  Given this environment, people are given the ability to choose to roleplay, and encourage others to do so as well.</p>

<p>Though we understand the desire to deal exclusively with people who likewise support the same or similar definition of roleplay, it would not be fair of us to embrace and attempt to enforce any particular definition.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How about an "Easy Advancement" server?</p>

<p>Another common suggestion that we hear is that for a server ruleset where everything (e.g. Levels, cash, and items) is easier to acquire.  The idea here is that a segment of the populace, known as the casual player, can only play a few hours per week and should be entitled to the same things that a person playing forty, eighty, or one hundred hours per week.</p>

<p>The difficulty here is that the definition of "casual player" differs as greatly as that of "roleplaying".  Some people who play but 10 hours per week suggest that the server be centered around that value, while others who play 40 hours per week still consider themselves casual players and feel that the bar should be there.  It is probably a given that if you are reading this FAQ, there is someone out there who not only plays the game more than you do, but also someone else who plays less.</p>

<p>The "average" EverQuest player plays the game around 15-20 hours per week, and it is at that range that advancement and acquisition in EverQuest is centered.  One of the things that people enjoy about EverQuest is that development of the character takes time and energy, and is in that fashion earned.  Shifting game dynamics on a new server ruleset to the point that a 10 hour per week player can expect everything that a 100 hour per week player can in the same calendar period would change the very core of EverQuest.  It would quite possibly eliminate one of the things about the game that people enjoy most.</p>

<p>One of the prerequisites of any alternate server ruleset is that it must not change the core dynamics of the game.  The "easy advancement" server would not be able to meet that requirement.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How about a "NODROP" server?</p>

<p>Another alternate server ruleset that is suggested frequently is a "NODROP" server.  Though the specifics vary slightly from suggestion to suggestion, the idea is that items that are in demand should be NODROP in nature, not allowing trade between players.  The main reason that this subject comes up is in regards to "Twinking" (See "Twinking" below).  Players often dislike seeing other players in out-of-level gear that they obviously didn't earn on their own.  Though the impact of twinking is minimal due to the nature with which game mechanics treat the occurrence, the visible result of twinking is not desirable to those players.</p>

<p>Though a NODROP server would certainly address these concerns, we feel that trading, or specifically, the ability to trade, builds the sense of community in game.  It also helps casual players obtain weapon and equipment that they otherwise wouldn't have the time to obtain.  Trade in the game, though it allows twinking, is so important in regards to the server community that we would not want to engage in limiting it to the extent created by a NODROP server ruleset.</p>

<a name="4.4"></a><h4>4.4 Twinking</h4>

<p>As long as multiplayer games exist, the debate over twinking will rage.  Each game chooses to handle the problem in a different matter, but the question still remains, is there a problem to be solved?</p>

<p class="question">Q:  What is "Twinking"?</p>

<p>"Twinking" is an old MUD that refers to the giving of "out of level" items, items that one character could never hope to obtain at their level of advancement, for the purpose of speeding advancement.  For instance, giving a newbie character a sword from a dragon would be considered "Twinking".</p>

<p>In EverQuest, the term also applies to providing a character "out of level" support in order to speed their leveling, such as by having a high-level cleric "babysit" a lower level character.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Is it allowed? Why?</p>

<p>As game designers, we are aware that players seek any advantage available in order to get a "leg up".  It has been the nature of massively-multiplayer games since their earliest manifestation.  It is with this in mind that EverQuest was built.  Since we recognize the issue, that being that people will always desire to "pass down" items from higher-level characters to lower-level characters, we chose to remain more or less neutral on the subject as long as it doesn't unbalance the game.</p>

<p>The idea on our side was to present an environment where a "twinked" character is not so much better off than an "untwinked" character, that the "untwinked" character has a problem getting groups.</p>

<p>Given that the only way to truly stop "twinking" is to put level-limits on everything, we moved forward with limiting its effect.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why not just put hard level-limits on everything?</p>

<p>It has been suggested on more than one occasion that we should put hard level-limits on items so that twinking will not occur.  These level limits would restrict characters that had not achieved a certain level of expertise from even equipping the items.  This is a decidedly artificial mechanism, one that we decided not to pursue.</p>

<p>Hard level-limits assumes that we have some fool-proof way to insure that items are won fairly at a certain level, and not before that level.  Since players surprise us daily on their skill within the game, it is reasonable to assume that players would surprise us with the level that they could obtain items legitimately.  Hard level-limits on items cheat those who obtain items a few levels before we thought they should be able, keeping them from using their reward for sometime after the event where they obtained it.</p>

<p>For this reason it was decided that hard level-limits on items would never be a part of EverQuest as long as another solution existed to keep the effects of twinking managed.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  What is the solution that was decided?</p>

<p>Soft level-limits.  A character using an item far above what they should have access to, based on the stats of the item rather than a per-item basis, will not get full use out of the item.  That is to say that a level 5 character wielding and wearing the best items in the game is not that much better off than the level 5 character wielding and wearing items that are appropriate.</p>

<p>In addition to soft-level limits on items, we found that hard level-limits were necessary item effects, as well as items of a planar class.  We handled effects directly with a level limit, and handled planar items indirectly by restricting access to the planes and making the items NODROP.</p>

<p>These measures insure that item twinking is more of a visual problem rather than a problem with game mechanics.  The end result is that while some people still do not enjoy the prospect of looking at a low level character wearing high-level gear, the difference in efficiency created by this issue is small enough that it really doesn't affect the game world.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  But what of spell-twinking (cf. babysitting)?</p>

<p>This is an issue that proved much more difficult to control.  With the number of different ways that people should be able to interact effectively, the only way to place any limits on spell-twinking was reduce the level of interaction that people could engage in based upon level.  We decided that in this case we would choose the lesser of two evils and remain hands-off on the subject.  Spell-twinking really only affects the recipient, causing them to level faster than others.  It does not present a situation where one character is invalidated because another is being spell-twinked.</p>

<p>The one exception that we made to this laissez-faire policy was to place level limits on beneficial spells obtained post level 50.  Our maximum spell power that we allowed for the 1-50 portion of the game was based upon the damage that could be done by spell-twinking.  We could not let beneficial spells get any more powerful without somehow limiting their use.</p>

<a name="4.5"></a><h4>4.5 Binding</h4>

<p class="question">Q: What is "Binding"?</p>

<p>"Binding" is the term used to describe the process of resetting the location that a character will "respawn" following death.  It is also the same location to which a player will be returned when using the spell "gate".  Binding is performed through the use of the spell "Bind Affinity" which can be cast by any pure caster or pure priest class.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Who can do it, and where?</p>

<p>Generally, casters can bind themselves anywhere, and melee players can only be bound within locations defined as "cities".  There are some notable exceptions, zones that do not allow binding, even by casters binding themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kunark Dungeons</li>
<li>Timorous Deep</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">Q: Why can't melee players be bound anywhere?</p>

<p>The design for EverQuest called for classes having reason to depend on others.  This is one aspect of that interdependence.  Melee characters depend on casters for binding, and also depend on casters for a quick trip back to their corpse when they die.</p>

<p class="question">Q: But running back to my corpse is time-consuming!</p>

<p>And it is that running time that encourages melee characters to form relationships with those who can reduce that time.  By, for instance, grouping with a cleric or paladin who can perform a resurrection, melee characters gain the advantage of being able to rejoin combat, or at least the group, much faster.  If melee characters were able to bind anywhere, that facet of play would be much different than it is today.</p>

<p>Binding rules as they are also encourage casters to keep melee players alive even at the expense of their own life.  A melee character being involved in a run back to their corpse from a city slows down the group and takes them all out of action for a while.  Given the choice of taking a death and getting back into the action immediately, versus taking a death and having to wait 20 minutes, groups will often choose the former.  Overall, the game is more exciting due to the important need to not only overcome the current objective, but to keep melee characters alive at all cost in the process.</p>

<p class="question">Q: I'm still not happy with the way this is handled.  Is there anything we can do to change it?</p>

<p>No.  The binding rules, especially the dependence formed by melee versus caster binding, are a basic tenet of EverQuest and work very well in implementation.  Players form relationships necessary to deal with the binding rules, and overall the game is better off for this design.</p>

<a name="4.6"></a><h4>4.6 Class  Balance and Interdependence</h4>

<p>As game designers, we speak frequently of terms such as "balance", "equality", and "class interdependence".  These terms often raise issues in the official forums for which universal agreement is hard to achieve.  Nonetheless, it does make a good subject for this portion of the FAQ.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  What is "balance" and how does it differ from "equality"?</p>

<p>"Equality" refers to a state where things are identical in nature.  For instance, if I can wield a sword, and someone else can wield a sword, we are equal in that respect.  "Balance" refers to the comparison of two dissimilar ideas, concepts, or things.  A pound of feathers is balanced with a pound of bricks, yet one would hardly argue that they are "equal" in every respect.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  How does that apply to the classes in game?</p>

<p>We strive to "balance" the classes rather than make them equal.  To do this, we give them strengths and weaknesses that are hopefully complementary to the strengths and weaknesses of other classes.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why not go with "equality"?</p>

<p>This is because classes being identical to each other would destroy the goal of having a class-based system.</p>

<p>Some other games choose to use a skill-based system where any character is as likely to obtain certain skills, abilities, and items as any other character.  Over time, people tend to gravitate toward whatever combination of skills, abilities, and items are deemed to be most advantageous at that particular time.  It creates a situation where someone can end up with a "useless" character purely on the basis of choosing skills, abilities, and items, which are deemed by the playerbase as a whole to be unimportant.  The environment compels character to gravitate towards the most efficient skill-set lest they be ostracized.  The end result is that successful characters become "cookie-cutters" of every other successful character.</p>

<p>Class-based systems limit the skills, abilities, and items that any person can use on the basis of choices made at the beginning.  Furthermore, the complimentary strengths and weaknesses of each class guide people away from always choosing to play the same class.  The fact that a cleric is an excellent class, and considered immensely valuable to a group does not lead to a situation where a group of six clerics is considered the good by any means.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  But this means that some classes are more powerful than others are.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  This brings us to the point that "offensive power" is not the only measure of "balance".  It is merely one of many concepts that contribute to the "balance" of a class.  A class can be "overpowered", meaning that they are more powerful than they should be, without necessarily being "out of balance".  The inverse can also be true.  Here's a list of the major balance components.  The order that they are presented is not necessarily an indication of the weight of each concept.  In fact, the weight given to each component varies depending on the class.</p>

<p>Major balance components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Usefulness to the group</li>
<li>Versatility</li>
</ul>
<p>"Power" indicates all of the attributes, skills, abilities, and spells that help a class engage and kill the enemy.  It includes both offensive and defensive power.  For example, warriors are known for their high attributes, skills, and abilities.  They are fairly powerful, but perhaps no more "powerful" overall than the monk.  Though a warrior can stay in a fight much longer than a monk, the monk can do more damage than the warrior.</p>

<p>"Usefulness to the group" speaks of things that the class can do that is desirable and helps improve the group.  If the ability is rare or unique, it carries extra weight.  As an example, enchanters have the unique ability to improve the mana regeneration rate of others.  This is considered valuable to groups that have casters.</p>

<p>"Versatility" refers to the breadth of the abilities possessed by the class.  It is the number of different types of things that the class can do.  Versatility is a key for "soloing" in EverQuest.  For instance, Druids and Necromancers are known for their versatility, with Necromancers being more powerful, and druids being more useful to the group.</p>

<p>In addition to the major balance components, there also exist minor balancing modifiers.  These are aspects of the game that do not necessarily relate directly to the major components, however figure into the situation in some other way.  They are the way that the game is set up to interact with a particular race/class combo in order to promote the health of the game in the long run.  They cannot be traded directly for additional points in the major components, but are used to buffer or bolster the effect of higher or lower scores in those major components.</p>

<p>Minor balancing modifiers include things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater or lesser experience requirements</li>
<li>More or less faction problems</li>
<li>Racial skills and abilities</li>
<li>Better or worse availability of items</li>
<li>Availability of quests</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these issues figure in to the overall "balance" of a class.</p>

<a name="4.7"></a><h4>4.7 Graphics</h4>

<p class="question">Q:  Why aren't there more unique textures used to provide more types of armor and weapons for the existing characters?</p>

<p>Different appearances, such as those created by different looking armor or designs on weapons, are applied by laying a texture over an existing polygon.  In order for these textures to be displayed, they must be stored in the texture memory of the video card.  The available texture memory on the video card defines how many textures can be stored without swapping them to disk.  Exceeding the texture memory limitation of video cards causes excess textures to be swapped in and out of the disk, a process that causes a severe reduction in framerate.  For this reason, we limit the number of textures being stored to minimize that reduction in framerate.</p>

<p>Although the texture memory pool is limited from the standpoint of completely different textures, we do have the ability to "tint" them without requiring that more memory be used.  Tinting results in the identical texture being shaded toward a new color.  This is how we create armor of different colors.</p>

<p>Though the standard video card on the market now contains more than the 2MB of texture memory included on the standard Voodoo1 card for which EQ was originally aimed, EQ needs to continue operating correctly for those users as well.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  How about using more textures for Kunark, and other zones that require enhanced system specs?</p>

<p>We do, however those enhanced textures are limited to those available within the specific environment, such as those found on the bodies of NPCs or on world geometry itself.  Armor, or special weapons designs, require that the texture be available in all zones.  Though there is a difference in local (cf. zone-specific) or global (cf. world-specific) textures from an implementation standpoint, they all use the same texture-memory pool on the video card.  The difference is that the local textures are loaded only while in the zone itself, whereas the global ones are loaded regardless of the zone.</p>

<p>While we have the capability to used more textures within the stationary aspects of the new areas, mobile aspects, such as armor on a character, need to be part of the global texture set.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why does all of the monk armor make them look like newbies?  Can't you tint it or something?</p>

<p>Monk armor, specifically the chest piece, gives them the appearance of a few small straps covering bare tattooed skin.  While the armor appears to consist of a mere harness, it is actually the entire chest-piece, including the skin.  Tinting this armor would also cause the skin to be tinted, which would look quite unnatural in the environment.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Will the existing zone graphics ever be updated in the fashion of Kunark?</p>

<p>No.  The existing world must remain operational for those who had the system specs quoted at the time that the part of the world in question was released.  New areas are likely to be developed that will require enhanced system specs, and these will be done in the same fashion as Kunark.</p>

<a name="5.0"></a><h4>5.0 Miscellaneous Issues</h4>

<p class="question">Q:  Why isn't there a quest in game for [insert concept here]?</p>

<p>It is not unusual for us to receive queries regarding quests, and why there isn't a quest for a particular race/class combo, a quest of a particular type, or a quest for a particular area or scope.  In most cases, the answer here is that a quest of that type just hasn't been done yet.  This is not to say that we will never expand quests into these areas, just that there are so many areas and concepts deserving of additional attention concerning quests that they can't all be completed at one time.</p>

<p>Quest designers often work for days or weeks just for the implementation of a single quest, depending on the difficulty and scope.  They are constantly working on newer and more enticing quests for the players, and those quests will appear in game regularly.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why can't my class [insert skill here]?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the answer here is that the skill wasn't put in for a particular class due to balance reasons.  As listed above in the balance section, each class needs to have strengths and weaknesses that are complimented by the strengths and weaknesses of other classes.</p>

<p>In the real world, there's no reason why someone wouldn't be able to pick up a sword and learn something about its operation.  In EverQuest, classes must be limited in what they can or cannot do, due to the fact that there is always going to be players out there that could learn and do everything if it were allowed.  These players would certainly be large enough in number at a certain point that they would start displacing people who did not have the time to do that.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why isn't there an item that [insert concept here]?</p>

<p>Item requests come to us as often as requests for a particular quest.  In the same fashion, it is often the case that the item just hasn't been created in game at this point, because there might not be a niche where its appearance would make sense.  There's also the subject of balance, that being that there is only so many things that we can do with an item without having that item step on the toes of another classes' abilities.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why is/isn't [insert item here] NODROP and/or LORE?</p>

<p>NODROP and LORE are item tags that are used for various reasons.</p>

<p>NODROP was originally intended as a way to insure that the character that completes a quest is the character that actually put forth the effort.  In other cases, NODROP has been used as an anti-twinking mechanism, allowing us to create items that are more powerful than we normally could (e.g. planar items). As NODROP prevents trading of items, and given that a healthy player-economy is desired in EverQuest, we are actively restricting its use to situations where the original intent of NODROP can be fulfilled.</p>

<p>LORE was created in order to prevent players from doing quests multiple times with effort either no greater, or marginally greater, than the effort required to do it once.  It has also been used as a way to keep players from "farming" items that are known to be popular, thus preventing others from attempting to obtain those items.  As we want the game world to make as much sense as possible, we're restricting the use of LORE as an anti-farming mechanism except in cases where no suitable alternative exists.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why isn't archery viable as a primary means of combat?</p>

<p>Archery was designed to be a secondary form of combat for those capable of using it.  It is not, however, meant to replace melee attacks in those encounters.  The reason for this is that we do not want archery, which only needs to cost the arrow itself, to replace or become suitable competition for spell-casting.  Making archery always do the 200-500 points of damage per hit that would be needed for it to become a primary combat skill, would put those capable of archery in direct competition with damage-centric spell casters.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Why are NPCs stronger than players at a given level?  Why can they do things that we can't?</p>

<p>NPCs are designed to be competition for groups of players.  As such, they need the ability to stand up to the attacks of up to six or more players for a reasonable amount of time to insure that the encounters are challenging.  The only other option available to make these encounters challenging would be to insure that they always attack in groups.  Doing this would of course vastly increase the number of NPCs in the world, placing excess load on the EverQuest servers, and would also make it much more difficult for players to take the required time for restoration between combats.</p>

<p>As the body of an NPC needs to be strong relative to the body of the player, so does its mind.  While the former is easy to accomplish, the latter is a much more daunting task.  Dozens and dozens of supercomputers still cannot match the situational decision-making process of a human.  Rather than expend additional computing power that could better be used elsewhere, we chose in many cases to allow NPCs to do things that players cannot.  For instance, NPCs will not drown, take damage from falling, or be burned while in lava.</p>

<p class="question">Q:  Everyone wants an [insert item here], why don't you make it drop more?</p>

<p>That certainly seems like an easy solution, however making items drop more is not the solution for everyone who wants one.  One of the reasons that everyone wants the item in question is that it is rare.  Demand exceeds supply.  The value of the item reflects this.  Just making the item more available would only serve to reducing the value of the item overall.  Once "everyone" has the item in question, its value would be basically meaningless.</p>

<p>Additionally, widely available high-end items cause characters to move towards becoming cookie-cutters of each other.  There is less to set one character apart from another if they are all wearing the same gear.  Right now, someone in game can feel a sense of accomplishment if they are the only person, or one of a small number of people to have a particular item.  This sense of accomplishment is one of the things that many people enjoy about the game.  They enjoy it because they overcame a challenge to achieve an objective, that objective not being achievable by all.</p>

<p>Item rarity is very important to the sense of accomplishment in game.</p>
