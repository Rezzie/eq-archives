<p align="center"><b><font color=#ff9900 size=4 class="header">When Elementals 
Attack</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Al`Kabor had 
been spending his time researching in the Qeynos area. Though he preferred the 
superior research facilities and libraries of Erudin, he found the locals in the 
Qeynos area more then eager to assist him with trivial errands for a trifling 
handful of coins. Indeed, labor was cheap and the people generally hard working 
and honest in this law abiding town.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>One such errand 
runner, a half elf, had just returned carrying a vial full of a certain rare and 
difficult to obtain ink he was sent to fetch. He flipped the half elf a gold piece 
and said, "You are dismissed". The errand boy looked at the coin, smiled and then 
left Al`Kabor's flat happily.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The ink was needed 
for a scroll he was nearly finished scribing. He had run out of the rare and precious 
ink just before he had completed his work on the scroll. He very carefully uncorked 
the bottle and set it upon the fine table of marble. Gently unrolling the precious 
scroll, he smoothed it lovingly out on the cool surface of the stone table. He 
dipped the quill, made from an enormous griffon feather, into the ink. He put 
the pen to the parchment and began to once again scribe the ancient runic symbols 
onto the parchment with slow and deliberate care.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>It started lightly, 
almost imperceptibly. He first thought that perhaps mobs of angry people were 
stomping up the stairs to his flat. But suddenly, everything was shaking violently. 
Books began to fall from their shelves; fine glassware fell to the ground and 
smashed. Gripping the heavy marble table to keep his balance, Al`Kabor watched 
in horror as the bottle of very expensive and difficult to acquire ink rocked 
back and forth, rolled on its side for a moment and then tipped over. Frozen in 
shock, he watched as the ink spread out over the scroll. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>He slammed his 
fist onto the table as the realization dawned upon him, "Five days of work and 
components worth a mountain of platinum pieces, ruined by yet another one of these 
damned earthquakes!" He grabbed the ruined scroll he had been laboring upon for 
nearly a week, crumpled it up in his hand and tossed it out his window. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In crumpling 
the scroll, he had inadvertently covered his hands with the ink. Another earthquake 
hit this one more violent then the last. Stumbling a bit, he caught himself on 
his coat rack in the corner of his study. The ink on his hands smeared onto the 
robe that hung upon the rack. Throwing his hands into the air he shouted, "I've 
had enough!" He wiped his hands clean on the old robe and threw it out the window 
too. Putting his best robe over his shoulders, he stomped downstairs out of his 
flat and into the streets of Qeynos.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Tramping through 
the streets, he shouted, "How can anyone get any work done around here with all 
these earthquakes? This is completely unacceptable!" All around him, people were 
running and shouts of alarm filled the streets. Walking toward the gates of the 
city, he was oblivious to the broken glass on the ground and cracks in the fine 
stone masonry, all evidence of the quake's severity.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Enraged, he grabbed 
a wood elf by the lapels as he tried to run past and yelled in his face, "You! 
Elf! What is causing these earthquakes? Hmm?" The elf looked back at him in fear 
and said nothing. "Oh why do I bother talking to one of your kind!" Releasing 
him, the elf ran away.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Stepping through 
the city gates, he turned and inquired indignantly to the heavily armored Paladin 
next to him, "How am I supposed to think when every five minutes I have the full 
contents of my library on the floor, woman?" The Paladin gave him a sideways look, 
apparently offended, snorted to herself and then walked back into the city shaking 
her head. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Bah," he said 
making a dismissive gesture behind the woman as she left. He began walking down 
the path out of the city. The stones that made up the path were uneven, some raised 
up higher then others, no doubt due to the earthquake. "They should get someone 
to fix this," Al`Kabor muttered to himself. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Suddenly, he 
found his feet had sunk into the ground a good foot or so and he was unable to 
walk. Surrounding him on four sides were small creatures that appeared to be made 
of earth itself. They grabbed at his robes and began pummeling him with their 
fists of rock and dirt.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Without even 
thinking, blinded by the sheer audacity of these creatures to even dare assault 
the mighty Al`Kabor and dirty his best robe, he begun to summon forth the magical 
energy to unleash his wrath upon these creatures. The small elementals, standing 
no taller then the shortest halfling, were each blasted to bits by the sheer power 
of the energy released in all directions by the mighty wizard. Clods of dirt and 
pebbles flying through the air were the only evidence that the creatures were 
even there a moment before.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Why are these 
elementals all over the place?" He pulled his feet free from the ground and walked 
over to a cleric of Rodcet Nife who was tending to another victim of the elemental 
attack who faired far worse then the wizard. He asked, "You! Cleric! Did these 
elementals rise from the ground or did somebody summon all of these?"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The cleric finished 
bandaging the wounded traveler and said hurriedly, "Sir, I have no idea. Excuse 
me, many are hurt or in peril from this attack. I must take my leave."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Al`Kabor shouted 
to no one in particular, "Bah! I'd gather more information from a wall then I 
would from you people!" He continued to walk up the stone path. Here and there 
earth elementals were assaulting folks outside the city in the hills of Qeynos. 
The Jagged Pine Treefolk from Surefall Glade were on full alert. The rangers and 
druids that called the glade home were doing their best to stem the tide of the 
elemental invasion.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Wandering the 
hills, Al`Kabor walked about blasting any elemental he came across to kingdom 
come. He did this not in defense of the hills nor for any sort of loyalty to the 
fine city of Qeynos but more in retaliation for his days of lost work and as therapy 
for the general feeling of rage and displeasure he was experiencing. Today was 
not a good day at all and it was about to get much worse.</font></p>
