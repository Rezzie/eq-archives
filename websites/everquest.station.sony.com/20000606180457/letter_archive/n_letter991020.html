              <p><font size="2">10/20/99</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Hello everyone,</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Brad invited me to fill in this week, as the topic for this Producer’s Letter was customer 
                service-related. I would like to take this opportunity to give everyone an overview of the policy enhancements 
                we are planning for EverQuest Customer Service. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Our original policies were designed to preserve EverQuest’s high-fantasy online role-playing 
                environment. Like EverQuest itself, many of these policies were innovative, having never before been pursued 
                in massively multiplayer online gaming. Although some were skeptical, we were committed to our naming and 
                guilding policies, and to controlling more serious problems like harassment and abuse. Our basic customer 
                service philosophy could be summed up with this statement &quot;One player should never be permitted to intentionally 
                ruin the play experience of another&quot;. EverQuest was created and maintained with that simple concept in 
                mind. We have learned a lot in the seven months since EverQuest launched. Armed with that experience, we are 
                ready to commit to an even higher level of service.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">We are referring to these changes as the &quot;Play Nice Policies&quot;. It is our intent 
                to further define our responsibilities as EverQuest customer service representatives, and to provide resolutions 
                when players come into conflict over in-game issues. The policy changes will directly affect how and when 
                we will mediate for players in dispute. When the policies are implemented, our staff will be taking action 
                to diffuse situations before they become so frustrating that a player’s enjoyment of the game is compromised. 
                One of the most serious concerns that we often hear from players is that Guides and GM’s cannot always provide 
                help. In these situations we will now be able to assist. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Before I delve into the policy changes, there is a point I would like to stress. EverQuest 
                players are encouraged to make every effort to interact positively and cooperate with their fellow gamers. 
                Our firm commitment to this ideal is reflected in these policies. Players who wish to destroy the gaming experience 
                of others are not welcome in EverQuest, and will be removed from the game without hesitation.</font></p>
              <p><u><font size="2">Play Nice Policies: A revision to the GM/Guide FAQ and Rules of Conduct.</font></u></p>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2"><i>Kill Stealing</i> will now be regarded as disruption and will result in disciplinary 
                  action when witnessed by any GM or Guide. The GM or Guide will review these situations on an individual 
                  basis and issue a decision which is considered binding upon all parties involved. This may include a requirement 
                  to depart the immediate zone or spawn area. <i>Kill Stealing</i> is defined as attacking an NPC with the 
                  intent to deprive another player or group of the experience or loot from that NPC. This practice commonly 
                  occurs in popular spawn areas. In these instances, the player or group who was first on the scene will have 
                  the rights to the kill. Players are encouraged to cooperate in these situations!</font></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2">Intentional <i>Training</i> of NPC’s and <i>PvP Switch Avoidance</i> will result in immediate 
                  disciplinary action when witnessed by a GM or Guide. We are aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional 
                  <i>Trains</i>, and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2"><i>Fraud</i> in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary action when 
                  confirmed by a GM. An example of this activity would be offering to recover the possessions from the corpse 
                  of another player, and refusing to return that property to it’s owner. <i>Secure Trade Window Circumvention</i> 
                  involving the sale of items in-game between players will also be prohibited and punishable under this rule.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2">The definition of <i>Harassment</i> will be expanded to include any use of any functionality 
                  to harm or otherwise inconvenience another player. An example of this would be dispelling another player’s 
                  protective spells without his consent. As always, measures will be taken in game code to prevent these activities.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2"><i>Yielding the Right of Way</i> is an issue where players choose to camp spawn sites (usually 
                  for treasure) where the monsters do not provide experience. This problem is initially being addressed in 
                  a broad plan involving changes to popular spawn areas and the inclusion of new quests. If and when we are 
                  comfortable with the success of these changes, we will consider the implementation of the <i>Yield</i> rule. 
                  This will require higher-level players or groups to yield to lower-level players in any situation where 
                  the NPC’s being fought consider green to the higher-level players. Due to the controversial nature of this 
                  issue, we will be conducting a comprehensive poll on this specific subject.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2">In the PvP+ environment, several issues will now be included in the definition of harassment. 
                  <i>Bind Point Camping</i>, or the practice of killing a player multiple times at his or her bind point. 
                  <i>Corpse Camping</i>, in which players lie in wait (often invisible or hidden) to kill another player who 
                  is returning to loot their corpse after a death. <i>Zone Border Camping</i>, which occurs when players attack 
                  other players before they obtain control of their character after crossing a zone boundary.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font size="2">Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds 
                  whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct may be disbanded. In addition, <i>Monopolizing</i> 
                  numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other players will not be permitted. If investigated and 
                  verified by a GM, <i>Monopolizing</i> will result in the disbanding of the guild.</font></li>
              </ul>
              <p><font size="2">I will paraphrase from the current GM/Guide FAQ as a reminder for anyone who may not be familiar 
                with our responsibilities as they relate to the enforcement of our customer service policies. Verant GM Administrators 
                review records of disciplinary incidents on a daily basis. Action is taken based on the severity and nature 
                of the offense, and/or the number of warnings issued to the customer. These actions may include but are not 
                limited to, temporary suspension or permanent banning from the game. Be advised that you may not receive any 
                notification or warnings, in-game or otherwise, prior to disciplinary action being taken against your account.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">As an additional note, please be aware that the /report command is to be used in conjunction 
                with the /petition function for players to inform us of violations of the Rules of Conduct in all issues related 
                to verbal harassment or threats and offensive language. After executing the /report command in one of these 
                situations, remember to follow up with a /petition so that the situation can be promptly addressed.</font></p>
              <p><font size=2>We will be using the polling function of the Chat Server to gather your opinions on these subjects, 
                and determine what issues are most important to you as EverQuest players. Implementation of the Play Nice 
                Policies, in whole or in part, will be made contingent upon that determination. You will see an official notice 
                on the patch server message and at </font><a href="http://www.everquest.com/" target="_top"><font size=2>www.everquest.com</font></a><font size=2> 
                prior to the enforcement of these policies. Until that time, the standard policies will remain in effect.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Although you’re in OUR world now, YOU are the characters whose lives and stories make EverQuest 
                what it is today. You are the most important part of our world. We will continue to improve our policies and 
                service to provide you with the best online gaming experience possible. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Thanks to everyone for taking the time to read this. From myself, the GM’s and Guides, and 
                everyone in the EverQuest Customer Service Department, have fun and Play Nice!!!</font></p>
