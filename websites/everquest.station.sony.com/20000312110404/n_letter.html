              <p><font size="2">12/6/99</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Hello everyone!</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">My name is Gordon Wrinn, and I am the Internet Relations Manager at Verant Interactive, Inc.  Some of you who participated in the EverQuest Beta, or followed EverQuest during the beta period may remember me as Guide Abashi. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">I discovered EverQuest quite by accident in December of 1997 while perusing a message board for another game.  The concept of playing a 3D role-playing game in a dynamic and persistent world immediately intrigued me.  With the beta for the game still being some months away, I, like everyone else, was relegated to discussing ideas about the game on the public boards.   Come June of 1998, I was quite excited when I received an invitation to the earliest phase of the EverQuest beta.  In late 1998, I was invited to join the EverQuest Guide Program.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">Due to some &quot;real life&quot; issues that took me out-of-town, I had to leave the Guide Program behind shortly prior to release.  However, some five months later, I returned to EverQuest and my role in the Guide Program, and not to mention, my role as a player <font face="Wingdings">&#74;</font>
 I was quite pleased a month or so ago when I was offered my current position.  </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">My job at Verant is to improve the quality and quantity of the information passing between Verant Interactive, Inc. and the player-base of EverQuest as a whole.  Up until now, public posts made by Brad and other members of the EverQuest Team have been made during their ample (*grin*) free time.  The Management Team here decided that their customers deserved more than this, and hence my position was created.  No, I am not here to replace announcements made by Brad and other members of the EverQuest team, but to supplement and add to them.  My job here is to know everything there is to know about EverQuest, represent the player-base in our meetings, and keep in touch with the public.  </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">I’ll be honest with you.  I’m not a &quot;PR Guy&quot; or &quot;Spin Doctor&quot;.  My professional background is in mission-critical subscriber systems management and development.  EverQuest, being a subscriber-based service maintained in a mission-critical manner, is directly in my area of technical expertise.    This experience, and my experience with EverQuest both as a player and a former Guide gives me the necessary skills to understand what EverQuest and Verant are all about, and keep a two-way dialogue going between the development team and the EverQuest player-base.  I’m not fond of beating around the bush about issues, and tend to speak my mind.  Though I won’t always be able to tell you what you would like to hear, I hope you’ll at least appreciate my candor.  </font></p>
              <p><font size="2">In closing, I’d like to say that I am looking forward to giving you, the customers, the attention and information that you deserve.  I’d also like to thank Brad for giving me the opportunity to hijack his letter, as it will hopefully cut down on the number of &quot;Who is this guy???&quot; posts on the public boards and newsgroups when I begin to make my appearances there in the near future <font face="Wingdings">&#74;</font></font>
