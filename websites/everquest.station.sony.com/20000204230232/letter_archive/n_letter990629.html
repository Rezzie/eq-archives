Welcome to the new Producer's Letter!
<p>
Yes, I realize there was one before, but it was rarely updated.  The reason for that, honestly, was that for so long I've always communicated to EQ players primarily through posts on message boards and fan sites.  In fact, for those of you who have been with EQ since before even the Beta, that's kind of where it all started.  A lot of the excitement and anticipation generated for EverQuest before release was grass-roots in a sense, with me posting and doing chats and all sorts of fan sites and guild pages popping up into existence.
<p>
It was a wonderful time and it's a communication process I've both enjoyed and feel comfortable with.  But the problem now is simply how many people are playing EverQuest, and reading and posting to these sites.  It's hard for me to get the message out sometimes - I've even posted before in response to a player and then the next day read another post on the same site complaining that they haven't seen me post for weeks and how we need to improve our communication.  There were simply so many posts that mine was gone by the time this person began reading.
<p>
So it occurred to me (and it probably should have occurred to me earlier - doh!) that there has to be a better way for me to address the EQ community as a whole in order to keep all of you more informed.  It is my hope to at least weekly, if not more often, post the Producer's Letter here on everquest.com and that the various fan sites and other EQ related boards would copy this letter into their news or to wherever else makes sense.  
<p>
Now, before any of you panic, I'm still going to be out there reading the boards and posting responses probably just as often as I always have been.  It's something I enjoy and I think it's very important to the growing community that we keep this two-way communication going.  But the difference will be that whenever it makes sense to post something lengthy and in-depth, I'll use the Producer's Letter.  That way, when major issues come up, I can reach the most people.  The types of posts I'll still make to various boards and newsgroups will more often be answers to specific questions or simply general comments.
<p>
And, of course, the various sites and discussion boards will quite often be the source for my inspiration to write the Producer's Letter.  It's where I'll gather topics and ideas.  You can expect to see all sorts of issues addressed, including camping, class balance, the player-driven economy, crowding, connectivity, etc.  That's right - I won't shirk from the heated controversial stuff at all.  You'll also see me discuss how things work here at Verant, what features and additions we're working on and how we're working on them.  I'll talk about how we meet together as a Dev Team and debate issues and how changes are implemented.  And I'll also cover exciting new stuff, like the new zones we're working on that will be downloadable in the future, as well as the huge Expansion coming next year.
<p>
Anyway, I really hope this helps.  I'm sure the heated and passionate discussions will continue, and that is both normal and healthy for an ever evolving and dynamic game like EverQuest.  But at least everyone will know better our positions on the various issues and what our plans are to address them.  You'll know that we're thinking about things too over here -- and not just thinking, but working very hard to earn the money you've spent and continue to spend on EverQuest.
<p>
I'll see you next week,
<p>
