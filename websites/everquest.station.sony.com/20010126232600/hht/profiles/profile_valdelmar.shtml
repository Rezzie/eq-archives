<p>Pride radiated from the smiles of Rodimus and Sharelle Wolfsong as they watched 
their son run off to join the pack of young men that were headed off to train 
for battle. Valdelmar, a nimble and dexterous young boy for a barbarian quickly 
learned to wield a sword as if it were but an extension of his arms. His fluid 
motions served him well in the heat of battle, and kept him from meeting his fate 
from a well placed blade.</p>
<p>As he grew in age, he also grew in size and strength. The young boy soon became 
a war hardened man with the cunning of a general. Many long battles had allowed 
Valdelmar to show his skill and whit to those above him. Valdelmar was soon given 
charge of a battalion to lead against the wretches that infested Blackburrow. 
This was to be a hard battle, as he was certain his men would be outnumbered greatly. 
Their advantage was surprise and tact.</p>
<p>The barbarians flowed into the cavern of Blackblurrow like a flood. The rogues 
of the ranks slipped quietly up to the gnolls that stood guard at the entrance 
and silently slit them from ear to ear. The troops marched into the hollowed cave 
underground and an alarm sounded. They had been spotted. Loud clashes of metal 
upon metal echoed throughout the cave and drowned under the rumbling battle cries 
of the barbarian horde. </p>
<p>Blood stained the rocks of the cavern at the end of the battle. Valdelmar overlooked 
the carnage that had erupted in this burrow. Mangled corpses littered the ground 
around his feet and he curled his lip in disgust. The gnolls had fallen to the 
barbarians, but many northern brothers had breathed their last of foul gnoll air. 
Valdelmar gave the order to collect the bodies of their fallen brethren so that 
they might get a respected burial in their own homelands. </p>
<p>They returned to the warm welcome of a festival to celebrate their success. 
Valdelmar, however, felt nothing like celebrating. Their attack was retaliation 
for a raid on the barbarian farms that stood on the very edges of Halas. Though 
they had won, many lives had been forfeited. That was but a single clan of gnolls. 
Valdelmar was certain more would come and the battles would only escalate.</p>
<p>He had to do something in order to protect his people. He had to become more 
than what he was. He set out to find the eldest of known shaman from his people. 
Slytheron was known to live somewhere in the hazardous plains of Karana. The journey 
lasted several months and proved to test Valdelmar's strength, courage and endurance.</p>
<p>Hill giants, Griffins and lions of the highlands all seemed to have a hunger 
for his hide. And still the home of Slytheron was no where to be found. Valdelmar's 
resolve began to waver in the despair that he would never find the old shaman. 
In the silence of night in the Karana plains, he heard the grass around him ruffle 
as something approached. He drew his sword and readied himself for the attack.</p>
<p>A long grey beard fell from the old man's chin as he stepped into the light 
of Valdelmar's fire. He introduced himself as Slytheron, and the shaman knew why 
he had come. Valdelmar listened as the shaman explained what could be done to 
sate his need to protect. Slytheron pulled a small vial from his skins. What animal 
had produced a skin like that, Valdelmar knew not, but his attention was fully 
on the vial.</p>
<p>"Drink," Slytheron instructed. "And your life shall forever be changed. I warn 
you of the dangers this vial holds. You will never again see your family, for 
they will not comprehend. You must not share this secret with others. And mostly, 
your duty to protect will encompass not simply your own people. Do you accept 
these?" Valdelmar gauged the old man with his clear blue eyes and nodded.</p>
<p>The clear liquid held no taste and no scent, but it filled Valdelmar with a 
burning heat unlike anything he had ever known. He felt a change within, a roaring 
power of incalculable strength. Even his armor had changed. From ruined, and tarnished 
to untouched and shimmering. Clarity entered his mind as well. The knowledge of 
what he now had to do, and how he was to do it. Valdelmar nodded to the old shaman 
in thanks and left to begin his duties and his existence anew.</p>
