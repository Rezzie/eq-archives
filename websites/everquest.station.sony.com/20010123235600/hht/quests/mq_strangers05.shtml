<p align="justify">Earron Huntlan, </p>
<p align="justify">After many grueling hours of attempting to restore the ruined 
page of the diary that you did give to me for research, I was unable to return 
the penmanship to a more legible standard or to interpret the writing to any large 
degree. As unfortunate that may be, I was however able to brush away most of the 
fluids that stained the page to see a quite remarkable and rather curious symbol 
stained into the parchment itself. I furthered my studies in regards to the symbol 
and found that it was an ancient Rune that has since fallen beneath the ways of 
our modern magical practices. </p>
<p align="justify">Despite the Rune's disappearance from our arcane methods, I myself 
was still able to translate the Rune and find exactly its purpose if used within 
a spell or research. This Rune in particular dates back to the Heretic Revolt 
and the forming of the first Paineel, which I am sure you know has since fallen 
into rubble beneath the hands of Master Yael. I have had brief introductions to 
ancient lore in the evolution of our magic and after some further research, I 
was able to pinpoint the exact creation and original purpose of this rune's creation. 
</p>
<p align="justify">One known as Dartain created the rune. An ancient Heretic who 
should be nothing more than dust within his grave, he somehow remains alive and 
well. His time shall soon come, but that is not the tale that we are discussing. 
Dartain created this rune and two others that would assist him in one of his many 
studies and experiments with death and life in attempts to create a spell that 
would summon a rather powerful undead servant. The project fell away as the Necromancer 
found an easier way to forge the spell, which to this day is used by those Necromancers 
who have the power within them to conjure such a powerful Servant of Bones. Due 
to this research, I am quite determined to think that the diary itself is one 
of the many that Dartain did keep before his exile to the Plane of Underfoot.</p>
<p align="justify">With the Runes no longer able to assist Dartain's research, he 
returned them to the pages of his diary where he is famed for holding most of 
his meaningless ramblings. If the diary were to be recovered one would notice 
that there are failed attempts to inscribe these runes upon pages 19, 23, 29, 
and 37 of the diary. It is rumored that if these runes are combined with the words 
of the same context, a flawless incantation would be created and thus the effect 
which Dartain was striving to obtain with his original creation of the Runes. 
Due to the more powerful nature of these incantations, I would assume the effect 
to be on a larger scale than that of a simple pet. I would have liked to take 
a look at the diary in full to perhaps find the other Runes and further my study. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Despite the absence of the other runes, I was able to discover 
the names of three inscribed upon the pages of that ancient diary... The first 
Rune that was created was that of Servility; the second Rune, the one that I held 
for some time in my possession, is that of Entreaty; and the third and final rune 
is that of Dominion. For each of these Runes there are a set of words that compliments 
the meaning and purpose of the Rune's names, unfortunately I can not provide the 
exact names of these words as they were a well kept secret from the likes of "goodly" 
scholars. </p>
<p align="justify">How this could possibly relate to the problems you have observed 
within your tavern and city are beyond me. This diary is meaningless as a whole 
and the runes inscribed upon these ancient illegible pages are useless without 
the words, which have been lost for centuries. With what has been evident within 
these past few days in regards to these disturbances, we can clearly eliminate 
the possibility of the heretic's involvement. This display is much too sloppy 
for their style in oppression, and they are currently too tied up with the Council 
at Erudin to attempt to control such a city as this. </p>
<p align="justify">There is one thing, however, that has disturbed me and has led 
me to believe that your thoughts of conspiracy are correct, but I still do not 
know what the diary or the runes have to do with any of this outbreak of petty 
street crimes. Last night as I was preparing myself to retire for the evening, 
a rather polite knock came to my door. To my surprise, an elderly erudite, as 
you had described to me when pleading for my assistance with the diary page, appeared 
at my door asking for the diary page to be returned to him. Immediately, as instinct 
would have, I dismissed him without the object of his desire and he turned away 
without another word. When I awoke this morn I found that the page was no longer 
in my possession, which leads me to think that it has some importance to this 
man. Never the less, I shall handle the situation on my own, if of course he has 
not retreated back into Paineel. </p>
