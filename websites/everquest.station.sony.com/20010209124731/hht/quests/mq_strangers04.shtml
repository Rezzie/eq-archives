size=4><span class="header">Stranger in Qeynos</span></font></b></p>
<p align="justify">Esteemed Council and My Lord, Magistrate Vegalys Keldrane, </p>
<p align="justify">My words have gone unanswered and unnoticed to you, our "Esteemed" 
council for far too long, and now I fear that it may be too late to prevent the 
chaos that has fully overrun our city. What favors that were owed to me have been 
called in, and now I find myself in debt for my attempts in bringing this letter 
to the highest authority. Lord Magistrate, please, hear the cries of your fair 
city and know that we are in dire need. More is afoot than simple ruffians and 
rude manners. </p>
<p align="justify">Beyond the increase of unfriendly citizens, unwarranted brutal 
attacks within our streets and kingdom at night, and curiously suspicious actions 
increasing that somehow point to a conspiracy in my eyes and to those who also 
have witnessed these acts. A more disturbing piece of evidence has been brought 
into the light. An elderly scholar, appearing to be a caster of sorts with great 
power beneath his years, came into my tavern, his appearance shrouded in travel 
worn dreariness. I had braced myself to deal with another rude scoundrel, to only 
find myself surprised by the rather polite and kind manner of this gentleman. 
Upon his back he carried a large black satchel which he seemed to hold dear to 
himself, strapped tightly so that any thief would bring themselves into focus 
if they dared to take his wares. </p>
<p align="justify">Conversation was struck between this individual and myself, and 
although he did seem to be strange to our fair lands, he was rather open and cordial 
with his discussion. It appears that my assumptions of his being a scholar were 
correct, and through his appearance I could see that he was once a resident of 
the city of Erudin, but his recent habitation is High Keep, where he has spent 
the majority of his years studying the arcane sciences. Our discussion was rather 
brief, but I did inform him of the bad element that has entered into our city 
as of these past weeks. </p>
<p align="justify">What did seem strange about this individual was that he did not 
seem to take my warnings of these occurrences as strange, but rather he ignored 
them completely and changed the subject to his travels. He spoke rather fondly 
of the guards within our hills and how they had given him shelter from the ferocious 
gnolls that plague our countryside. Upon resting and feeling confident that he 
should continue his travels towards his destination, our fair city of Qeynos. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Through his recounting of his travels, he paused for a moment 
and did stray from his ignorance to my warnings of the changes to our city. He 
informed me that young Mira Sayer had been struck with a minor illness after being 
bitten by a rabid wolf. Feeling obliged to assist the woman after her husband 
had so graciously given him provisions for the rest of his journey; the traveler 
used his ties to the gypsies and sent the ill woman to travel to their camp where 
she would find treatment. When continuing the tales of his travels, the Erudite 
made quite pleasing and warm words for the Priests of Life, who gave short term 
shelter and care to his needs upon his arrival at the city. </p>
<p align="justify">Shortly after his coming to my tavern and our discussion far from 
ending, the rude young woman came into the tavern and immediately took the traveler 
away from his seat at my bar, to her usual table. I could not hear what was shared 
between them, as their voices were hushed despite the tension and heat that seemed 
to rise from both of them in their discussion. Without hesitation or warning, 
the woman simply leaned over the table, drawing her blade to the fine lad's throat 
and quite loudly demanding that he give her an item I assume was within his bag, 
as that is where she reached for next. </p>
<p align="justify">As I was tired myself and quite disgusted with the display, I 
wasted no time in calling the guards to arrest the woman for assault within my 
establishment. Without delay, three of your fine guardsmen who were on watch that 
eve between the ninth and tenth chimes of the clock came in and disrupted the 
brawl. Unfortunately the young woman disappeared into the shadows, through magic 
or her skill I could not tell. She left the traveler upon the floor with a serious 
wound to his throat. I hear now that he is in the care of the Temple, but I have 
yet to receive an update about his condition. </p>
<p align="justify">While cleaning up the mess that was left upon my bar's floor, 
I came across a withered page of a diary, or so it seemed, although the writings 
upon the age worn paper were not of any language that I could read. Keeping in 
mind the heritage of the traveler that the diary had belonged and knowing that 
the famed Al`Kabor had taken residence within our city some time past, I used 
what little persuasion I had to entice the great wizard to translate the writing 
as it may have given some insight into the recent disruptions within my tavern.</p>
<p align="justify">I was surprised to see that the Erudite wizard was rather easy 
to sway into the translation of the page, and in only two short days did I receive 
a response from him in regards to his translations. I have enclosed his letter 
to me, as an expert opinion and a form of physical evidence I can use to concerning 
the strange conspiracy that seems to be erupting throughout our city.</p>
<p align="justify">I ask again, please, hear our cries and know that we do not provide 
it in vain. Do not let us fall into irreparable turmoil. Keep our faith, dear 
Council and Lord Magistrate. </p>
