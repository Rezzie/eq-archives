<p>Born in Qeynos in 2075, Solist Kinslan was the son of a widowed brewer, his 
mother having died giving birth to him. From early childhood the magical arts 
fascinated him and by his teens he was already one of the most prominent students 
in Qeynos. Working as a researcher of spells and magical items, Solist was a driving 
force for the power that the Arcane Scientists have today. Eventually the need 
to travel for his research came about and so he left the city of his birth for 
twenty years of field research. From the libraries of Erudin to the crypts of 
Castle Mistmoore, Solist learned about everything there is to learn on Norrath 
and was regarded as a great sage by all. </p>
<p>Using his magic, he created a tower for himself which existed between the planes 
and Norrath which only he had the spells to access. It was at this time that Solist 
made the discovery that would forever change his life…and grant him immortality. 
While exploring the Lavastorm Mountains, an eruption caused a rockslide revealing 
sealed doors to an ancient temple. After three days of translation, Solist was 
able to break the seal and open the doors. What he discovered inside was the lost 
temple of Solusek Ro, a small city of fire and lava. In a hidden shrine at the 
bottom of the temple Solist found a book of ancient lore and power and wasted 
no time in reading from the pages. </p>
<p>It was then that Solusek Ro himself appeared in the temple, his avatar towering 
above the wizard, singing his hair and watering his eyes. Solusek Ro was pleased 
with this wizard; he had gained much power in his short lifespan and had reopened 
the temple. Solist was offered a deal that few mortals ever get…he was offered 
immortality and the powers of a demi-god. He was to become the High Wizard of 
Solusek Ro. The price for this knowledge was his eternal servitude to both Solusek 
Ro and the will of Norrath. He could never interfere in the workings of mortals, 
only act as a guide and make sure that the natural order of life was kept. The 
chance for infinite knowledge was too hard to resist, and the pact was sealed.
