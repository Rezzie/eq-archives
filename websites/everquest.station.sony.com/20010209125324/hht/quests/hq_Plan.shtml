<p align="center"><b><font color=#ff9900 size=4><span class="header">Venril's 
Plan</span></font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Venril Sathir 
moved back into Karnor's Castle some 50 years ago. Before that time, the Iksar 
Lich-King spent more then a century in hiding in The Bile at his Fortress Varis, 
after his defeat at the hands The Alliance of Stone. The Alliance of Stone's victory 
came only after the leader of Venril's Lycanthrope army, an Iksar wizard serpent 
changer by the name of Thuuga, was deceived by the Ring of Scale and joined the 
Alliance.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Venril Sathir 
vowed to rebuild his empire to its former terrible glory of two thousand years 
past. However, he had learned a valuable lesson at his last defeat. Choosing to 
stay out of the public's eye from now on, he has since become secretive and has 
been rebuilding his strength quietly, biding his time as the tendrils of his influence 
snake their way into all levels of society. He has many agents and moles placed 
strategically all across the continent that report to him and see that local politics 
resolve themselves in a manner favorable to his designs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>One such agent 
is a shapeshifter by the name of Korucust. Appearing as a Sarnak, Korucust managed 
to become a member of Sarnak Overking Bathezid Di'zok's council. The Ring of Scale 
had a representative that once sat upon the Sarnak king's council but he disappeared 
mysteriously around one year ago, shortly after Korucust was elected. The truth 
of the matter is that Korucust assassinated this representative at Venril's behest. 
One of Venril's goals is to subvert the influence that the Ring of Scale has over 
the Sarnak. Indeed, he views the Sarnak as a means of eventually destroying the 
Ring of Scale.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Before he ordered 
the assassination, Venril learned very important information about the Ring of 
Scale through the reports he received from Korucust. He found that a few years 
back the Ring of Scale were able to steal the memories of a certain High Elven 
Paladin. The notion that it was possible to actually steal the memories of another 
and take them as your own was one that was quite attractive to Venril. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Venril has been 
watching the elves and their small settlement with interest. Far from posing any 
sort of threat, they have been creating a pleasant distraction that has kept the 
Frogloks, giants and others busy much to his delight. Nevertheless as in all things, 
he pays close attention to their activities through his spies. He favors the Lycanthropes, 
those that still remain loyal to him, for that particular duty. Their superior 
senses allow them to watch and hear things from a great distance, without alarming 
the elves.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>He was fascinated 
when he began to hear that the elves were telling stories, once again, about this 
certain High Elven Paladin that had her memories stolen. The rumors say this High 
Elven Paladin currently has in her possession a staff, allegedly given to her 
by Tunare, which seems to have an enchantment upon it that is helping the High 
Elf to regain her memories. Furthermore, Venril hears that this High Elf will 
be travelling to this elven small settlement very soon, to embark upon a journey 
to find and confront the Ring of Scale.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Upon hearing 
that the Paladin would soon be traveling to the continent, Venril swore that he 
would learn the secret of stealing memories. He sees this as a way to exponentially 
increase his knowledge while destroying his enemies at the same time. Indeed, 
a ruler without memories is one whose kingdom is easily conquered. If he can gain 
access to this ability he feels he may finally realize his goal of total control 
of the continent and eventually, the entire world.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Venril Sathir 
wants both Firiona Vie and her staff, The Lifeguide, so he can study them both 
and learn how it is that he can steal the memories of others and take them as 
his own. Venril begins to hatch a plot to bring this about.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Of course, the 
last thing Venril wants is to gain the attention of Ring of Scale or anyone else 
for that matter. He tasks a powerful shaman by the name of Danak Dhorentath with 
kidnapping Firiona. He will have her hidden in a remote location, far away from 
his Castle Karnor. Venril knows without a doubt that there will be elven search 
parties and the like for a time after her disappearance but he is not concerned. 
Patience is a trait he has learned in his roughly 400 years as a Lich. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Danak Dhorentath 
hatches a foul plan to accomplish this goal. Venril lends Danak a powerfully enchanted 
magic necklace. This necklace has the ability to open a gate to remote encampment 
far from Venril's domain. Taking a team of four Lycanthropes and a lesser Initiate 
of The Arisen, Danak and his party make their way to the small elven settlement 
to fulfill his dark master's wishes and capture the High Elven Paladin.</font></p>
