<p align="center"><b><font color=#ff9900 size=4 class="header">The Party Assembled</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dagda's keen 
and well-trained eyes caught a glimpse of several figures walking slowly across 
the snowy wastes. She turned and looked at the approaching figures, her eyes flashing 
in startled recognition. Curious she made her way toward the figures. The two 
gnomes, Ognit and Dabner, flanked her on either side.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Her eyes met 
with the eyes of the beautiful golden haired high elf standing before her. Dagda 
was sure she was seeing a friend but could not remember who she was or how she 
knew her. The high elf was accompanied by what must have been a half elven bard, 
judging from the lute slung across her back, that also seemed eerily familiar 
to her. In fact, the erudite in robes, the human resplendent in shining armor, 
the scruffy looking halfling and the scowling dwarf all seemed familiar to her 
for some reason. But the shy wood elf carrying the exquisitely crafted and ornately 
decorated bow, she did not recognize.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Seeing the smile 
upon the face of the high elf, Dagda did not wish to seem unpleasant. She reached 
forward and gripped one arm, wrist to wrist and clapped her other hand upon the 
high elf's shoulder in a gesture of greeting and friendship. In doing so, she 
brushed against the beautifully carved, bejeweled staff the high elf carried.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>A flash of light 
came forth from the staff and everyone stood for a moment stunned, shaking their 
heads. Suddenly, Dagda looked into the eyes of the high elf and smiling with sudden 
recognition she blurted out, "Firiona… Firiona Vie! It's been so long my friend. 
But… I had a feeling I would be seeing you again soon."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona hugged 
the large barbarian woman tightly. Turning to her side she said, "I would like 
to introduce a new friend of ours. Her name is Lyirae."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lyirae curtsied 
gracefully. "It's a pleasure to meet all of you. I certainly hope everything is 
all right." She looked around nervously and then added, "It sounded like a war 
was going on a moment ago."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Oh that!" Ognit 
made a dismissive gesture. "It was nothing, don't concern yourself."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Yes. It really 
was nothing," Dagda said quickly as she elbowed the gnome, a smile playing across 
her face. Ognit just scowled back at her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"Yes, I can truly 
say that I do remember you all now. I see none of you have changed over the years." 
Firiona smiled briefly but it quickly faded. "I truly wish we were meeting under 
better circumstances. I've come to ask the three of you for your help."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Her face grave, 
she continued, "The task set before us is difficult and the road we must travel 
deadly. And I truly know not what the future has in store for all of us. Already 
Sionachie, Thubr, Dreezil, Sir Jevik and even Al`Kabor have agreed to accompany 
me in my task." </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Bowing graciously, 
Dagda said, "Firiona, it would be my honor to travel with you and the others once 
again. I will be at your side."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Ognit stepped 
forward, his face screwed into scowl and spat, "So you're saying that you came 
to get us last? And that you asked for Al`Kabor's help before mine?" Firiona looked 
over at him, hurt flashing visible across her eyes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Raising both 
hands to his mouth Ognit began to laugh, a high pitched and ear splitting guffaw. 
It was good that he laughed rarely. "I'm kidding Firiona," he said, "I wouldn't 
miss the chance to travel with this group again for all the world!" He then gave 
Firiona a hug, smiling as he did; his face looking like it may crack in the process, 
so unaccustomed to the facial expression as it was.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dabner bounced 
forward toward Firiona with glee. "This is great! It's going to be just like old 
times again! I'm so excited!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Stopping for 
a moment, Dabner counted on one hand. He then counted on the other. "Wait… What 
about Lorisyn? Are we going to invite him to come with us as well?"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona, looked 
down at him sadly and said quietly, "Dabner…" </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Lyirae lowered 
her head and closed her eyes. She turned and walked slowly away from the group, 
stopping some distance away and began sobbing quietly.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Inquisitive, 
Dabner turned and asked, "Firiona? What happened to Lorisyn? Where is he?"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona glanced 
at the sky before returning to gaze upon Dabner. "We were attending the Festival 
of Faydark's Children. Sionachie, Thubr and I were all there. We learned some 
wonderful news. Lorisyn has… had a twin sister. Lyirae is Lorisyn's twin."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dagda and the 
gnomes' eyes widened with surprise. Looking back toward Lyirae, the resemblance 
was obvious.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona continued, 
"We were all caught up in the moment with the festival, the reunion and the good 
news. But then," she stifled a sob in her throat, "Shortly thereafter, we were 
ambushed… Lorisyn was struck down by assassins."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>"What?" Dagda 
spoke in a soft, dangerous voice, as her eyes flashed with fury. "Who are they? 
I will burn the sound of their names forever into my mind. They shall know the 
full force of my rage before I end their lives."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Looking the barbarian 
in the eyes Firiona says, "They are old enemies of ours and have been since…" 
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>She lowered her 
head and shook it with frustration, "I honestly can not remember. One is a Teir`Dal 
woman by the name of Vahlai Ka`Izal. The others are a Troll and an Orc by the 
names of Rogkasth and Ghargin." Dagda nodded solemnly upon hearing the names of 
the assassins.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Ognit's face 
was frozen in shock. "Well… Surely you could have revived him and brought him 
back to life! Surely there were healers present!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dabner glanced 
over at Lyirae standing off from the group. His face was suddenly filled with 
the wisdom that comes from studying the spiritual world, even at the cost of missing 
the finer points of the mundane world. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Facing his friend 
again he said softly, "Ognit… The gods don't allow for any life to be permanently 
extinguished, even the life of the lowliest snake or insect, until it is their 
appointed time. Once that time has been fulfilled and the cycle of life has been 
completed, the soul moves on never to return to this plane. From that point forward 
there is nothing that any mortal can do to bring life back to the body, for the 
soul has already moved on."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Upon hearing 
the soft voice and words of the gentle cleric, Lyirae walked slowly back to the 
group. She smiled lightly at Dabner, her eyes red with tears. "You speak as would 
a follower of Tunare."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dabner turned 
to look once again upon the face of his friend's twin. "Though I am happiest with 
a good solid chunk of earth above my head, I have been traveling above ground 
for quite some time. As a man of faith I have found it important to study and 
understand the beliefs of others. Particularly those of my close friends."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Taking hold of 
Lyirae's hand, he looked softly into her eyes. "Know that Lorisyn is now strolling 
in a glade far more beautiful than any known in the Faylands or any other in this 
mortal realm. He now dwells forever in the arms of the Great Mother."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dabner then turned 
to Firiona, his face uncharacteristically hard and resolute. "I will join you 
in your journey to the new lands. And Brell willing, I will do everything within 
my power to see that those responsible for Lorisyn's death find justice before 
going to meet their dark gods face to face, sooner then later."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Dagda clenched 
her fists at these words and said, "My rage burns and I can not stand here. Let's 
be on our way."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona nodded, 
"Agreed, Dagda. Let us move on, we have a very long journey ahead of us." Together, 
the group turned and began to walk back the way they had come.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Firiona Vie and 
her party, now fully assembled, set forth on their journey to the new lands to 
confront the Ring of Scale. Fighting against the raging blizzard, their faces 
drawn and determined, they disappeared into the furious storm.</font></p>
