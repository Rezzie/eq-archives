              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>I’d like to talk about the Test Server, what it’s for, and how we use it. And I’d also like to address the 
                kiting issue. Recently, we put a patch on the Test Server to experiment with ways to deal with the ‘kiting’ 
                problem (that being that some classes can kill NPCs that con yellow or red to them with little or no risk 
                involved). </p>
              <p>First, let me say that we put things on the Test Server to test them. To make this more clear, we’ve begun 
                to explain in more detail the changes we are putting on the Test Server in the patch message, and we’ve also 
                included a disclaimer in the patch message reminding people that these changes may or may not make their way 
                to the live servers. Once we have the change on the Test Server, our internal testing team, in conjunction 
                with players on the Test Server (some of whom volunteer quite a bit of their time to help us – thanks!), determine 
                if the change has the desired effect. </p>
              <p>So I guess what I’m saying here is don’t necessarily assume that because something is on the Test Server 
                it will always make it that way to the live servers. And please read the patch messages carefully – there 
                were all sorts of inaccurate assumptions being made as to the changes until, and even after, we posted a clarification 
                on the patch message.</p>
              <p>Now, that said, we are going to address the kiting issue in some regard, and we will do it as fairly as possible. 
                We have nothing against players who prefer soloing to grouping, and we’ve never really taken a negative stance 
                to kiting in the past. All that is true. But game dynamics change, and as the game and player base mature, 
                flaws in game design and mechanics can be exposed. I know some players think, &quot;Well, why didn’t they 
                address this in beta?&quot; Well, I truly wish we had, but the problem wasn't as evident then, and well, we 
                do make mistakes. I think we did a pretty darn good job learning from our competition and various MUDs of 
                the past, but EverQuest is not perfect, and it will continue to evolve and mature, and if problems arise or 
                are exposed, it is our responsibility to the long term health of the game to make changes.</p>
              <p>I’ve always said, and this dates back to before Beta 1, that EverQuest is primarily a group-oriented cooperative 
                game, but that certain race/class combinations would be able to effectively solo, and that soloing would typically 
                be more time consuming. And I stick by what I said. As the game has matured, however, certain methods of kiting 
                now allow some classes to solo NPCs that con yellow or red with little to no risk. We, the designers of EverQuest, 
                feel this is not only unfair to other race/class combinations that by design can typically only solo blues, 
                but that it is also threatens the long term health of the game.</p>
              <p>Over the next couple of weeks we will test various changes on the Test Server, the goal being to address 
                this issue but NOT to remove kiting as a viable playstyle. Our internal testing team will work with the development 
                team (which includes people who have played all sorts of classes to mid and high levels) and I’m confident 
                we’ll find a fair solution. In the meantime, I encourage our player base to visit the Test Server (run testeverquest.exe 
                from your EverQuest directory) and to try out the changes, and to give us feedback. We’ve also made some significant 
                changes to how PvP combat works and we’d love some feedback on that as well.</p>
