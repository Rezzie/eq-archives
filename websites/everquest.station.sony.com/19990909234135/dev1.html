<P>Welcome to the first installment of the EverQuest developer diary!  </P>

<P>Whew, it’s been busy here!  With March 16<SUP>th</SUP> (EverQuest’s release date) right around the corner, the entire team, heck the entire company, has been hard at work on last minute details.  The programmers are squashing bugs right and left, the world builders are tuning the last zones and entering last minute quests, and the infrastructure guys are getting the billing system ironed out.   Most of us just worked 7 days straight, and typically 12-15 hours a day at that.  </P>

<P>But it’s well worth it, believe me.</P>

<P>Why?  Well, EverQuest just had another birthday… her third to be exact.  Official work on EverQuest began March 4<SUP>th</SUP>, 1996, when I and lead programmer Steve Clover were hired to make a massively multiplayer game for Sony Interactive Studios (now 989 Studios).  So looking ahead at the next week we’re finally seeing the finish line.  To work on a project this long, which as truly been a labor of love, and to be so close to seeing it in the stores… it’s awesome.</P>

<P>I’m also just as excited to think of EverQuest’s future after launch.  I’ve been telling people for a while now that EverQuest is more than a product, it’s a service.  There’s so many more things we can and will do with this game.  Creating a dynamic, ever-changing world is what this is really all about, and I can’t wait to see Norrath evolve and expand.  Especially the dynamic quests we have planned… those will truly bring the world alive.  In fact, all of you in Phase 4 can look forward to some amazing events we have planned the final evening of the beta.  </P>

<P>Anyway, back to work for me.  The game is very close to being ready for March 16<SUP>th</SUP>, but we’ve still a bit of work to do.  I hope to see you in Norrath soon.</P>
