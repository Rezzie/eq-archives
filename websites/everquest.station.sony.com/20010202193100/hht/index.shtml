                          also take note of non-balance concerns as well.</i></p>

                          by people that start their posts with "I didn't read

                          I don't want to stifle any creativity. But I have to 
                          admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same 
                          suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing 
                          good new ideas late in threads when they are buried 
                          among things that others have covered several times

                          It is a humbled and chastened monk who tells the tale 
                          of his greed, and the group's further adventures within 
                          the Sarnak Fortress.</p>

                          </b>On Sunday, February 4th at 4pm Eastern (1pm Pacific), the Steamfont rodents will be released to cause havoc and mayhem.  Tuatha de Danann of The Tribunal server is sponsoring a few Gnomish activities that should prove to be fun for all of us, and annoying for everyone else! I mean, who isn't annoyed by a gnome?</p>

<p align="justify">First event:  classic gnomish gnaked gnewbie run starting at Ak'anon. Alcohol provided and mandatory (of course), prizes awarded.</p>

<p align="justify">Second event:  the Gnomish Inquizition, hosted by our own Kainazzo. Match wits  and beat our quizmaster.. while drunk of course.. to win more prizes.</p>

<p align="justify">Third event:  Drunken newbie "test-of-tactics" type brawling in the lawn in front of Ak'anon.  Need we say more?</p>

<p align="justify">Registration:  </p>

<p align="justify">1. Create a level 1 gnome of whichever class you choose - remember the third event, so if your friends sign up with you - coordinate class choices.</p>

<p align="justify">2. IMPORTANT: Email me at gnomerun@usa.net with the following information:  The name and class of the gnome you created, as well as the name, level, and class of your "main" character that will receive any prizes that you might win.  As an option, send me a tell in-game to register.</p>

<p align="justify">3. Be online with your gnome out in front of Ak'Anon by 3:30pm Eastern/ 12:30pm Pacific for briefing, debriefing, debuffing, and distribution of alcoholic substances.  Anyone showing up who did not register via email or contact me in game will not be allowed to participate.</p>

<p align="justify">Prizes are geared for low to mid levels.  We have a "cash" pot that will be  divvied up, and a whole lot(!) of items valued upwards of 1000pp.  If you have more than one character, register your lowbie as the char being represented by your gnome. For added fun, we will not be announcing who is who until the end.</p>

<p align="justify">Good luck!</p>
