                           but I'm afraid it's pretty old. =( I lost over 400 registered 
                           names. =( To those of you who were deleted, I'm very 
                           sorry. I am implementing a plan to do more regular backups 
                           so that if this happens again, it won't be so devastating.</font>

                           <p><i><font size="-1"> I have noticed that weapons and 
                              shields are independant 3D models with their own texture, 
                              thus not being a direct part of the character model 
                              - Are the rest of the armor done in a simular way, 
                              or is that only a different texture ? (helmets comes 
                              to mind.) I sat and played EQ ... got hungry, ran 
                              out of food - Then I suddenly realised that I haven't 
                              seen any Twinkies (the ones you eat, not players with 
                              super equipment) in the game yet !! "AAaaargh ... 
                              a scandal", I thought, "Time to ask Milo if it's right, 
                              they've GOT to be there !" SO - Is it really correct 
                              that there are no twinkies in Everquest ?</font></i>

                           Hills Area. The members who wish to play this game must 
                           pay 5pp to join, and come to the North Qeynos Zone. Once 
                           everyone is in N. Qeynos, Arcanine will zone in and give 
                           them all consent to loot his corpse. Everyone will zone

                           you must buy a "ticket" for 5pp. You can buy asmany tickets 
                           as you wish. Each player who enters will be given a number 
                           for their ticket, and then the ticketmaster will use 
                           the /random command. The grand prize winner will receive 
                           a Staff of Writhing! The first prize will be a Flowing 
                           Black Robe! The second prize will be 40% of the lottery 
                           money, and the third prize will be 25% of the money!

                           generally be within 2 levels of each other) This event

                           Drunken Brawls will be just a bit different. *grin* The

                           beverages. Once the players are good and drunk, the players 
                           will give some plat to the ref. The battle will commence 
                           once both players shed their weapons into their backpacks. 
                           The opponents will fight hand to hand with no ability 
                           to cast spells. After the brawl has been fought, the 
                           victor will be given their money, and also their opponents 
                           money. (Booze compliments of Ceenla and Ibzen)</font>

                        <blockquote><font size="-1">The War of the Secret Fire</font> 
                           <p><font size="-1"> The morning mist over the commonlands 
                              seemed to shift and move through the valleys as if 
                              almost alive. From her vantage point far above, the 
                              scout took in the lay of the land, committing the 
                              details to memory. She was half elven and half human, 
                              wearing rough leather armor and leaning on a staff 
                              that bore her slight weight with ease. It was pitch 
                              dark, but her eyes were able to see.</font> 
                           <p><font size="-1"> She was one of the few entrusted 
                              with the plans, with the knowledge of what was to 
                              come, what would happen in a scarce fortnight, following 
                              the Festival of Life in Freeport. This landscape, 
                              so rich in beauty and with teeming life, would soon 
                              be a place of death, soaked in the blood of the dark 
                              ones as they fell under an lethal ambush. From here, 
                              the army of light would then march into Nektulos and 
                              then Neriak and collapse the underground city in upon 
                              itself. It was appropriate, she mused. Evil always 
                              consumed itself, and thus Neriak would perish in a 
                              fitting way.</font> 
                           <p><font size="-1"> As she took to the path and began 
                              jogging down the side of the mountain into the mist, 
                              she briefly felt remorse at the imminent loss of the 
                              dark elven race from the face of Norrath, but it was 
                              quickly replaced with her anger at the loss of two 
                              of her siblings at the hands of her dark cousins. 
                              Nay, she thought, the evil must be washed away, and 
                              this time none shall stop us.</font>

                        <font size="-1">Here is a new site that will help Guilds

                           allow for any member, of any guild, on any server to 
                           create events dynamically by day of month, event place, 
                           guild name, and time. Hopefully, this should help alleviate 
                           board messages with current Dragon rotations and so forth 
                           - since each planned event will be clearly and easily 
                           visible to everyone. If guild A has scheduled a PoF raid 
                           on the 15th of January, guild B will be able to look 
                           and see that they have and plan another day accordingly!</font>

                           board for the discussion of the application. There are 
                           several event areas that need to be added; so please

                        <li><font size="-1"> Some changes have been made to the 
                           exit of Nagafen's Lair into the Lavastorm Mountains. 
                           This will hopefully reduce if not solve the bug that 
                           causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen's 
                           Lair. Please let us know how this goes.</font></li>
                        <li><font size="-1"> Due to feedback received from the customers 
                           concerning the density of fog during rainstorms, visibility 
                           has been increased.</font></li>
                        <li><font size="-1"> All drops of steel weapons have been 
                           replaced with higher quality fine-steel weapons of the 
                           same type. This change was made to reduce the amount 
                           of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper 
                           levels. The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior 
                           to the steel weapons that were dropping, they just sell 
                           to vendors for less money.</font></li>
                        <li><font size="-1"> Casting times have been implemented 
                           on several activatable items. This was done to correct 
                           issues that could arise from people chain-casting these 
                           items. </font></li>

                           is no longer necessary and has been backed out. The Levitate

                           a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to

                           which upon further consideration is not compatible with 
                           our vision of those classes' roles. This change will 
                           basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of 
                           Hit Points) between rangers and warriors of the same

                           due to their lower damage output. Though the Paladin

                           to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting 
                           spells should help them become more effective tanks.

                           being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, 
                           do not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which 
                           uses the same skill. Paladins are typically the only

                           the Necromancer's Feign Death tactic, as well as reviewing 
                           public opinion on the matter, we have implemented a change. 
                           As we would like everyone to understand why we feel this 
                           change was necessary, here is a summary of the issue:</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Problem: <br>
                           Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in 
                           all circumstances, providing offensive tactics that are 
                           abusive. For this ability to remain balanced, the pet 
                           should follow the same rules as invisibility. Offensive 
                           tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting 
                           a saving throw verses the effect. Since creatures do 
                           NOT get a direct save verses feign death (as you cast 
                           it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once 
                           you have feigned death, there is very little risk to 
                           necromancer himself. As this tactic involves charming 
                           an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which could 
                           be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers 
                           to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could. 
                           This situation is well beyond what would preserve game 
                           balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty 
                           Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for example). </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Example: <br>
                           While there are many examples of how the Necromancer 
                           Feign Death tactic is abusive, one of the most egregious 
                           occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower Guk. The room 
                           consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself. 
                           Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily 
                           solo the room at virtually no risk to himself. The Necro 
                           can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead. 
                           To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok 
                           and Charms the other. When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, 
                           he feigns. The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and 
                           kills it, taking considerable damage during the fight. 
                           The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord returns to 
                           its spawn point. When the necromancer gets back up, he 
                           is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign 
                           Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns 
                           again. The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed. When 
                           the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul 
                           Lord AND nearly full mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, 
                           and the Necro collects his special items.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Solution: <br>
                           Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where 
                           summoned pets suicide and the charmed ones break Charm. 
                           We do not want, however, to adversely affect lower level 
                           Necromancers to such a large degree. What we do recognize 
                           is the need to prevent higher level Necro's from exploiting 
                           key spawn points. Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed 
                           NPC will immediately break Charm. However, summoned NPCs 
                           (pets) will NOT be affected. While this still allows 
                           the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned 
                           pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon 
                           spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does. </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> *Manastone Changed*</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> The players have raised many concerns 
                           about the power of the Manastone, which no longer drops. 
                           They cite that people without a Manastone are not as 
                           welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other 
                           areas as people with them. Since dropping additional 
                           Manastones via quest or removing them from the existing 
                           populace is not desirable, we've decided to make it so 
                           that the Manastone will no longer function in the alternate 
                           planes. Furthermore, it will not function in any of the 
                           zones included with the Kunark Expansion.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> We apologize to those adversely affected 
                           by this change. Our general goal is to avoid making changes 
                           to items in peoples' possession, however we felt this 
                           change was, all things considered, warranted and for 
                           the benefit of the game as a whole.<br>

                        two new articles, an article by our newest staff member 
                        Azerfal based on life in the PvP worlds of Norrath and Ask 
                        the Assembly an article where you can post your question 
                        and we the assembly will attempt to find an answer to post 
                        in the next volume. We have also sorted out the problems 
                        with our message board and invite you to join in conversation

                        that will continue to work as well. Everything has been

                        program known as ICQ. If you currently reside in the dimension

                           It has many additional features, but the best of all 
                           is the ActiveLists. This is a form of chat room run on 
                           someone's computer. In this case, I am running one for 
                           all of the land of Xegony. In case you would like to

                        has a special event planned for the Tunare server: </font></p>
                     <blockquote><font size="-1">There are times when I'm out adventuring 
                        alone, when my friends are nowhere to be found, and my travels 
                        usually bring me to West Karana, where I prey upon a few 
                        of Qeynos's corrupt guards. Recently, I stopped by the Miller 
                        farm and had a chat with Furball Miller, who informed me 
                        of some strange goings-on in South Karana. A new clan of 
                        gnolls has invaded, and they are evil through and through!</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Not too long ago, they raided and conquered 
                           the Splitpaw clan of gnolls there, they took the Splitpaw 
                           home for themselves, and imprisoned or just slaughtered 
                           their Splitpaw cousins.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Later I brought this matter before Heartwood 
                           Master, and though Kelethin is far from South Karana, 
                           he agrees that if given the chance these new gnolls could 
                           be a greater threat to Norrath than some may imagine. 
                           We ordered a Scout of Tunare to explore the old lair 
                           of the Splitpaw, a young elf who was adept at hiding 
                           and sneaking and exploring, and after two weeks she had 
                           yet to return, and we feared the worst.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> I took it upon myself to travel there 
                           with a few friends to look for this lost scout, and did 
                           find her.. hanging from a noose just inside the cave. 
                           Her body has since been returned to Kelethin for proper 
                           burial ceremonies and Heartwood Master has ordered me, 
                           the General of Tunare, to cleanse the land of this new 
                           threat.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> And thus, the call goes out to all able 
                           bodied adventurers, to join or assist the Soldiers of 
                           Tunare as we raid the Conquered Lair of the Splitpaw!</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Date and Time:<br>
                           This event is to be held Saturday, January 22nd, at 8 
                           PM EST, on the Tarew Marr server. All interested parties 
                           will meet on the stone bridge in South Karana, and from 
                           here we will march on to the lair no later than 9 PM. 
                           The lair can be found STRAIGHT south from the bridge.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Dungeon Information:<br>
                           This event is geared toward players with levels in the 
                           high 20's, on up to 50. The new gnolls in Paw have levels 
                           that range from around 30 to around 40, the deeper in 
                           you go, the tougher they get. Think of it as inhabited 
                           by gnolls as tough as cyclopses and giants, with a bunch 
                           of casters too, and a couple of tough, poisonous snakes 
                           (It's kinda like the temple of Cazic Thule in toughness, 
                           and train-ness).</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> All loot in Paw, except the Robe of 
                           Ishva and (I was told it drops here) Summon Corpse spell 
                           scroll is random. You could, for example, kill a gnoll 
                           right out front and get a nice new set of those Splitpaw 
                           gloves, or you could be very deep inside and still get 
                           the gloves on something. This is sort of a nice change, 
                           since you don't have to go to 1 set spot and "camp" a 
                           special monster, you're free to explore and still have 
                           just as good of a chance of getting the good loot as 
                           you would if you sat around.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Offhand, I can't remember the names 
                           of all the gnoll classes in there now. I do know that 
                           the weaker white furred-gnolls tend to be rogues, and 
                           will be happy to backstab you for around 150. The tan-furred 
                           gnolls are the tougher ones. Tesch gnolls are warriors, 
                           all the rest are casters (I think Nesch or something 
                           is a cleric, Rosch is an enchanter or magician), there 
                           are a lot of different types of gnolls with names that 
                           change as they get tougher. But no matter how tough they 
                           are, the will ALWAYS run away when the fight isn't in 
                           their favor anymore. Trains get VERY bad if you're careless 
                           there, so make sure you snare or root every gnoll you 
                           are fighting when they're around half dead, and keep 
                           them snared or rooted. If they run, the WILL come back 
                           with a lot of friends (and these trains can, and have, 
                           easily slaughtered full 40+ groups)</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> I've been told the robe and summon corpse 
                           spell drop on a gnoll that spawns every 12 hours. If 
                           we happen to get him once that'll be great, but don't 
                           expect to be able to stay there and camp the place, cuz 
                           he won't come back :) Also, my group has explored the 
                           place a lot, we've found the spawn spot of 2 different 
                           "named" gnolls, killed them both once or twice, and every 
                           time they had nothing but pocket change. So in other 
                           words, this place is pretty much camp-free.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Don't come if you just want loot, you're 
                           not gonna get much. But DO come if you want to have a 
                           lot of fun, and do something besides sit around bored 
                           in Sol B or Lower Guk and argue over camp spots.</font>

                           to a halt. At least one prominent game developer blamed 
                           EverQuest for product delays, and for several weeks GameSpot's 
                           editors were spending more time exploring Norrath than 
                           they were doing their jobs. That's because exploring 
                           the world Verant created is an incredible experience, 
                           especially when you can do so with friends. And knowing 
                           that Norrath will continue to grow, both through Verant's 
                           continual addition of new zones and the forthcoming expansion,

                        to make the move official early next week, but Gamestats, 
                        who hosted my site, got ahold of my domain name transfer 
                        and decided instead to take my site down and transfer people 
                        logging onto the site to another eq site. Thus those who 
                        try my old domain will instead find themselves at maximumeq. 
                        The domain has not yet transferred, but it will be <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a> 
                        when it gets transferred, hopefully early next week. In 
                        the meantime, you can go to <a href="http://216.155.25.102" target="_blank">http://216.155.25.102</a> 
                        to get onto the site. I am sorry for the inconvienince to 
                        everyone, but it is really not my fault. Thank you.</font>

                           In this event we will have every one who wishes to join 
                           pay 1pp for the entrnace fee. Then you will start a half

                           name. (THIS IS SO WE DON'T HAVE TRACKERS) The first person

                           of weapon. ONLY THE FIRST PERSON WILL GET A PRIZE FROM

                           then get 50% of the platium entrance fee.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> LOTTERY:<br>
                           The Lottery will simply use the /random command. There 
                           will be a ticketmaster. The ticketmaster will stand at 
                           the gate.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> There will be three stages to the lottery. 
                           The first will happen first, second will happen second 
                           and so on.</font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> FIRST STAGE - 2pp per ticket<br>
                           SECOND STAGE - 5pp per ticket<br>

                        <p><font size="-1"> All lottery contestants must give the 
                           platinum to the ticketmaster. The ticketmaster then writes 
                           down their number. Fore example, if Sarina was the 6th 
                           person to buy a ticket, she would be listed as No. 6. 
                           Then, the ticketmaster will use the /rand command for 
                           how ever many people there are entered. Whoever wins 
                           gets 50% of the lottery earnings.</font>

                        The Leaders of the fair city of Erudin have recently discovered 
                        a band of Erudite Heretics on a small island stronghold 
                        located at Kerra Ridge. It is from this location that information 
                        has leaked detailing plans for the occupation of Odus and 
                        the systematic pillage of Erudin itself. All attempts to 
                        reach the stronghold by Erudite forces have failed due to 
                        intevention with the native Kerra. </font> 
                        <p><font size="-1"> Erudin requests our aid in dealing with 
                           this latest threat to the peace of Norrath and we have 
                           responded. We will assemble our forces on the beaches 
                           of Toxxulia forest on Sat. January 8th 2000. The assault 
                           will begin at 7pm EST with the swim to Kerra Isle. We 
                           have persuaded the Erudite Government to release the 
                           Kerra outpost on Kerra Isle in Eruds Crossing commonly 
                           known as Wisp Island, from any responsibility in this 
                           affair. Also those Kerra have assured us that no unprovoked 
                           aggression shall be vented on our forces as a result 
                           of this campaign. Please join us. All classes and races
