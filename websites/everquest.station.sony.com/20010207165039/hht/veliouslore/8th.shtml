            <p align="left" class="subHeader"> Day 8</p>
            <p>Strange and wondrous tidings have arrived from the exploration party this day. They have discovered another new race living amid the mountain crags of the Great Divide, and most amazingly of all, their missing companion! It seems he was found, unconscious, near their home.</p><br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day8_1.html', '775')"><img src="images/day8_1_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>The 
              group bid a frosty farewell to their hosts after being refused permission 
              to search the Pit for their friend. Even though the Coldain assured 
              them the denial was due to the dangers that lie therein, our band 
              of adventurers would not have abandoned their comrade if there were 
              any sign of life. Since they had not received any word or image 
              from him in 24 hours they decided, sadly, that he must have fallen 
              victim to the creature seen in the final transmission. </p>
            <br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day8_2.html', '775')"><img src="images/day8_2_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>A 
              slightly smaller party left Icewell Keep, collecting an image of 
              the castle’s main gates on their way out, and headed back into the 
              mountain range to explore. As disheartened as they were by the loss 
              of their friend, nevertheless, they had a job to do and they intended 
              to do it well. </p>
            <br clear=all>

<p>In their travels through the mountains, now without benefit of Coldain guide, the party found the going rough and the path nonexistent. Freezing winds blasted down the sides of the mountains as if E’Ci herself were trying to sweep them away. </p><br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day8_3.html', '775')"><img src="images/day8_3_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>The 
              party reported that they had become disoriented and concerned for 
              their survival, when they were startled by the approach of a large 
              and bulky figure. They prepared for combat, only to find that the 
              creature was calm and peaceful.</p>
            <br clear=all>

<p>The being they encountered appears to be some sort of intelligent bovine creature, resembling something like a yak. Perhaps intelligent is a misleading term, as the yak men or "tizmak" as they refer to themselves, do not possess the faculties common to the greater races of Norrath. Still, they had the presence of mind to lead the adventurers to their lair in the mountains, and provide them food and shelter from the storm.</p><br clear=all>
            <p><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day8_4.html', '775')"><img src="images/day8_4_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>We 
              can only imagine their surprise when they found their lost companion 
              among the yak people! As it turns out, he had no recollection whatsoever 
              of leaving the Pit area, his last memory being the face of that 
              icy creature as it widened its maw to bite. In fact, the yak men 
              explained to our group that he had been unconscious ("dead-sleep" 
              was the term they used, reportedly) when they found him near their 
              cave. He was still quite dazed and confused and healing slowly when 
              they found him. Still in all, the party was overjoyed to find themselves 
              once again intact.</p>
            <br clear=all>

<p>A warm stay in the yak men’s cave and our party will venture forth in a much better frame of mind on the morrow...</p><br clear=all>
