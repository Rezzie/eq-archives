<p align="center"><b><font size="4" color="ff9900" class="header">Ognit Eznertob</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ognit is most happy in a 
warm, well-furnished study with tomes and papers and tools surrounding him. He 
is actually known to smile when a formula he has been working with is finally 
completed. Other than that, he is a grump. His hobby is tinkering with devices 
and contraptions. Remarkably intelligent, Ognit is cursed with a lust for knowledge 
that draws him out of his study into the futile world of the mundane everyman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He met his travelling companion 
Dabner, when a Clockwork Scrubber he was working upon went rogue and attacked 
him. Dabner heard the commotion and healed Ognit as Ognit blasted the crazed beast. 
Ognit was most grateful and they spoke for some time over dinner.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ognit could not get rid 
of Dabner from that point on. As the noon sun warmed the underground caverns of 
Ak`Anon the temperature rises a scant 0.7 degrees or so. Ognit could predict the 
arrival of Dabner based on the thermometer on the wall of his study. At noontime, 
Dabner would finish his morning devotions and check in with Ognit. He would prattle 
on endlessly about anything that had sparked his interest that morning. At first 
Ognit viewed the intrusions as a nuisance, but later Ognit began to tolerate the 
visits, even looked forward to them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He began to count on Dabner's 
visits. Beyond his taste for rational reasoning, he found himself asking for Dabner's 
"insight" on certain things, whether they be mechanical, magical, or spiritual. 
Occasionally his responses were just plain silly in Ognit's eyes. But once in 
a while he was truly, dead-on accurate about things. Dabner's occasional insights 
into the nature of the universe were invaluable. From that nebulous point forward, 
they were the best of friends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ognit enjoys the stories 
and jokes that Dabner tells. Occasionally he even laughs. As much as he hates 
to admit it (and he never will publicly), Dabner is a source of inspiration for 
him, as well as good company. He also looks on Dabner as a student--albeit a poor 
one--but he is more than willing to at least try to teach him. Dabner ranks as 
one of the few people in the world that can actually make him laugh. That being 
said, Ognit's attitude towards Dabner alternates between one who is a trusted 
friend and one who is a troublesome nuisance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ognit's attitude towards 
Dagda is one of grudging respect on the surface, but true friendship underneath. 
She is a savage in his eyes and has vowed to protect him because he is "weak", 
something he takes great exception to. At the same time, he sees her devotion 
to Dabner and himself as something both noble and worthy of great respect. As 
one who has spent his life immersed in books and spurning contact with actual 
people, he has found it a rare thing that others would take a shine to one such 
as he. Furthermore, it makes him happy to see that his friend Dabner has such 
a powerful ally, given his inherent weakness in mind and naivete. If you really 
pressed him, he would admit that Dagda is his friend and with a bit of prodding, 
she would do the same. They share an intense, almost sibling-like, rivalry and 
he and Dagda argue often about anything and everything. However, their conversations 
are the most lively and indeed even friendly when they are discussing something 
he is tinkering. </font></p>
