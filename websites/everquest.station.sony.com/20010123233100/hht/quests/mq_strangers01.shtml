size=4><span class="header">Stranger in Qeynos</span></font></b></p>
<p align="justify">Esteemed members of the Council,</p>
<p align="justify">I write to thee my deepest concerns with a troubled heart for 
our fair city, Qeynos. Our once outstanding community of order and justice has 
fallen into a veiled mask of chaos with each night passing. Strangers walk through 
the streets within the shadows of night, with a loathsome disposition, holding 
little to no regard for our laws and the fine people who enforce them.</p>
<p align="justify">Some of these unsavory characters have passed through my very 
tavern, their manner like anything but that of a decent citizen. Just the other 
night, within the wee hours of the morn, one of these individuals demanded ale, 
and then refused to make payment for my services and wares. As if he had not already 
caused enough of a bother, he made rude comments and holdings toward one of my 
serving girls. Unfortunately, he had fled before I could make petition to the 
guards for assistance with this thief of sorts. That was not the first, nor has 
it been the last encounter with these faint, but steadily more apparent changes 
that are afflicting our city. A bad element has rose up in our fair city, with 
little more warning then would be given for a foul tainted wind.</p>
<p align="justify">Alas, I fear that my establishment is not the only one to be met 
with this ugly face of change. Athrin Tashir, a scholar within the Temple of Life 
and a frequent and welcomed visitor to the Lion's Mane Tavern, brought his troubles 
to me over a glass of ale this night just past the ninth chime of our lovely clock. 
It appears that he too has been confronted with the recent disturbances that plague 
our city. Within the past fortnight the scholar has been mortified by the disturbing 
disappearances of sacred scrolls from the Temple's Library. For days he took it 
as the careless work of the newest members to fall beneath his tutelage until 
he caught eye of the truth to his lost scrolls. A youthful lad, as Athrin had 
described to me, was caught searching through the shelves and crates, bunches 
of scrolls held carelessly within his hands. Athrin attempted to apprehend the 
thief, but as the misfortune that had befallen myself, the scoundrel fled without 
a scratch.</p>
<p align="justify">I ask of you, dear and noble council, to recognize the disturbance 
and honor our plea for your eyes and ears to the matter. I fear gravely for our 
humble city of order and justice.</p>

Owner of the Lion's Mane Tavern<br>
Proud Citizen of Qeynos</p>
