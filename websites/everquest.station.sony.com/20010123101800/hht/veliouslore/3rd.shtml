              Discovery of the Coldain</span> 
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left" class="subHeader"> Day 3</p>
              <p align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/14.html', '775')"><img src="images/image14_lo.jpg" width="280" height="210" align="left" hspace="8" border="0"></a>Our 
                intrepid explorers have found yet another hitherto unknown race! 
                That is, the descendants of a group of ancient dwarven explorers 
                have apparently lived and thrived on this icy continent for centuries! 
                The dwarves refer to themselves as Coldain and were encountered 
                by our adventurers in their travels. The Coldain’s initial settlement, 
                which was known as Froststone, now lies in ruins, a grim reminder 
                of ancient slaughter at the hands of ice giants. The valiant Coldain, 
                however, have rebuilt their city at great cost, both in resources 
                and lives.<br clear=all>
                <a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/10.html', '775')"><img src="images/image10_lo.jpg" width="280" height="210" hspace="8" align="right" border="0"></a> 
              </p>
              <p align="left">The Coldain dwarves recounted their history for 
                the party, and in the process explained that the keep they had 
                visited, that known as Ry`Gorr Keep, apparently was erected atop 
                a beautiful and technologically remarkable warren of caverns carved 
                from the velium that covers these lands. Though they have not 
                yet braved the snow orcs who guard it and explore, our party has 
                obtained images of it from their hosts.<br clear=all>
              </p>
              <p align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/7.html', '775')"><img src="images/image7_lo.jpg" width="280" height="210" align="left" hspace="8" border="0"></a>The 
                dwarves call these caves the Crystal Caverns. From what we’ve 
                seen in their images, the caves are quite both stunning and cunning. 
                Their design is attributed to a miner hero of theirs named Glight 
                Snowchipper, who in turn received his inspiration directly from 
                Brell in a vision. When the ice giants overran the dwarves back 
                in the time of Dain Frostreaver II (the adventurers report that 
                the leader of these dwarves is always referred to as the Dain), 
                they fled in the only direction they could, deeper into the earth.<br clear=all>
                <a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/8.html', '775')"><img src="images/image8_lo.jpg" width="280" height="210" align="right" hspace="8" border="0"></a> 
              </p>
              <p align="left">While the dwarves were hiding in the frigid caverns 
                after fleeing Froststone, he envisioned this labyrinth of ice 
                where the dwarves could build a haven at the center, and hide 
                from the ice giants. The walls were planned to be semi-translucent 
                so that invading giants would become easily lost and fall into 
                ingenious deathtraps.<br clear=all>
              </p>
              <p align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/13.html', '775')"><img src="images/image13_lo.jpg" width="280" height="210" align="left" hspace="8" border="0"></a>For 
                thirty years after creating the Crystal Caverns and the hidden 
                city at their center, the labyrinth served as a refuge, until 
                the ice giants learned of its existence by following a trade caravan. 
                Slagd Frozentoe of the ice giants led an invasion force of 250 
                warriors to the caverns, intent on annihilating the Coldain. Glight 
                Snowchipper himself led the dwarves’ defense effort, leading the 
                ice giants deep into the confusing tunnels.<br clear=all>
              </p>
              <p align="left">As a last resort, when the giants were nearing the 
                Coldain refugees’ hiding place deep in the caverns, Glight selflessly 
                sacrificed himself and his men by diverting them to a little-used 
                tunnel shaft, then creating an avalanche that brought tons of 
                snow, ice, velium and rock down on giants and dwarves alike, allowing 
                the rest of the Coldain to escape. Our adventuring friends mentioned 
                having heard a rumor whispered among the Coldain that may be more 
                wish than truth – that a small number of the original group who 
                lived in the settlement at the maze’s center refused to leave 
                and still remain in the isolated city.<br clear=all>
              </p>
              <p align="left">The Coldain went on to build themselves a new city, 
                known as Thurgadin (sometimes, we hear, they refer to it as New 
                Froststone, in memoriam), which is cleverly hidden in the mountains. 
                Our explorers have promised to provide us with further details 
                on that after having visited. We anxiously await their next missive!<br clear=all>
