<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="ff9900" class="header">Lanys 
T`Vyl </font></b></p>
<font face="Copperplate Gothic Light" size=2> </font> 
<p><i><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Moon of Blood: 
</font></b></i> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The moon of blood is the 
most holy night for Innoruuk's followers and occurs once every twenty-seven months. 
On this heinous night every follower of Innoruuk must murder a good being to honor 
his or her god. The dark elves have their own tradition on this night as well. 
The nobles choose a commoner to mate with and then sacrifice to their dark god.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two to three score years 
ago Vendela G`Kal, a high priestess of Innoruuk, attended the Festival of the 
Moon of Blood in the Neriak commons. As the festival progressed, she noticed an 
exceptionally fine looking common male in the throng. The high priestess bade 
him to be her sacrifice to Innoruuk. She led him to her inner sanctum, where they 
copulated throughout the night. Spent, she fell into a deep sleep. When she awoke, 
the dark elf was gone. One year later, she gave birth. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The child borne from this 
chance encounter showed remarkable abilities beyond that which any ordinary Teir`Dal 
had ever possessed. Many saw this, and took note. As she grew, many tried to end 
her life, fearing her for her power and abilities. On the first such attempt, 
an ancient shadow knight saw the three would be assassins and slew them as they 
made their attempt upon the Child of Innoruuk. After the battle, Innoruuk appeared 
before the Shadow Knight and bade him to do his bidding. He assigned the Shadow 
Knight to teach and protect his child and gave him a new body to do so. Under 
his tutelage, the child grew strong in both the art of combat and in the dark 
magics of Necromancy. She is now stands ready to bring hate across all of Norrath.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lanys T`Vyl is the Child 
of Hate. She is the embodiment of Hate upon Norrath. She carries herself with 
a deadly grace. Any who oppose her will be submitted to her unforgiving wrath 
and those that follow her are said to eventually be led to glory. She is very 
loyal to those that follow her, as she cherishes her father's creations and looks 
upon them as her own, but mercy be felt for those Teir`Dal who would betray her 
for their torments would be everlasting within her grasp. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through the past year she 
has risen and taken a name for herself amongst the mortal history of Norrath, 
her heart scorched with a great hatred for the new 'grace' that has fallen upon 
the earth. The Koada`Dal known as Firiona Vie, claimed to be the Champion of Tunare, 
has sparked an extreme hatred within Lanys's already darkened heart, a hatred 
so cold that it has numbed the rest of her senses. One year ago a battle was fought 
within Kithicor Wood, a battle between Lanys T`Vyl and her army, granted to her 
personally by King Naythox Thex, and Firiona Vie. There Lanys was defeated by 
the might of good, but Laarthik's own sacrifice saved her life, allowing her to 
be cradled within the realm of Hate; her mortal form was forever sealed away by 
the powers of Tunare.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For many a moon Lanys remained 
locked away within her father's realm, patiently basking within her torments as 
she awaited her return. With the assistance of a powerful necromancer, whose name 
she has since forgotten within her chaotic thoughts, Lanys's soul was transported 
safely into the material realm of Norrath, her soul replaced into a Teir`Dal female's 
body. Having defeated Tunare's bind upon her, Lanys returned to Neriak to only 
be met by disdain and intense disgust from many of the people within Neriak - 
her recent failure reflecting furiously within their eyes. Lanys has sense sought 
to bring revenge to the 'bastard wench' who had caused her turmoil, vowing that 
she will be the death of Firiona Vie and eventually, the of Tunare herself. </font></p>
