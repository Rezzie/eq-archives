size=4><span class="header">Stranger in Qeynos</span></font></b></p>
<p align="justify">Mordavin Telase, the mastermind behind a grand conspiracy to overthrow 
Antonius Bayle and take control of Qeynos, was apprehended today. A grand trial 
took place but alas, Mordavin managed to escape. Details of the trial are below. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Mordavin was tried and charged with Conspiracy to Commit Genocide, 
Treason, Destruction of Sacred Natural Resources, Grand Larceny and Murder. After 
lively testimony from Earron Huntlan, Al`Kabor, Athrin Tashir, Rykonis Sw`Vaye 
and a host of other citizens, Mordavin's plan was exposed. He unabashedly admitted 
to each of these charges, thumbing his nose at the jurors and prosecutor. </p>
<p align="justify">The Bloodsabres sought to destroy all life in Qeynos and the surrounding 
areas in an effort to take control of the city. Mordavin and the Bloodsabres sought 
to summon the Avatar of Bertoxxulous and use his power to unleash a powerful and 
virulent plague that would extinguish all life as far as the Karanas. </p>
<p align="justify">Athrin Tashir testified concerning the thieves that were ransacking 
the Temple of Life and attempting to steal their sacred scrolls a daily basis. 
Ironically, the Bloodsabres needed the research of their mortal enemies in order 
to find a way to become immune to the very plague they were to unleash. Though 
most of the scrolls were returned, a great number nevertheless fell into the hands 
of the Bloodsabres. The research was completed and a way devised to protect them 
from the plague found. </p>
<p align="justify">Al`Kabor revealed that the Runed Branding Irons would have been 
used to brand all those friendly to the Bloodsabres and their causes with a certain 
sigil. This sigil would have rendered them immune to the effects of the plague. 
The strange, obsolete words people were finding, when combined with the hidden 
runes found on the prime numbered diary pages found blowing around the city produced 
one of several incantations. These incantations are part of the spell that would 
have been used to summon the Avatar of Bertoxxulous. With the power of the Bertoxxulous, 
a powerful spell would have been cast that would have released a deadly and virulent 
plague, the likes of which almost no one would survive. Finally, the strange building 
materials were to be used to construct a rather large shrine to Bertoxxulous, 
that would be necessary for the summoning. </p>
<p align="justify">Holly Windstalker took the stand. She told that the waters in 
Surefall glade became tainted one day. She and Cros Treewind noticed the taint 
after drinking from it one morning and immediately alerted everyone in the glade. 
Though the rangers and druids caught it quickly and were able to purify the waters 
again, the mate of Mammoth too, drank the water. He became mad with sickness and 
ran away. In order to prevent spreading the disease, she and Cros both went into 
the wilderness until they recovered. The bear, perhaps sensing the familiar smell 
of Cros, found him and in its madness, killed him. In his weakened state, Cros 
was unable to defend himself and died by one of the creatures he swore to protect. 
Mordavin admitted that tainting the waters of Surefall Glade was but a simple 
experiment to test the virulence of the plague that was to be unleashed. It was 
also a way to settle some old scores with a long standing enemy. </p>
<p align="justify">Rykonis Sw`Vaye, in order to clear his good name as a legitimate 
business man, took the stand. Rykonis said that he was contracted by Mordavin 
to supply the man-power to mine and deliver supplies to the Bloodsabres. Rykonis 
used his connections (it is rumored that Rykonis works for Donovan, the leader 
of the bandits) to obtain the manpower necessary to complete the contract. The 
men mined the high quality granite from the mountainous areas of the Karana near 
Coldwind Shore and also delivered large supplies of paints. </p>
<p align="justify">Rykonis admitted to even using gnolls to accomplish this goal, 
saying that the job was so large, he was unable to get the men needed to complete 
the contract. So he appealed to his gnollish contacts for more labor. Gnolls tend 
to work cheaply and are good laborers when properly motivated. He provided his 
very own stylish Brooch to those that worked for him as a form of identification 
so he knew who should be paid and who shouldn't. </p>
<p align="justify">Mordavin became angry at Rykonis for double crossing him and vowed 
revenge. It was shortly thereafter that several zombies, Rotting Sentries, crawled 
up from the sewers and began to assault the citizens. In the confusion, one of 
the zombies managed to free the bonds on Mordavin's hands and he gated away to 
an unknown location. </p>
<p align="justify">At this time a man-hunt is under way. Mordavin must be caught 
and brought to justice. The Rangers of the Jagged Pine treefolk are using their 
resources to gather information about Mordavin Telase's whereabouts. We await 
their reports so that the man-hunt may begin. </p>
