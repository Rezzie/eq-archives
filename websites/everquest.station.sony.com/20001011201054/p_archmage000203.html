This issue of Arch-Mage Answers is all Bards, all the time.  Each question 
here was taken directly from our message boards.  I want to thank everyone 
who submitted the many hundred questions.  I obviously couldn’t answer them 
all, but I think we got a pretty good sampling.  And so, without further ado…

<B>Q: A few months after release, there was a speed cap put on Selo's due to 
cheaters.  Was this Intentional?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: When our speed cap was put on, it was discovered that Bards with exceptional 
magic drums were breaking the speed limit that we had set back in Beta.  In effect, 
they were moving faster then the fastest we ever planned for players to move.  So yes, 
the speed cap for cheaters brought their speed down a small percentage. 

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Q: Charm limited to level 37 and below mobs. Our charm is already very limiting, 
why the level limit?</B>
<P>
A: We are very careful which classes we give charm to in EQ - so much so that we 
actually removed the ability from some classes post Beta.  Bards are the only class, 
other then the Enchanter, which can charm all types of creature.  
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
We are currently kicking around another higher level Bard Charm song for one of the 
empty level slots.  If we do put it in, it will be different from Solon’s - but still 
cool

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: A Bard’s Dodge caps at 120, and they get no parry or riposte.  Why?  
(Class Balance is a fine answer, just checking)</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Bards have much better, and much more unique, magical abilities then those of 
any other Hybrid class.  Because of this, their melee skills are not as good as the 
typical Hybrid.  Bards melee still better then any non-melee class - their offense, 
weapon skills, hit points and two-weapon fighting are superior to that of any priest 
or magi type.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Using some Magic instruments, for example, the Darkwood Piccolo, have no 
effect. </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: High Quality Instruments always bump up the effect of a song.  Some songs, however, 
don’t have effects that can be bumped up - for example, Tarew’s Aquatic Ayre gives the 
ability to breathe water.  Having a magical instrument will not make you breathe water 
“better.”  The Piccolo, a wind instrument, has the least number of songs that have 
effects which can be increased.  Most Wind songs tend to be all or nothing.

<B>Q: I have never seen a "Your target has resisted your attempt to mesmerize it" while 
using lullaby, as per your post.  When should I?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: I believe that went in last patch.  If not, it should be in this one.  You will 
see the resist message when your target resists your song.  This not showing was a 
display error - it should have been fixed long ago.  It took a while because when some 
of us (not all of us, just some) play, we use a version of the client that provides 
more information/messaging.  
This lets us catch a lot of bugs that most people might not see.  It makes tracking 
down bugs a lot easier, quicker, and more efficient.  On the downside, it sometimes 
isn’t always easy to remember which messages everybody sees, one which only we see.  
This was one of the few cases where too much information caused the problem.

<B>Q: Will twisting ever be coded against? I.e. is it considered cheating? If it is, I 
definitely want to know about it now.</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Twisting is not cheating.  It won’t be coded against.  We are even looking at 
putting a little something extra in to help the people with slower machines twist 
better, while not allowing those with faster machines to twist more often.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: The time it takes to memorize a song should be decreased. </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: We put in some code last patch to help with that.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Why don't we know what instrument type songs take when we look at them in our 
songbook?  It's very frustrating when you do not remember which instrument is used.</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: This is something we have planned to add for a while.  New display code should 
hopefully be going in some time soon.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: If any instruments raise song effectiveness, can you please have that listed 
when we examine it? </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Using an instrument will always increase the effect of a song - assuming that type 
of song can be increased by an instrument (example: Any set of Drums will make you run 
faster when playing Selo’s Accelerando).  Some instruments will increase your effect 
more then others.  The same new display code that is going in to help with the 
Song/Skill identification will also display instrument bonus/penalties.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Q: In the expansion, the level cap will be changed and we will presumably get more 
songs. Will our bard singing skills have a higher skill cap?  For that matter, why are 
our bard skills capped at 200? Songs are our lifeblood and an integral part of this 
class.</B>
<P>
A: Almost every skill in EverQuest is capped at 200.  There are, of course, some 
exceptions - but the vast majority of EQ skills range from 1-200.
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
That being said, if the level caps go up, you can safely assume that Bard Skills 
will increase with it.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Is there a reason why the Bard's mana song cannot be twisted? Perhaps because of 
game balance again?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: There is a common assumption that ALL Bard songs last for 3 “ticks.”  This is not 
true.  Many songs last for shorter and longer durations.  The Bard’s mana song is one 
with a shorter duration.  For more details, see Volume III of the Arch-Mage answers.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: While I understand the idea that Druidic and Shaman SOW effects cannot be used 
indoors (I even understand the Journeyman boots), I don't understand why the Bard 
running song not working indoors. </B>
<P>
A: Game Balance.  No spell or effect that speeds up a character will work indoors.  
Period.
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
During Beta we found that indoor use of movement increasing spells and songs led to 
trains on a massive scale.  When we took out the movement effect songs, the amount of 
trains happening in dungeons significantly decreased.  This was one, of many, reasons 
that we will never have movement increasing spells or songs able to be cast in 
dungeons.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Denon's Desperate Dirge - is it really that "desperate?"  After all, the Bard 
does 300 damage to himself to do 300 damage to all MOBS in a certain radius around him. 
That's really cool, except 300 damage is absolutely nothing.  Casters have been doing 
that since level 30, and Bards get a song that does that at level 43.  Plus, this one 
actually uses all the Bard's mana so it's a one shot deal.</B>
<P>
A: The 300 damage is only done if you target something near yourself - this is an AoE 
song, and like all other AoE effects, if the caster stands too close, they get hit 
with their own effect.  Ask any Wizard.  As for the amount of damage dealt - Bards 
do not have large damage songs - their songs are more of a gradual thing, dealing 
damage over time.  This song breaks the rules for Bards - it deals a large (for them) 
amount of damage instantly.  This is why they can sing it very infrequently (i.e. it 
takes up all their mana).
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Bards were actually never intended to have any songs that took mana.  Using mana on 
this one was just a convenient way to mark off time for how often they could use 
the song.

<B>Q: What kind of condiment taste best on Wood Elf Bards?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Around here, we go for barbecue sauce.  To paraphrase one of the other game designers, “it really brings out that nice smoky wood taste.”


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: You mentioned previously that adding an extra tick to bard DoT songs would make 
them 50% more powerful. Why not simply add to the damage each tick does instead?</B>
<P>
A: Solid suggestion.  
<P>
The reason that we did not increase the damage for Bard songs is that, honestly, most 
Bards don’t kite with their DoT songs.  The Bellow is an instant - so it is unaffected 
by movement / kiting.  Chords and such are good songs - but we do not want to increase 
the damage that they deal every tick for the 5% or so of the time that movement might 
lower their damage.  
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
Bards are also the only class that can move and sing/cast a song at the same time.  
Every other class must be standing still before they can produce a magical effect.  
Increasing the damage done by Bard songs, purely for purposes of making them even 
better Kiters, is against the spirit of the reason that we put in the anti-kiting 
code in the first place.

<B>Q: In 82 days of play my most ingrained behavior is to switch between weapons and 
instruments slowly and with the utmost care for fear of dropping something. Will a 
yes/no confirmation window or an item drop toggle be added to prevent us from dropping 
weapons?</B>
<P>
A: We are looking into doing this.  No promises, but, again, solid suggestion.
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
BTW - 82 days?  Very impressive.  (And no, please don’t everybody e-mail me your 
played times - we love you all regardless of how many days of play time you have).


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Why did you make all the weapons in plane of hate for bards pretty much the 
exact same thing except for its weapon type. </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: There were a few items added to Hate Plane for Bards.  Three of them were 
originally designed to be dropped from the same monster - the three identical 
Bard weapons.  They were made identical so that no matter which weapon a Bard had 
chosen to train up in (1HS, 1HB or Piercing), they would have a good weapon to chose 
from.  During the tuning and testing phase of Hate, these weapons got split up and 
placed on different monsters.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Why didn’t you make the attack speed songs of bards stack with other spells. </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: No attack speed spells or songs stack with each other either.  Each player can h
ave a total of two haste effects on them - one from an item, and one from a spell/song.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Does AC matter for a bard?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Yes.  A better AC is always worth having.  It means that you get hit for less 
damage.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Can you PLEASE make our songs attract less mobs? I cant even sing in planes 
during a fight because all the mobs will go aggressive on me!! So I get turned into 
a mediocre tank.</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: We reduced the Bard song taunt factor a bit this/last patch.  Sometimes, however, 
discretion is the better part of valor.  I know many Bards that leave their songs 
playing, regardless of the situation.  There are times when you want to stop singing, 
in the same way that there are times when a Cleric may not want to attract attention 
by Healing, or a Wizard may not want to attract attention with their DD spells.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Our dispel magic song is a very nice song, but can you make it more like 
nullify magic?  By the time we get this song, we can’t dispel a lot of the buffs. 
Is there a reason for this?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Check the patch message - Syvelian’s has gotten a bit more powerful.  That being 
said, all magic effects can be dispelled.  Some are just harder then others.  The 
difference in levels between the caster and the person casting the cancel does make 
a difference.  What the “better” cancel magic spells do is add to your effective 
level for purposes of the comparison.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Why do we not have the ability to play Invisibility and See Invisibility songs 
together? Or perhaps allowing our see invisible to be played on top of a casters 
invisible or camouflage?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Any effect that hits you while invisible turns you visible.  We recently added 
the See Invisible component to the Bard’s invisibility song - this should help the 
problem.  (Or you can just follow the cool sparkles…)


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Can you give us some way to increase faction (when we have a god) so that Guise is 
worth using?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Try using Cinda’s Charismatic Carillon - the song increases your faction with that of 
the targeted creature.



</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Q: Is Kellin's Lucid Lullaby (Lvl 15) supposed to have a memory blur component?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Nope.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Ok this is a personal question and probably completely trivial, the enameled black 
chestplate from lower guk is a black plate that is wearable by all the plate wearing 
classes except Bard. I wear an inferior black plate because I like the black plate 
look, can this plate be made available to Bards?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: No reason.  I changed it so that Bards can use it too - should be in this patch.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Recently, the range on Brusco's Boastful Bellow (level 12 song) was drastically 
reduced, leaving bards with, for all intents and purposes, no ranged attack. There are 
times when my bard cannot bellow a mob that is actually within aggro range, because it 
is "too far away".</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: We didn’t change it.  I double checked my database just to be sure, and the range 
is what it has always been (half the range of a Wizard style DD spell).


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Are there enhanced effects for these songs when the proper instrument is 
equipped? In the case of Aquatic Ayre, is the enhancement range increased? For 
Sirens and Pixie Strike, does it increased duration, chance of success, or both?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Instruments only effect the primary effects of the song (healing, buff, attack 
speed, etc.) - not the range/duration/chance of success, etc.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>




<B>Q: If a player is targeted when the level 26 screech (area fear) is started, a 
message is displayed that this sort of spell cannot be cast on players.  Is this 
"feature" intended?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: All player classes lost the ability to Fear (or anything else that causes the AI 
to take over your character) other PCs.  This was, sadly, due to a few people who were 
really abusing it.  They spoiled it for everybody.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: First I would like to know why you made bards hybrids. I mean I see rangers (
druid/warrior), Paladins (cleric/warrior), and ShadowKnights (necro/warrior), but a 
Bard is a rogue/?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Bards are Hybrids (by classification) because they more closely resemble the 
Paladin/SK/Ranger then any other group of classes.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Can you explain your thoughts behind Psalm of Purity and Psalm of Vitality? 
These songs are simply useless since any 5th level druid and 4th level cleric can cure the disease and poison these songs are supposed to protect from. I mean truly 39 points of disease protection for a 29th level song?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: These songs, in addition to protecting from poison and disease, also have chances 
to remove a poison or disease effect on you.  They are a mixture of a cure and a 
resistance buff in one.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Alenia’s Disenchanting Melody. It will remove all buffs/deduffs except Necromancer 
and ShadowKnight spells. If this song gets rid of a 49th level buff it darn sure should 
get rid of a 14th level infectious cloud or steal strength. Again these spells are 
counteracted by 4/5th level spells from a druid or cleric.  Could you explain why it 
doesn't? </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Alenia’s Disenchanting Melody will get rid of magical effects - but it will not get 
rid of poison or disease effects (no cancel magic style spell will get rid of a poison 
or disease effect).  For that you need a Cure - or a Psalm.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Do you believe Dissension the Mana Draining Song is actually useful against a 
Monster? What scenarios do you envision it being used and can this actually be done 
in game?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: My favorite is to use it against single, large mobs that you don’t want casting 
lots of spells.  Vox is a good example - the less mana she has, the less Complete 
Healing spells she can cast.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: I notice that Charisma affects all of the Mind based songs as far as resists 
are concerned. My question is what statistics affects the resists of the Direct 
Damage and Damage over time songs.</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: No statistic effects damage songs.  Charisma is special in making mental based 
songs / spells harder to save against.  One of the reasons that this was done was 
to give an extra benefit to classes / races that have higher Charismas.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<B>Q: The radius on Selo's Accelerando should be doubled. </B>

A: I agree.  That should be in next patch.

<B>Q: As a Wood Elf Bard, my Forage skill gets capped at 40 regardless of the 
fact that my heritage as a Wood Elf has trained me better. Is it intended to be 
so that as a bard I LOSE that heritage?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: That’s silly.  I’ll see what I can do.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Why are some 2H Slashing weapons usable by bards but our skill is capped at 0?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Bards were never slotted to get 2H weapons.  They have no ability to skill in it 
from a Guild Master, nor do they ever actually get the skill.  There is a display 
error, however, at the Bard Guild Master which shows that the skill is trainable.

<B>Q: What is the specific impact wielding a flute has on each of the following: 
Cinda's Charismatic Carillon, Tarew's Aquatic Ayre, Solon's Song of the Sirens, 
Crission's Pixie Strike, and Agilmente's Aria of Eagles?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Greater Faction increase, none, none, Lowers more Magic Resistance, none.

<B>Q: I play a shaman. This is perhaps a bit off the mark, but I was wondering what 
are the best buffs for a bard?  For example, I recently discovered … that dexterity 
helps a bard, as does charisma. Any other buffs that a wise bard should be asking 
for?</B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Charisma and Dexterity are the best Buffs.  Most Bards that I know can also always 
use a few more points of strength - their armor usually puts them dangerously close to 
encumbrance.  AC & HP buffs are also nice - most denizens of Norrath have an 
inexplicable hatred of music and tend to take it out on nearby minstrels.

<B>Q: We have one song that only affects the bard only, called Jonathan’s Whistling 
Warsong. Why haven’t we seen similar songs at higher levels? </B>
</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A: Most Bard songs are designed to be grant group effects rather then personal buffs.  
Jonthan’s Warsong was put in to give lower level Bards a boost at a time where they 
needed one.  We could certainly add another higher level version of the song, but I 
have a feeling that it just wouldn’t be used that much.


</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>



<B>Q: Because we can be interrupted while being attacked or experiencing lag, were 
there any thoughts on increasing the duration of levitation/invisibility/water 
breathing? No one in his or her right mind would ask a bard to perform these songs 
in combat situations. A great set of group songs that need a little more work. </B>

A: This is something that I have been running some tests on recently.  There is a

A: I think that did receive a slight duration boost.  It should be going in this 
patch or the next one - not sure which.
