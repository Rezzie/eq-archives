                     <blockquote>&quot;<b>GameSpot:</b> Will there 
                        really only be newbie zones for the Iksar and then zones 
                        for 50th-level characters? Does that mean there will be 
                        no midlevel zones for, say, the teens, levels 20 to 29, 
                        or 30 to 39? 
                        <p><b>McQuaid:</b> There will be all sorts 
                           of zones in Kunark, with all sorts of target level ranges, 
                           such that an Iksar (or anyone else, for that matter) 
                           could play from level one to 50 and beyond. &quot;

                     <blockquote>&quot;The graphics in Kunark, compared 
                        with the rest of EQ, have undergone a serious overhaul. 
                        Sporting over three-times the polygon count of the other

                        gameplay, but with plenty of eye-candy, as well. For the

               <blockquote> &quot;GameSpot broke with tradition this year by awarding 
                  its highest honor exclusively to EverQuest&quot; 
                  <p>And... 
                  <p> &quot;Following EverQuest's release in March, the whole gaming 
                     industry effectively ground to a halt. At least one prominent 
                     game developer blamed EverQuest for product delays, and for 
                     several weeks GameSpot's editors were spending more time exploring 
                     Norrath than they were doing their jobs. That's because exploring 
                     the world Verant created is an incredible experience, especially 
                     when you can do so with friends. And knowing that Norrath will 
                     continue to grow, both through Verant's continual addition 
                     of new zones and the forthcoming expansion, only adds to the

                     a game so graphics-rich it would require a 3-D-accelerated 
                     PC in order to play it. Smart move.&quot; </p>

                     It is diverse, balanced, and incredibly detailed. The world 
                     is enormous, and you can easily get lost in the gameplay...

               <blockquote> 
                  <p>"... it will bring the most amazing world to our screens and 
                     anyone with the least bit of adventuring spirit will be sucked

               EverQuest. Cindy praises EverQuest with the following: 
               <blockquote> 
                  <p>"... we were bowled over by what appeared to be one of the 
                     most stunning and spectacular online worlds ever to hit the 
                     'net." 
                  <p> "[EverQuest] will certainly influence the way online RPGs 
                     are handled from now on." 
                  <p> "The best part about EverQuest so far seems to lie in the 
                     immersiveness of the gameworld (usually a 'buzzword phrase,' 
                     but not here)."

                     crown. Though we have a few months yet before EverQuest is 
                     released, Sony Interactive has thrown down the gauntlet for
