      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FOSTER CITY, Calif.&#150; (ENTERTAINMENT WIRE) &#150;</font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oct. 
        18, 1999 &#150;</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">989 Studios&#153;, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, 
        announced today that its top-selling online PC title EverQuest<sup>&reg;</sup> has broken all subscription-based online 
        gaming sales records. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other 
        online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 
        players. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">''EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve 
        of entertainment software,'' said Kelly Flock, president, 989 Studios. ''What is most impressive is the fact that 
        EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest 
        is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer game.'' </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 &#150; 
        and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor of Verant Interactive &#150; involves the game's multitude 
        of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique interactive storyline that evolves according to 
        a player's decision. Players can choose to begin the game in any of three continents, with more than 70 adventure 
        zones and 12 cities. Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, alliances and politics. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">''EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and 
        conceptually,'' added Flock. ''Its continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, 
        which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting 
        the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing online simultaneously, EverQuest offers 
        gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience.'' </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers 
        can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously. The active global EverQuest subscriber base is 
        comprised of players from various countries throughout the ''real'' world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, 
        Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France and New Zealand. </font>
