              <p align="left">FAQ stands for "Frequently Asked Questions". The 
                purpose of this FAQ is to provide answers for subjects that are 
                frequently posed in EverQuest forums by the players of the game. 
                The focus of the FAQ will be persistent issues, or, things that 
                are not likely to change. Transient issues, or issues that are 
                temporary or subject to change from day to day, will not be covered 
                in this document, but will instead be discussed within the official 
                EverQuest forums. In order to establish some guidelines for posting 
                within Official EverQuest Forums, the first part of this FAQ relates 
                directly to conduct and etiquette on the boards. It is important 
                that everyone adhere to the rules of the board in order for them 
                to serve their purpose.</p>
              <p align="left">This FAQ will typically not cover issues that are 
                considered "class-specific" in nature. Class-specific issues are 
                typically extremely volatile and inflammatory, resulting in situations 
                for which there can be no completely agreeable resolution. There 
                is always one more argument that can be made either for greater 
                advantages or for lesser disadvantages for a specific class. Instead, 
                when addressing issues of this nature within this document, steps 
                will be taken to insure that the response is broad enough so that 
                it applies to most or all players, regardless which class they 
                play.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">1.0 Official EverQuest Forums</h4>
              <p align="left">This section of the FAQ is primarily concerned with 
                the Official EverQuest forums, and the conduct that is considered 
                appropriate and inappropriate when posting to those forums.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is the purpose of the Official 
                EverQuest forums?</p>
              <p align="left">The Official EverQuest Forums exist as a place for 
                EverQuest players to gather and discuss issues related to EverQuest. 
                Some forums (e.g. Customer Service, General Discussion, Quality 
                Assurance) are visited frequently by official representatives 
                regularly, and serve as a place for players to communicate with 
                some of the various EverQuest teams (e.g. Development, QA, and 
                Customer Service). These forums allow us, as developers, the opportunity 
                to discuss issues that the players feel are important.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Who may post on the Official 
                EverQuest Forums?</p>
              <p align="left">In the initial implementation, "Customer Service 
                / Technical Help" will be open to the public. While anyone may 
                read all of the forums, the remaining forums will only allow posts 
                from active EverQuest account holders.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why is posting to the Official 
                EverQuest Forums restricted?</p>
              <p align="left">While we would like to keep posting open to everyone 
                regardless of their account status, in the past, the official 
                EverQuest forums have had some problems maintaining a suitable 
                posting environment due to the relative anonymity of the posters. 
                With little to no tangible reason to keep posting behavior in 
                check, some posters took advantage of the anonymity provided by 
                the forums to post often vulgar and otherwise inappropriate material 
                on the boards.</p>
              <p align="left">As EverQuest is a family game, with people of all 
                ages participating in the gaming community, we as developers have 
                a responsibility to maintain a suitable environment to the best 
                of our ability. The only way to accomplish this goal in regards 
                to the Official Forums is to reduce the relative anonymity of 
                the forums, thus allowing us to eject posters who post material 
                that is inappropriate for public consumption.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: I'm concerned about security 
                of my account. If I must log in with a valid Station Name to post, 
                doesn't that give someone half of the key needed to hack my account?</p>
              <p align="left">No. Though you will be logging in (through a secure 
                connection) with your valid station name and password, the station 
                name will not be displayed. Instead, entirely within our local

                in these forums?</p>
              <p align="left">As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The 
                Station, posting to these forums is bound by The Station's Terms 
                of Service that can be found in their entirety at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml">http://www.station.sony.com/services/tos.jhtml</a>. 
                In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental 
                rules that apply to the EverQuest Forums.</p>
              <p align="left">In general, you may post any material, written in 
                a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for 
                the forum to which you are posting. This includes material that 
                disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game. 
                We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas 
                as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable 
                of reading the forum.</p>
              <p align="left">You may not, however, post any material that:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate 
                    the idea, but do not turn your disagreement into an attack

                are broken?</p>
              <p align="left">Action that we might take in regards to a post in 
                violation of these rules on the Official EverQuest Forums will 
                vary depending upon the transgression. It could include any number 
                of the following:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>

                  <li>Closing of the thread.</li>
                  <li>Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest 
                    for the duration of the suspension).</li>
                  <li>Banishment (results in the user's station account being 
                    canceled. User will no longer be able to access EverQuest, 
                    or any Official EverQuest Forum).</li>

              <p align="left">People who violate the rules of the boards may or 
                may not receive any warning before any action is taken. In the 
                event that a warning is given, the warning will be recorded upon 
                the game account and may result in further action should the player 
                show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct. Philosophically 
                and administratively, there is no difference between conduct in 
                game, and conduct in the Official EverQuest Forums.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Ok, we know what we shouldn't

              <p align="left">Give your posts some thought, and try to be courteous 
                and respectful. Disagreeing with someone does not mean that you 
                have to be anything less than courteous in your dealings. Read 
                over what you plan on posting before hitting the "Submit" button, 
                and imagine how you would feel if the post was aimed at you. Would 
                you be personally offended? If so, you should consider rephrasing 
                the post or canceling it altogether.</p>

              <p align="left">Everyone needs help once in a while, making customer 
                service an issue important to all. Included in this section are 
                some of the more common questions that we see in regards to the 
                Customer Service Department.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is the purpose of GMs and 
                Guides in game?</p>
              <p align="left">GMs and Guides provide the in-game customer support 
                for EverQuest. The primary functions of a CSRep in-game could 
                be categorized under the following:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>Administrative Functions</li>
                  <li>Disciplinary Functions</li>
                  <li>Gameplay Functions</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left">Administrative Functions include things such as 
                creating guilds, answering questions, handling reimbursement requests, 
                etc. Disciplinary Functions include the investigation and arbitration 
                of issues surrounding the actions of a player in regards to a 
                CSRep or another player. Gameplay Functions include organizing 
                quests and events for the servers.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Under what circumstances can 
                a GM or Guide assist me in game?</p>
              <p align="left">An all-inclusive list of every situation in which 
                a CSRep can assist you in game would be impossible to list. However, 
                in general, CSReps are there to help you when you need something 
                that is not a normal function of the game. This includes assistance 
                if you encounter a verifiable bug that somehow hampers your gameplay 
                experience.</p>
              <p align="left">CSReps are not there to provide gameplay hints, 
                or any service that can be performed by another player. See the 
                GM/Guide FAQ available off of the EverQuest Web Site.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">3.0 The Vision</h4>
              <p align="left">Our vision for the game comes up quite regularly 
                on the EverQuest Official forums. Some of the more frequent questions 
                can be found in this section.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: When reading about EverQuest 
                on the net, people often make reference to "The Vision". What 
                is that?</p>
              <p align="left">Just about every project has some sort of plan or 
                vision behind it. Either a person or a group of people typically 
                come together, discuss their common goals, and create a game plan. 
                EverQuest is no exception.</p>
              <p align="left">In March of 1996 Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover were 
                hired by John Smedley, then Director of Development of Sony Interactive 
                Studios, to design and implement a massively multiplayer RPG. 
                Brad and Steve, both avid MUD players, decided to attempt to capture 
                the fun and compelling aspects of MUDs, including the lessons 
                learned and the core systems developed over the years, and to 
                combine them with a 3D graphical engine in order to create a mainstream 
                commercial game. They also wanted to recapture the comradery and 
                teamwork they'd experienced playing paper and pencil RPGs in years 
                past around the table with their friends. To this end they wrote 
                the original design document and decided upon several core fundamental 
                tenets; for example, that EverQuest would primarily be a PvE (Player 
                vs. Environment) game with optional and restricted PvP (Player 
                vs. Player), and that EverQuest would be a game focused on cooperation 
                and interdependence built upon a class system where grouping with 
                others was heavily encouraged.</p>
              <p align="left">Over time the EverQuest team grew from two people 
                to over thirty. Team members from all different backgrounds joined, 
                including game designers well versed in MUDs, paper and pencil 
                RPGs, and single player computer RPGs. Bill Trost, who became 
                the lead designer on EverQuest, joined the team early on and set 
                out to create a fantasy world that was original in both origin 
                and content but also filled with familiar creatures and locales 
                from traditional High Fantasy. He and many other game designers 
                developed rich story lines, intricate quests, and a wide variety 
                of people and places with which to interact. A revolutionary faction 
                system was also developed to replace a more simplistic alignment 
                system. Late in development, a Trade Skills system was added to 
                the design in order to appeal to players who wanted to involve 
                themselves with non-combat oriented activities.</p>
              <p align="left">In the three years that it took to develop EverQuest, 
                and in the time since March 16, 1999, that it's been commercially 
                online, many aspects of the game have changed. Many enhancements, 
                alterations, and additions have been made to the world that is 
                Norrath. But the vision, the original purpose and goal, has been 
                maintained. John Smedley, a 10+ year veteran of game development, 
                once commented that the end result that was EverQuest more closely 
                resembled its original design document than any other project 
                he'd experienced. The EverQuest team is very proud of this fact 
                and firmly believes that sticking to a vision, especially within 
                an ever-evolving persistent online game, is key (along with passion, 
                talent, and dedication) to creating a truly great game.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why does the game need a vision?</p>
              <p align="left">Vision is focus. Without focus a project will usually 
                lose consistency. All games need a vision prior to release - it 
                keeps the team together and focused, and it ensures that the tendency 
                of a group of creative people to go off on wild tangents (which 
                often threatens a product's completion) is kept in check.</p>
              <p align="left">A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), however, 
                is more than a product. It is also a service, and MMOGs live on 
                and continue to adapt and evolve after they're launched. For this 
                reason a vision is even more important to games like EverQuest. 
                Not only are more people involved in creating them, but also teams 
                often change after release. Customers communicate and expect changes 
                and enhancements. Lessons are learned and better systems and solutions 
                are developed. The need to remain focused lest the game change 
                into something it's not is therefore paramount. While adaptation, 
                enhancement, balance, and growth are all essential MMOG ingredients, 
                they must be kept within the original parameters of the game's 
                design.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: If enough customers want a particular 
                change made to a piece of software, it would behoove the company 
                to make that change. Why doesn't that philosophy apply to EverQuest?</p>
              <p align="left">Actually, it often does. Customer feedback and ideas 
                are a very important part of an MMOG. Many of the features found 
                in EverQuest came from customers' ideas, both back in beta testing 
                and after commercial launch. It is, however, the responsibility 
                of the teams behind EverQuest to make sure that the game remains 
                balanced and fair for all. Realizing that EverQuest and similar 
                games are a product, a service, and a game all in one is very 
                important in terms of perspective. Were it merely a product then 
                future products that reflected a change wouldn't necessarily affect 
                owners of the older product. But because EverQuest is a persistent 
                and multiplayer game, changes affect everyone. Often, a change 
                that might benefit one customer or even a group of customers in 
                a positive way might also affect an even larger group in a negative 
                way. Essentially, we must abide by the fact that in an MMOG, the 
                needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Bottom line: 
                as long as the majority of customers are relatively happy with 
                the product, the fundamentals of that product should not change.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Games change, times change, 
                and people change. What of the vision?</p>
              <p align="left">The vision changes and adapts as well, but its core 
                foundation does not. As a product and service that people bought 
                and continue to pay for, it is our responsibility to make sure 
                EverQuest remains EverQuest. For example, were a company to set 
                out to create a sports car, it would behoove them to keep making 
                that sports car better, listening to their customers wants and 
                desires. But were a subset of their customer base to decide over 
                time they'd rather have an SUV, it would probably be a bad idea 
                to change the sports car into an SUV. As long as enough customers 
                wanted sports cars to make their production profitable then the 
                company should keep producing sports cars, making sure that changes 
                and enhancements made their product a better sports car (as opposed 
                to something else). Perhaps if enough of their customers also 
                wanted an SUV they would also look into making an SUV. But that 
                would be a second product, not a change to the first.</p>
              <p align="left">The same logic also applies to EverQuest. Are there 
                things we could do to make EverQuest a better EverQuest? Absolutely, 
                and we continue to pursue those ideas and appreciate the feedback 
                we get from our customers to that end. But there are also things 
                we could do to EverQuest to make it a different game. Many of 
                the ideas that we receive would do just that. Some are good ideas, 
                some are bad, but whether good or bad, were they implemented, 
                EverQuest would turn into a significantly different game. That 
                is something we cannot allow - it would be simply be very bad 
                business.</p>
              <p align="left">As games, times, and people change, perhaps demands 
                and desires for MMOGs will also change. Certainly the number of 
                people interested and able to play MMOGs will grow. It is Verant/Sony 
                Online's opinion that this emerging market will allow us and others 
                to create games in the future that are more specifically tailored 
                to the variety of existing customer needs. But in the meantime, 
                given EverQuest's lead in the marketplace, its increasing sales 
                and subscriptions, the fact that it needs to appeal to many different 
                customers and play styles, and the importance of remaining focused, 
                EverQuest will remain true to the original Vision and will continue 
                to evolve and adapt into a better EverQuest.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.0 General Game Mechanics</h4>
              <p align="left">This section of the FAQ begins discussion on EverQuest 
                gameplay, and the decisions that lead to certain designs in the 
                game. Many of these issues are considered volatile topics, and 
                have led to strenuous debate on the Official EverQuest Forums.</p>
              <div align="left"><a name="4.1"></a> </div>
              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.1 Experience</h4>
              <p align="left">There has been a good deal of debate from time to 
                time concerning the way that the advancement system works in EverQuest. 
                Some support the current system, while others would prefer an 
                alternate system. The advancement system in EverQuest, however, 
                is not subject to post-production changes.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why do some races and classes 
                require more experience to level than others do?</p>
              <p align="left">When the races and classes were being laid out during 
                the design-phase of EverQuest, it was decided that true differences 
                would be present in both. No one race or class should be a mere 
                cookie-cutter of another (cf. equality), but should instead complement 
                each other's strengths and weaknesses (cf. balance).</p>
              <p align="left">On the subject of races, since the concept of "equality" 
                was not a goal, races were designed with strengths and weaknesses. 
                Ogres, for instance, excel at armed combat, while Erudites excel 
                at magic. Given this, some races will always be better at a certain 
                class than another race will. For instance, ogres will always 
                make better warriors than gnomes. Even though the extent to which 
                ogres can be better warriors is limited (see the next Question), 
                something was still needed to discourage people who wanted to 
                play warriors from always choosing the ogre, in order to insure 
                that classes from each race are played. Though there are many 
                ways to discourage everyone from choosing the same race (e.g. 
                Faction, Size), the experience requirement is very effective.</p>
              <p align="left">On the subject of classes, much of the same applies. 
                Hybrids, for instance, are fairly well known to require more experience 
                than their parent classes. That additional experience requirement 
                is there to discourage "everyone" from playing hybrids due to 
                their versatility. For instance, though a Paladin's combat skill 
                isn't that of the warrior, it's close, and perhaps so close that 
                a Paladin might often be a better choice than a warrior. However, 
                the lesser number of hitpoints, coupled with the increased experience 
                requirement making Paladins less prolific, insure the warrior 
                still has a place.</p>
              <p align="left">Experience requirements, much like faction, size, 
                item availability, etc., do not contribute directly to the concept 
                of balance, but still play an important part in insuring that 
                the number of characters in the world is balanced.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: If my class requires more experience 
                to level, shouldn't that mean that my character should be more 
                powerful at a given level than that of another class which requires 
                less experience to level?</p>
              <p align="left">No. Back before EverQuest was in beta, one of the 
                things that people were asking for on the public boards was for 
                a class that required "4 or 5 times" the experience of other classes, 
                but was ultra-powerful. Though that may sound good on the surface, 
                there will always be people who have the time to put in that 4 
                or 5 times more effort. When these people who have that extra 
                time finally reach the max-level, they would be so powerful that 
                they would nullify the need for some other class, if not the need 
                of several.</p>
              <p align="left">Even today, some people, with the help of friends 
                or multiple accounts, can level a current class to 50 in a matter 
                of a few played-days. People have a reasonable expectation that 
                at any given level, their class should be useful for something. 
                The mere existence of a super-powerful class, even with the extra 
                experience requirement, would not be enough of a deterrent to 
                insure that the particular class doesn't overwhelm the existing 
                class-interdependence scheme.</p>
              <p align="left">Additional experience requirements are there, plainly, 
                to give people a reason to choose some of the less powerful race/class 
                combos. As mentioned in the previous question, it is not a direct 
                component of balance, but rather a minor contributor. Though the 
                difference in power is not tremendous for the reasons mentioned 
                above, it exists, even to its minor extent, to the point that 
                something was needed.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is done to keep those who 
                require more experience to level from being unfairly penalized 
                at death?</p>
              <p align="left">Experience loss upon death, for all classes, is 
                based upon the experience that a human warrior would require for 
                the previous level. This has the effect of making classes that 
                require less experience lose a larger amount of experience, relative 
                to the experience required for the current level, than classes 
                that require more experience overall.</p>
              <p align="left">It is set up this way so differing experience requirements 
                don't translate to a double-jeopardy situation in death. For instance, 
                if experience loss on death was based as a percentage of current 
                experience, hybrids, which require more experience to level, would 
                lose more experience on death, and also take longer to make it 
                back up.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How is experience dealt out 
                when in a group? Why?</p>
              <p align="left">Experience is dealt out within the group based upon 
                the amount of experience required for the current level, non-linear 
                levels excepted. It is set up in such a fashion that most race/class 
                combos in a group, regardless of level assuming that they are 
                all capable of getting experience given the current group makeup, 
                will level at a similar rate.</p>
              <p align="left">It was set up in this fashion so that a group of 
                friends playing the game, and always playing together, could maintain 
                a groupable level-range regardless of their race/class choices. 
                Surely the downside of this design is that someone playing a high-requirement 
                class will take more experience while in the group, causing the 
                whole group to level slower. However, since the additional requirement 
                is shared by all in the group, the overall impact is probably 
                in the neighborhood of a few percentage points to any one particular 
                person. It is certainly not a large enough difference that anyone 
                should choose to exclude someone from a group on the basis of 
                them playing a high-requirement race or class.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why do some levels require more 
                experience than would seem normal?</p>
              <p align="left">The amount of experience required for advancement 
                is not linear. Some levels require more experience than would 
                seem normal if the scale is assumed to be linear in nature. This 
                isn't a correct assumption.</p>
              <p align="left">The amount of experience required to level is based 
                off of 4 values:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>The Level</li>
                  <li>The Racial Modifier</li>
                  <li>The Class Modifier</li>
                  <li>The Level Range Modifier</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left">These numbers are manipulated in an internal proprietary 
                algorithm that determines the amount of experience required to 
                level. Though the RM and CM are constants, and the "Level" itself 
                is linear, the LRM is not linear in nature, but rather moves in 
                steps based upon the level range. The end result is that the levels 
                where the LRM increases require more experience than would seem 
                appropriate were the system linear in nature.</p>
              <p align="left">In retrospect, it is quite possible that we should 
                have made the formula such that the additional experience required 
                by the LRM was spread over every level in the particular range 
                in order to keep in line with customer expectations. However, 
                the experience required in the end would remain the same.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why, when dying in some levels, 
                do you seem to lose more experience than would seem normal?</p>
              <p align="left">Experience loss on death is based entirely off of 
                the amount of experience that was required for a human warrior 
                to earn in the previous level. Due to the stepping of the LRM 
                mentioned in the previous question, dying in the level AFTER the 
                step of the LRM will result in a greater experience loss. Again, 
                this is another situation where perhaps we should have spread 
                the requirement across the level range, however the end result 
                would be the same.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why does experience-loss even 
                exist?</p>
              <p align="left">EverQuest is a game. Games of this nature present 
                challenges that must be overcome in order to reach an objective. 
                Though no one will ever "win" EverQuest, the concept of challenges 
                and objectives are very much a part of the game. Whatever your 
                objective is in the game, whether it is reaching max level, obtaining 
                a new item, or becoming a master baker, there are challenges over 
                which you must prevail. A challenge, in the context of a game, 
                must have some risk in order for the objective to be meaningful. 
                For instance, who prizes a sword, regardless of its power, that 
                can be bought off a vendor for a mere copper?v 
              <p align="left">Challenges in EverQuest typically require both effort 
                and risk. Certainly there are situations that require a great 
                deal of effort with little risk, and vice versa, but over all 
                it remains a system of effort and risk. The effort, in this case, 
                is the time that you spend attempting to accomplish your objective. 
                The risk is the prospect of failure, being the experience, items, 
                etc. that you might lose should you fail in your challenge.</p>
              <p align="left">Three things determine the final value of the objective:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>The inherent value of the reward.</li>
                  <li>The effort invested obtaining the reward.</li>
                  <li>The potential risk absorbed, whether realized or not, when 
                    attempting to overcome the challenge.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left">The final value of the objective is based upon its 
                availability and its usefulness, which translates respectively 
                to supply and demand. An item (the objective in this case) that 
                is very available and not very useful has a low value, whereas 
                a highly useful item in low availability has a high value. The 
                "usefulness" of the objective is the inherent value of the reward 
                itself, whereas its availability is tied to the effort and risk. 
                An item of high inherent value is also very useful, with the only 
                thing to be determined is its availability.</p>
              <p align="left">As you can see, the value of any objective is tied 
                closely to the potential risk that was absorbed when attempting 
                the challenge. Overcoming challenges and achieving objectives 
                are widely agreed to be "fun" in games. Since there can be no 
                value in an objective if there is no challenge, and since there 
                is no challenge if there is no risk, and since both challenges 
                and objectives are necessary for there to be "fun", there must 
                be risk for the sake of "fun".</p>
              <p align="left">Experience loss on death is the potential risk that 
                is necessary for the game to be "fun".</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: But experience loss is frustrating 
                and not very much fun!</p>
              <p align="left">Precisely. Realizing a risk is never fun. It wouldn't 
                be a risk if it were. The fruits of a risk are by their nature 
                something that you do not want to encounter. It's the potential 
                of realizing that risk, and then overcoming the challenge to reach 
                the objective that is fun.</p>
              <p align="left">This is why the game provides many ways for the 
                player to reduce their potential risk should they endeavor to 
                do so, but not so many ways or to the extent that the risk itself 
                would be nullified without likewise nullifying the objective itself. 
                Players choose, for the most part, what risks that they wish to 
                encounter. They choose, for the most part, whether they wish to 
                encounter those risks with or without the amenities necessary 
                to reduce that risk.</p>
              <p align="left">The amount of risk absorbed by a player is almost 
                entirely within their hands. The goal for us is to make sure that 
                the inherent value of the reward is worth the potential risk in 
                more cases than not.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: I still don't like the way experience 
                is handled in any of these cases, what would it take to get you 
                to change it?</p>
              <p align="left">Divine intervention. The experience system in EverQuest, 
                including the formulae used to determine advancement rates, race/class 
                advancement modifiers, level range modifiers, nonlinear progression, 
                and everything else related in this section, are not subject to 
                post-production changes.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.2 Soloing</h4>
              <p align="left">The subject of soloing in EverQuest comes up quite 
                often on the Official EverQuest boards, so often in fact that 
                a section dedicated to it was appropriate for this FAQ.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is "Soloing"?</p>
              <p align="left">"Soloing" is the process of fighting or otherwise 
                advancing in game without the assistance of other players or a 
                group.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Is soloing possible in EverQuest?</p>
              <p align="left">Certainly you may, however one should expect that 
                solo players should not be able to go everywhere and do everything 
                like a sufficiently balanced and talented group could. EverQuest 
                is built primarily as a group-oriented game, and encounters, especially 
                at more advanced stages, are geared specifically towards groups. 
                Some encounters are even expected to take multiple groups in order 
                to be conquered.</p>
              <p align="left">Furthermore, some classes are more suited to soloing 
                than others, and the ability of any particular class to solo may 
                change as that class advances in levels. Typically, soloable classes 
                (classes having the ability to solo), are designed to be more 
                self-sufficient in game. However, due to their versatility, they 
                are often less masterful at any particular aspect of their abilities 
                then classes that are designed to be group-centric. This can often 
                make them less desired in balanced groups where masterful classes 
                can be found. For instance, the necromancer and druid, highly 
                regarded as the "best soloing classes", are typically not among 
                the top most desirable classes for a group, whereas the Cleric, 
                the master of healing, has little soloing ability, but is greatly 
                desired in a group.</p>
              <p align="left">As mentioned above, even the most soloable classes 
                will not be able to go everywhere, do and acquire everything, 
                without the assistance of a group.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why does EverQuest promote grouping 
                over soloing?</p>
              <p align="left">We firmly believe that the vast majority of players 
                choose to play Massively Multiplayer Online Games due to the endless 
                possibilities that come with the prospect of interacting with 
                other people. These players will usually have a tendency to form 
                "groups", even if the gaming engine itself doesn't provide that 
                option. Once formed into groups, if the game is not designed to 
                handle them, there is little challenge left in the game, as they 
                can move through any designed encounter with ease. The end result 
                is that this majority garners less entertainment from the game 
                and is less likely to enjoy it for a long term.</p>
              <p align="left">Still, we recognize that there are those who prefer 
                the ability to "solo", even in a multiplayer universe, which is 
                why we provide classes that are capable of the feat.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: I think every class should be 
                able to solo and make progress. Why isn't this the case?</p>
              <p align="left">Once every class is given the ability to solo, the 
                game is no longer oriented towards groups, and the problem illustrated 
                in the last question comes to fruition.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How about zones or creatures 
                that don't allow grouping, but where everyone has the ability 
                to solo?</p>
              <p align="left">Such zones would not be consistent within the gaming 
                world, and present the same problems mentioned above. We certainly 
                have zones where "soloing" is supported more than others (e.g. 
                Outdoor zones), however the focus in this case will remain upon 
                the classes that are designed for soloing.</p>
              <p align="left">Having a warrior, a class highly regarded for their 
                value in groups and their inability to solo at advanced levels, 
                suddenly become more powerful for the purpose of fighting in a 
                "solo only" zone wouldn't make sense in the world we have built.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.3 New Proposed Server Rulesets</h4>
              <p align="left">As people find aspects of the game that particularly 
                interest them more than others, it is not an infrequent occurrence 
                for an alternate server ruleset to be suggested. The ideas and 
                drives behind these alternate rulesets vary, but the end result 
                is the suggested enhancement of the game for a niche of players. 
                Below, a few of the more common suggested rulesets are addressed.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How about a "Roleplay" server?</p>
              <p align="left">It is frequently suggested that we set up an alternate 
                server ruleset called a "Roleplay" server. Though the format of 
                the server differs from suggestion to suggestion, the result that 
                is aimed for by the proponents of this suggestion is a world where 
                everyone plays their character from an in-character perspective, 
                rather than by projecting their own identity upon the character 
                being played.</p>
              <p align="left">Though we like to encourage "roleplay" in every 
                form possible, building an alternate server ruleset to "enforce" 
                the concept of roleplay would be a difficult if not impossible 
                venture. The diversity of our playerbase is such that there are 
                many different definitions of "roleplay" out there, most of which 
                are subjective. It would be fair to say that roleplay is in the 
                eye of the beholder. Another player might not consider what one 
                person considers roleplaying as such. This makes the idea of consistently 
                "enforcing" roleplay to the satisfaction of a large number of 
                people a truly insurmountable task.</p>
              <p align="left">The choice to roleplay is a personal one. We provide 
                the world, rife with possibilities, from which you can develop 
                the character that you choose to play. We provide the races, political 
                alignments, complex interactions and ideals that form the depth 
                of the game beyond the graphical layout. In short, we provide 
                a level of diversity yet to be matched in any game to date. These 
                things exist on all servers, regardless of ruleset, to promote 
                roleplay throughout the game. Given this environment, people are 
                given the ability to choose to roleplay, and encourage others 
                to do so as well.</p>
              <p align="left">Though we understand the desire to deal exclusively 
                with people who likewise support the same or similar definition 
                of roleplay, it would not be fair of us to embrace and attempt 
                to enforce any particular definition.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How about an "Easy Advancement" 
                server?</p>
              <p align="left">Another common suggestion that we hear is that for 
                a server ruleset where everything (e.g. Levels, cash, and items) 
                is easier to acquire. The idea here is that a segment of the populace, 
                known as the casual player, can only play a few hours per week 
                and should be entitled to the same things that a person playing 
                forty, eighty, or one hundred hours per week.</p>
              <p align="left">The difficulty here is that the definition of "casual 
                player" differs as greatly as that of "roleplaying". Some people 
                who play but 10 hours per week suggest that the server be centered 
                around that value, while others who play 40 hours per week still 
                consider themselves casual players and feel that the bar should 
                be there. It is probably a given that if you are reading this 
                FAQ, there is someone out there who not only plays the game more 
                than you do, but also someone else who plays less.</p>
              <p align="left">The "average" EverQuest player plays the game around 
                15-20 hours per week, and it is at that range that advancement 
                and acquisition in EverQuest is centered. One of the things that 
                people enjoy about EverQuest is that development of the character 
                takes time and energy, and is in that fashion earned. Shifting 
                game dynamics on a new server ruleset to the point that a 10 hour 
                per week player can expect everything that a 100 hour per week 
                player can in the same calendar period would change the very core 
                of EverQuest. It would quite possibly eliminate one of the things 
                about the game that people enjoy most.</p>
              <p align="left">One of the prerequisites of any alternate server 
                ruleset is that it must not change the core dynamics of the game. 
                The "easy advancement" server would not be able to meet that requirement.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How about a "NODROP" server?</p>
              <p align="left">Another alternate server ruleset that is suggested 
                frequently is a "NODROP" server. Though the specifics vary slightly 
                from suggestion to suggestion, the idea is that items that are 
                in demand should be NODROP in nature, not allowing trade between 
                players. The main reason that this subject comes up is in regards 
                to "Twinking" (See "Twinking" below). Players often dislike seeing 
                other players in out-of-level gear that they obviously didn't 
                earn on their own. Though the impact of twinking is minimal due 
                to the nature with which game mechanics treat the occurrence, 
                the visible result of twinking is not desirable to those players.</p>
              <p align="left">Though a NODROP server would certainly address these 
                concerns, we feel that trading, or specifically, the ability to 
                trade, builds the sense of community in game. It also helps casual 
                players obtain weapon and equipment that they otherwise wouldn't 
                have the time to obtain. Trade in the game, though it allows twinking, 
                is so important in regards to the server community that we would 
                not want to engage in limiting it to the extent created by a NODROP 
                server ruleset.</p>
              <div align="left"><a name="4.4"></a> </div>
              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.4 Twinking</h4>
              <p align="left">As long as multiplayer games exist, the debate over 
                twinking will rage. Each game chooses to handle the problem in 
                a different matter, but the question still remains, is there a 
                problem to be solved?</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is "Twinking"?</p>
              <p align="left">"Twinking" is an old MUD that refers to the giving 
                of "out of level" items, items that one character could never 
                hope to obtain at their level of advancement, for the purpose 
                of speeding advancement. For instance, giving a newbie character 
                a sword from a dragon would be considered "Twinking".</p>
              <p align="left">In EverQuest, the term also applies to providing 
                a character "out of level" support in order to speed their leveling, 
                such as by having a high-level cleric "babysit" a lower level 
                character.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Is it allowed? Why?</p>
              <p align="left">As game designers, we are aware that players seek 
                any advantage available in order to get a "leg up". It has been 
                the nature of massively-multiplayer games since their earliest 
                manifestation. It is with this in mind that EverQuest was built. 
                Since we recognize the issue, that being that people will always 
                desire to "pass down" items from higher-level characters to lower-level 
                characters, we chose to remain more or less neutral on the subject 
                as long as it doesn't unbalance the game.</p>
              <p align="left">The idea on our side was to present an environment 
                where a "twinked" character is not so much better off than an 
                "untwinked" character, that the "untwinked" character has a problem 
                getting groups.</p>
              <p align="left">Given that the only way to truly stop "twinking" 
                is to put level-limits on everything, we moved forward with limiting 
                its effect.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why not just put hard level-limits 
                on everything?</p>
              <p align="left">It has been suggested on more than one occasion 
                that we should put hard level-limits on items so that twinking 
                will not occur. These level limits would restrict characters that 
                had not achieved a certain level of expertise from even equipping 
                the items. This is a decidedly artificial mechanism, one that 
                we decided not to pursue.</p>
              <p align="left">Hard level-limits assumes that we have some fool-proof 
                way to insure that items are won fairly at a certain level, and 
                not before that level. Since players surprise us daily on their 
                skill within the game, it is reasonable to assume that players 
                would surprise us with the level that they could obtain items 
                legitimately. Hard level-limits on items cheat those who obtain 
                items a few levels before we thought they should be able, keeping 
                them from using their reward for sometime after the event where 
                they obtained it.</p>
              <p align="left">For this reason it was decided that hard level-limits 
                on items would never be a part of EverQuest as long as another 
                solution existed to keep the effects of twinking managed.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is the solution that was 
                decided?</p>
              <p align="left">Soft level-limits. A character using an item far 
                above what they should have access to, based on the stats of the 
                item rather than a per-item basis, will not get full use out of 
                the item. That is to say that a level 5 character wielding and 
                wearing the best items in the game is not that much better off 
                than the level 5 character wielding and wearing items that are 
                appropriate.</p>
              <p align="left">In addition to soft-level limits on items, we found 
                that hard level-limits were necessary item effects, as well as 
                items of a planar class. We handled effects directly with a level 
                limit, and handled planar items indirectly by restricting access 
                to the planes and making the items NODROP.</p>
              <p align="left">These measures insure that item twinking is more 
                of a visual problem rather than a problem with game mechanics. 
                The end result is that while some people still do not enjoy the 
                prospect of looking at a low level character wearing high-level 
                gear, the difference in efficiency created by this issue is small 
                enough that it really doesn't affect the game world.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: But what of spell-twinking (cf. 
                babysitting)?</p>
              <p align="left">This is an issue that proved much more difficult 
                to control. With the number of different ways that people should 
                be able to interact effectively, the only way to place any limits 
                on spell-twinking was reduce the level of interaction that people 
                could engage in based upon level. We decided that in this case 
                we would choose the lesser of two evils and remain hands-off on 
                the subject. Spell-twinking really only affects the recipient, 
                causing them to level faster than others. It does not present 
                a situation where one character is invalidated because another 
                is being spell-twinked.</p>
              <p align="left">The one exception that we made to this laissez-faire 
                policy was to place level limits on beneficial spells obtained 
                post level 50. Our maximum spell power that we allowed for the 
                1-50 portion of the game was based upon the damage that could 
                be done by spell-twinking. We could not let beneficial spells 
                get any more powerful without somehow limiting their use.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.5 Binding</h4>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is "Binding"?</p>
              <p align="left">"Binding" is the term used to describe the process 
                of resetting the location that a character will "respawn" following 
                death. It is also the same location to which a player will be 
                returned when using the spell "gate". Binding is performed through 
                the use of the spell "Bind Affinity" which can be cast by any 
                pure caster or pure priest class.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Who can do it, and where?</p>
              <p align="left">Generally, casters can bind themselves anywhere, 
                and melee players can only be bound within locations defined as 
                "cities". There are some notable exceptions, zones that do not 
                allow binding, even by casters binding themselves:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>Kunark Dungeons</li>
                  <li>Timorous Deep</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why can't melee players be bound 
                anywhere?</p>
              <p align="left">The design for EverQuest called for classes having 
                reason to depend on others. This is one aspect of that interdependence. 
                Melee characters depend on casters for binding, and also depend 
                on casters for a quick trip back to their corpse when they die.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: But running back to my corpse 
                is time-consuming!</p>
              <p align="left">And it is that running time that encourages melee 
                characters to form relationships with those who can reduce that 
                time. By, for instance, grouping with a cleric or paladin who 
                can perform a resurrection, melee characters gain the advantage 
                of being able to rejoin combat, or at least the group, much faster. 
                If melee characters were able to bind anywhere, that facet of 
                play would be much different than it is today.</p>
              <p align="left">Binding rules as they are also encourage casters 
                to keep melee players alive even at the expense of their own life. 
                A melee character being involved in a run back to their corpse 
                from a city slows down the group and takes them all out of action 
                for a while. Given the choice of taking a death and getting back 
                into the action immediately, versus taking a death and having 
                to wait 20 minutes, groups will often choose the former. Overall, 
                the game is more exciting due to the important need to not only 
                overcome the current objective, but to keep melee characters alive 
                at all cost in the process.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: I'm still not happy with the 
                way this is handled. Is there anything we can do to change it?</p>
              <p align="left">No. The binding rules, especially the dependence 
                formed by melee versus caster binding, are a basic tenet of EverQuest 
                and work very well in implementation. Players form relationships 
                necessary to deal with the binding rules, and overall the game

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.6 Class Balance and Interdependence</h4>
              <p align="left">As game designers, we speak frequently of terms 
                such as "balance", "equality", and "class interdependence". These 
                terms often raise issues in the official forums for which universal 
                agreement is hard to achieve. Nonetheless, it does make a good 
                subject for this portion of the FAQ.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: What is "balance" and how does 
                it differ from "equality"?</p>
              <p align="left">"Equality" refers to a state where things are identical 
                in nature. For instance, if I can wield a sword, and someone else 
                can wield a sword, we are equal in that respect. "Balance" refers 
                to the comparison of two dissimilar ideas, concepts, or things. 
                A pound of feathers is balanced with a pound of bricks, yet one 
                would hardly argue that they are "equal" in every respect.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How does that apply to the classes 
                in game?</p>
              <p align="left">We strive to "balance" the classes rather than make 
                them equal. To do this, we give them strengths and weaknesses 
                that are hopefully complementary to the strengths and weaknesses 
                of other classes.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why not go with "equality"?</p>
              <p align="left">This is because classes being identical to each 
                other would destroy the goal of having a class-based system.</p>
              <p align="left">Some other games choose to use a skill-based system 
                where any character is as likely to obtain certain skills, abilities, 
                and items as any other character. Over time, people tend to gravitate 
                toward whatever combination of skills, abilities, and items are 
                deemed to be most advantageous at that particular time. It creates 
                a situation where someone can end up with a "useless" character 
                purely on the basis of choosing skills, abilities, and items, 
                which are deemed by the playerbase as a whole to be unimportant. 
                The environment compels character to gravitate towards the most 
                efficient skill-set lest they be ostracized. The end result is 
                that successful characters become "cookie-cutters" of every other 
                successful character.</p>
              <p align="left">Class-based systems limit the skills, abilities, 
                and items that any person can use on the basis of choices made 
                at the beginning. Furthermore, the complimentary strengths and 
                weaknesses of each class guide people away from always choosing 
                to play the same class. The fact that a cleric is an excellent 
                class, and considered immensely valuable to a group does not lead 
                to a situation where a group of six clerics is considered the 
                good by any means.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: But this means that some classes 
                are more powerful than others are.</p>
              <p align="left">Absolutely. This brings us to the point that "offensive 
                power" is not the only measure of "balance". It is merely one 
                of many concepts that contribute to the "balance" of a class. 
                A class can be "overpowered", meaning that they are more powerful 
                than they should be, without necessarily being "out of balance". 
                The inverse can also be true. Here's a list of the major balance 
                components. The order that they are presented is not necessarily 
                an indication of the weight of each concept. In fact, the weight 
                given to each component varies depending on the class.</p>
              <p align="left">Major balance components:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>Power</li>
                  <li>Usefulness to the group</li>
                  <li>Versatility</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left">"Power" indicates all of the attributes, skills, 
                abilities, and spells that help a class engage and kill the enemy. 
                It includes both offensive and defensive power. For example, warriors 
                are known for their high attributes, skills, and abilities. They 
                are fairly powerful, but perhaps no more "powerful" overall than 
                the monk. Though a warrior can stay in a fight much longer than 
                a monk, the monk can do more damage than the warrior.</p>
              <p align="left">"Usefulness to the group" speaks of things that 
                the class can do that is desirable and helps improve the group. 
                If the ability is rare or unique, it carries extra weight. As 
                an example, enchanters have the unique ability to improve the 
                mana regeneration rate of others. This is considered valuable 
                to groups that have casters.</p>
              <p align="left">"Versatility" refers to the breadth of the abilities 
                possessed by the class. It is the number of different types of 
                things that the class can do. Versatility is a key for "soloing" 
                in EverQuest. For instance, Druids and Necromancers are known 
                for their versatility, with Necromancers being more powerful, 
                and druids being more useful to the group.</p>
              <p align="left">In addition to the major balance components, there 
                also exist minor balancing modifiers. These are aspects of the 
                game that do not necessarily relate directly to the major components, 
                however figure into the situation in some other way. They are 
                the way that the game is set up to interact with a particular 
                race/class combo in order to promote the health of the game in 
                the long run. They cannot be traded directly for additional points 
                in the major components, but are used to buffer or bolster the 
                effect of higher or lower scores in those major components.</p>
              <p align="left">Minor balancing modifiers include things such as:</p>
              <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li>Greater or lesser experience requirements</li>
                  <li>More or less faction problems</li>
                  <li>Racial skills and abilities</li>
                  <li>Better or worse availability of items</li>
                  <li>Availability of quests</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p align="left">All of these issues figure in to the overall "balance" 
                of a class.</p>

              <h4 align="left" class="subHeader">4.7 Graphics</h4>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why aren't there more unique 
                textures used to provide more types of armor and weapons for the 
                existing characters?</p>
              <p align="left">Different appearances, such as those created by 
                different looking armor or designs on weapons, are applied by 
                laying a texture over an existing polygon. In order for these 
                textures to be displayed, they must be stored in the texture memory 
                of the video card. The available texture memory on the video card 
                defines how many textures can be stored without swapping them 
                to disk. Exceeding the texture memory limitation of video cards 
                causes excess textures to be swapped in and out of the disk, a 
                process that causes a severe reduction in framerate. For this 
                reason, we limit the number of textures being stored to minimize 
                that reduction in framerate.</p>
              <p align="left">Although the texture memory pool is limited from 
                the standpoint of completely different textures, we do have the 
                ability to "tint" them without requiring that more memory be used. 
                Tinting results in the identical texture being shaded toward a 
                new color. This is how we create armor of different colors.</p>
              <p align="left">Though the standard video card on the market now 
                contains more than the 2MB of texture memory included on the standard 
                Voodoo1 card for which EQ was originally aimed, EQ needs to continue 
                operating correctly for those users as well.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: How about using more textures 
                for Kunark, and other zones that require enhanced system specs?</p>
              <p align="left">We do, however those enhanced textures are limited 
                to those available within the specific environment, such as those 
                found on the bodies of NPCs or on world geometry itself. Armor, 
                or special weapons designs, require that the texture be available 
                in all zones. Though there is a difference in local (cf. zone-specific) 
                or global (cf. world-specific) textures from an implementation 
                standpoint, they all use the same texture-memory pool on the video 
                card. The difference is that the local textures are loaded only 
                while in the zone itself, whereas the global ones are loaded regardless 
                of the zone.</p>
              <p align="left">While we have the capability to used more textures 
                within the stationary aspects of the new areas, mobile aspects, 
                such as armor on a character, need to be part of the global texture 
                set.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why does all of the monk armor 
                make them look like newbies? Can't you tint it or something?</p>
              <p align="left">Monk armor, specifically the chest piece, gives 
                them the appearance of a few small straps covering bare tattooed 
                skin. While the armor appears to consist of a mere harness, it 
                is actually the entire chest-piece, including the skin. Tinting 
                this armor would also cause the skin to be tinted, which would 
                look quite unnatural in the environment.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Will the existing zone graphics 
                ever be updated in the fashion of Kunark?</p>
              <p align="left">No. The existing world must remain operational for 
                those who had the system specs quoted at the time that the part 
                of the world in question was released. New areas are likely to 
                be developed that will require enhanced system specs, and these 
                will be done in the same fashion as Kunark.</p>

              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why isn't there a quest in game 
                for [insert concept here]?</p>
              <p align="left">It is not unusual for us to receive queries regarding 
                quests, and why there isn't a quest for a particular race/class 
                combo, a quest of a particular type, or a quest for a particular 
                area or scope. In most cases, the answer here is that a quest 
                of that type just hasn't been done yet. This is not to say that 
                we will never expand quests into these areas, just that there 
                are so many areas and concepts deserving of additional attention 
                concerning quests that they can't all be completed at one time.</p>
              <p align="left">Quest designers often work for days or weeks just 
                for the implementation of a single quest, depending on the difficulty 
                and scope. They are constantly working on newer and more enticing 
                quests for the players, and those quests will appear in game regularly.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why can't my class [insert skill 
                here]?</p>
              <p align="left">Undoubtedly, the answer here is that the skill wasn't 
                put in for a particular class due to balance reasons. As listed 
                above in the balance section, each class needs to have strengths 
                and weaknesses that are complimented by the strengths and weaknesses 
                of other classes.</p>
              <p align="left">In the real world, there's no reason why someone 
                wouldn't be able to pick up a sword and learn something about 
                its operation. In EverQuest, classes must be limited in what they 
                can or cannot do, due to the fact that there is always going to 
                be players out there that could learn and do everything if it 
                were allowed. These players would certainly be large enough in 
                number at a certain point that they would start displacing people 
                who did not have the time to do that.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why isn't there an item that 
                [insert concept here]?</p>
              <p align="left">Item requests come to us as often as requests for 
                a particular quest. In the same fashion, it is often the case 
                that the item just hasn't been created in game at this point, 
                because there might not be a niche where its appearance would 
                make sense. There's also the subject of balance, that being that 
                there is only so many things that we can do with an item without 
                having that item step on the toes of another classes' abilities.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why is/isn't [insert item here] 
                NODROP and/or LORE?</p>
              <p align="left">NODROP and LORE are item tags that are used for 
                various reasons.</p>
              <p align="left">NODROP was originally intended as a way to insure 
                that the character that completes a quest is the character that 
                actually put forth the effort. In other cases, NODROP has been 
                used as an anti-twinking mechanism, allowing us to create items 
                that are more powerful than we normally could (e.g. planar items). 
                As NODROP prevents trading of items, and given that a healthy 
                player-economy is desired in EverQuest, we are actively restricting 
                its use to situations where the original intent of NODROP can 
                be fulfilled.</p>
              <p align="left">LORE was created in order to prevent players from 
                doing quests multiple times with effort either no greater, or 
                marginally greater, than the effort required to do it once. It 
                has also been used as a way to keep players from "farming" items 
                that are known to be popular, thus preventing others from attempting 
                to obtain those items. As we want the game world to make as much 
                sense as possible, we're restricting the use of LORE as an anti-farming 
                mechanism except in cases where no suitable alternative exists.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why isn't archery viable as 
                a primary means of combat?</p>
              <p align="left">Archery was designed to be a secondary form of combat 
                for those capable of using it. It is not, however, meant to replace 
                melee attacks in those encounters. The reason for this is that 
                we do not want archery, which only needs to cost the arrow itself, 
                to replace or become suitable competition for spell-casting. Making 
                archery always do the 200-500 points of damage per hit that would 
                be needed for it to become a primary combat skill, would put those 
                capable of archery in direct competition with damage-centric spell 
                casters.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Why are NPCs stronger than players 
                at a given level? Why can they do things that we can't?</p>
              <p align="left">NPCs are designed to be competition for groups of 
                players. As such, they need the ability to stand up to the attacks 
                of up to six or more players for a reasonable amount of time to 
                insure that the encounters are challenging. The only other option 
                available to make these encounters challenging would be to insure 
                that they always attack in groups. Doing this would of course 
                vastly increase the number of NPCs in the world, placing excess 
                load on the EverQuest servers, and would also make it much more 
                difficult for players to take the required time for restoration 
                between combats.</p>
              <p align="left">As the body of an NPC needs to be strong relative 
                to the body of the player, so does its mind. While the former 
                is easy to accomplish, the latter is a much more daunting task. 
                Dozens and dozens of supercomputers still cannot match the situational 
                decision-making process of a human. Rather than expend additional 
                computing power that could better be used elsewhere, we chose 
                in many cases to allow NPCs to do things that players cannot. 
                For instance, NPCs will not drown, take damage from falling, or 
                be burned while in lava.</p>
              <p class="question" align="left">Q: Everyone wants an [insert item 
                here], why don't you make it drop more?</p>
              <p align="left">That certainly seems like an easy solution, however 
                making items drop more is not the solution for everyone who wants 
                one. One of the reasons that everyone wants the item in question 
                is that it is rare. Demand exceeds supply. The value of the item 
                reflects this. Just making the item more available would only 
                serve to reducing the value of the item overall. Once "everyone" 
                has the item in question, its value would be basically meaningless.</p>
              <p align="left">Additionally, widely available high-end items cause 
                characters to move towards becoming cookie-cutters of each other. 
                There is less to set one character apart from another if they 
                are all wearing the same gear. Right now, someone in game can 
                feel a sense of accomplishment if they are the only person, or 
                one of a small number of people to have a particular item. This 
                sense of accomplishment is one of the things that many people
