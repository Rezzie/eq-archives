size=4><span class="header">Stranger in Qeynos</span></font></b></p>
<p align="justify">Esteemed members of the Council,</p>
<p align="justify">My plea to you is repeated and I can only pray that you do not 
disregard these words as nothing more than a humble bartender's cry. The increase 
of our fair city's troubles are even more apparent since my last letter to you, 
and I have yet to see any actions on your behalf, or upon the side of any who 
would hold the authority to do such. I beg to you, our leaders, to whom our loyalty 
and trust have been pledged. Our cries must be heard.</p>
<p align="justify">Beyond my own words, I have seen the steady increase of these 
vile, unsavory thieves and bullies within our streets and our proud establishments, 
but it seems that the trouble has expanded beyond our city walls and has begun 
to over flow into the humble hills outside our fair city. As I write to you now, 
one such merchant, a trader from the City of Freeport to our West, slumbers wearily 
within one of the tavern's suites. Upon the bruised and battered face of this 
gentleman you will see the signs of truth within my testament and warnings of 
the coming waves of corruption to our city, and to our kingdom. I will enclose 
my own words of this man's encounter while traveling through our once safe plains 
in the event that you do not hear it from him before he returns to Freeport.</p>
<p align="justify">This man, a jeweler and a rather young individual to the ways 
of trade had carried a shipment of polished, but yet uncut stones from the mines 
within the Butcherblock Mountains. His caravan small in size and holding only 
two hired individuals to protect against any encounters that might cross their 
path, he made his way safely through the haunted wood of Kithicor and found no 
troubles with the Orc infested territories of High Pass Hold. But it was upon 
entering the Hills of Qeynos that did he find himself faced with troubles that 
would perhaps ruin this young man's career. His description to me of the incident 
was brief and I do not blame his difficulty in describing those who attacked him 
as such chaos would leave any unsuspecting man nearly blinded to the sights before 
him.</p>
<p align="justify">The two escorts were quickly murdered by the attacker and the 
merchant himself badly beaten into unconsciousness. During the brief moments that 
he was able to catch sight of his attackers, the gentleman claimed that he caught 
sight of the famed Red Sashes of Donovan upon their waists. A brouche he also 
described, one which bore an uncanny resemblance to those worn by the sect governed 
by Rykonis Sw`Vaye, a rather recent exile from our own city only a brief year 
past.</p>
<p align="justify">Unfortunately, my tale of the growing disturbances does not end 
there. Tyllman Lushfeld, a rather eccentric young bard who has frequented my establishment 
for many a year now, has also met the gruesome hand of these brutes. Tender at 
heart, the young lad has grown quite fond of a certain woman who has returned 
to my tavern nightly, her face is undisputedly recognized by these old eyes but 
I can not for the life of me place where or how I do know her. Although she is 
sweet in appearance, her cold, frigid persona is quite apparent as she rudely 
shuns the young lad's advances. This is something that normally would not catch 
my attentions, as she would not be the first to ignore the bard's advances, but 
the manner in which she throws him aside is disturbing. The woman herself is alone 
until the same time each night, shortly after the Clock's third chime in the morning, 
when a scoundrel makes his way to her and together they speak in hushed tones 
before quickly disappearing into the night.</p>
<p align="justify">I bear no physical proof to you, as I know it is something that 
is so favored among the process of trial and justice, but the testimony of this 
man should leave you to, at the very least, perform an investigation and increase 
our defenses through our city. We can not allow what is festering within our kingdom 
to continue. Our way of life depends upon your ear and reasoning.</p>
