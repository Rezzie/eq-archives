<p align="center"><b><font color=#ff9900 size=4 class="header">History Repeats</font></b></p>
<font 
face=Arial></font> 
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever and 
Dagda Icefury had spent the last several days spelunking in the Hole and the ruins 
of the old city of Paineel. The ruins were an eerie, dusty and dark place. Strange 
and terrifying sounds echoed throughout the once splendorous city, like wails 
of torment from souls suffering in eternal agony. Though Ognit seemed unfazed 
by the atmosphere, Dabner and Dagda were very skittish about their journey down 
into the Hole.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dabner swore that the sounds were 
none other than the ghosts of Erudites slain during the Great War that destroyed 
the old city years ago. Ognit hypothesized that the strange noises were caused 
by undercurrents of wind wafting from the surface above and were nothing to be 
concerned about. Dagda knew not the cause of the sounds but she was sure that 
the three of them should not be in that place. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">After spending some time exploring 
the ruins and wandering deeper into the cavern, the three came across the very 
thing for which Ognit had been searching. Before them stood The Hatch and the 
wall of Living Stone. The Living Stone is an artifact of great power created by 
Brell Serilis the purpose of which was to stop the creatures from the Plane of 
the Underfoot from entering into the world. The residents of the old city once 
conducted experiments on the Living Stone, attempting to find a way to harness 
its power. The experiments damaged the wall of Living Stone and creatures began 
to breach the wall and threatened the city. The Erudites constructed The Hatch; 
a sort of life support system that kept the Living Stone strong after the earthen 
Lord Yael escaped and threatened their destruction with his army of elementals.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ognit sought to study both The Hatch 
and the wall of Living Stone. He felt that the Erudites were simply not qualified 
for that sort of study and indeed it would take the delicate and careful touch 
of a gnome to properly study the artifact and perhaps find a way to harness its 
power. History has a way of repeating itself.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ognit considered the first of his 
experiments successful. He found that the wall of Living Stone was able to release 
enormous amounts of power, as evidenced by the tremendous earthquakes he was able 
to cause simply by infusing the Hatch with just a small amount of magical energy. 
Indeed, it seemed the two worked together like a transformer, turning small amounts 
of energy into tremendous surges of power. Though he had no idea how one could 
harness the released energy, he was impressed with the results nonetheless.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dagda was terrified and believed that 
the gnome was tinkering with powers beyond his comprehension. She threatened to 
leave them both down there, particularly when the experiments began to cause earthquakes 
of greater and greater magnitude. Against her better judgement, she stayed. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ognit saw the greater earthquakes 
as a sign that his experiments were going well. He was getting even better power 
output for the same amount of energy. Dabner eventually began to become frightened 
too and started to side with Dagda, urging the wizard to abandon the experiment. 
Ognit was incensed and no amount of convincing would deter him from his experimentation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the inevitable happened. 
Ognit channeled just a small amount of energy into the Hatch. It wasn't much, 
not even enough to kill a moss snake. However this time, the Living Wall began 
to shudder spasmodically and took on a pale, sickly color. The earthquake that 
resulted was truly terrifying. Chunks of stone began falling from the ceiling 
and the ground itself began to be ripped apart. From the huge gashes in the earth, 
the three saw terrifying creatures emerge. All about them were sounds of shrieking, 
crying and bellowing. The noises were both exclamations of excitement for finally 
being freed and rage for being imprisoned for such a long time. The three began 
to flee the hole in terror as the creatures began to swarm around them, their 
ears ringing from the unholy screams. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">As they made haste toward the surface, 
they came across a figure that looked to be an Erudite. The Erudite was walking 
slowly and limping slightly. He was filthy, covered with dirt and soot. His skin 
was pallid, as one who had not stood under the glare of harsh sunlight for ages. 
He wore a robe that was a splotchy brownish color. It was difficult to tell if 
this was the robe's original color or if it was the result of the filth that covered 
it. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">He turned quickly and upon seeing 
them, he spoke. "Gnomes… And a Barbarian woman of all things! I don't know whether 
I should thank you or draw the full sum of the life-force from your bodies right 
here and now!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dagda pushed her way past the two 
gnomes, putting herself between they and the Erudite. Facing the strange man she 
asked, "Who are you?"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">He folded his arms across his chest 
and smiled slightly. He raised an eyebrow as he spoke, "My name is Dartain of 
the Dark Truth. I don't suppose you have any idea about what you have just done? 
Or perhaps I should say undone, do you?" </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">He seemed to stare through their souls 
with eyes fierce yet lined with weariness. "Your meddling has caused the Wall 
of Living Stone to weaken once again. Though your actions have finally allowed 
me to break free after being trapped for so many a year, you have also allowed 
many of the denizens that were imprisoned behind that wall to escape into the 
world again as well."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Even in the dim light, Ognit's face 
became visibly paled. Dartain continued, "The Hatch is still unharmed and appears 
to be functioning as it should. I believe the wall will repair itself again in 
time. While the breach remains however, there will be a steady flow of creatures 
escaping from the underfoot. I suggest you make haste out of this place and take 
warning to those above, so that they may prepare themselves."</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">As he finished speaking, murky shadows 
made their way from the floor and encircled the dirty robes the strange man wore. 
As he disappear from view he softly muttered, "Finally, I am free…"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">The trio said not a word to each other, 
and continued at a dead sprint toward the surface as the sound of an army of creatures 
rumbled directly behind them. Reaching the top of the ruins, they held their breath 
as they jumped into the cold water and wriggled their way with panicked speed 
through the rocky underwater cavern that lead into the new city of Paineel.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">After emerging from the water, the 
first breath they took was used to issue forth a scream of terror. All around 
them, terrible creatures of rock and stone wandered in the open throughout the 
streets of the new city of Paineel. Already, cries of alarm could be heard being 
raised from deep within the bowels of the city. Even more alarming was the fact 
that the earth still seemed to be shaking, even after all this time. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dagda in an effort to warn the Heretics 
of the impending danger shouted, "Horrible creatures from the earth have broken 
loose! Run for your lives!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dabner exclaimed, "Brell Serilis help 
us all! They are everywhere!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Dagda gave both gnomes a shove forward 
and yelled, "Go! Run!" The three began at a dead run once again. She kept behind 
the gnomes to make sure they were both still alive and running.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">As he ran, Ognit smacked himself in 
the forehead screaming, "Oh gods! What have I done! Just keep running everyone!"</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Guards Menbuknar and Heridion stood 
near the entrance to the new city of Paineel. The pair of skeletal sentries stood 
staring out over the grassy alcove through hollow eye sockets that were long without 
flesh or blood watching over the new city of Paineel in eternal service to their 
Heretic masters. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">"Nooiiissseeey," Menbuknar said with 
a quiet disembodied voice like sandpaper in response to the sudden shouts.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Guard Heridion took several steps 
forward and pointed, "Rooockssss." Hefting their swords above their head, the 
two skeletal guards shambled clumsily out into the courtyard and began to fight 
against the intruding earth elementals.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">As he swung away against the creatures 
made from earth itself, Menbuknar sniffed the air with a nose that wasn't there 
and rasped, "Gnoommmessss."</font></p>
