<STRONG>
Q: Why is there no Icon for the Bard Mana Song (Cassindra’s Chorus of Clarity)?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: There are different types of Bard Songs.  Most Bard Songs leave an icon on 
your character because the song has a duration - usually 5 to 15 seconds.  Each time 
the Bard sings the song she renews the duration - this means that a Bard who continues 
to sing the song can potentially keep the song effect going indefinitely.  

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Some Bard songs do not have durations - you receive the effect when the Bard sings it, 
but will not get another “dose” until she sings it again.  Cassindra’s Chorus of 
Clarity (the mana song) is one of these songs - it does not have an actual duration, 
so you don’t get an icon on your screen.

</font><A NAME="alliance"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: What is the Duration of Alliance/Benevolence?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: Alliance and Benevolence (Enchanter) are spells that add some of an NPC’s 
faction to your own.  This means that if you cast Alliance on a Guard of Qeynos, 
your faction with the Guards of Qeynos goes up.  

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Because this spell had the potential to be cast many times, and because of the limit 
of having 15 spell on a character at a time, we decided to code Alliance/Benevolence 
different from other duration based spells.  Alliance and Benevolence <B>do not 
count</B> towards your 15 spell limit.  When you cast the spell, it will last until 
you zone - there is no duration component to these spells.  Because of this, we do 
not display a spell icon on your screen - partially because you never need to worry 
about the spell going away, and partially to keep your screen from filling with icons.

</font><A NAME="levitate"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: What changed with Levitate on the last patch?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: Levitate was changed so that if you already have the Levitate spell on your 
character, no other levitate effect will take hold.  This was done to prevent a 
certain abuses of the spell which involved chain casting levitate to reach areas 
which were not designed to be player accessible.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

To get your levitation spell renewed, you can click to dispel it (this is one of 
the few spells that everybody can click to remove).  Once the spell has been removed, 
you will be able to have it renewed.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Bards were unintentionally hurt with these changes - their song will not overwrite 
its own levitate effect.  This error will be fixed with the next patch.



</font><A NAME="resistance"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Does fire save better then cold (or magic/poison/disease)?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: I get asked this one a lot.  All of our saving throws use the same table.  
This means that a Fire based DD spell that does 100 damage has exactly the same 
chance of not being resisted as a Cold based DD spell that does 100 damage.  The 
same holds true for Magic, Disease and Poison.  With our system, the type of damage 
dealt does not modify saving throw computations.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

However…

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Some creatures are more resistant to certain types of magic then others.  Fire 
Goblins, for example, have a bonus saving throw verses fire.  Polar Bears have a 
better save verses cold.  Most of the time, if it makes sense that a creature would 
be more resistant to a certain type of attack, it is.  It is easier to damage a Fire 
Goblin with Shock of Frost then with Ignite.  It is easier to damage a Polar Bear 
with Burst of Flame then with Numbing Cold.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

If you encounter a creature that is not taking as much damage as it should from a 
spell, you may wish to switch to a spell that deals a different type of damage.  
(fire to cold, cold to magic, magic to disease, etc.)

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

You may also want to see if the creature was hanging out near an NPC Cleric, Shaman 
or Druid - the creature may be under the protection from a few Endure or Resist 
spells.  In these circumstances, I recommend liberal doses of Cancel Magic.



</font><A NAME="changes"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<P><HR WIDTH=75%><BR>

<STRONG>
Q: Did the Spell Resistances/Spell Durations/etc. change on 
(this/last/4 weeks ago) patch?
</STRONG>

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

A: Almost every time we do a patch I get asked if the Resistance Rates, Duration 
of Spells, etc. were modified.  I have had people swear that the duration on their 
spells went down by 50%, or that creatures started saving 20% better after patches - 
sometimes even patches where we did not modify spell data.

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

So, just to lay rumors to rest, we have not made “hundreds” of blanket changes to 
Spell Resistance Rates or Spell Durations since Beta.  As circumstance have 
warranted we <B>have</B> adjusted <B>specific</B> spells - usually to make the 
duration longer.  The only <B>blanket</B> change we have done post-Beta was a Spell 
Duration modification made a few months after release; I increased the duration of 
most Buff spells by about 20%.  

</font><P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Every other rumor has been just that - a rumor.
