<p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="ff9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="header">Thubr 
Axebringer</span></font></b></p>
<p align="center"><span class="header"><b><font size="5" color="ff9900" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="header">(Thubir)</font></b></span></p>
<font size=2> </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr Axebringer was born 
Thubir Axebringer to his parents Mor and Vanka Axebringer. Thubr's younger sister, 
Laka, had trouble pronouncing the "ir" sound in his name, so she called him Thubr 
(pronounced Thoob-r). The nickname has remained with him since that day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Growing up in South Kaladim, 
Thubr spent many hours playing in the areas around the arena. Fascinated by how 
weapons were made, he would often peek through the windows of the Staff & Spear 
weapon shop to watch the storeowner, Didek Stormhammer, cousin of King Kazon, 
hard at work. When he wasn't peeking into windows, he sat on the rooftop of the 
building to watch the great warriors fight in the arena nearby. He did this not 
merely for entertainment, but Thubr studied their fighting techniques, committing 
them to memory, developing his own skills.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One day, Thubr sat in his 
usual spot atop the Staff & Spear, waiting for the battles to start, while banging 
a small pipe with his hammer. He had carefully shaped the dull piece of metal 
into a tiny dagger. Hearing the noise on his roof, however, Didek Stormhammer 
went up on the roof and pulled Thubr back down by his ear.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Child, what were you doing 
on the roof of my shop?" Didek asked. Before Thubr could answer, Didek spoke again. 
"Where did you get this from?" He pulled the tiny well-crafted dagger from a pocket 
in Thubr's pant leg.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Siirrr…" Thubr stammered, 
"I made that from an old pipe I found behind the shop. 'Tis mine, give it back 
t'me."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In disbelief, Didek asked 
again, "You are too young to have made such a finely crafted weapon, where did 
you get this from?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Aye, I did make it," said 
Thubr, undaunted, "give it back, 'tis mine. I learned how to make it by watchin' 
weapons bein' made through the window o'ye shop."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Didek, seeing promise in 
the lad, asked Thubr to come work for him as an apprentice. Through the years, 
the young dwarf learned how to make many weapons. He also continued his rooftop 
study of the arena combatants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was years later that 
King Kazon Stormhammer came to the shop to look for new weapons for his Stormguard. 
Browsing over his cousin's inventory, the king found nothing that sparked his 
interest. About to leave, he spotted Thubr standing before his workbench. The 
King told Thubr to step aside that he might examine the weapons upon his table. 
"Didek!" the King shouted over his shoulder as he perused what lay before him, 
"Why did you not show me these weapons?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Cousin, those are just 
ones that the boy is working on," said Didek, gesturing toward Thubr, who was 
now a young man. "I did not deem them of the best quality."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">King Kazon turned to Thubr 
and told him he wanted the weapons for his Stormguard. After pausing but a moment, 
Thubr responded, "The high quality weapons I make on me own time are too good 
t'give to anyone else. I keep 'em for m'self because I am a great warrior and 
deserve the best."</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marveling at the audaciousness 
of the youth, the King asked, "What is your name, boy?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"He is Thubr Axebringer, 
milord," interrupted Didek.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">King Kazon studied the young 
man, sizing him up. The pause was awkward only for Didek, for Thubr stood steady 
under the scrutiny. Finally, The King said, "If you are truly a great warrior, 
as you say, you should be in the Stormguard." Lifting his sword, the King beckoned 
Thubr to kneel before him and tapped him on the shoulder, proclaiming, "Thubr 
Axebringer, the great warrior, is now a member of the Stormguard." He sheathed 
his sword and said to Thubr, "Report for duty immediately. And bring the weapons 
with you!"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr, for once, was speechless. 
He stood then bowed. "Yes, Sire," was all he said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr spent many years with 
the Stormguard, learning new tactical skills and honing the ones he had acquired 
on his own. He also continued to improve his blacksmithing skills, creating stronger 
and better weapons for the Stormguard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In South Kaladim, at the 
Pub Kal, owned by the Darkfoam family, he ran into many interesting people while 
drinking. It is here that he was tricked into becoming an ambassador for Kaladim. 
Although he was good at getting the job done, Thubr was not the typical ambassador. 
He shares the traditional dwarven qualities of stubbornness and love of drink. 
When he is drunk, however, he is very friendly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thubr became a master brewer 
through his years as well, adding to his reputation as an expert blacksmith and 
fierce warrior. The owner of the Grub & Grog, Retchin Krundd, a decidedly unattractive 
but friendly and flirtatious female Dwarf, lost a bet with Thubr and, consequently, 
part ownership of the pub to him as well. Located in East Freeport, this establishment 
is considered one of the roughest taverns on all of Norrath, frequented by course 
adventuring types and the notorious Freeport Militia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout his adventures 
and difficult battles, Thubr has traveled with many people. Some of these he even 
regards as friends. He has battled along side the likes of Firiona Vie, Al'Kabor, 
Dreezil Pocketdip, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, Dagda Icefury, Lorisyn Oakwynd, 
Lyirae Oakwynd, Sionachie Heartsinger, and Sir Jevik Isqual to name a few. Of 
these, he would speak most highly of Firiona Vie, Al'Kabor, and Dreezil Pocketdip. 
Though he views Al'Kabor as an arrogant and longwinded Erudite, Thubr gains much 
entertainment from him, often following him around. Firiona Vie he respects, as 
most do, and is always concerned for her safety.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dreezil Pocketdip, a shady 
halfling, is one of Thubr's favorite drinking buddies. After long battles, the 
two can be found visiting the nearest bar to guzzle down many types of ale together.</font></p>
