                      </font></b></p>
                    <p align="left">Gordon Wrinn is the Associate Producer of EverQuest Live.  Also known by many as Abashi, Gordon has been a well-known spokesperson for EverQuest for well over a year now.</p>

<p align="left">Gordon is originally from Michigan and, as he puts it, not from a single place, but from all over the state, having moved everywhere from Detroit to the rural areas of Webberville and Fowlerville.  He attended Howe Military School in Indiana where he obtained his high school diploma, then the University of Arizona for a period of time.</p>

<p align="left">Working with computers has been a long-time vocation.  His first position was technical - fixing computers and printers at a small retail store in Tucson, Arizona.  He learned a great deal on the job to supplement his own body of knowledge, gained from working with bulletin board systems (BBSs) at home on his own time.  His management skills were noticed there, and within a few months he was promoted to Service Manager, supervising seven other people.  Networking became his primary interest within a couple of years and he began to move into positions where he could further that aspect of his career.</p>

<p align="left">After becoming a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE), Gordon moved into system design and management, in both freelance and employee capacities.  After a former employer’s corporate headquarters shut down his local office, they retained him as a consultant for several months.  Meanwhile, Gordon’s involvement in the EverQuest Guide Program and his astute assessments of various problems and situations brought him to the attention of Verant management.  The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p align="left">Gordon served as Community Relations Manager for Verant Interactive, Inc., until just recently, when he was promoted to Associate Producer for EverQuest Live.  His management and coordination skills have proven to be valuable assets to the team.</p>

<p align="left">Gaming has been an interest of Gordon’s ever since the days of Lawnmower on the Commodore PET 14, growing nearly to obsessive stages (almost a pre-requisite for getting into this business) at some points in his life.  After going cold turkey for a few years in order to get through high school, he got started with bulletin board systems and from there into multi-user dungeon games (MUDs) and eventually online games.</p>

<p align="left">In addition to computers, Gordon has also been an avid pool enthusiast, even to the point of competing professionally for a time.  From there, he went on to pursue and obtain his pilot license.  Since that time, he hasn’t found a new hobby to occupy his time that isn’t related to his job, though he keeps searching!  He currently lives in the San Diego area with his wife of seven years, Marie.</p>
