              <P align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day4_1.html', '775')"><img src="images/day4_1_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>Our 
                heroes have had a difficult time traveling lately. It seems they 
                have had to fall back on their Steamfont mountain climbing skills, 
                and improvise a bit. There is a steep and rugged mountain range 
                on Velious which juts up out of the continent, running north and 
                south, virtually dividing its eastern and western portions. Giants 
                wander its foothills seeking the Coldain, whom they apparently 
                despise. The reason for this perilous trek is that the local dwarves 
                are reportedly leading the adventurers to their city within the 
                earth!</P>
              <br clear=all>

              <P align="left">Meanwhile, the geography of the mountain range is 
                quite spectacular, as you can see in the images sent back by the 
                party. The dangers abound - from the giants, and from the earth 
                itself. These must be the youngest mountains on Norrath, judging 
                by their sharp crags and steep inclines. </P><br clear=all>
              <P align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day4_2.html', '775')"><img src="images/day4_2_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>In 
                the foothills of the mountain range, the explorers noted a Kromrif 
                (frost giant) military outpost. Taking care not to get too close 
                on the advice of the dwarves, the brave party managed to gather 
                imagery for us. It is amazing to consider how these and other 
                creatures of Velious have adapted to the harsh conditions of the 
                icy tundra. </P>
              <br clear=all>
              <P align="left">Another interesting, if deadly, species are the 
                ice wurms – great reptilian beasts of draconic origin who live 
                among the crevasses of the Daggerflow River. The river is more 
                of a glacier, really, which slowly advances toward the Great Scar 
                in the south. One interesting spot of note was what appears to 
                be a ruined temple found just to the south of the steep valley 
                known as the Great Scar.</P>
              <br clear=all>
              <P align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day4_3.html', '775')"><img src="images/day4_3_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="left" border="0" hspace="8"></a>When 
                the dwarves were chased from their home within the crystal caverns, 
                they knew that they would have to create a fortress that would 
                be not only easily defensible, but as well hidden as possible. 
                In those days centuries ago, the city was carved out of the very 
                mountains our party now traverses. Once, there were numerous guard 
                towers dotting the mountainsides, camouflaging the two protecting 
                the entrance to Thurgadin, also known as New Froststone. </P>
              <br clear=all>

              <P align="left">The intervening centuries and the complacency of 
                the dwarves after such a long period of relative safety led them 
                to abandon the other towers to the ruin of time and weather. Now, 
                there is but one set of towers, the two guarding the entrance 
                to the dwarven city. The security under which the entrance is 
                held prompted our explorers to camp just outside the entrance 
                for the night and wait for morning to enter. As they settled for 
                the night, they spoke the sights they would see in the morning 
                in the cavern city.</P><br clear=all>
              <P align="left"><a href="javascript:openWindow('screenshots/day4_4.html', '775')"><img src="images/day4_4_lo.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" border="0" hspace="8"></a>Our 
                party’s hosts grew somber at one point, their faces lined with 
                concern, as they described another maze of caverns known to exist 
                beneath the mountains. Known as Velketor’s Labyrinth, the Coldain 
                quickly assured the adventurers that none of them had ever entered 
                that lair of evil. It is apparently known to them, and they indicate 
                it is known to all who reside on the ice continent, as a place 
                from which none return. When asked where the entrance lies, the 
                Coldain shuddered and refused to answer. One can only hope that 
                none of the party will decide to find out for themselves!</P>
