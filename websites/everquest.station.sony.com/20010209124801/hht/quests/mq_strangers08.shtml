<p align="justify"><b>The Capture of Mordavin Telase </b></p>
<p align="justify">A report from the League of Antonican Bards: </p>
<p align="justify">Mordavin Telase, the mastermind behind all of the tragedy and 
chaos that had fallen upon the fair city of Qeynos, has finally been apprehended 
and brought in alive to face his sentence. Lord Vegalys Keldrane, Magistrate and 
advisor to King Antonius Bayle was charged with the duty of apprehending Mordavin. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Calling for assistance from the local populace and relying upon 
the reports given him by the Rangers of Surefall Glade, Vegalys and the group 
set out into the Karanas in search of Mordavin. With the help of the tracking 
skills of the rangers and druids in attendance, Mordavin's hiding place was eventually 
found. </p>
<p align="justify">Vegalys demanded that Mordavin give himself up and was instructed 
to come along peacefully. Mordavin had nothing but insults for the Magistrate. 
After heated words were exchanged, the Arch Priest of the Bloodsabres became enraged 
and attacked Vegalys. </p>
<p align="justify">A battle ensued between the Arch Priest and those that were to 
be his captors. After several minutes of fighting, Mordavin was seriously wounded. 
Realizing that he was out matched and out numbered, he gave himself up. However, 
the words he spoke upon his surrender were eerie. He stated that though he may 
be captured, he was not defeated, saying that they were too late to stop the events 
that had been set in motion. Vegalys took the foul priest into custody and he 
was taken to Qeynos, where he currently languishes in prison awaiting his sentencing. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Antonius Bayle was so impressed by the successful and efficient 
capture of what was surely the most wanted and reviled criminal in the history 
of Qeynos, that he offered a title and his very own shield to the leader of those 
that assisted Magistrate Vegalys Keldrane in the capture of this fiend. With Mordavin 
captured and behind bars, Qeynos citizens and the residents of Karana may now 
sleep peacefully. </p>
