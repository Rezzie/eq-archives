Relic of Brell Serilis</span></font></b></span></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>At last, with 
the long sought after scroll in his possession, the mighty Al'Kabor unravels the 
secret behind the demise of the Kedge race. Phinigel Autropos, the last surviving 
Kedge, consigned his brethren to permanent undeath with a magical spell of great 
power. Al'Kabor, armed with this knowledge, confronts Phinigel. The unspoken threat 
that he could use the very same spell on Phinigel himself is made clear, unless 
Phinigel cooperates with the wizard. The last Kedge is not one to take such threats 
lightly, however, and though he could more than likely destroy arrogant Erudite, 
he reasons it wiser to teach him a valuable lesson rather than risk his own life.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phinigel uses 
his arcane magic to send out a vision of an ancient artifact, long guarded by 
his minions, the aqua goblins. The Hammer of Dagnor Butcherblock, the first dwarven 
king, appears before the dwarven rogue Duskan Hammerhand and a dark elven cleric 
named Teuil N'Mar. In the vision, the hammer is revealed, secreted beneath the 
murky waters of Dagnor's Cauldron within a barnacle-encrusted tower, and guarded 
by aqua goblins. Duskan recognizes the holy relic, and immediately makes a foolish 
attempt to retrieve the hammer alone, desiring the glory of the successful deed 
solely for himself. He fails, narrowly escaping the aqua goblins with his life.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crawling along 
the shore, barely coherent and near death, Duskan manages to convince a party 
of passing adventurers to escort him to his King. When Duskan is brought before 
King Kazon Stormhammer and reveals his story of the vision and his botched raid, 
the King organizes an expedition for the recovery of the Butcherblock Hammer, 
known among the dwarves as Dagnor's Fist. Three dwarven champions are chosen to 
head the effort: Boris Stormhammer, the King's nephew, Kalek Orefinder, and Fenric 
Ogrebane, son of the legendary Furtog Ogrebane. These three, aided by the adventurers, 
easily cut down the aqua goblins guarding the hammer. As the goblin Tidal Lord 
is dying, Phinigel Autropos himself appears. He stymies the dwarves and adventurers, 
driving them back. Then, as swiftly as he appeared, he disappears. The dwarves 
and adventurers finish off the last goblin and rescue the hammer.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As they march 
victoriously back to Kaladim, a dark elven raiding party ambushes and slaughters 
them. In the fight, the dark elven wizard perishes, preventing the raiders' return 
to Neriak. The leader, Valkis D'Vinn, carefully seals the captured relic in an 
enchanted adamantium chest, and orders his group to march to Crushbone, where 
another dark elven wizard awaits.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fenric, thought 
dead but actually feigning, overhears these plans, and immediately seeks help 
once they leave.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dark elven 
raiding party discovers upon returning to Crushbone that the wizard they sought, 
Szasi R'Alis, is dead, along with Grak Crushbone, who died defending her. Valkis 
attempts to bargain with the adventurers who surround them, but is quickly cut 
down. The sealed Adamant Chest of Thex passes into the possession of the adventurers, 
who return to Kaladim to deliver the chest to King Kazon. The Dwarven King declares 
the dwarf in the party of adventurers his champion, and instructs him to return 
with the key to the chest.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The adventurers 
travel to Nektulos and slay Captain Na'Var, holder of the key. The Captain struggles, 
but is outmatched. The adventurers take the key back to the King, who rewards 
them with baubles from his treasury. The King then declares the dwarf adventurer 
who was integral to the success of the mission to be Champion of the Dwarves, 
and Guardian of Butcherblock's Hammer.</font></p>
