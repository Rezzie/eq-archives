              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Hello Everyone,</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Back in October, Jeff Butler, EverQuest’s 
                Customer Service Manager, outlined some new Customer Service Guidelines 
                in the </font><a href="/letter_archive/n_letter991020.html"><font face="Arial" size=2>Producer’s 
                Letter</font></a><font face="Arial" size=2>. Shortly after these 
                policies were publicized, we announced that their implementation 
                would be postponed pending some revisions necessary to insure 
                enforceability and consistency across the servers and different 
                levels of our Customer Service organization. Last week, our policy 
                team completed their public revision of those policies, and we 
                are ready to implement them at this time. Before we get in to 
                the wording of the &quot;Play Nice Policies&quot;, I’d like to 
                take a moment to discuss their spirit, and why we feel that they 
                are necessary.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>EverQuest continues to astound everyone 
                involved with it almost daily. Nearly one year since we opened 
                our doors, EverQuest boasts a community of current players numbering 
                nearly 200,000, most of whom still play on a daily basis. In all 
                actuality, EverQuest has gone beyond what could be described with 
                a term such as &quot;community&quot;. We are all, in fact, part 
                of the EverQuest Society. <br>
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Like any society, each person has the 
                ability to place his or her mark upon it. The vast majority of 
                people in our society do their best to insure that their mark 
                is positive, by abiding to the laws that we, much like the government, 
                bring forward. Some of you choose to become pinnacles of honor, 
                dignity, and respect in your individual communities by forming 
                guilds, promoting honorable actions by your members, and by supporting 
                EverQuest on your web-sites. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Also like any society, we have our 
                underbelly, a relatively small number of people who live to prey 
                upon the honorable. It is frequently the goal of these people 
                to see to their desires, no matter the effect of their actions 
                upon others around them. They are the ones who claim ownership 
                of servers, zones, or spawns, and cause or threaten harm to anyone 
                who does not share their disregard and contempt. They are the 
                ones who live, not to enjoy the game with everyone else, but to 
                enjoy at everyone else’s expense. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>For the first few months after EverQuest’s 
                release, we felt that a policy of non-interference in many of 
                these matters was warranted. However, we continued to lose good 
                players. This was not due to any deficiency or dissatisfaction 
                in the game, but due to dissatisfaction with the treatment that 
                they received from their fellow players, and the perceived inability 
                of our Customer Service department to intervene. Late last year, 
                we made a commitment to our players to begin playing an active 
                role in many of these situations.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>The intent of these policies is to 
                provide the players with general guidelines for what is or is 
                not acceptable behavior in EverQuest, and give them with the opportunity 
                to work out differences prior to involving the EverQuest Customer 
                Service Staff. Naturally, in a game as multifaceted as EverQuest, 
                we are not able to cover every possible issue that could arise 
                as part of these policies. In these cases, it is the spirit of 
                a rule that will prevail over any discrepancies in the letter.

              <p><font face="Arial" size=2>The policies below are now in effect 
                and will be reflected in the </font><a href="/s_guidefaq.html"><font face="Arial" size=2>GM

                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Kill Stealing will now be regarded 
                    as disruption and will result in disciplinary action when 
                    witnessed by any EverQuest Customer Service Representative 
                    (EQCSR). The EQCSR will review these situations on an individual 
                    basis and issue a decision which is considered binding upon 
                    all parties involved. Kill Stealing is defined as the killing 
                    of a mob for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing 
                    another player or group. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>The intent of this rule is discourage 
                    and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those 
                    who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest 
                    mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service 
                    Staff will reflect this philosophy. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2><b>Contested Spawns</b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>There are cases where two or more 
                    groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups 
                    are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot 
                    be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer 
                    Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding 
                    compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by 
                    an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly 
                    suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise 
                    that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may 
                    mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent 
                    that a player-devised compromise would.</font></p>

                    of completing that goal. </i></font></p>

                    the fantasy environment and designed to hurt, will be considered 
                    a disruption. The existence of the filter (/filter) is not

                    targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience 
                    them. Harassment can take many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind 
                    of the person or party on the receiving end of the action. 
                    However, in order to account for those who are excessively 
                    thin-skinned, the EQCSR involved will make a determination 
                    as to whether or not the average person would feel &quot;harassed&quot; 
                    and act accordingly.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Zone/Area Disruption is defined

                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>The PvP Servers are a special case 
                    for many of the policies listed here. When one makes the decision 
                    to play on a PvP Server, they are in essence agreeing to play 
                    on a server where compromise is decided on the basis of who 
                    has the power to kill whom. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>By the same token, we expect that 
                    the people on those servers will apply PvP combat in all situations 
                    where it is called for, as a resolution to the problem. As 
                    such, the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will decline to 
                    intervene in cases where a PvP alternative exists, such as 
                    at disputed spawns where the parties involved have the ability 
                    to attack each other.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Though the PvP environment does 
                    eliminate a few of the problems experienced on the normal 
                    servers, there are a few more PvP-specific problems that are 
                    created.</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Intentionally causing experience-loss 
                        to other players in the PvP environment is illegal in 
                        all cases and will result in a warning when witnessed 
                        by an EQCSR. This includes things such as intentionally 
                        training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to get 
                        the final blow in combat. We do understand that there 
                        are cases where the experience-loss is unintentional, 
                        and will take no action unless a person earns a reputation 
                        of causing unintentional experience-loss. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Much like how the Kill Stealing 
                        rule applies to those on the blue servers, this rule is 
                        designed to discourage and make note of those who do it 
                        habitually, thus betraying the spirit of PvP. As a note, 
                        the EQCSR will not in any case provide a resurrection 
                        for someone who was caused experience loss in PvP, intentionally 
                        or otherwise. This is one of the dangers of playing on 
                        a PvP server. </font></p>

                        in the process of retrieving their corpse is illegal and 
                        will result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. You 
                        are expected in all cases to give someone a reasonable 
                        amount of time to recover their corpse an leave the area 
                        prior to attacking again. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size=2>Conversely, the person recovering 
                        their corpse is expected to do so and retreat to safety 
                        promptly. In other words, sitting next to your corpse 
                        and taunting someone while daring them to attack you so 
                        that you can /petition them is bad form, and would result 
                        in a warning if witnessed by an EQCSR. </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial" size=2>The EQCSR in attendance will 
                        decide what is reasonable in these cases. It is highly 
                        recommended that the people involved make equitable arrangements 
                        prior to involving the EverQuest Customer Service Staff.

                    in defense of any of the antisocial behaviors mentioned above. 
                    As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) allowed 
                    to &quot;Train&quot; a guard onto an enemy in protection of 
                    your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed 
                    to steal someone’s corpse under the guise of role-playing 
                    a thief. </font></p>

                These actions may include but are not limited to, temporary suspension

                allowed to intentionally ruin the gameplay experience of another, 
                a philosophy to which we are firmly committed. These policies 
                will continue to adapt as we learn new ways to deal with particular
