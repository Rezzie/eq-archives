<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Fist Damage Delay
Statistics</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our fists are operate as a
standard weapon, based on Hand to Hand skill. This weapon is
considered one handed (of course), and it's delay is always 36. <em>(Note:
Yeti of Karana has recently done tests which seem to indicate
that our delay is now 35.5. If this is true, it will skew these
numbers a bit more in favor of our fists, but only slightly).</em>
The damage on our fists is ((Level/5) + 4) rounded down. So here
is the statistics on our &quot;fist weapon&quot; from level 1 to
50. Note the ratios posted are Delay/Damage, of which lower is
better.</font></p>

    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Level <strong>01</strong>

</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>One Handed Weapon
Comparison</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So, at level 50, our fists are
better damage/delay (This doesn't include procs obviously) than
any dual wieldable double attacking 1 handed weapon except:</font></p>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Weapons like <em>Darkmetal Holy
Water Sprinkler</em>, <em>Ghoulbane</em>, <em>Six Note Blade</em>,
<em>Evensong</em>, and the <em>Tunarian Scimitar</em> don't
really count since they can't be used by classes that can dual
wield <strong>and</strong> double attack, so they might as well
be 2 handed weapons as far as damage goes. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, including procs, many
other weapons could probably be comparable to our fists, but it's
doubtful (The Ykesha and the Electrum Plated Koshinagta are the
only ones that are close, and the Koshingata is very specialized,
and the Ykesha is only 70point dd).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still, a warrior, ranger, or rogue
with lots of dragon/plane equipment <strong>can</strong> have
better weapons than our fist (especially something like <em>Blood
Fire</em>, which procs a 600point dot). The only compensation
that we get is that our skill caps are higher, especially our
dual wield, so chances are, at level 50, we can probably still
manage to outdamage even an <em>Eyerazzia</em>/<em>Bone Razor</em>
combo. With Flying Kick to balance, we might even do more damage
than a <em>Blood Fire</em>/<em>Spined Dragon Claw</em> combo. But
there's just no way we can outdamage someone who has two <em>Fanged
Skull Stilettos</em> (which are the most unbalanced weapon I've
seen in the game yet). However, I doubt that many people will
ever acquire those.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Conclusions</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">So overall, yes, we are the
masters of damage, but just barely, and only at the high levels.
Looking at weapon equivalencies at early levels, you'll see our
fists are well under the standard equipment for those levels
nowadays. Even at the high levels, I don't know if it makes up
for our lack of hps, stun, taunt, and 14 weight limit. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As a side note, interestingly
enough, if you wanted to twink a monk, two <em>Sharkbone
Warhammers</em> (<strong>3.25</strong>) at weight 3.0, would help
a monk up to level <strong>40</strong>. One of the few weapons
worth using for a monk at the high levels. However, if you do
decide to do this, I suggest you maintain your Hand to Hand skill
as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two <em>Black Enamalled Maces</em>
(<strong>3.5</strong>)also work well up to level <strong>35</strong>,
but their 4.5 weight might be hard to stomach, and <em>Cold Iron
Morningstars</em> (<strong>3.89</strong>) work till level <strong>30</strong>.
Before level <strong>20</strong>, a <em>Scepter of Flame </em>(<strong>4.14</strong>)
will help out, as well a <em>Scepter of Rahotep </em>(<strong>4.22</strong>).
Everything else is generally too heavy to be wielded by a monk.</font></p>
