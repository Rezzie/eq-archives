<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Monk Headbands</u></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The monk headbands are status
    symbols for the Silent Fist monks of Qeynos. All of the
    quests come from the monk guildhouse in Qeynos. To do these
    quests, you need good faction with the Silent Fist (turning
    in your guild note at level 1 should do it). The headbands
    themselves don't have the most impressive stats, and most
    monks will abandon them after they get access to the
    Executioner's Hood and the Crown of the Froglok King.
    However, they are necessary for the Robe of the Lost Circle
    quest.</font></p>
    <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>White Headband</strong>
            - Requires four gnoll scalps. You cna get these from
            gnoll pups in the newbie zone, Qeynos Hills, or
            Blackburrow.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Yellow Headband</strong>
            - Requires three putrid bones and the white headband.
            The putrid rib bones come off putrid skeletons, which
            spawn at the undead ruins near Blackburrow.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Orange Headband</strong>
            - Requires two gnoll pelts from gnolls in
            Blackburrow, and a gnoll skin off a elite guard or
            commander. Also requires the Yellow Headband.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Red Headband</strong>
            - Requires the head of Shen, the skull of Dareb, and
            the head of Drah. All of these can be found on named
            splitpaw gnolls in the Karanas. The only spawn I know
            of is Ghanex Drah, who spawns in the undead ruins in
            South Karana, near the bridge to North Karana. Also
            requires the Orange Headband.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Purple Headband</strong>
            - Requires the Dagger of Marnek off the Necro
            Thaumaturgist in the bottom floor of befallen. Also,
            the Skull of Jhen'tra off gnoll embalmers in Lake
            Rathe. The hardest piece to get, however, is Zaharn's
            Coronet, which comes from the Permafrost king room
            (spawn's name is a 31 cleric named High Priest
            Zaharn). Finally, requires the Red Headband.</font></li>
    </ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Monk Sashes</u></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The monk sashes are status
    symbols for the Ashen Order monks of Freeport. All of the
    quests come from the monk guildhouse in Freeport. To do these
    quests, you need good faction with the Ashen Order(turning in
    your guild note at level 1 should do it). The sashes
    themselves don't have the most impressive stats, and most
    monks will abandon them after they get access to the Thick
    Banded Belt or Flowing Black Silk Sash. However, they are
    necessary for the Robe of the Lost Circle quest.</font></p>
    <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>White Sash</strong>
            - Requires 1 bone chip, 2 orc scalps (from Deathfist
            Orc Pawns), and 1 snake fang.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Yellow Sash</strong>
            - Requires the white sash, a giant snake rattle (off
            asps and darkweed snakes), a Chitin (off desert
            tarantulas in North Ro), and a deathfist sashed belt
            (off Orcs in East Commons). The deathfist sashed belt
            is acually called a deathfist slashed belt on the
            item name.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Orange Sash</strong>
            - Requires a legionairre bracer from Crushbone, a
            Greater Lightstone (from a wisp), and a Cutthroat
            Insignia Ring (off dervishes in North Ro). And of
            course, the yellow sash.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Red Sash</strong>
            - Requires the wand of marnek (called a
            &quot;blackened wand&quot;, comes off Priest Amiaz,
            an alternate spawn for the Thaumaturgist in 3rd floor
            of befallen), and the sapphire of souls (called a
            &quot;blackened sapphire&quot;, comes off a rare
            spawn rogue that is in Rathyl's room in Najena).
            Incidentally, these two items are also required for a
            Shadowknight quest originating in Freeport, which is
            to assemble the wand of burning.</font></li>
    </ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Collar of Neshika</u></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This quest was formerly to
    obtain the Treant Fists, but now yields the </font><a
    href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/collarofneshika.html"><font
    size="2" face="Arial">Collar of Neshika</font></a><font
    size="2" face="Arial">, a mostly useless collar for monks. At
    the same level to complete this quest, a monk can easily get
    a collar of undead protection, which is arguably a better
    item. This quest takes place in Kithicor forest, and you'll
    most likely want a ranger to help you out with it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Kithicor, after entering
    from the west commons zone, if you follow the path, the first
    house on your left will have a few people spawn in it. One of
    the spawns will cycle between a ranger, a gnome, and a monk.
    The monk's name is <em>Grim Oakfist</em>, and he's looking
    for help from a willing monk.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you talk to him and follow
    the bracketed keywords, you'll find that he wants you to help
    him out by hunting three tigers which killed his wife. He
    can't do this himself because the tigers are protected by the
    rangers. The tigers have odd names, and run at the speed of
    SoW. Track down and kill these tigers and each will drop a
    pelt. It's best if the ranger helping you doesn't assist you
    with killing the tigers, as otherwise he'll lose faction.
    Return all three pelts to Grim Oakfist, and he will give you
    the Collar of Neshika.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I forget the exact tiger
    names, but one is Eenot. They are around level 20 or less,
    and are pretty easy to kill once you've found them. The
    dangerous part of the quest is that Kithicor is now haunted
    by undead, so it can get dangerous if you do this at the
    wrong time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Incidentally, asking Grim
    about [<strong>Treant Fists</strong>] will direct you to
    Freeport to start the Treant Fists quest.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Treant Fists</u></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This quest is originally
    initated by asking Grim Oakfist about [Treant Fists], but you
    can bypass this stage completely. Grim tells you to talk to
    Puab, a guildmaster in the Ashen Order.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you ask Puab about [Treant
    Fists], he will direct you to Kerra Isle, where you must talk
    to a banished kerran monk. This Kerran can be found in the
    dungeon of Kerra Isle, on the island that houses the
    Heretics. Puab gives you a silver coin to give to the
    banished kerran (his name is Clawfist, but his spawn is
    simply called &quot;a banished Kerran&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When you give the coin to the
    Kerran, he will tell you he needs your help in collecting the
    remains of his friend who died in the Runnyeye area. He gives
    you a container in which to combine all four parts of the
    friend and sends you on your way.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the runnyeye area, you must
    collect four items:</font></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a
            href="http://eq.stomped.com/catalog/item_detail.cfm?id=2094"><font
            size="2" face="Arial">Humerus Handled Mace</font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial"> - From the Gorge of King Xorbb
            (beholder's maze). It spawns on a rare spawn Goblin
            Alchemist, who spawns near the zone to Runnyeye, and
            wanders.</font></li>
        <li><a
            href="http://eq.stomped.com/catalog/item_detail.cfm?id=2149"><font
            size="2" face="Arial">Ribcage Chest Armor</font></a><font
            size="2" face="Arial"> - From Misty Thicket, a rare
            spawn Goblin Alchemist, who spawns in the place of
            Mooto, and wanders between the three goblin camps.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Catskull Cap - From the
            Gelatinous Cube in Runnyeye, who spawns in the
            underwater passage near the bank and the goblin king.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Some Bone Weapon - Can't
            remember what this item was called, but it's a drop
            off a common spawn called a &quot;Goblin
            Captain&quot; who spawns in the room behind the
            goblin king.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After combining these four
    items in the box and returning it to the banished Kerran, he
    will give you a note to take back to Puab. Give the note to
    Puab, and he will give you the </font><a
    href="http://eq.stomped.com/catalog/item_detail.cfm?id=1980"><font
    size="2" face="Arial">Treant Fists</font></a><font size="2"
    face="Arial">. The Treant Fists are one of the best monk
    gloves in the game, arguably up to the Basoon Haste Gauntlets
    or Gauntlets of Fiery Might.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong><u>Robe of the Lost Circle</u></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is the most in depth monk
    quest known in the game, and probably one of the most
    frustrating. The reward is the </font><a
    href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/monkrobe.html"><font
    size="2" face="Arial">Robe of the Lost Circle</font></a><font
    size="2" face="Arial">, a good monk chest piece. In the
    process of doing this quest, you also become an honorary
    member of the Monks of the Whistling Fists, a lost
    brotherhood of monks. This makes for some good roleplaying
    oppurtunities if you are into that sort of thing.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The robe also has a unique
    maroon look, which will earn you lots of inspects, at least
    for a few more months till the robes are more common.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The quest is started by
    talking to either Brother Qwinn in South Karana or Brother
    Zephyl in Rathe Mountains. Both of these monks are rare
    wandering monk trainers. They belonged to a lost order called
    the &quot;Monks of the Whistling Fists&quot;. In order to
    become an honorary member of the Whistling Fists, you must
    perform tasks for these two monks.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brother Qwinn requires the
    &quot;</font><a
    href="http://eq.stomped.com/catalog/item_detail.cfm?id=1856"><font
    size="2" face="Arial">Code of Zan Fi</font></a><font size="2"
    face="Arial">&quot;, a book dropped by Targin the Rock, a
    rarish spawn in the king room in Solusek B. He also asks you
    to turn in your purple headband to prove that you are an
    adept member of the Silent Fists. Turning in these two items
    will give you the Needle of the Void.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brother Zephyl asks you to
    return &quot;</font><a
    href="http://eq.stomped.com/catalog/item_detail.cfm?id=1901"><font
    size="2" face="Arial">the Idol</font></a><font size="2"
    face="Arial">&quot;, an idol dropped by Raster of Guk. He can
    be found in, of course, Guk. Specifically, Lower Guk, in the
    Minotaur Elder room. He spawns at the top of the stairs in
    that room. He is an extremely rare spawn. His placeholder is
    a greater minotaur. If you turn in the Idol and your red
    sash, he will give you a rare robe pattern. Finding raster is
    by far the hardest part of this quest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Combining the robe pattern,
    the needle of the void, Jonathon's Whistling Warsong, and a
    swatch of shadow silk together in a tailoring kit will create
    the Robe of the Lost Circle. I made the robe with a tailoring
    skill of 27, and it was trivial for me. Another monk reported
    creating the robe with a skill of 21 and failing, destroying
    all the components in the process.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jonathon's Whistling Warsong
    can be purchased for a small amount from any bard guild, and
    shadow silk can be made by any decent tailor</font><font
    size="1" face="Arial"> (</font><font size="2" face="Arial">Shadow
    Wolf Pelt, Silk Swatch, Scroll of Gather Shadows (low-lvl
    Necro invis spell scroll)). A silk swatch can be made by
    combining two spider silks in a tailoring kit.</font></p>
