      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#AEC3DB">Michael
      Jackson on Loop</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">This is the strategy commonly used by young
      necromancers.&nbsp; The first step is to pull a creature with a DoT or a
      debilitating spell.&nbsp; Once the creature starts coming your way, send
      your pet and follow it.&nbsp; Now you must engage in melee combat,
      hopefully inflicting some damage while taking a few hits.&nbsp; Once you
      HPs drop down a little, step back and cast a drain life spell to replenish
      lost HPs. Remember to step back far enough so the critter can't reach you
      after the first cast.&nbsp;&nbsp; After casting it 2 or 3 times, step back
      into melee combat and do the same thing again.&nbsp; The main advantage of
      this strategy is that you can spare your pet from taking too much damage.&nbsp;
      The main disadvantage is that it sometimes does not work as the creature
      will go AGRO on you.&nbsp; Oh and no, I am not a fan of Michael Jackson.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#AEC3DB">Run Forrest
      Run</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">This is best used when in a large area such as the
      Commonlands or Karanas Plains.&nbsp; The first and very important step is
      to check if your target creature is alone.&nbsp; You want to make sure you
      are pulling only one creature.&nbsp; Once you find your target, cast a DoT
      spell on it that you know is not likely to be resisted.&nbsp; The darkness
      line of spells would work great as it reduces the speed of your target.&nbsp;
      But Heat Blood also does a nice a job since it deals a larger amount of
      damage.&nbsp; Remember to cast from a safe distance as you should cast and
      run to a zone.&nbsp; You do not want the creature to reach you as that
      would trigger your pet.&nbsp; You only want that to happen when you reach
      the zone area.&nbsp; Once you do, turn around and wait for that creature
      to arrive.&nbsp; It should be quite down on life if you hit it far away.&nbsp;
      As soon as it gets close enough, send your pet and cast away.&nbsp; You
      can either put some more DoTs on it, drain life, or send it away again
      with Fear.&nbsp; The main advantage with this strategy is that you can not
      only take tougher opponents but also be safely fighting near a zone in
      case things go wrong.&nbsp; Of course, its main advantage is that you
      might end up with more than one creature on your tail.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#AEC3DB">Fear me</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">Another commonly used strategy is the DoT/Fear.&nbsp;
      Find yourself a target, stand back from a safe distance and send your pet.&nbsp;
      As soon as you do, cast a Darkness spell and, if successful, Fear your
      target.&nbsp; It is important to succeed when casting your Darkness spell
      as you want the creature to move slowly so you can cast other spells.&nbsp;
      If it is not successful, cast other DoTs and recast Darkness.&nbsp; If
      resisted again, do not wait longer and Fear it right away.&nbsp; You will
      have to get closer to creature to cast another spell otherwise it will
      move out of range.&nbsp; Once Fear fades, recast it.&nbsp; Repeat this
      until the creature is dead with occasional damage spells dealt while the
      creature is running away.&nbsp; This strategy works best against opponents
      that con blue as Fear will be resisted too often against tougher
      opponents.&nbsp; Its main advantage is that you will rarely take any hits,
      which is quite a good thing against critters that can hit fast and hard.&nbsp;
      Of course, the disadvantage relies on the fact that necromancers are not
      great at fearing creatures and it can either be resisted or work for a
      very brief amount of time.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#AEC3DB">Master of the
      Undead</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">When hunting undead creatures in a team and
      specially solo, Master of the Undead can work pretty well.&nbsp; There are
      plenty of zones where fighting one undead only is quite a rarity.&nbsp;
      You target an undead and his brother will join the battle instantly,
      making it a lot harder to win.&nbsp; To improve the odds, here is what you
      should do.&nbsp; Cast one of the Numb the Dead line of spells on one of
      the undeads.&nbsp; It will lower its AGRO and force it to stand still for
      quite some time.&nbsp; You now can fight the other undead alone.&nbsp; By
      the time you are done with it, the other creature should either have just
      joined the battle or about to.&nbsp; And killing this one now that the
      other is dead should not be a problem.&nbsp; It is important to kill the
      first undead as fast as you can to make sure you are done or close to it
      when the effects of the Numb the Dead line of spells fades away.&nbsp; The
      main advantage of this strategy is that it allows you to solo to creatures
      at the same time reasonably easy.&nbsp; The disadvantage lies on the fact
      that your lowering AGRO spell might either be resisted or fade away faster
      than you would want.&nbsp; To reduce those chances, use this strategy at
      points on your career when that spell is fairly new on your inventory.&nbsp;
      Thus, using it at level 24, when you just got Rest the Dead will work
      better than using Numb the Dead at level 22.</font></font>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#AEC3DB">XP Boost</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">Use this strategy to boost your XP gain at the cost
      of your beloved bone chips.&nbsp; To use it, make sure you familiar with
      your target.&nbsp; You want to know how much damage it can deal and what
      kind of spells it has.&nbsp; Once you find your target, fight it anyway
      you want.&nbsp; As the creature is about to die, reclaim your pet and
      finish the creature yourself.&nbsp; As you share XP gained in battles with
      your pet, not having it around when the battle ends will give you roughly
      twice more XP than having it around.&nbsp; This strategy works even better
      against creature that start running away once its HPs drops below a
      certain point.&nbsp; As the name says, the main advantage of this strategy
      is simply getting more XP.&nbsp; But it comes at the expense of your bone
      chips as you will always have to get a new pet.</font></font>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#AEC3DB">Petless</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">When hunting with large parties, it is sometimes
      advisable to stay without a pet.&nbsp; There will be occasions when your
      party is simply superior to your targets and you don't need the pet
      anyway.&nbsp; But there will be situations when even your mighty party
      will find itself in dangerous situations.&nbsp; If the later is true and
      you are hunting undeads, stay without a pet and simply get yourself one
      during the battle.&nbsp; Have your tank pull the undeads and as soon as he
      comes back, charm one of the undeads with Dominate Undead.&nbsp; You will
      not only reduce your opponents strength but also have a new ally to fight
      for your party.&nbsp; The advantage here is that you balance a combat with
      a single cast and have a cool new pet fighting for you.&nbsp; The main
      disadvantage is that your newly acquired pet will turn against you at any
      minute.&nbsp; Remember to be prepared and let your party know what you are
      doing.</font></font></p>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><i><font color="#AEC3DB" face="Tahoma" size="2">The
      Wonders of&nbsp; the Petless RootDoT</font></i><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">There are to ways to begin this strategy the first being the best for crowd
      control.&nbsp; If you have a good enough distance between you and the mob move
      where you are sure to get 2 spells off before it gets to you then start off
      with a mid level fast casting darkness spell ( I prefer engulfing darkness
      over dooming).&nbsp; If it takes on then you have more than enough time to Root
      until it takes.&nbsp; If darkness failed then just root till it holds.  You can
      opt for just starting with root however if the creature breaks free then you
      more than likely will not have a time for root again till you get bashed a
      few times.&nbsp; FYI Root WILL work after darkness but darkness will NOT hold if
      root is on.  Now get your distance and cast heat blood or other non DD DoTs
      leaving VoS and or Scourge for last.&nbsp; Since most DoTs don't have a DD to
      begin with the creature will take damage with almost no chance of breaking
      the root until the root was meant to be broken.&nbsp; VoS and Scourge will
      sometimes free the mob with it's initial damage however IF the darkness took
      on the first time then you can quickly root again.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Tahoma" size="2">In places like Mist Moore where it's all about crowd
      control I find it very useful to kill them almost where they stand with this combo.&nbsp;
      Many a night where I can just root/heatblood/vampiric curse/VoS and just sit back down to
      meditate.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp; I think you will be pleasantly surprise at how long root
      can last when you are not doing any DD.</font></font></p>
