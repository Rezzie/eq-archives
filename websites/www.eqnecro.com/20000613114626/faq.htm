      I be a necromancer ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: That is an easy one.&nbsp; You should be a
      necromancer simply because it is the coolest class in an Norrath.&nbsp; It
      will provide a very nice gaming experience since necromancers are not only
      a powerful class, but also a challenging one.&nbsp; NPCs will not like you
      most of the times and you will constantly have to work on your faction
      standing.&nbsp; Thus, your &quot;life&quot; will not be limited to hitting
      the A button.</font></font></p>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#214D7B">Q: How
      powerful is a necromancer ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: In my opinion, a very powerful one.&nbsp;
      Necromancers don't have much in terms of direct damage as other
      spellcasters do and are pretty weak in a melee combat.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
      we are the only class that can deal damage at the same time we recover
      life with the Drain Life (DL) group of spells.&nbsp; You might not realize
      how powerful a necromancer is until you reach level 12 though.&nbsp; It is
      at that level that necromancers get the first real powerful spells.&nbsp;
      Besides Bind Affinity, which binds you to an area and thus allows you to
      travel freely through Norrath, we get Lifedraw (a DL spell that maxes at
      45 damage), Convoke Shadow (the first pet with magical attack abilities),
      Spook the Dead (a spell that makes undead creatures just run run run and
      making you even more skilled when fighting against undeads), and two great
      DoT spells, Heat Blood and Engulfing Darkness.&nbsp; In sum, our
      combination of pet spells, DL spells and DoT spells make us a very
      powerful class indeed.</font></font>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#214D7B">Q: What are
      the disadvantages of playing a necromancer ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: As mentioned before, necromancers are disliked by
      most NPCs in Norrath, including some in your own home town.&nbsp; Thus,
      you will not be able to walk around in towns unless you are invisible.&nbsp;
      That makes you pretty much stuck to the areas close to your home town
      until you reach level 8 and can purchase the invisibility spell.&nbsp;
      There are ways to fix that though.&nbsp; You can kill creatures that will
      improve your faction standing with NPCs and guards from a specific region.&nbsp;
      For example, you can go to Black Burrow and kill Gnolls.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a
      result, you will improve your faction standing with NPCs, merchants and
      guards of Qeynos.&nbsp; Whenever you go back to Qeynos, consider them and
      pay attention to what they say.&nbsp; It might take some time but at some
      point they will be indifferent to you and won't bother with your presence
      anymore.&nbsp; You will even be able to purchase things from merchants.&nbsp;
      Take a look at the Faction Standing guide for a more complete list of
      things you can do to improve your faction standing.</font></font>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">
      <font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">A: Yes you can.&nbsp; Take a look at the answer

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><i><font color="#214D7B" size="2" face="Tahoma">Q: Any tips
      for a newbie necromancer ?</font></i>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">
      <font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">A: Well, the most important thing you should do when
      starting a new character is gathering enough money to buy cavorting bones,
      the first pet spell.&nbsp; A necromancer is fairly weak without his or her
      pet.&nbsp; Once you get your pet, it is important to understand how to
      deal with it.&nbsp; The best tactic when fighting with a pet is as follow.&nbsp;
      Cast a spell pulling the creature and send your pet to combat.&nbsp; Take
      a few hits and then back off, leaving your pet holding the creature while
      you stand behind casting Lifetap.&nbsp; Once you regain some of the lost
      HPs step back into combat and repeat the same process until the creature
      is dead.&nbsp; Other important things for are knowing where the guards are
      (you can run close to them when in danger and they will kill the creature
      for you), learning the location of the necro guild in your home town (you
      will have to buy those new spells as well as food and water), knowing
      which opponents to fight against (always, but always consider a creature
      before engaging into combat), and get to know people in your area (as a
      necro, you will have difficulty buying things that are not available at
      your local necro and a friend will help you overcome that problem as he
      might go and buy you things like armor to you in town).</font>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#214D7B">Q: What
      race should I be when playing a necromancer ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: That is hard question as it depends on your
      playing preferences.&nbsp; In my opinion, Erudites and Dark Elves make up
      the best necromancers among all races.&nbsp; Erudites are the most
      intelligent race in all Norrath (base of 117) and will give you plenty of
      mana.&nbsp; Charisma is also not that bad (base of 70).&nbsp; Dark Elves
      are also high on intelligence (base of 109), have very good agility (base
      of 90), and have two special powers, hiding and ultravision.&nbsp; The
      main drawback for both races is that they are disliked throughout Norrath,
      specially the evil Dark Elves.</font></font>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#214D7B">Q: Where
      should I spend my practice points ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: Initially, at channeling.&nbsp; It will reduce
      the chances of fizzling a spell.&nbsp; Once you make it to level 4, spend
      a few points in meditate as it will speed up your mana recovery.&nbsp; I
      would not spend points pretty much anywhere else as you will learn other
      skills on your own, through practice in battles.&nbsp; Save those points
      for skills you can only use later on such as research, old Erudin or any
      other trade skill (e.g. jewelry, tailoring, etc.).</font></font>

      to buy a spell but I cannot find it in my necro guild. What should I do ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: For some reason, some spells are just not
      available in necro guilds.&nbsp; Most of the spells that can be used by
      necromancers and other spellcaster classes you just cannot find.&nbsp; In
      order to buy it, you will have to ask a friend of yours that is not a
      necro to go to a different spellcaster guild and buy it for you.&nbsp; If
      not, just offer money to anyone that brings you the spell you are looking
      for.</font></font>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><i><font color="#214D7B">Q: I keep
      on dying and loosing experience and can never make it to the next level.&nbsp;
      Is there anything I can do ?</font></i><br>
      <font color="#c0c0c0">A: One important thing to learn when fighting in a
      region is how safe is the place you are.&nbsp; Black Burrow for example is
      like train town.&nbsp; There are so many trains in that place that chances
      are you will get hit by one.&nbsp; Places like this make solo work a lot
      harder since you will not have any back up in case things get a little out
      of hand.&nbsp; Thus, look for a party of characters roughly the same level
      you are.&nbsp; Never join a party in which someone is more than 3 levels
      above or below yours.&nbsp; You will get very little experience from that.&nbsp;
      But do join parties since you will be safer with them.&nbsp; Your
      experience will not go up as fast as if you were alone, but you will also
      not die very often and loose those pr</font><font color="#C0C0C0">ecious XP.&nbsp; The other thing you
      can do is simply look for a better place to fight in, anywhere where
      trains are less likely to happen.&nbsp; Take a look at the Zone Analysis
      section for some tips on where should you be.<br>

      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#214D7B">Q: What is the full list of pet commands?</font><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
                     A: This is the full list:<br>
                     /pet attack - Pet will attack targeted creature<br>
                     /pet guard me - Pet will follow you around and attack anything not friendly around you<br>
                     /pet guard here - Pet will attack anything not friendly around his guarding post<br>
                     /pet as you were - Pet will forget any previous commands<br>
                     /pet back off - Pet will stop attacking targeted creature as long as it is not engaged in
      melee combat<br>
                     /pet follow me - Pet will follow you around<br>
                     /pet health report - Pet will tell you the percentage of HPs it has left<br>
                     /pet who leader - Pet will tell you who summoned it<br>
                     /pet sit down - Pet will sit down and heal faster<br>
                     /pet stand up - Pet will stand up and guard the spot<br>
                     /pet target - You will target your pet<br>
                     /pet taunt/no taunt - Turns taunt on or off in battle (taunt is on by default)<br>
                     /pet get lost - Pet will commit suicide<br>
                     Note that you can press F1 twice (first selects yourself and second your pet) to select
      your pet.  Easier than typing /pet target or wasting a hot key slot for this command.<br>

                     A: Well, this is not the answer you are probably looking for, but it is the only one that can
      be given.  Words are a random loot.  You just have to be lucky enough to get Words and
      even luckier to get the one you are looking for.  One thing you should know is that Words
      from a specific level are dropped by mobs from that level.  Thus, if you are looking for
      level 29 Words, you must kill mobs that range from level 29 to 33.  There are though
      mobs that drop Words more frequently than others.  The undead in Unrest and Spectres
      in Feerrott/Oasis of Marr are an example of such mobs.  But again, Words are just
      random and you will probably have to buy a few of them in order to research your spells.</font></p>
