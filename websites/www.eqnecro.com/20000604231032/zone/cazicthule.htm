      Thule Zone Guide</font></b></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
      Cazic Thule is a temple-like dungeon located next to Feerott.  Next to the entrance to
      Cazic there are a few pyramids guarded by Lizardmen.  The largest pyramid, at loc -1200
      -70, is the entrance to Cazic Thule.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Cazic Thule has a large number of creatures tailored for a wide range of levels.&nbsp;
      It is also a dangerous place since trains are found started by one of the many
      many players that come here in search of experience and fortune.&nbsp; Furthermore, Cazic is not the place to go
      if you are looking for some quick solo XP.  But do not be discouraged.&nbsp;
      Cazic Thule has many rewards for those who decide to take its challenge.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Lower level necromancers (around 20-24) should stay close to the entrance.&nbsp;
      The corridor before the real entrance to Cazic Thule and the courtyard are home
      to a good number of lower level Lizardmen.&nbsp; Broodlings, Warriors, and Guards are commonly found
      wandering around the Cazic entrance.  In this case, the best strategy is to team up with
      some friends and stay as close to the zone as possible, but outside the entrance corridor
      (that way you will not be in the train path).&nbsp; Have someone pull the Lizardmen to a safe
      spot in the courtyard and cast away.&nbsp; Be aware that, while in Cazic Thule, you will rarely
      pull a single creature.&nbsp; Casting on one will most certainly mean a battle against two, three
      or even more creatures.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
                     Once you have made it past level 24, you can start pulling from a little deeper inside
      Cazic Thule.&nbsp; The area known as maze (accessed through a door to the right when you
      enter the courtyard)  spawns a good number of mid-level Lizardmen, including Defenders
      and Sentinels.  Use the same strategy mentioned before.&nbsp; Have someone pull the
      Lizardmen to the patio and cast away.&nbsp; Keep in mind that if you are the one pulling, you
      should pay attention to your pet.&nbsp; The maze is indeed a maze and it is quite easy to lose
      your pet in its corridors.&nbsp; Having your pet guard an area in the courtyard, next to your
      group, might be a good idea.  And make sure you get to know the corridors of the maze
      before you attempt to pull from the deep end.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
                     Necros in their low 30s can start hunting in one of the many areas with mid and high
      level Lizardmen.  The most popular area is  known as the Throne room.&nbsp;
      This area spawns a large number of mid and high level Lizardmen as well as a few Gorillas.  To get
      there, head to the courtyard and go through the door on the left side and then turn right.
      You will need a fairly large team to hunt in the Throne room and a very good ISP
      connection.. The battles are almost non-stop and creatures always come in teams.
      Another good hunting target for necros in their 30s are the Alligators.  They can be found
      in quite a few different places.&nbsp; The most common can be accessed by going up the
      ladders either in the right or left side of the courtyard.  Once again, be careful when
      pulling in Cazic.  These Alligators will rarely come alone and can bite pretty hard.  Finally,
      a third hunting option is the area known as Arena.  You can get there by going through
      the same door you use to get to the Throne room.  But instead of turn right past the door,
      turn left and keep going down.  There are several mid level Lizardmen on your way
      downstairs, but those shouldn't be a problem.  The arena spawns several high level
      Lizardmen, including Heralds, Prosletypes, Zealots, and Justicars.&nbsp; Make sure you have a
      good and large party when coming to the Arena.  If anything goes wrong, zoning is often
      not an option (you do remember those Lizardmen you fought to get to the Arena right?).</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
                     Necros past level 34 can hunt pretty much anything in Cazic Thule.  There are plenty of
      targets for you here.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">                     Level 35 characters can hunt pretty much anything in Cazic Thule.  That does not mean
      you can go on a solo rampage since you still need a group.  So, get yourself a team and
      look for one of Cazic Thule's tough opponents.  The Taew Eew Lizards are a good
      example.  There are a few different of them and they spawn every now and then in
      different locations. The Taew Eew Diviner and the Taew Eew Templar can be found on
      the first floor of the Throne Room.  The Diviner drops the Lizardscale Mantle and the
      Templar drops the Lizardscale Cloak.  Be careful with the Diviner.  Even though he is not a
      very tough opponent, Diviners can and probably will charm.  Make sure your party knows
      about this before heading into battle. A third Taew Eew, the Archon, can be found in the
      Temple at the end of maze.  Go through the courtyard door that leads to the maze and
      take the first left.  Go through the room with four pillars, take the second
      left turn and keep going until you see a Temple. The Archon can be found in the room at the topmost
      part of the Temple.  He is the one that drops the Lizardscale Belt.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Another option for level 35+ necromancers are Golems.  There are three types of Golems
      in Cazic Thule, Clay, Stone, and Steel.&nbsp; Any of these three Golems will
      not go down very easily and are always protected by high level Lizardmen such as
      Justicars, Heralds, Zealots, and Judicators.&nbsp; First, the Clay Golem can be
      found in the Temple area and is the easiest one of the three Golems.&nbsp;
      He commonly drops a Lizardscale Tribal Mask.&nbsp; The second Golem, the Stone one, can be
      found in the Throne room area.&nbsp; Go up to the second floor and look for a
      throne.&nbsp; The Stone Golem room can be a very tough place and you should only try it
      with a full party.&nbsp; The problem is the room you will be camping is surrounded by other rooms where the high level Lizardmen spawn.&nbsp;
      Even though you might not want to, you will have to fight a lot of Lizards before, during, and after you take
      the Stone Golem.&nbsp; Finally, the Steel Golem can be found in the Alligator Tunnels.&nbsp;
      To get there, go to the Alligator tanks and swim until you get to a ladder.  The Alligator Tunnel
      area is just up this ladder.&nbsp; You must be very careful when hunting&nbsp;
      in here since you will in the middle of a major Alligator spawn.&nbsp; And Alligators will KOS anyone that crosses
      their way. My advice is this: come with a full party and make sure you don't have to
      zone. You simply won't be able to.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><br>
                     Well, I saved the best for last.&nbsp; If your party is really up for the challenge, go after the
      Avatar of Fear.  You can find him below the large greenish ball in the downstairs area of
      Cazic Thule.&nbsp; A full level 35+ party can take him down, but not easily.  He hits very hard
      and is often protected by a few high level Lizardmen.&nbsp; The best strategy is to take him
      down as soon as possible.&nbsp; Focus your party's efforts on him before you move on to the
      Lizardmen.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Well, that is pretty much it for Cazic Thule.&nbsp;
      It is indeed a good hunting place, but also a very dangerous one.&nbsp; There are far too many people, a clear invitation to
      trains. And they will happen very often.&nbsp; Besides that, the only real bad thing about Cazic
      is the fact that you will need to be in a party to kill anything.&nbsp; And it hurts
      a whole lot more to die when hunting with a party.&nbsp; You can loose a whole day of Lizardmen killing
      after a single death. Thus, make sure you have a good team going.&nbsp; Pay special attention
      to your tank/puller. The difference between a good and a bad one is easily the difference
      between your life and death.&nbsp; Have fun!</font></p>

      The Ogre Bouncers that roam Feerott patrol this area and can kill you in a split second. So, if you
      have to med outside Cazic, try to do it while invisible or as close to the Cazic zone as
      possible.&nbsp; Believe me, you will not have more than a few seconds to zone after a Bouncer
