      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">Ok, so you want
      start a necromancer character and is looking for a few tips.&nbsp; Well,
      hopefully you can find answers to some questions you might have in this
      guide.&nbsp; You can also check the <a href="http://eqnecro.com/faq.html">FAQ</a>
      section for issues not mentioned here.&nbsp; Comments, suggestions and
      contributions are greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Just click on the submit link
      in the main menu.</font>
      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">The first thing you should do when starting a new character is answer the following question: Do I want to be a PvP player or
      not?  The reason I say this is some classes are a better fit to PvP than others.&nbsp;
      But a Necromancer can be a real powerful opponent.  You simply have to play it right.&nbsp;
      Only use DoTs that deal fast damage, try to have items that raise your magical
      resistance, have a fast weapon when dueling other casters so you can try and interrupt them, cast Drain Life spells all the time,
      and so on.  Dueling is a lot different than fighting a mob and requires preparation.&nbsp;
      But hey, Necromancers were never an easy class to play and I am pretty sure you will learn how to beat each class.&nbsp;
      We are Necromancers and fear no death.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
                     In any case, the Necromancer is an excellent class.  One of the best in the game, you will be able to solo a number of creatures
      that other classes have difficulty dealing with by themselves.  Our ability to have a pet, deal DoT damage, and deal like no other
      class with undead creatures also make us necromancers a party member anyone should want in their team.  Necromancers are
      also the only class in the game where you can fight a creature of your level and walk out of battle with full health.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">So, without any
      further delay, lets get into some of the specifics in order to create a
      necromancer character.&nbsp; Walk in darkness my friend.</font></p>

      should you choose?&nbsp; No one but yourself can answer that question.&nbsp;
      It is a matter of personal preference and the difficulty level you are
      looking for.&nbsp; Humans are the base class in Norrath and should make a
      little bit easier to play a necromancer.&nbsp; On the other hand, Dark
      Elves are the evil class of Norrath and a Dark Elf necromancer will be
      most definitely hated throughout Norrath.&nbsp; Besides that, each class
      has its own peculiarity.&nbsp; Dark Elves are very agile and intelligent;
      Erudites are very intelligent and have a better charisma then all other
      classes but humans; Gnomes are also very agile and intelligent, as well as
      pretty dexterous; finally, Humans, are the base class and even though are
      not bad in anything, are also not good in anything.&nbsp; Thus, choose
      wisely and take into account not only the advantages each class possess,
      but also its disadvantages.</font></font>

      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">The next step in
      a character formation&nbsp; is to distribute those 30 bonus points you
      receive.&nbsp; Once again, this will be dictated by your own preferences.&nbsp;
      I can give only give you one advice.&nbsp; What will be doing 15 levels
      later? Will you be relying on other people to sell things for you?&nbsp;
      Will you be a master jeweler?&nbsp; Will you be a better than average
      melee fighter?&nbsp; Or will you be a pure spellcaster that avoids melee
      combat at all costs?&nbsp; These are some questions you should try and
      answer in order to better split your bonus points.&nbsp; Even though you
      should know this, below is a description of each attribute.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#21456B">Strength: </font><font color="#c0c0c0">Raises

      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#21456B">Dexterity: </font><font color="#c0c0c0">Dictates
      how often you will hit your opponent when in melee combat</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#21456B">Wisdom:</font><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Dictates how successful you are when using a trade skill such as jewelry

      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#21456B">Intelligence:</font><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;

      you want to sell or charge for things you want to buy</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#c0c0c0">My
      recommendation is to put some points in intelligence (the most important
      one as you want as much mana as possible and learn new skills faster),
      stamina (a few to raise your max HP), wisdom (if you are going to take on
      a trade skill), and charisma (make yourself a little more friendly looking
      and get better prices with merchants).&nbsp; But choose as you might and
      be aware that these attributes will remain constant for the rest of your
      life (with the exception of magical pieces that can modify them).</font></font>

      say here.&nbsp; With the exception of Humans, other races have no choice
      in what deity they will follow.&nbsp; Dark Elves must follow The Prince of
      Hate, Erudites must follow The Faceless, and Gnomes must follow The
      Plaguebringer.&nbsp; Humans can choose either The Prince of Hate, The
      Faceless, or the Plaguebringer.&nbsp; This choice will affect how Dark Elves and Gnomes
      necromancers will view you.&nbsp; If you choose the deity a specific race

      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#c0c0c0">Once again
      not much to say.&nbsp; As a necromancer, you will never get the chance to
      choose the city you start in.&nbsp; Dark Elves start in Neriak, Erudites
      in Erudin, Gnomes in Ak'Anon, and Humans in either Freeport or Qeynos.&nbsp;

      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">Ok, so there you
      are, pretty much naked and all by yourself in a city you might not be
      familiar with.&nbsp; What should you do?&nbsp; Well, the first thing you
      should is memorize the two spells you have with you.&nbsp; Heheh, I guess
      you knew that, so now what?&nbsp; Well, look out for the necromancers'
      guild in your town.&nbsp; Remember, you are a necromancer so your guild
      should be pretty much well hidden or even outside of town.&nbsp; Ask
      around and you should be able to find it.&nbsp; It is there that you
      should hand over your letter (read it first to see the name of the NPC you
      should give it to) and receive your first XP and a robe.&nbsp; You are now
      ready for your first battle.&nbsp; Well, not really.&nbsp; A necromancer
      is pretty much defenseless without a pet so check out your guild and see
      how much the spell Cavorting Bones costs.&nbsp; Of course you won't have
      money to buy it but there is something you can do and that I always do if
      I see a young necromancer around.&nbsp; Check who is in your zone at that
      time and see if any higher level necromancer is around.&nbsp; If so, ask
      him if he could be so kind as to buy you that Cavorting Bones spell.&nbsp;
      Who knows, you might get lucky (after all, 1G is nothing even for a level
      8 necromancer).&nbsp; If you get the spell, great.&nbsp; If not, then
      start saving those silver coins until you get enough to purchase the
      spell.&nbsp; It should be the first thing you spend your money at.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">So now you are
      ready for your first battle.&nbsp; If you not only new to the necromancer
      class but also to the game, you should learn the consider command.&nbsp;
      Always consider a creature before attacking.&nbsp; Just target that
      creature and hit C.&nbsp; The message it gives you will pretty much
      dictate the outcome of the battle.&nbsp; You will soon learn what all con
      replies are.&nbsp; At first, the easiest creature should read that it
      would be an even fight.&nbsp; Those are the ones you are looking for.&nbsp;
      But before engaging in combat, make sure you know your way around and how
      close you are to a safe spot.&nbsp; Try fighting at first in places close
      to a zone or local guards.&nbsp; Those are two good resources for times
      when things might get complicated.&nbsp; Once you are familiarized, attack
      and hopefully get your first kill.&nbsp; Start saving those loots and once
      you are full, head back to the necro guild and sell it.</font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><font color="#c0c0c0">One
      important thing about the first battles is realizing that you will die,
      specially if you don't have a pet.&nbsp; There is something you can do to
      make the recovery of your corpse easier if you do not own the locate
      corpse spell yet.&nbsp; If you realize death is a possibility you might
      not be able to avoid, type /location or /loc or /l before dying.&nbsp; It
      will give the coordinates of your corpse in case you die and make it
      easier for you to get back to it.&nbsp; But do not be too afraid of dying
      as it will happen.&nbsp; Often.&nbsp; And remember you do not loose XP if
      you die until you reach level 5, so just go there and fight.</font><br>

      <p><font color="#c0c0c0" size="2" face="Tahoma">I will be adding
      more and more tips for newly created necromancers as I get contributions,

      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      You can move your corpse to a different and safer location by typing

      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Partying with people will make you get less XP, but it will also make it
      safer for you, so try partying every once in a while to take on tougher
      creatures</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Do not party though with anyone 3 levels above or below yours.&nbsp; A
      three level difference is the maximum that will provide you XP.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Get to know the place you are.&nbsp; Go to the zones nearby whenever you
      can.&nbsp; Travel and adventure as much as you can.&nbsp; You will never
      know if the place you currently are is good or not if you don't know any
      other place you can compare it with.&nbsp; Ok, so that kobold cons green
      but still gives you XP, but it is so little it is not worth the time and
      effort you are putting into it.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Don't be afraid to ask questions.&nbsp; Most people are happy to pass on
      the knowledge they acquired previously throughout their lives in Norrath.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Clouds in Norrath always move from east to west.&nbsp; So if you are lost
      and that damn sense heading skill constantly says that you have no idea
      which direction you are facing, try looking up the sky.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      But do use Sense Heading as often as you can.&nbsp; At least until it
      maxes out (max goes up by 5 each new level) so when you reach a higher
      level your skill will be in good shape</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Do not use practice points in skills you can learn during battles or in
      the field.&nbsp; Save those points for skills that are either expensive or
      difficult to learn.&nbsp; Initially, I would only spend practice points in
      channeling since that will make your spells fizzle a lot less.&nbsp; Do
      not spend more than 10 points though.&nbsp; Once you reach level 4, spend
      some in meditate as it will speed up your mana recovery process.&nbsp; All
      other skills will be learned in the field.&nbsp; Note, the first spell
      that requires the evocation skill is Ward Undead at level 8, so you might
      want to spend a few on this skill also in order to speed up the learning
      process.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      You can do your own /loc databank.&nbsp; It can make your traveling a lot
      easier.&nbsp; Whenever you are in a location you know you will come back,
      type /loc and write down those coordinate.&nbsp; Or you can use the <a href="zone/locations.htm">Location
      Database</a> from Eqnecro</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      You can customize any command you want and put it into one of the 6 hot
      buttons accessed by the numbers 1 through 6.&nbsp; To do that, go to the
      socials menu and right click on a button, for example Hail.&nbsp; That
      button is useless right now and you can change it for a more useful
      command.&nbsp; Once you right click a button, the customization screen
      should appear.&nbsp; Choose a name for that button and type the command
      you wish to store (e.g. /pet attack).&nbsp; You now have your customized
      button.&nbsp; Just left click and hold and put it in one of the hot button
      boxes to the left.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      The commands to control a pet are:&nbsp; /pet attack, /pet follow me, /pet
      guard me, /pet guard here, /pet as you were, /pet sit down, and /pet stand
      up, pet health report, /pet back off, /pet who leader, /pet target, /pet
      taunt, /pet no taunt, /pet get lost</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Get to know people throughout your adventures as chances are you will be
      meeting them over and over again.&nbsp; As a necro, the more friends you
      have the easier things get for you.&nbsp; You will find yourself in
      situations where help might save your life or satiate your hunger.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      On a similar note, help people as much you as you can.&nbsp; Help young
      necromancers as you were in that situation before and if you are like me,
      you know how hard it can be.&nbsp; I have donated countless platinum
      pieces to many people that I might never see again.&nbsp; But sometimes
      you do see them and they will remember what you did for them in the past.</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;If
      you want to become a PvP player, all you have to do is give the note you
      start with to the local Priest of Discord.&nbsp; He will make you a PvP.&nbsp;
      Be prepared for the consequences though as you might loose that 1 prized
      possession (if you loose in a battle, the one that defeated you is
      entitled to loot 1 item from your corpse).</font></font>
      <p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><img border="0" src="../eqimages/star.jpg"><font color="#c0c0c0">&nbsp;
      Explore, adventure, meet people, try new things, and have fun. That is the
      one tip you should really take into consideration.</font></font></p>
