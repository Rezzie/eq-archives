      Zone Guide</font></b></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><br>
      </font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Estate of Unrest is the manor located next to Dagnor's Cauldron and near the town
      of Kaladim.&nbsp; You can either get to it from Kaladim or if coming from the
      Antonica continent, take the boat in Freeport and wait until you reach Butcherblock Mountains.&nbsp;
      Be aware that guards patrol the docks and will kill you on sight.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Unrest is a popular place indeed.&nbsp;
      The area is always crowded and you might encounter lag problems every now and then.&nbsp;
      But the amount of people here shouldn't diminish your experience as the Estate of Unrest houses a very large quantity of undead creatures.
      Unrest can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it can also be a deadly one.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Unrest can be divided into 3 parts.&nbsp;
      At the front of the house you can find the weakest creatures in Unrest such as Greater Skeletons, Jack'O'Lanterns, and
      Tormented Deads. You should hunt here if you are in the upper teens (level 16+).&nbsp;
      The best way to do it is pull one undead near the walls and close to the tunnel that leads to Dagnor's Cauldron.
      Make sure you get one at a time and be careful with the Death Beetles that wander all
      over Unrest.&nbsp; They will attack you if you are fighting an undead creature.&nbsp;
      At this stage, you can do most of your hunting solo but getting a partner might help wipe out the
      always nasty Death Beetles.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Once you hit level 20+ you can start hunting creatures that dwell inside the Estate of
      Unrest.&nbsp; You will not be able to solo anymore as the creatures are not only
      tougher but also have a tendency to come in more than one.&nbsp; I would definitely stay outside the manor
      as camping inside it will most certainly lead to death.  Set your party right next to the
      outer walls of Unrest and have a tank pull from the first floor of the manor.&nbsp;
      The creatures you can expect to battle are Ghouls, Darkbone Skeletons, Drybone Skeletons,
      Carrion Ghouls, and Skeleton Monks.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, the deeper you go into the first
      floor, the harder the creatures will be.&nbsp; One tip I would give you is to know exactly what
      you will be doing once battle starts.&nbsp; As the outer walls of Unrest are heavily populated
      with players, it can be difficult to fully understand what is going on.&nbsp;
      Thus, the use of the /assist command can come in handy.&nbsp; You should at least tell your party to
      take out the tougher creature first and then kill whatever came with the pull.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">After level 24, you can start heading inside the house for good.&nbsp;
      No more pulling to outer walls.&nbsp; There are plenty of things you can do inside the Estate of
      Unrest.&nbsp; The largest number of creatures your party should be looking for can be found in the basement.
      Getting to the basement can be tricky as the passage is somewhat hidden.  The last door
      at the left hallway from front of the house has a bookshelf.  If you click on it, it will open
      up the passage downstairs.&nbsp; At the basement you can find the toughest skeleton
      variations from Unrest (barbed and monks), and the unique and toughest creatures from
      this zone, the Werebats and the Festering Hags.&nbsp; Both the Werebat and the Hag are
      around level 29 and can hit very, very hard and really fast.&nbsp; At mid to upper 20s, you will
      last very little if no one comes to your aid.&nbsp; The experience and loot they provide is very
      rewarding though and worth the risk.</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">One of the most interesting things about Unrest is the change it will be for a
      Necromancer used to casting DoT spells and drain life.&nbsp; To hunt in Unrest you will
      almost always have to be in a large size party, which means will often be killed very fast.
      Casting DoT spells is not a good strategy as it will not be very effective.&nbsp;
      Heart Flutter would be good anyway not for its DoT effects, but for its weakening effect.&nbsp;
      But it has always been resisted when I cast, even on creatures that con'd green.&nbsp;
      Thus you will have to turn to direct damage and drain life spells to make yourself useful.&nbsp;
      But the most interesting thing is that you should be able to hunt without your pet in Unrest, and you
      actually should at certain times.  In a party with at least 1 tank, the creature should not
      turn upon you.&nbsp; And since most creatures in Unrest are undead creatures, you can use
      Dominate Undead.&nbsp; Whenever your tank pulls more than one tough creature, charm one
      of them and use it to kill the second one.&nbsp; Of course, your newly acquired pet will turn
      upon you at some point but by then your party should be able to handle it.  And who
      wouldn't think having a Skeleton Monk as a pet is cool?</font></p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="word-spacing: 0; margin: 0"><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Unrest is a great place to hunt as it is populated by tons of undead creatures.&nbsp;
      And as masters of the undead, we necromancers can only benefit from that.&nbsp;
      You can often find very good loot in Unrest but XP is not that great.&nbsp;
      As you will be hunting in large parties, whatever you kill will be shared with your team members
      and XP goes up very slow. Nevertheless, critters spawn very fast and the action is non-stop.&nbsp;
      A very fun place indeed if you don't happen to meet a Hag face to face...</font></p>
