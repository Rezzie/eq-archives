        The Powers that be in Qeynos have once again allowed what was in our sights to slip into who-knows-when.<br> 
        It seems that there was some progress finally being made towards ridding the vast Karanas of the touch of death in the form of a magic-based "anti-plague" as it was being referred to.<br> 
        Now there was still some work that needed to be done as the magic simply would not hold for an appreciable period of time , but now the poor animals that they were testing with have been stolen!<br> 
        Yes , I said stolen.<br> 
        Citizens , be glad you are safe within the walls of the city of men, where your food is plague-free and your animals are safe.

        <p>The Teir'Dal are fighting amongst themselves again and now they seems to have done away with one of their most famous faces.<br> 
        Reports are coming in from all over that Lanys T'Vyl was sacrificed to their despicable God Innoruuk.<br> 
        Always difficult outside of Neriak to decipher the politics of a race founded in hate, one is left to assume that the tensions between Lanys and the Royalty of Neriak had run their course, as gad seemed to be coming judging by the recent scuffles in the Commonlands.<br> 
        We are expecting word soon on the current state of Teir'Dal population in the Commonlands outside of Befallen.</p>
