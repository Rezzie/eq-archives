        While collecting mineral samples for his fusibility experiments, Al'Kabor noticed that the quadrolith that stands in the Great Divide of Velious was not emitting any magical energies as the ones found within the old world and Kunark.<br> 
        He needed to continue studying the structure and thus enlisted a knowledgeable wizard to aid him with the collecting of the fusible ore that he left in the caverns of the shardwurms in the Great Divide.<br> 
        <br> 
        The wizard traveled to the shardwurm caves and was greeted by the Guardian Monell.<br> 
        The Guardian mentioned that he and his brethren protected the land from intruders and that the velium within the land was too sacred to be tampered with, despite its claim of ownership by Al'Kabor.<br> 
        <br> 
        Reports have said that the Guardian was slain with relative ease and Al'Kabor retrieved the samples that were needed for his continued research of the apparently "dead" quadrolith.<br> 
        It would later be known that Al'Kabor had been successful with experiments that he performed with the fusible coral, earthen, igneous, and velium ores that enabled him to create a scepter of extraordinary potential that when held , the magical energy of the scepter expands the mind while providing a greater protection from the elements.<br> 
        <br> 
        This magnificent artifact has been entrusted to one of the wizards who had proven themselves capable and intelligent enough to be trusted to wield such an incredible artifact.
