          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Edwardian Holyblade</b></p>
          <p>Greetings and well met Xxxxx.<br>
            I am Edwardian Holyblade, noble paladin of Marr.<br>
            I have devoted my life and my blade to the glory of Mithaniel Marr.<br>
            I am also in charge of training all new paladins of Marr to make sure 
            that they have the best training necessary.<br>
            If you are a paladin of Marr I may have some [training] for you.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What training?</b></p>
          <p>I have developed a training program for all young and upcoming Paladins 
            of Marr.<br>
            My tests will enable you to learn some basic hunting, navigating and 
            armor crafting skills.<br>
            All of these abilities will be very important on your path to enlightenment.<br>
            If you are [ready to begin my tests] I will explain to you how the 
            tests will work.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am ready to begin your tests</b></p>
          <p>Very well Krohfak, I look forward to seeing you progress through 
            your training.<br>
            Here is your special mail assembly kit.<br>
            In this kit you will combine a number of components that you will 
            collect from all areas of Freeport, North Ro and the Commonlands.<br>
            The components that you will gather and combine in this kit will magical 
            create a specific armor material piece.<br>
            Each of these materials will be combined in a forge with the appropriate 
            mold that I will provide you with.<br>
            I will explain to you how the [recipes] work when you are ready.</p>

          <p><b>&gt;What recipes?</b></p>
          <p>Once you have crafted your material from the specific recipes I give 
            you you will need the appropriate mold as I mentioned before.<br>
            I can present you with the recipe and mold for Truthbringers [Helms], 
            [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].<br>
            When you are ready to being collecting the components for a material 
            recipe simply tell me what piece you [want] to craft.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I want to craft a helm</b></p>
          <p>I would strongly suggest a good helm as you can see by my patch over 
            my eye I was not so careful in my younger days.<br>
            To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of 
            Crude Iron Ore, 1 Young Kodiak Paw, 1 Ruined Cat Pelt and 1 Hops in 
            your assembly kit.<br>
            Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along 
            with this mold to fashion your very own Truthbringers Helm.</p>
