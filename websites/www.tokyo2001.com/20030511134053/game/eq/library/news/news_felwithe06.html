        <p>Our spies have sent word that Neriak and their vile Innoruuk have 
        seen fit to deliver the artifact Malevolence upon one of their ilk.<br>
        It is unknown as of yet who it was that was given such a dubious gift, 
        but one can be sure that we will hear more from this missionary of hate.<br>
        It seems, most unfortunately, that the recent attempts of the Teir Dal 
        to return Malevolence to its former function were successful or their 
        Priests would no doubt have taken care to keep the wretched thing far 
        from public scrutiny.<br>
        Instead, we must bear the burden of keeping this malevolent chosen one 
        from corrupting us.<br>
        <br>
        Beware the power of the artifact, children of Tunare.<br>
        The legends say that it can do more than simply steal your soul from 
        your waking body.<br>
        It can keep from ever knowing eternal peace at the side of the Mother of 
        All for, any sacrifice made to malevolence will be the property of 
        Innoruuk himself.<br>
        There is no worse fate that could befall you.<br>
        Please, take heed.</p>

        The chosen of Tunare has returned to the unfriendly continent of Kunark recently.<br> 
        Her intentions there are not yet known to us, but we expect word soon.<br> 
        Please refrain from hypothesizing or second guessing the nature of her adventure.<br> 
        Ours is not to question the will of the Mother and her avatar.<br> 
        Be sure that all will be known when it is in the best interest of all of Tunare's creatures for us to know.<br> 
        The only thing that we can be sure of is that Firiona Vie is on a mission in the name of balance and order at the behest of Tunare herself, so worry not.
