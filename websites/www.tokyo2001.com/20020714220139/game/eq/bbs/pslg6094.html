It was then that we discovered the <BR>hard packed ice was as strong as any stone or wood.   With this ice, we <BR>were able to carve out structures, right out of the ice.  Through time, <BR>the settlement grew into a town, and then into a keep.  The keep was <BR>then named Froststone for the stone-like ice it had been built out of <BR>and with this, we had realized our stay was now permanent.  Up until <BR>this point, we had only encountered animals, wolves and walrus' for <BR>their skins and meat and all was good.   Then we encountered the [Frost <BR>Giants]. <BR><BR> You say, 'Who are Frost Giants?'<BR><BR> Historian Baenek says 'The Frost Giants were the first intelligent <BR>life, if you could call them that, the Coldain encountered.  Those <BR>behemoths did not take kindly to our settlement upon their lands and <BR>so, as with all that are jealous of Brells finest creation, they waged <BR>war.  They thought they had caught us by surprise but we knew they were <BR>coming.  We were just fooling them into thinking we were unawares!  The <BR>battle lasted for many [days]. <BR><BR>You say, 'How many days?'<BR><BR> Historian Baenek says 'It lasted for many days.  Didn't you hear me <BR>the first time?  Where was I?  Oh, yes, the battle.  Colin Dain, Brell <BR>rest his soul, decided that the giants were not worth our time so he <BR>gathered our people and lead us deeper into the mountains to seek <BR>another [place].  And the stubborn beasts followed us!  It was then <BR>that Colin, Brell rest his soul, stayed behind with a small band of <BR>volunteers and led a suicide ambush to buy the others time to escape.  <BR>He paid with his life, and so in honor of this exemplary dwarf, we <BR>called ourselves the Coldain and our leader the title of Dain. <BR>

<tr><td colspan=4 bgcolor="#000042"><b>記事番号6095へのコメント</b><br> You say, 'Where is another place?'<BR><BR> Historian Baenek gestures toward the surrounding area and says 'The area <BR>known as the Crystal Caverns, which you see before you, was created in <BR>little more than four score years.  A vision from Brell was granted to a <BR>Coldain miner by the name of Glight Snowchipper, who presented his <BR>proposal to Dain Frostreaver the First and the Dain seeing the soundness <BR>of this, began construction immediately.  A test came three decades <BR>later, when a Giant scout followed one of our hunting parties back to our <BR>caverns and reported the location to the [Chieftain] of the Ice Giants.' <BR><BR> <BR>You say, 'Who is Chieftain?'<BR><BR> Historian Baenek spats on the ground 'Slagd Frozentoe was it's name.  He <BR>led a small party of Giants, only 250 or so.  Glight was given the honor <BR>of leading the defense of the caverns and using his magical pickaxe, <BR>aptly named Snowchipper, he led his forces using hit and run tactics, <BR>felling many giants.  With over half its forces dispatched, Slagd still <BR>managed to penetrate his way further into the cavern and would have made <BR>it to the city proper if not for the courageous act of [Glight].' <BR><BR><BR> You say, 'I proper for the courgeous act of Glight'<BR><BR> Historian Baenek says 'Glight led them on a wild chase, using false <BR>passageways and such, until he finally went down a passageway with no <BR>chance of escape.  It was then that Glight triggered the cave in of the <BR>passage burying the remaining giant forces and that of Glight's as well <BR>under tons of ice and snow.  To honor this act of self-sacrifice, Brell <BR>rest his soul, the cavern is known as Glight's Fall.  As a result of the <BR>cave in, there looks to be a waterfall frozen in time.  It is said his <BR>[ghost] still remains somewhere in the caverns.  Peace was at hand for <BR>some time, but as with all things, it did not [last].

We do not know why they came, they just did.  They turned out to be <BR>some of the most dangerous foes we have ever encountered as they used <BR>stealth and camouflage to attack their prey.  Many a kin has fallen prey to <BR>them with only their shrieks of agony and terror to echo throughout the <BR>halls as notice of their deaths.
