        <p>Dorvias N'Keth, the Archpriest of Innoruuk and advisor to King Naythox Thex,discovered that Lanys T'Vyl, the forsaken daughter of Innoruuk, has learned the location of the arm of malevolence, the second of the three lost pieces of the artifact that could destroy our father and give her the ultimate power.<br> 
        <br> 
        In order to keep Lanys T'Vyl from obtaining the part of the artifact, the Archpriest obtained permission from Venril Sathir to seek out the Iksar,Danak Dhorentath to raise the long since dead General Tzashk, keeper of this staff for several years.<br> 
        <br> 
        Once the general was summoned, the location of the staff was made known.<br> 
        Tzashk informed them that only the great dragon Trakanon would know the true location of the staff for it was he who defeated he and his fleet and confiscated the staff from him long ago.<br> 
        <br> 
        Dorvias N'Keth was last reported as heading to confront the Ring of Scale about this information.</p>

        Yes, the avatar of Cazic-Thule appeared and banished the floating goddess from Norrath.<br> 
        <br> 
        The evil presence of the God of Fear still remains in the lesser portion of the Faydark Forest.<br> 
        While it is not the presence of our hateful father Innoruuk, the corruption should still amuse the Teir'Dal nation as the scent of fear amongst the high elves and woodlanders can be smelt from afar.</p>

        <p>The recent outcome of Al'Kabor's research has been new translocation spells,but that is not the most interesting part of this report.<br> 
        Apparently, one of his assistants betrayed him and he retaliated by stripping the individual of his wizardry.<br> 
        <br> 
        While others view him as being a dangerous wizard, we should not fear him.<br> 
        His mercifulness proves that he is no threat to us.</p>
