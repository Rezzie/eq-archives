          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Mercutius Del Torre</b></p>
          <p>Good day, night, or whatever the time is.<br>
            I am Mercutius Del Torre, minstrel of the Draconic Loyalist Fellowship.<br>
            The great crystalline dragon goddess, Veeshan, has blessed my life with the opportunity to 
            live among her children here in the Skyshrine.<br>
            I have learned more of the dragons history, lore, and heritage than I ever could have dreamed 
            of knowing back in my younger days in Qeynos.<br>
            If you are privy to the musical arts and a friend of the dragons and kin I have developed 
            a method of crafting [draconic instruments] and would craft some for you given I am provided 
            with the necessary materials.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is draconic instruments?</b></p>
          <p>I have a collection of instruments that I have crafted during my stay here in the Skyshrine 
            from materials that can be found here on the continent of Velious.<br>
            I presented my crafted instruments to the dragon scholars and they decorated them with runes 
            in the ancient dragon script that enhances the magnificence of their sounds.<br>
            I will craft either a [draconic drum], [draconic lute], or [draconic horn] if you bring me 
            the materials in order to do so.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is draconic Lute?</b></p>
          <p>The strings of the draconic lute must be crafted from Siren Hair and the body of the lute 
            must be carved from a Brontotherium Femur treated with a [special shellac].<br>
            If you bring me those items I will craft the lute for you and have it inscribed with the dragon 
            script runes.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is special shellac?</b></p>
          <p>The shellac used for the instruments must be created by a brewer from a Flask of Water, an 
            [Oily Goo Secretion], and one [Kromrif Spit Vodka].<br>
            Once you have the shellac fire the old dragon horn or brontotherium femur in a kiln with the 
            shellac.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Oily Goo Secretion?</b></p>
          <p>In the caves of the Geonids in the Wakening Lands can be found Tar Goos.<br>
            These Tar Goos secrete a sticky oily substance that makes an excellent preservative.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Kromrif spit vodka?</b></p>
          <p>Kromrif Spit Vodka is a strong alcohol that can be purchased from the Coldain brewers of 
            Thurgadin.</p>
