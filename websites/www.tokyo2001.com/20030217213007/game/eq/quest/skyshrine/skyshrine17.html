          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Torm Wenrar</b></p>
          <p>Hail to you my friend! I am Torm Wenrar, proud warrior of the Draconic Loyalist Fellowship.<br>
            The dragons and dragon-kin of Skyshrine have need of capable warriors to aid in the war with 
            the giants of Kael Drakkel. Do not consider this a sign of weakness, even the most powerful 
            beings benefit from having friends and allies.<br>
            The Giants too have many beings in their service, Ogres, Trolls, and unfortunately even Northmen 
            like myself have been hired into the service of the Kromzek.<br>
            These mercenaries must be put down, perhaps if enough of them are slain, other sell swords 
            would be deterred from seeking the employment of the Kromzek.<br>
            The dragon-kin have placed a [bounty] on the lives of the Kromzeks mercenaries, any aid you 
            can provide to the Skyshrine would be well rewarded.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What bounty?</b></p>
          <p>You shall be rewarded from Skyshrines treasure hordes for the Kromzek Mercenary Brooches 
            of every three mercenaries in the Kromzeks employment you slay.<br>
            If you manage to locate and slay the [mercenary captains], or the more [notorious mercenaries] 
            the rewards will be greater.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What notorious mercenaries?</b></p>
          <p>There is a bounty for the lives of four mercenaries that have become notorious killers of 
            dragon-kin.<br>
            Since these mercenaries are not adorned with personalized brooches like the mercenary captain, 
            their heads must be returned to me as proof of their deaths.<br>
            The four mercenaries can usually be found together hunting dragons and dragon-kin.<br>
            The first of these despicable individuals is a human by the name of Julius Oresco, a warrior 
            of great skill.<br>
            Julius' dragon hunting band is composed of the Dwarf, Grenth Drakebane, the erudite, Sadeem 
            Oujva, and the northman, Rontar O'Karn.<br>
            Bring me the heads of the four notorious mercenaries and I shall reward you on behalf of the 
            dragon-kin from the treasure hoards of Skyshrine.</p>
