        <p>Many of you know because you got caught up in it, some of you even lost one close to you, but it appears we may have seen the last of Lanys T'Vyl.<br> 
        A huge battle erupted in middle of Rathe Mountains between those Teir'Dal still loyal to Lanys and Neriak itself.<br> 
        No one is sure, but one would have to assume that Thex had simply had enough of her games.<br> 
        The battle was fierce as the Dark Elves cut each other down by the dozens upon dozens.<br> 
        Reports say that it was only the intervention of Mayong Mistmoore himself that stopped the fighting.<br> 
        <br> 
        That is hardly all though.<br> 
        Our sources confirm that Innoruuk himself made an appearance after the struggle and this is the part we should all be wary of.<br> 
        None outside of the very Plane of Hate can be certain, but the evidence suggests that there is a successor to Lanys' position at the right hand of the Prince of Hate.<br> 
        This is something that we will be watching closely.<br> 
        Let us all give a prayer to the Earth Mother that Firiona will be strong enough to face this new threat down as she did Lanys back in the battle for Kithicor.</p>

        The famed wizard Al'Kabor has once again made a great stride in the&nbsp;<br>
        magical sciences.<br> 
        After experimenting with fusible coral, earthen, igneous, and velium ores, the fruit of the Erudite's labors produced a scepter of wondrous proportions.<br> 
        Only time will tell if these advancements will be something that he sees fit to share with all of Norrath.<br> 
        In the meantime. should you see a wizard running around with a shovel, there is a chance that it is Al'Kabor's scepter cleverly disguised so that it does not fall into the wrong hands.
