        <p><b>&gt;Hail, Centurion Jelin</b><br>
        <br>
        Welcome to my home, my apologies for it being untidy I have been 
        preoccupied with thought of my brother lately.<br>
        I love Seru and I love this town do not get me wrong, but it still makes 
        me sad to see someone cast out.<br>
        He was forced to submit to the Question when he was found to be 
        supplying [Recuso] with food, water, and medical supplies.<br>
        Because of the power of the question they soon found this out, and now 
        he has to live amongst the very people he was helping.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What Recuso?</b><br>
        <br>
        The Recuso are the refused.<br>
        They are cast out of Sanctus Seru because of their crimes against the 
        city, their incompetence, or for any other number of political reasons.<br>
        Because you are questioned by a Praesertum other than the one that you 
        are in, it is kept unbiased.<br>
        My brother committed crimes against the city by assisting the Recuso. 
        The refused are sent to Marus Seru as punishment and [interfering] with 
        that punishment is interfering with Seru's way. <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What interfering?</b><br>
        <br>
        I would never be able to aid him, let alone think of it without failing 
        the question.<br>
        I just wish I knew how he was doing.<br>
        I could not check on him, and could not ask you to check on him either, 
        or you would defy Seru.<br>
        That is something that I could not ask of anyone.<br>
        The Question is a horrible ordeal.<br>
        You will either die from being cast to Marus Seru or from the draining 
        power of the Question itself. </p>

        <b>&gt;Your sister is worried about you</b><br>
        <br>
        You talked to her?<br>
        Surely she didn't come right out and say that though, that would get her 
        removed from the Hand, and most definitely the city.<br>
        I am glad you were smart enough to read here emotions to see that she 
        thought of me.<br>
        It really makes my heart warm and gives me hope.<br>
        It is difficult living here, we are under constant attack, and have no 
        way to get food.<br>
        I wish I had some [good news] for her. <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What good news?<br>
        </b><br>
        Yeah, it looks grim for anyone in this awful place.<br>
        I wrote her this letter when I found out that I was being exiled, but 
        did not get a chance to give it to her.<br>
        If you want to risk it, you can take it to her.<br>
        Make no mention if is from me.<br>
        She is loyal to the city and would not want to be cast out because of 
        me. </p>
