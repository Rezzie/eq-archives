        <p>Deep in the heart of Neriak, The king and Queen held a war council against Lanys T'Vyl and her followers.<br> 
        During the council , Mayong Mistmoore appeared in an obvious fit of rage toward the Crimson Triad.<br> 
        He informed The Royals of Lanys T'Vyl's ritualistic ceremony in which resulted in the capture of his minion Khasra Vei'Ras.<br> 
        He informed them of Lanys' location and of her intention to complete Malevolence in the Rathe Mountains, Lanys was preparing to complete the ritual.<br> 
        The Crimson Triad interrupted her and a great battle began.<br> 
        The battle was long and bloody.<br> 
        Growing tired and angrier by the wait, Mayong Mistmoore appeared, knocking Lanys T'Vyl unconscious.<br> 
        He then Grabbed Malevolence.<br> 
        With the Bloodmoon in hand, he completed Malevolence.<br> 
        He then placed it in the hands of the archpriest, Dorvias N'Keth and told the Crimson Triad to complete the sacrifice of the Lanys T'Vyl.<br> 
        <br> 
        Instructed by the King and Queen, Ashteth T'Dral and Dorvias N'Keth quickly began the sacrificial ceremony.<br> 
        Upon the appearance of the Avatar of Hate, He took Malevolence from the hands the Archpriest with instructions to venture to the Plane of Hate when he is summoned.<br> 
        <br> 
        Once the ceremony was completed, The King made the following announcement in Neriak:<br> 
        <br> 
        "Loyal Teir'Dal.&nbsp;<br>
        The time has come for our nation to move on to greatness.<br> 
        Neriak has conquered over the armies of Lanys T'Vyl.<br> 
        At last, the sacrificial ceremony has been performed in the name of our father.<br> 
        The Avatar of Hate has absorbed her essence and power.<br> 
        Valizrae D'Tora, the new chosen, has been freed and is now beginning her training to become the new child of hate."<br> 
        <br> 
        Lanys's minions, outraged by the sacrifice of their leader, are quickly constructing a temple in her honor.<br> 
        The King and Queen showed no concern over this factor.</p>
