        <p>Well friend, apparently the Demons from Neriak were not content to forever taint lovely Kithicor with their hated hate, nope nope nope.<br> 
        Now ugly ol'Lanys herself has taken up home inside of Befallen (the place with the skeltons, after the forest but before Freeport where the humans live you know).&nbsp;<br>
        What is a halfling that only wants peace and tranquility to do in such proximity to so ugly nasty dirty a race as them?<br> 
        For one thing, do not go near to the Befallen place, not that we can travel our own forest at night anymore, hamumph.<br> 
        <br> 
        Remember these helpful hints, Halflings of the Vale: eat a hearty meal before leaving your house ( never know when you might need the strength) , never be afraid to call to a deputy for help (that's what they are there for after all ), don't go through the forest at night ( can't stress that enough in fact, once the sun goes down, you might just want to rest) , and of course never ever ever accept gifts from a dark elf , no matter how shiny or tasty.</p>

        <p>You all remember Holly Windstalker? She runs around near Qeynos getting mad at folks that fight with the bears and the wolves and things there.<br> 
        Well , if I were a poacher ( not that I am) I would be extra careful for a while because she is not getting any happier soon.<br> 
        Poor Holly lost a dear dear friend long ago.&nbsp;<br>
        His name was Cros, Cros Treewind.<br> 
        <br> 
        He was a very good man that helped Holly in her goals of protecting the wildlife.<br> 
        Anyway , he died a while ago.<br> 
        Caught some bad cold from the water or something over in those parts , but now the city thinks they know who did it.<br> 
        Poisoned the water that is.<br> 
        <br> 
        The folks there seem to be doing what they can to find the peoples responsible, but no luck yet.<br> 
        With this tragedy being in the news again, residents say Holly has been in a terrible mood lately.<br> 
        Anyway I think we should all pause a moment before supping tonight and remember Cros.</p>
