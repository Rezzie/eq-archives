        It is the bound soul of a pure mortal, rare indeed.<br>
        Take this hollow gem, and combine with it the heart of one who is pure.<br>

        <b>&gt;What prophecy?<br>
        </b><br>
        I suppose it is time for the secret to be shared.<br>
        Ages ago, two brothers were born.<br>
        Glohnor was highly favored by the pompous Lightbringer, whose name we do 
        not utter.<br>
        Lhranc was chosen by the Prince of Hate to bring destruction and turmoil 
        to the sons of men.<br>
        The one thing they shared in common was their love of the fair 
        priestess, Kyrenna.<br>
        Kyrenna fell deeply in love with Glohnor.<br>
        When Lhranc discovered this, he was overcome with rage and unwisely 
        attacked his brother, who happened to be far more adept in combat.<br>
        The fight cost Lhranc dearly.<br>
        He lost his dignity as well as an eye in the struggle.<br>
        He was ordered to leave Freeport and live his life in exile from the 
        only home he had ever known.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What became of Lhranc?<br>
        </b><br>
        Lhranc wandered the deserts of Ro for weeks, sinking deeper into 
        depression and giving in to rage.<br>
        Reports from the local merchants and caravans had him roaming the dunes 
        muttering to himself incoherently.<br>
        Eventually, he was forgotten, blending in with the hermits and madmen 
        common to that region, forgotten by all save one.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;Who is the one?<br>
        </b><br>
        Innoruuk had not forsaken Lhranc.<br>
        Once his rage and hate had matured and sufficiently altered his soul, 
        the dark prince summoned him and gave him dominion over the demons that 
        had enslaved his mind.<br>
        He was given a weapon that made him powerful enough to slay any enemy 
        that stood in his way.<br>
        He was to become the first human to harness the power of the almighty 
        shadowknight.<br>
        After years of traveling and teaching mankind his newfound abilities, 
        Lhranc sneaked back into Freeport through a series of sewers in search 
        of revenge against his brother and in hopes of kidnapping Kyrenna, the 
        source of his obsession. Waiting until Glohnor was alone, Lhranc sprang 
        from the shadows and slew his brother.<br>
        This was the act that brought about his curse.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What curse?</b><br>
        <br>
        As I said, Glohnor was highly favored by the Lightbringer.<br>
        When the contemptible god of honor discovered what had been done, he 
        transformed Lhranc into a deformed spectral knight and placed him in the 
        ruined city.<br>
        Lhranc then used what remained of his power to summon Kyrenna to his 
        side and bind her there in a timeless, seamless sphere.<br>
        He struggled for centuries to break her will and convince her to serve 
        Innoruuk, certain that together they could remove his curse. But then, 
        there was the prediction.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What prediction?</b><br>
        <br>
        The prophecy states that one day Kyrenna will escape the clutches of 
        Lhranc and that she will resurrect Glohnor.<br>
        Together, it reads, they will destroy Lhranc and undo all he has done.<br>
        I trust that I do not need to tell you, Xxxxx , that this would decimate 
        our foothold in Norrath.<br>
        When the prophecy was written, its words spread across the land.<br>
        A dark council was held to construct a plan that would frustrate the 
        words of the prophets.<br>
        My ancestors were responsible for robbing Glohnor's tomb and securing 
        his remains.<br>
        For generations we have been charged with the duty of guarding those 
        remains and the secret plan, should the corpse be discovered.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What secret plan?</b><br>
        <br>
        The plan is a last resort only to be tried if Kyrenna indeed escapes and 
        the remains are discovered.<br>
        Judging by my brother's words that time is now.<br>
        It will take the most powerful hero all the courage and dedication he 
        can muster to complete the ritual.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;I will complete the ritual</b><br>
        <br>
        It would seem we have no choice, and this is our only hope.<br>
        I must first make a dark shroud.<br>
        To do this I must stain it with the blood of an innocent.<br>
        Go find me this rare blood so I can start the creating of the shroud.</p>
