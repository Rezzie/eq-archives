          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Annous Pineshadow</b></p>
          <p>Annous Pineshadow closes his eyes and gives a deep bow of his head 
            in formal greetings,</p>
          <p> 'Good day to you, Xxxxx. I am Annous Pineshadow, high priest of 
            The Rainkeeper and ambassador of Qeynos.<br>
            It has been a [long] time since I last set foot within the Jaggedpine, 
            and although not surprised, I am amazed and awestruck at the untouched 
            purity of these sacred grounds.<br>
            It is very much a relief to know that the forest has been sparred 
            the taint of the venomous world that has become Norrath.'</p>
          <p> <b>&gt;How long?</b></p>
          <p>Annous Pineshadow gives a gentle chuckle as he conjures his most 
            fond of memories,</p>
          <p> 'Sixty years -- give or take.<br>
            This is the place of my birth and my home.<br>
            When I had come of age, I ventured to Qeynos to learn the ways of 
            the priest, finding myself lost in the ways of the druid.<br>
            I adore the nature that Karana sustains, but I had always felt myself 
            more suited for the path of preservation and servitude of the faith.<br>
            When his majesty, Antonious III sealed the Jaggedpine, I was among 
            those who were asked to remain behind in Qeynos.<br>
            Only the druids and rangers of Karana remained in the Jaggedpine -- 
            it was important to preserve only the bare minimum and we understood 
            the need.<br>
            We also did not wish to have our culture be entirely cut off and those 
            who remained outside of the forest's confines were there to continue 
            the faith and [sacred ways] of The Rainkeeper.'</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is sacred ways?</b></p>
          <p>There are hundreds of different rites, ceremonies, prayers, and rituals 
            that are performed in one's devotion to The Rainkeeper.<br>
            Many of these can be as simple as the performance of a duty, as a 
            druid would protect their forest, while some may be as complex and 
            consuming as a several day ceremony to usher in the changing seasons.<br>
            Aaaah. . . but there is truly so much that in the time that's left 
            for me here could not give proper justice for in my explanations -- 
            nor do I believe that you would truly understand them by simply listening.<br>
            You must [have the faith in your heart] and you must truly wish to 
            uphold the ways of the Rainkeeper and do so to truly understand.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I have the faith in my heart</b></p>
          <p>I would not dare challenge that, my friend, but is your faith strong 
            enough to withstand the greatest of consequences -- even the sacrifice 
            of your own life in remaining true to that faith?<br>
            Aaaah. . . but such is a question that cannot be merely asked and 
            simply answered in words.<br>
            One truly does not discover one's self until they are faces with the 
            reality of such tests of faith.<br>
            Perhaps, if [you are willing], I might guide you on a path that may 
            lead to the discovery of such answers.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am willing</b></p>
          <p>Excellent, child. I am pleased to know that you are willing to go 
            so far as to test your faith -- but do so not to me, or to anyone 
            other than yourself and The Rainkeeper, else you shall find only a 
            hollow shadow of the answers you seek, and a great void of disappointment.<br>
            If you prove successful in your own eyes by completing this task, 
            then you shall be among The Rainkeeper's sacred order of priests -- 
            The Gale Weavers.<br>
            Druids and Clerics alike make up this order, for our dedication is 
            mutual in strength and our ultimate duties to The Rainkeeper are parallel.<br>
            The first journey that you must embark on will result in the acquisition 
            of the [Azure Idol of Karana] -- an ancient item that each of The 
            Gale Weavers possess.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is azure idol of Karana?</b></p>
          <p>When the order was first founded by the Hierophant known as Tanirun 
            Galeweaver, he bestowed upon all of his brethren a sacred idol carved 
            by his own hands.<br>
            It is said that when Tanirun blessed the Shrine of Karana with his 
            gift of the storm, that the remaining essence of Karana's witness 
            was divided among the idols.<br>
            In the passing times, the idols were handed down when an old member 
            passed beyond into the Eye of Karana's Storm and a new member was 
            inducted in their predecessor's memory and honor.<br>
            You will seek one of these idols -- one that at present has no owner 
            and was stolen by the bandit raiders and return it to me.<br>
            The man who possesses the idol is one known as Drayen Blackguard -- 
            a member of the dreaded Blackguard family that has taken recent residence 
            in the forest.<br>
            You shall find him in the mountains of Rathe if our scouts are correct.''</p>

            <b>&gt;I wish to prove myself worthy</b></p>
          <p>Then your endeavor shall continue, my child.<br>
            Take this scroll -- to you now it holds no meaning but in due time 
            you shall understand.<br>
            Keep the scroll close to you until you have sought and successfully 
            acquired the [Dormant Crystal Sphere] and [The Rainkeeper's Writ].'</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Dormant Crystal sphere</b></p>
          <p>There are several magical spheres throughout Norrath but this sphere 
            is [unique to The Rainkeeper].<br>
            It is said that when Karana blessed this area with his first storm 
            in acceptance of the nomadic tribe that would settle here, that the 
            droplets of rain left upon the pines and blades of grass was gathered 
            by one of these nomads and stored in a plain clay jar that was then 
            buried as a symbol of their own gratitude toward the storm.<br>
            Nearly a century later when Karana's Shrine and the Throne of Karana's 
            Thunder were near completion, one known as Tanirun Galeweaver found 
            the jar.<br>
            The water was still inside, preserved by means unexplainable through 
            simple reason.<br>
            It is said that Tanirun poured the water into his own hands and wove 
            a spell, sealing the wind within the orb of this ancient rain that 
            was now crystallized by Tanirun's spell.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is The Rainkeeper's Writ?</b></p>
          <p>'When the order of The Gale Weavers was established, Tanirun and 
            his brethren of the order constructed a sacred writ similar to a spell, 
            but it cannot be invoked at the priest's whim.<br>
            Like the storm, it is chaos.<br>
            When the words are spoken, the elements of the storm will come as 
            they wish, when they wish.<br>
            This writ was used to conjure the essence of the storm into the orbs, 
            creating the mirror of a sky where a storm rages eternally.<br>
            The writ was lost to us sometime before the Jaggedpine was sealed. 
            One known as Naundruar, a former high priest of our order, took the 
            writ.<br>
            He was furious, enraged that the order had been asked to divide and 
            leave our sacred homeland.<br>
            None are ultimately certain what horrible fate befell him, for his 
            hatred toward Qeynos had infected his being like an incurable disease.<br>
            In the southern plain of Karana you will find the remnants of this 
            once great priest and with him, you shall find the writ.'''</p>

            You have done well, my child.<br>
            The ancient scroll has impressed upon it a small mirror of your faith.<br>
            As it was with you through your travels, the runes have changed to 
            reflect your own heart and what lies within it.<br>
            I have woven for you the Orb of the Gale -- your Orb of the Gale, 
            but do not think that your journey ends here.<br>
            It is still hollow -- the winds are dormant and the clouds lie in 
            wait.<br>
            Their lifeblood is missing, and you must seek it.<br>
            To do this, you must venture to the realm where the Gale thrives -- 
            the Plane of Sky.<br>
            There are ethereal creatures known as Gale Weavers that dwell there.<br>
            You must extinguish their temporary tangible form and from that, take 
            the essence of the Gale that they have woven.<br>
            Do not feel remorse for destroying these planar creatures, for you 
            do not truly destroy them.<br>
            Once you have obtained the Essence of the Gale, place it into the 
            orb and seal it, creating the Orb of the Gale that must be returned 
            to me.''</p>
