        <p>Antonius Bayle and the ruling council of Qeynos have begun formal investigations and inquiries into a shadowy group calling themselves the Bloodsabres.<br> 
        Worshippers of Bertoxxulous, this group is responsible for a failed coup attempt some time ago in the past as well as for recently releasing the terrible plague upon the Plains of Karana.<br> 
        <br> 
        The local magistrate and advisor to the Qeynos ruler plans to employ an army of investigators to root out and bring an end to this terrible threat to their city.<br> 
        He expects many arrests in the coming days as lower ranking members of this strange cult are collared and hauled in for questioning.<br> 
        <br> 
        We here at TNWR support Antonius Bayle in his efforts to bring an end to this threat.<br> 
        His Magistrate and Advisor, Vegalys Keldrane, has asked any interested in assisting with these investigations to contact him personally for further instructions.</p>

    Several arrests have taken place in the weeks past that have turned up new information as Magistrate Vagelys Keldrane continues his pursuit of the group of individuals known as the Bloodsabers.<br>  
    Through the interrogation of admitted members of this group, information has been gained that they believe may lead investigators to two individuals that were personally responsible in causing the death of Cros Treewind, a druid who at one time worked as a guard patrolling the hills outside of Qeynos.<br>  
    These individuals were reported responsible for tainting the waters of Surefall Glade, infecting Cros Treewind, Holly Windstalker and manu of the Glade's protected animals with a sickness.
