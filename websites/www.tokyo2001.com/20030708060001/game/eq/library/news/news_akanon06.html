        <p>In what has now become a comical display of childish intolerance, those nasty Dark Elves decided they would fight over the body of their cold-as-stone-dead "chosen" Lanys T'Vyl.<br> 
        Apparently, those psychotic enough to remain loyal to a corpse wanted to keep the body of their revered and way-not-alive leader with them.<br> 
        <br> 
        At the same time, those back in Neriak also wanted the body of Lanys.<br> 
        So those crafty elves cooked up some story to tell this so-called "Baron" who was guarding the corpse in the ruins of Befallen of all places.<br> 
        Whether it worked or not, we are not sure but we do have it on very good authority that the body of Lanys T'Vyl is in the hands of Neriak now.<br> 
        At least it is for this week anyway.</p>

    King Tearis Thex of the elven nation, said farewell to his beloved daughter Firiona Vie recently.<br> 
    She is said to be traveling to the continent of Kunark for reasons unknown.<br> 
    General Galeth Veredeth issued a statement assuring the people of Faydwer that though he was not able to reveal the nature or purpose of her journey, it is one of peaceful intentions and that we should not worry for her safety.<br> 
    <br> 
    I don't know about you readers, but I think anyone that can handle a sword like that woman certainly isn't one you should worry about.<br> 
    Have you seen that sword she has been carrying around since her staff "The Lifeguide" was stolen? She means business.<br> 
    That thing must weigh a ton and is longer then I am tall by a factor of two! Don't worry about her, worry about whatever gets on the business end of that sword. Sheesh.
