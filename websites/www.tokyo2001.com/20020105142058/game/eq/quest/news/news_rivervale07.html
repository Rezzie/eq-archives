        <p>The temple of Life in Qeynos has found a way to counteract the plague elements in the Karana lands.<br> 
        This is glorius news indeed.<br> 
        I heard that there was some farmer human there and he was growing foods just fine because he buried a wee statue in his dirt.<br> 
        Seems that this no good man helped the no good men who started the trouble to begin with and those bad folks gave this bad farmer the statue as payment.<br> 
        Anyway, the goodly Priests of Life in Qeynos turned that little statue over and over until they figured out what it was about it that fixed the plague.<br> 
        Soon, they will try very hard to make this magic happen all over the Karanas so we can make fresh muffins and breads again.<br> 
        Happy days!</p>

        <p>In nearby East Karana, one of the worst of the bad evil eyes there, Lorrk the Insane, was recently dispatched by a band of adventurers.<br> 
        I think gypsies sent them to do it, because they brought them back his parts and she gave them an old chest full of magic stuff.<br> 
        Someone even told me that the chest was for Al'Kabor because he was looking to combine some things.<br> 
        Now what that wizard needs with a chest from the gypsies I've nary a guess, but I am sure glad to have one less thing to be worry about when I pass through that place.</p>
