          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Dalorio Blistbobble</b></p>
          <p>Xxxxx! You scared me! Well it is good to meet you nonetheless young 
            Xxxxx.<br>
            Many young Guardians of the Vale often come to me for guidance.<br>
            If there is something I can help you with in your training you make 
            sure you let Dalorio know!<br>
            In the meanwhile I will be working on my [trade].</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What trade?</b></p>
          <p>Well you see Xxxxx, I have been an aspiring blacksmith for quite 
            sometime now.<br>
            I have spent mostly all of my spare time since I was just a wee whipper 
            snapper like yourself collecting different materials and trying to 
            craft anything and everything of value in our town forge.<br>
            Blacksmithing has always interested me and that interest is exactly 
            what led to the creation of my [special recipes].</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What special recipes?</b></p>
          <p>Well its funny that you ask Xxxxx, I have just recently perfected 
            my smithing recipes for Proudfoot Platemail.<br>
            I would be willing to part with my recipe along with a mold for each 
            piece of this fine platemail to any apprentice willing to [collect 
            the necessary items] to craft it.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I will collect the necessary items</b></p>
          <p>You will eh Xxxxx? I am happy to hear of an upcoming Warrior of the 
            Vale willing to collect the items necessary to craft their own armor.<br>
            I must admit that you could really use some armor because it can get 
            quite dangerous out in the thicket!<br>
            Now back to business!<br>
            To craft your own Proudfoot Platemail you will need my magical assembly 
            kit that you will combine the items I ask you to gather for specific 
            recipes.<br>
            After you have done this you will use the pattern I give you along 
            with the material you have fashioned and combine it in a forge to 
            yield your armor piece.<br>
            Now are you [ready to get started]? </p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am ready to get started</b></p>
          <p>Very well Xxxxx, let's get to it! Here is my personal Platemail assembly 
            kit.<br>
            Inside this magical assembly kit you will combine certain items collected 
            both from the thicket and our great city of Rivervale.<br>
            It is my hope that while you progress in your training and through 
            the different armor pieces that you will be able to learn of your 
            surroundings both inside and outside the Vale.<br>
            If you are ready to start fashioning your items simply tell me what 
            armor piece you [want] to make.<br>
            I have the recipe for Proudfoot Platemail [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], 
            [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].<br>
            As a side note, make sure you craft your Breastplate last due to the 
            difficulty of collecting the items for it.</p>

          <p>Alrighty then Xxxxx! To create your bracer material you will need 
            to gather 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Thorn Drakeling Scale, 2 Fire 
            Beetle Eyes and 1 Lettuce then combine them in your assembly kit.<br>
            After creating your Proudfoot Bracer Material combine it in a forge
