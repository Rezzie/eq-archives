          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Torm Wenrar</b></p>
          <p>Hail to you my friend! I am Torm Wenrar, proud warrior of the Draconic Loyalist Fellowship.<br>
            The dragons and dragon-kin of Skyshrine have need of capable warriors to aid in the war with 
            the giants of Kael Drakkel. Do not consider this a sign of weakness, even the most powerful 
            beings benefit from having friends and allies.<br>
            The Giants too have many beings in their service, Ogres, Trolls, and unfortunately even Northmen 
            like myself have been hired into the service of the Kromzek.<br>
            These mercenaries must be put down, perhaps if enough of them are slain, other sell swords 
            would be deterred from seeking the employment of the Kromzek.<br>
            The dragon-kin have placed a [bounty] on the lives of the Kromzeks mercenaries, any aid you 
            can provide to the Skyshrine would be well rewarded.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What bounty?</b></p>
          <p>You shall be rewarded from Skyshrines treasure hordes for the Kromzek Mercenary Brooches 
            of every three mercenaries in the Kromzeks employment you slay.<br>
            If you manage to locate and slay the [mercenary captains], or the more [notorious mercenaries] 
            the rewards will be greater.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What mercenary captains?</b></p>
          <p>There are four mercenaries that have been promoted by the Kromzek to the position of mercenary 
            captain.<br>
            These captains command various units of mercenaries, usually those of their own race.<br>
            The military prowess of the Kromzek, Kromrif, and their followers should not be underestimated.<br>
            These individuals are very good at what they have been hired to achieve.<br>
            There is a bounty available for the personalized mercenary brooches of Captain Glarg, Captain 
            Ulmog, and Captain Mc'Hersh.<br>
            Recover all three of the brooches and return them to me as proof of the captains deaths and 
            I shall reward you from the treasure coffers of Skyshrine.</p>
