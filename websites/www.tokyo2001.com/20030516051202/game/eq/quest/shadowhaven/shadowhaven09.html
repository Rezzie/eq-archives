            <b>&gt;Who daksins?<br>
            </b><br>
            Well I know that he told me he was going to the Tenebrous Mountains to try to aquire the blood 
            of one of the cursed vampyres there.<br>
            A very brave Gnome he is but also sometimes not very aware of what he is getting himself into.<br>
            He told me that he needed to bring it to Zimloro so that a potion could be made to cure his 
            sick sister that was attacked by one of the cursed not too long ago.<br>
            Perhaps you could go [lend him a hand] so that he could return sooner because his family is 
            very worried about him. <br>
            <br>
            私は彼がその呪われしVampyresの血を得ようとする為に、Tenebrous Mt.に行くことを知っている。<br>
            彼は非常に勇敢なGnomeだが、甘くみている。<br>
            彼は呪われた者の攻撃によって感染した兄弟を治すための薬をZimloroが作れるように手助けしている。<br>
            彼の家族が彼のことを非常に心配しているので、早く戻ってこれるように［彼に手を貸しなさい］。<br>
            <br>
            <b>&gt;I will lend him a hand</b><br>
            <br>
            That is very nice of you Xxxxx.<br>
            Im sure his family will be very greatful.<br>
            He should not be there alone and we fear the worst for him.<br>
            If you are to go search for him please take him this note from Zimloro that contains further 
            instructions Please seek him out and do your best to convince him to come home. <br>
            <br>
            素晴らしい。<br>
            彼の家族が非常に心配しています。<br>
            彼は一人であそこに行くべきではなかった。我々は彼の身の上に最悪の事が起きることを恐れています。<br>
            もしあなたが彼を捜しに行くなら、どうか彼にすぐ家に帰って来るよう説得してください。<br>
            その為にも、Zimloroのこのメモが必要となるだろう。</p>

          Ah of course the antidote supplies I have been waiting for from Daksins. <br>
          I hope he is ok, we all told him it was not wise to go out to the cursed mountains alone. <br>
          I thank you for bringing me these supplies because Daksins was unable too. <br>
          There have been many reports lately of people receiving the disease carried by the beasts you 
          encountered. <br>
          Should you come across these extracts in the future bring them to me if you like. <br>
