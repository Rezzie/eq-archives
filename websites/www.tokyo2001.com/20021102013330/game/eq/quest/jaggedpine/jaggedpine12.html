          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Nolan Greenwood</b></p>
          <p>Nolan Greenwood gives a gentle nod to Xxxxx,</p>
          <p>'Greetings. I am Nolan Greenwood, warder of the Jaggedpine and retainer 
            of our [ancient ways]. The recent introduction of [outsiders] whose 
            faith and loyalties mimic our own toward The Rainkeeper has led to 
            the rebirth of a long lost excitement and use for my talents, thus 
            my presence here today. Usually, I would not be so easily found for 
            when presented with the choice, for I prefer the sanctuary of the 
            open forest to the confining walls of my room here at Fort Jaggedpine.'</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What ancient ways?</b></p>
          <p>As with any culture, my friend, there are countless established ways 
            of life, worship, law, and order.<br>
            It would be impossible for me to explain all of our ancient ways in 
            a single conversation -- and even more impossible would it be for 
            you to understand them.<br>
            You must experience and [accept them as your own] to fully understand.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I accept then as myself</b></p>
          <p>Nolan Greenwood raises a brow and gives a gentle, warm smile to Xxxxx's 
            declaration,</p>
          <p>'I see, and am very pleased to know that your interest has grown 
            and your heart is opened to know the path of The Rainkeeper.<br>
            As I retain the laws and order of nature that we of the Jaggedpine 
            have sworn ourselves to, I will be more than willing to give you what 
            words I can to guide you toward true discovery of what it means to 
            be of The Rainkeeper's service and pledge.<br>
            The rest shall be taught through your own experience in these [trials].'</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What trials?</b></p>
          <p>To show your devotion to the natural world and strengthen your abilities 
            to protect it, you must engage in a symbiotic relationship with nature.<br>
            As you give your devotion and one day your life to the natural world, 
            it will equally provide the [tools] that will aid you to execute the 
            duties and protection you have pledged to uphold.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What tools?</b></p>
          <p>Sustenance, shelter, and the necessities that we must have to survive 
            are all provided by the world that we must protect.<br>
            The wilderness will also lend its spiritual force to you, and it is 
            the fullest potential of that spiritual force that I can see you and 
            many other druids have yet to truly harness.<br>
            Do not think that we reave these things from nature -- for as I said, 
            our relationship must be mutual.<br>
            If you invest the time and prayer to [ask of her], she shall provide 
            the rest to these needs most willingly -- as a mother would her beloved 
            child.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;How do i ask of her</b></p>
          <p>These questions are not of the vocal expression, my friend.<br>
            To request nature's aid, you must go in-search of that aid.<br>
            In that search, you will provide unto her nothing less than a service 
            equal to what it is you seek.<br>
            My beloved daughter, Cheyloh, and [I shall guide you] through this 
            quest.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;How shall you guide me?</b></p>
          <p>I will give you the guidance of words and my knowledge of the details 
            pertaining to your tasks.<br>
            My experience and talents in the ways of making proper and the most 
            efficient use of that which nature will grant you in gratitude of 
            your service to her shall be at your disposal as necessary and appropriate.<br>
            The first of your tasks will be to acquire and return to me two items 
            -- [Silver Griffon Feathers] and a [Jade Studded Rawhide Tunic].''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is silver griffon feathers?</b></p>
          <p>There is a beast known as the Silver Griffon whom lurks in the darkest 
            of shadows cast by Luclin's light.<br>
            Although this creature was born of those that are natural, the Silver 
            Griffon himself is not.<br>
            Once a great and powerful creature of the Karana Plains, the beast 
            known as the Silver Griffon was killed and its spirit corrupted by 
            the priests of The Plaguebringer when their scourge was brought upon 
            those plains not too long past.<br>
            Put this creature to rest and from its ethereal wings, bring me its 
            silver feathers.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Jade Studded Rawhide Tunic?</b></p>
          <p>As the Qeynos faithful of The Rainkeeper have come to us, we have 
            sent some of our most adept brothers and sisters to them as an act 
            of good faith in hope that our ways would be exchanged.<br>
            One such adept is Jhaya Wyndrunner.<br>
            She, like myself, is a keeper of our ways -- a former apprentice of 
            mine, in fact, and a master in the arts of weaving.<br>
            Speak to her about the Jade Studded Rawhide Tunic and she will give 
            you further guidance on how you may acquire it.''</p>

            <b>&gt;What is pouch of polished jade stones?</b></p>
          <p>Our artisans of the Jaggedpine pride themselves on the beauty and 
            quality of their products.<br>
            The jade stone has become a sort of a symbol to those of us in the 
            Jaggedpine and it is used almost exclusively to decorate all of our 
            powerful tools.<br>
            Unfortunately, many others have found the potential of these stones 
            and have begun to reave them from us and our craftsman have been too 
            occupied with the recent events to make any great supply of these 
            items.<br>
            You must [find] one of the [stolen pouches].''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;How do i find stolen pouches</b></p>
          <p>With the creation of the passageway in Blackburrow to the Jaggedpine 
            Forest, many of the poachers that are native to Qeynos soil have secretly 
            made their way into our woodlands.<br>
            They maliciously destroy our beautiful and sacred beasts solely for 
            the purpose of monetary profit.<br>
            We were not prepared to encounter such individuals and these thieves 
            raided many of our establishments at Fort Jaggedpine.<br>
            The artisans were not spared these barbarous acts and many of our 
            precious stones were stolen.<br>
            I know the name of the one who may have these stones -- [Greshvoule].''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;Who is Greshvoule?</b></p>
          <p>Jhaya Wyndrunner glares at the mention of the name,</p>
          <p>'Greshvoule was one of many poachers to invade our forest after the 
            construction of the subterranean passageway.<br>
            He is a very cunning thief and a warrior not to be trifled with.<br>
            He. . . killed one of our artisans and a dear friend of mine, Callisa, 
            who specialized in the art of carving and polishing these jade stones.<br>
            One of the rangers native to the glade graced me with his favor and 
            found that the barbarian known as Greshvoule is hiding in Permafrost, 
            trying to escape proper justice for his crimes against the glade.<br>
            If you could find him and avenge the wrongs committed against my dear 
            friend and the glade, I would be eternally grateful.'</p>

          <p><b><i>(Jhaya Wyndrunner)</i></b><br>
            That is an item that you must forge with your own skills, my friend.<br>
            We of the Jaggedpine use the resources that nature allows us to the 
            fullest extent and it is our law that when we embrace nature's gifts, 
            that the one whom has gained those gifts must use their own hands 
            and work to earn that gift -- for she has granted it to you, and you 
            alone.<br>
            I can tell you [how to make the Black Rawhide Tunic] and perhaps make 
            this task a bit easier for one as new to our ways as yourself, my 
            friend.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;How to make the black rawhide tunic?</b></p>
          <p>To make the tunic, you will need to acquire the appropriate materials.<br>
            These materials are a [Cured Panther Hide] and [Wisps of Potameid 
            Hair].<br>
            These two items, if properly sewn together, will make the Black Rawhide 
            Tunic that you will need to further your task to Nolan. But be wary, 
            my friend.<br>
            The tailoring of this item is not for the inept of this skill.<br>
            You must master the thread and needle to be successful in sewing the 
            tunic.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Cured Panther Hide?</b></p>
          <p>The poachers that have invaded our forest are far from having any 
            mutual arrangement with the world they carelessly reave from.<br>
            One such poacher, Elishia Blackguard of the Blackguard family is known 
            to 'specialized' in furs.<br>
            She has been seen skinning the corpses of our forest panthers and 
            despite how despicable her actions are she truly is worthy of her 
            reputation.<br>
            Likely if you find her, you will find a Flawless Panther Hide. Once 
            you have retrieved the hide and the [gifts of the forest], take the 
            items to my brother, Lerian, who you will find here in the glade.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Gift of the forest?</b></p>
          <p>The great pines in our forest are a constant and generous source 
            of sap.<br>
            You can harvest this sap without harming the woodlands by foraging.<br>
            The second gift is the Dew of the Hatchling, which you shall also 
            find without turmoil as the forest will freely give it if you take 
            the time to seek it out.''</p>

            Lerian Wyndrunner studies the hide carefully -- using his eyes, fingertips,

            to the Jaggedpine forest.<br>
            Accepting the true identity of the hide, Lerian removes a small vial 
            of clear oil and smears it across the flawless midnight fur.<br>
            He then retrieves the seeds from the small pouch given to him by Xxxx,

            The seeds begin to sprout, growing at an unnatural pace from the nourishing

            The fern imbeds itself in a beautiful design upon the hide as they 
            grow -- their roots and the thin, delicate vines rendering the flora 
            secure in its place.</p>
          <p>Lerian then offers the hide to Xxxx, 'You will need to seek out one
