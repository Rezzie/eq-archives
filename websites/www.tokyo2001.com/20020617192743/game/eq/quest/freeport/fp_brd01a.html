          <p><b>&gt;Hail Sten Harnak</b></p>
          <p>Greetings to you Xxxxx.<br>
            I am Sten Harnak Virtuoso of Freeport.<br>
            I have lived in Freeport and studied the art of songweaving here for 
            all of my days.<br>
            I am always eager to see new faces here in our concert hall.<br>
            If you are here for a performance I am afraid it does not start till 
            a bit later but if you are a young bard in training then I might have 
            some [work] for you.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What work?</b></p>
          <p>Well I have numerous concerts here that I must prepare for so I always 
            must be sure that I have the best possible support as far as my fellow 
            bards go.<br>
            I am always seeking new young talent to sing in our concerts.<br>
            If you are a bard I have made tasks for you to complete to see if 
            you are a worthy songweaver.<br>
            These tasks will test your determination and battle skills.<br>
            I would only allow one that has completed all of my [specific tests] 
            to sing in my concert hall.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What specific tests?</b></p>
          <p>If you are ready to begin your training I will assign you a number 
            of tests.<br>
            These tests will enable you to outfit yourself with a suit of armor 
            only worn by the most respected musicians of Freeport.<br>
            First, I will present you with a Songweavers Assembly Kit.<br>
            In this kit you will combine certain [recipes] that will be magically 
            formed into an armor material.<br>
            Each one of these materials will need to be combined in a forge with 
            the appropriate mold to make your armor piece.</p>

          <p><b>&gt;What recipes?</b></p>
          <p>I have the material recipes available for Songweavers Platemail [Helms], 
            [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].<br>
            When you are ready to craft a specific piece simply tell me what armor 
            piece you [want] to craft.<br>
            For example if you would wish to craft a helm tell me “I want to craft 
            a helm”.<br>
            Also please keep in mind that the components necessary for crafting 
            your breastplate material are the most difficult to collect so you 
            might want to collect them last.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I want to craft a helm</b></p>
          <p>A very important armor piece indeed Xxxxx, one well placed attack 
            to the head by an adversary could leave you in very poor condition.<br>
            To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of 
            Crude Iron Ore, 1 Ruined Wolf Pelt, 1 Deathfist Pawn Scalp and 1 Barley 
            in your assembly kit.<br>
            Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along 
            with this mold to fashion your very own Songweavers Platemail Helm.</p>
