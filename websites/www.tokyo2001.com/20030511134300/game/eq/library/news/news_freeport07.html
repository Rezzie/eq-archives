        <p>Qeynos' famed "Priests of Life" have finally come up with a tangible reason to believe that the foul stench hanging like a pall in the Karanas may someday end.<br> 
        It seems some "innocent farmer" had cleverly found a way to grow a healthy crop in the midst of all the decay - he aided the villains responsible.<br> 
        Upon investigating a plot of land seerningly untouched by the disease spreading over every formerly fertile inch of soil throughout the land , the keen investigative minds of Qeynos deduced that something was amiss.<br> 
        The man in question was found to have buried a magic idol of some sort in the grounds outside his home.<br> 
        After studying this relic , the priests of life are "confident" that they have devised a way to end the plague.<br> 
        A "smudging ceremony" will take place.<br> 
        The smoke will then "react violently against the impure elements."<br> 
        Reacting violently has yet to be adequately described , but suffice it to say , I will be staying home that night...</p>

    A band of adventurers claiming to represent the interests of famed Erudite wizard Al'Kabor met with some of the nomadic gypsies of East karana.<br> 
    As is always the case with Al'Kabor , little is actually known of the true intent behind the meeting.<br> 
    What we do know is that , to get that which they desired , the gypsy calling herself Tarevla Nimellin bartered with these messengers for the extermination of Lorrk the Insane , an evil eye that was rampaging the area after being set free by one of her own people.<br> 
    A very old looking chest changed hands between the adventurers and the gypsy.<br> 
 The claim was that it was a Combine era relic for Al'Kabor's research.<br> 
    This remains unconfirmed , along with what research is being done.
