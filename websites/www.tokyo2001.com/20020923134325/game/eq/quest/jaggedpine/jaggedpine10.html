          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Lady Deira</b></p>
          <p>Lady Deira closes her eyes and gives a formal, polite bow to Shiden,</p>
          <p>'I am Lady Deira, Veteran of Thunder and one of several ambassadors 
            to the Jaggedpine from Qeynos.<br>
            It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, although I fear that I 
            am not one for words or company at the moment.<br>
            I have [duties] to uphold and must give the fullest of my attentions 
            to the fort.</p>
          <p><br>
            <b>&gt;What duties?</b></p>
          <p>When his majesty, Antonious IV, ordered the removal of the barricades 
            that had separated the Jaggedpine forest from the rest of the Qeynos 
            lands, the council of Qeynos hand-picked several ambassadors to venture 
            to the forest and provide the proper support of both military needs 
            and social reconstruction purposes.<br>
            I was sent to aid in fortifying the military front to ward off the 
            attacks of the gnolls and any other intruders that might climb through 
            the gnolls' burrow.<br>
            It has proven to be a very trying task as the gnolls are quite persistent 
            in their attacks of Fort Jaggedpine and the fort's residents are rather. 
            . . [lost] in the ways of modern warfare.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;How was it lost?</b></p>
          <p>I do not mean to insult either their integrity nor their abilities, 
            it is merely that they have been cut off from us for so long and have 
            never had the chance to benefit from the experiences of the passing 
            times.<br>
            Granted, much unfortunate turmoil and darkness has enshrouded our 
            world and they were sparred the suffering of Norrath for some time, 
            but the lessons learned have been denied to them.<br>
            They are capable scouts and unrivaled artisans who hold tradition 
            in a sense of honor that is to be commended and respected, but they 
            know little about war or defense.<br>
            Their existence has been peaceful -- nearly tranquil in comparison 
            and they struggle now.<br>
            However, this does not mean that there is no hope to maintain the 
            precious balance they have established and upheld since before the 
            construction of the great cities of Norrath, nor does it mean that 
            they are incapable; merely [undisciplined].'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;How are they undisciplined?</b></p>
          <p>Again, I do not speak out against the abilities that they do have 
            -- they are able warders of nature and I do not underestimate the 
            cunning of their scouts.<br>
            It is when the obstacle is unknown that they find themselves without 
            the knowledge to appropriately defend, nor are they trained to handle 
            an onslaught of attacks that has been so generously afforded in the 
            recent days.<br>
            My duties are not only to aid in the protection of the fort and the 
            people of the Jaggedpine, but I am also here to train their citizens 
            in the manner of defense and offense of battle.<br>
            They have been most receptive to my coming and have shown much interest 
            in what lessons I have been able to offer thus far and in return, 
            they have been most gracious in their hospitality and shared [secrets] 
            of our mutual faith.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What secrets?</b></p>
          <p>The people of Fort Jaggedpine are master artisans and their faith 
            to The Rainkeeper is pure -- having been spared the change of the 
            modern eras.<br>
            Their ancient ways are some of the very precious and priceless jewels 
            that we strive to protect in our presence here; but shields and steel 
            can do only so much to protect and assure that this ancient culture 
            survives.<br>
            It must be passed on from generation to generation and faithful to 
            faithful.<br>
            I, like all of my fellow ambassadors from Qeynos, am devoted in spirituality 
            to The Rainkeeper and thus the keepers of the ancient ways have been 
            well received to our presence and inquiries.<br>
            I recently have been taught the ancient secrets of their blacksmiths 
            -- secrets that until recently held little to [no place] in the recent 
            culture of the Jaggedpine.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;Why do they hold no place?</b></p>
          <p>When the Jaggedpine forest was ordered to be sealed, only those who 
            were directly connected with the natural world in their profession 
            were allowed to remain in the forest's confines.<br>
            This was a decision made not out of prejudice, but out of a fundamental 
            necessity to maintain the bare minimum that was thought needed to 
            preserve that which they sought to spare from the approaching corruption 
            of the time.<br>
            The warriors, knights, rogues, and the minority of the arcane scientists 
            loyal to The Rainkeeper and the philosophy guarded by his faithful 
            were warmly and hospitably accepted into the already existing guildhalls 
            of the Qeynos city proper. However, the traditions of these minority 
            professions dedicated to the philosophies and culture of The Rainkeeper 
            did not die -- they merely faded for a while.<br>
            But they are very much [alive once again].'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;How are they alive once again?</b></p>
          <p>With the reunion of the Jaggedpine forest with its sister, the Surefall 
            Glade and reinstatement into the kingdom of Qeynos, the old ways of 
            the minority followers have resurfaced.<br>
            As I am a warrior whom has been dedicated to The Rainkeeper since 
            I first took up the blade, I have been given the honor of being introduced 
            and tutored in the [ways of my ancestors].'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What are the ways of the ancestors?</b></p>
          <p>There are several rites that the Veterans of the Storm, the title 
            bestowed to the warriors and knights loyal to The Rainkeeper, perform 
            to place themselves among the ranks of The Rainkeeper's faithful.<br>
            Unfortunately, this time of turmoil has kept much of these rites from 
            being properly resurrected and performed, although they are not forgotten 
            and the intentions to introduce them once again to the faithful remain 
            strong still.<br>
            However, there is one practice that the artisans and elders of Fort 
            Jaggedpine have been able to relay to me.<br>
            They are very traditional by nature and wished to reunite their distant 
            brethren not only with the forest but also with the ways of their 
            ancestors before them, so they invited me to learn the rites of the 
            [Tempest Guard] and wield our ancient symbol.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;Who is the tempest guard?</b></p>
          <p>The Tempest Guard is a title bestowed among the most devout and capable 
            of the Storm's Veterans.<br>
            I do not say this in boast or overconfidence, mind you.<br>
            I walked the tremulous path and strove to earn this ancient and sacred 
            place among my kin.<br>
            Now, I am one of few to hold the title, for true warriors and knights 
            dedicated to The Rainkeeper are rare and finding those whose hearts 
            are truly set upon the path of storms are rarer yet.<br>
            As I exist as a bearer of this rank, I am also one of the mentors 
            that guide it.<br>
            If a veteran of the storm views themselves as [worthy to bear the 
            Tempest Guard symbol], then I shall be the one that tests the validity 
            of their views.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am worthy to bear the tempest guard symbol</b></p>
          <p>Very well and it is now that we shall begin.<br>
            As with all things of the Jaggedpine and the ancient ways, you must 
            endeavor on your own accord and initiative to achieve recognition 
            among the ranks of this society.<br>
            I shall give you the guidance toward the path, but you must willingly 
            walk it -- and you must do so in facing many great dangers.<br>
            The first steps that you must take are ones of material acquisition, 
            or on a more fine of point, you must obtain the [items] that will 
            be constructed into your symbol, should you prove worthy of it in 
            the end.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What items?</b></p>
          <p>You will be sent, as your first task, to retrieve two items that 
            will be critical to the fulfillment and possible success of your trial.<br>
            The Earthen Crown of the Underfoot, the first of the two items you 
            must obtain, resides in the depths of The Hole.<br>
            One named Tzitzi the Crazed holds the crown.<br>
            Beware him, for although his madness is consuming, his cunning and 
            wile are not to be underestimated.<br>
            The second item that you must return to me with the crown is [Nyrein's 
            Tome], which is rumored to exist in the depths of Kedge Keep.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Nyrein's tome?</b></p>
          <p>'When great cities were still in the dawn of their conception, Nyrein 
            Shadowstorm was the first to bear the title of Tempest Guard.<br>
            She was an able warrior who had defended her homeland of the Jaggedpine 
            time and time again -- warding away the bestial foes of the Unkempt 
            Wood and slaying the would-be raiders of the other nomadic tribes 
            that sought to reave the precious forest for their own.<br>
            It is said that the spirit of Karana himself blessed her -- guised 
            in the form of a raging tempest that accompanied her through the campaign 
            that would secure the Jaggedpine for our ancestors.<br>
            It was then that she was bestowed the name of Tempest Guard and the 
            circle of the Veterans of the Storm was set in-place.<br>
            In her final campaign centuries past, she fell beneath the spell of 
            the Kedge.<br>
            What resides of her there is but a hollow shell -- the true Nyrein 
            ascended into the Eye of Karana's Storm long ago and her physical 
            essence is sadly but a tormented servant of the deep.''</p>

        <td class="log"><b>&gt;What is tempest rune ? </b> 
          <p>Long before the order of the Veterans of the Storm had been established; 
            long before the Jaggedpine had been fully settled by our nomadic ancestors, 
            a brave young scout came upon a most powerful item by the grace of 
            an unlikely chance.<br>
            This item was a simple white stone, yet engraved upon it was a beautiful, 
            complex rune.<br>
            The young warrior found the item to be more beautiful than anything 
            he had seen before -- more beautiful than the lush forest; more beautiful 
            than even the great tempest that had recently scorched the earth of 
            his people's land.<br>
            The young warrior thought the rune to be a gift from the storm -- 
            from Karana himself.<br>
            He returned it to the elders of his tribe, who also found the great 
            beauty of this simple white stone to be divine. The young warrior 
            was [entrusted with the stone] while the elders and early artisans 
            introduced the design into their cultural and spiritual works.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;Why was he entrusted with the stone ?</b></p>
          <p>Our ancestors were not selfish people and although the stone's beauty 
            overwhelmed them with an unspeakable spiritual purity, they knew that 
            it had not fallen into this warrior's hand by simple chance.<br>
            They felt that the great god of the storms had wished for the stone 
            to fall into this young man's possession, and so they respectfully 
            obliged what they interpreted to be their deity's will.<br>
            As time passed and the completion of Karana's Shrine was near, the 
            elders called upon the then able warrior to attend the final ceremony 
            of the shrine's completion.<br>
            It was then that the warrior knew the stone's purpose and as the storm 
            was captured into the very rock of the shrine, he placed the stone 
            upon one of the branches of the sacred tree that the shrine was built 
            around.<br>
            The lightening from the final moments of the storm was absorbed into 
            the rune.<br>
            Eventually, this rune would become a sacred symbol for all who pledge 
            their blades to The Rainkeeper.<br>
            However, [history] would weave a new turn to that tale.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What history?</b></p>
          <p>'When Antonious III ordered the sealing of the Jaggedpine Forest, 
            Anumnan Dathry, then a Tempest Guard, was one of many who understood 
            the need and supported the decision.<br>
            The years passed and Anumnan grew old, putting aside his sword for 
            the life of a priest.<br>
            He would see his only heir would rise to hold the honor of Tempest 
            Guard, however, his son would betray the Knights of Thunder.<br>
            In this knight's eyes, the betrayal was not one performed out of malice; 
            on the contrary, he felt that his slaying of the order's then senior 
            knight was an act of pure devotion, for it was his thought that his 
            superior had fallen into the clutches of a venomous shadow that lurks 
            even now in the depths of Qeynos.<br>
            It was thought that Anumnan's son had been manipulated by this evil 
            and the slaughter of the knight was one orchestrated by the shadow 
            he sought to purge.<br>
            Anumnan then faced the gravest [decision] that any father and devoted 
            priest fears.''' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What decision?</b></p>
          <p>Anumnan, a high priest of The Rainkeeper and confidant of the Veteran 
            order, was asked to aid in the judgment to be passed onto his only 
            living heir, as it was his duty to his order and deity.<br>
            As a priest, he knew what he had to do -- as a father, he fell into 
            the clutches of a silent suffering that viscously wove anger, regret, 
            pity, and undying love.<br>
            It was his duty to aid the Council of the Storm in this decision and 
            in the end, he agreed with the council to execute the fallen knight.<br>
            The night his son's body was respectfully laid to final rest within 
            the sacred temple of The Rainkeeper, Anumnan was confronted with a 
            [truth] that would change him forever and set him on a pitiable path 
            of insanity.'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What truth?</b></p>
          <p>As Anumnan paid his respects to his lost child in solitude and peace, 
            a cloaked woman approached him.<br>
            Callously, she held the aged priest to the envenomed point of her 
            dagger and forced him to imbibe her tale.<br>
            It was then that she revealed to Anumnan the truth -- the truth that 
            his son's accusations and actions were not only correct and justified, 
            but they had saved the entire order from complete corruption within 
            the infectious shadow.<br>
            She would reveal to Anumnan the name of the one who had betrayed his 
            son and the order; the name of the one who had worked beside the corrupted 
            knight and originally painted his son as their scapegoat.<br>
            Before Anumnan could question the woman, she disappeared back into 
            the darkness that had delivered her and this fateful news, leaving 
            him alone in his consuming [doubt].'' </p>
          <p><b>&gt;What doubt?</b></p>
          <p>Anumnan carried with him the entirety of doubt -- for he doubted 
            everything now.<br>
            He doubted the woman and her tale, he doubted her motives that in 
            his mind were countless, he doubted himself, and he doubted his sacred 
            order and faith.<br>
            This doubt would eventually drive Anumnan mad and two years later, 
            lead his hand to slay the one who bore the name the woman had uttered 
            to him upon his son's grave.<br>
            Out of respect for Anumnan, his son, and the order, we speak neither 
            the name of our martyred brother nor that of the villain who had come 
            so close to the Knights of Thunder's ruin.<br>
            It is said that the crazed Anumnan hired several rogues to execute 
            every ranking member of the Veterans of the Storm and return to him 
            as proof of their demise the single, sacred rune that they wore about 
            their necks.<br>
            You see, Shiden, Anumnan originally sought council with his closest 
            of allies within the order when he began to doubt, but their ears 
            [would not have his tale].''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;Why they would not have his tale?</b></p>
          <p>The order knew of Anumnan's grief and was saddened by the priest's 
            sudden confusion, doubt, and questions.<br>
            They kept his confidence well, however, and did not speak beyond their 
            own circle of Anumnan's account of the rogue, but his madness would 
            twist his allies' compassion into callous ignorance.<br>
            Anumnan grew to believe that the corruption the rogue had spoken unto 
            him had already seeped into the order and he began to nurture a festering 
            lust for vengeance.<br>
            Anumnan was never caught by Qeynos, but it is said that he sought 
            refuge within the city of Freeport.<br>
            Our intelligence was only able to find the remnants of Anumnan's tale 
            reduced to that of a pitiable madman who dwells in the southern desert 
            of Ro.<br>
            Seek Anumnan and return him to the Eye of Karana's Storm that his 
            caged spirit has sought for so long.<br>
            Anumnan will also carry the rune that you seek, for as he destroyed 
            the others, including his own, he still wears the one that had once 
            belonged to his departed son.'' </p>

          I have forged the necessary Hollowed Tempest Stone -- yes, young warrior, 
          I am indeed one well versed in the ways of the Tempest Guard for at 
          one time I myself held such a rank in a time before the closing of the 
          Jaggedpine.<br>
          Aaaah, but enough reminiscing for one day -- your trial is the matter 
          at hand.<br>
          Within the Hollowed Tempest Stone you must combine the Essence of the 
          Tempest Guard, which you will find only through great peril.<br>
          The Tempest Reaver, who resides in the realm of Cazic-Thule himself,

          <p>Nyrein Shadowstorm spent much of her life defending the Jaggedpine 
            from within its confines.<br>
            However, duty would sometimes deem that she trek beyond the forest 
            to assure its protection.<br>
            In the peek years of her life, she spent much time wandering the whole 
            of Norrath in pursuit of one villain that had betrayed the entire 
            order.<br>
            We are not certain why or how this one, who at one time was Nyrein's 
            most trusted of companions and second to only her within the order, 
            fell to the temptations and corruption of The Faceless -- but we do 
            know that Nyrein defeated him on the battlefield.<br>
            He fled to the Plane of Fear and with him went the very essence of 
            the Tempest Guard that remains caged within his corrupted, violent 
            spirit.<br>
            Find the Tempest Reaver and retrieve the Essence of the Tempest Guard, 
            which you must then seal within the Hollowed Tempest Stone to create 
            the Tempest Guard's Stone.<br>
            Once you have this sacred stone, return it to Lady Deira.''</p>
