    Humans may have found a resolution to their little problem in the Karanas.<br> 
    The priests from the Temple of Life have gathered documentation of extensive tests and investigations and analyzed the results.<br> 
    <br> 
    An idol from a farmer who had joined up with the Bloodsabers in an act of self-preservation was the key for the priest of Rodcet Nife in discovering the process of smudging the Karanas.<br> 
    <br> 
    Our own priestes have stated thatthe solution was obvious and should have been discovered long ago.<br> 
    However, it has always been evident that the humans are a tad slow at researching such things.

        A more amusing note to this is the fact that same of scholars in Qeynos have offered to assist him with his research.<br>

        While he is not the most brilliant being on Norrath, even he could not possibly want the idiotic scientist of Qeynos who took an enormous amount of time in discovering a solution to the end of the plague that has been killing them for such a long time.
