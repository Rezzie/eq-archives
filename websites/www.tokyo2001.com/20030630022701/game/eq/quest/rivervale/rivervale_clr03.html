          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Thekela Meepup</b></p>
          <p>It is a pleasure to meet you Xxxxx.<br>
            I am Thekela Meepup, one of the highest ranking Clerics in all of 
            Rivervale.<br>
            I pride myself on being the mentor for all of the furryfooted that 
            are called upon by Bristlebane to give life.<br>
            If you are a [Cleric] I might have some training for you to complete 
            if you so wish.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am a Cleric</b></p>
          <p>Xxxxx the Templar.<br>
            Well I suppose that does have quite a nice ring to it don't you say?<br>
            If you stick with your training perhaps this could be what you are 
            referred to one day.<br>
            Before that day though, you have a lot to learn and a lot of training 
            ahead of you!<br>
            Do you want to [begin your training] at this time?</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I want to begin my training</b></p>
          <p>Excellent! I will give you a variety of items to collect and combine 
            in this magical assembly kit to create a material that you will use 
            to craft armor.<br>
            My hope is that as you gather these items you will learn about your 
            home and how to navigate around the surrounding areas of the Vale.<br>
            If you are ready to begin your adventure I will present you with your 
            Magical Mail Assembly Kit and the instructions for collecting the 
            necessary items to craft your armor.<br>
            Are you [ready to receive your Magical Mail Assembly Kit]?</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am ready to receive my Magical Mail Assembly Kit</b></p>
          <p>Here you are Xxxxx.<br>
            Take this mail assembly kit, it is what you will use to combine the 
            different items necessary to craft your own Platemail of the Stoutdeacon.<br>
            Different combinations of items will be required from both our town 
            and the hunting grounds in the thicket to create materials for specific 
            armor pieces with Crude Iron Ore being the basis for all of your armor 
            materials.<br>
            When you are ready to receive a recipe for a specific material simply 
            tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft.<br>
            I will then supply you with the mold and recipe for Stoutdeacon Platemail 
            [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gloves] and 
            [Breastplates].</p>

          <p>Well boots would be quite a good idea if I do say so myself Xxxxx, 
            for certain situations only though!<br>
            You should be proud of your feet and all the lovely hairs that they 
            have been blessed with by Bristlebane!<br>
            However if you wish to create a material that you will use along with 
            this mold to create your boots you will need 2 Bricks of Crude Iron 
            Ore, 2 Dark Elf Skins, 2 Bixie Wings and 1 Rat Foot.</p>
