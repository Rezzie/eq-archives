          <br>
          Greetings to you.<br>
          I seek one whot has chosen the path of monkhood.<br>
          What do you call yourself?&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>>I am a monk.<br>
          </b><br>
          Good. I had hoped you were one.<br>
          As seeker of the way you are in constant training to push yourself to 
          your physical and mental limits.<br>
          It is an admirable quality and I wish to aid you.<br>
          I will provide you with a cap, a tunic, sleeves, bracers, gloves, leggings 
          and boots.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>>What cap?</b><br>
          <br>
          I shall weave one of exceptional quality for you but you must gather 
          the items first.<br>
          I require an ancient leather cap and a set of three pieces of crushed 
          coral.&nbsp; 
          <p><b>>What tunic?<br>
            </b><br>
            You shall be an imposing force with this tunic.<br>
            Solid as the unmoving mountains, it shall protect you.<br>
            Once I have gained an ancient leather tunic and three flawless diamonds, 
            the item is yours.</p>
          <p><b>>What sleeves?</b><br>
            <br>
            As the mighty stone that parts the flow of water, so shall these sleeves 
            divert harm against you.<br>
            Bring me three flawed emeralds and a pair of ancient leather sleeves.</p>
          <p><b>>What bracer?</b><br>
            <br>
            For a bracer I shall require an ancient leather bracelet and a set 
            of three crushed flame emeralds.<br>
            Do this and the reward shall be yours to keep.</p>
          <p><b>>What gloves?</b><br>
            <br>
            Your hands are like the wind, everflowing and moving.<br>
            Subtle one moment, then a howling wind raining blow upon blow to your 
            foes.<br>
            These gloves shall aid you.<br>
            In order to complete them I require a pair of ancient leather gloves 
            and three crushed topazes.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>>What leggings?</b><br>
            <br>
            The leggings shall protect you, as the valley shelters the still pool 
            within its center from the howling winds.<br>
            Furnish a pair of ancient leather leggings and a set of three flawed 
            sea sapphires for me and they are yours.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <b>>What boots?</b><br>
            <br>
            Your feet are hard as any stone and as swift as a coiled serpent but 
            even the swiftest feet require protection so I shall provide you with 
            these.<br>
            They should help.<br>
            Acquire a pair of ancient tarnished boots and three crushed pieces 
            of black marble.</p>
