        <p>So far all attempts to stop the disdainful child of hate Lanys T'Vyl have failed.<br> 
        Although Dorvias N'Keth , the Archpriest of Innoruuk and advisor to King Naythox Thex, had learned the location of the second piece of the Malevorance.<br> 
        Lanys could not be stopped at obtaining it.<br> 
        <br> 
        With little worry of the Crimson Triad's continuing efforts to sacrifice her, she and her followers reached Skyfire Montains ahead of the King's armies and other enemies.<br> 
        <br> 
        Lanys and Lord Kazira , keeper of the arm , engaged in a lengthy conversation regarding the staff.<br> 
        Not heeding a warning from Lord Kazira, Lanys rallied her followers destroyed the dragon.<br> 
        <br> 
        Dorvias then approached and warned her of the dangers of obtaining all pieces of the artifact it self.<br> 
        Lanys fought in an even battle with the archpriest.<br> 
        Lanys called foward her followers to destroy Dorvias.<br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Dorvias gave Lanys a warning of her sacrifice being inevitable and gated away to report back to the King.<br> 
        <br> 
        With two pieces of the great artifact, Malevorance, in hand, lanys returned to her ceased fortress of Befallen to continue to build her forces and rally her allies.<br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Showing the powers that she holds, Lanys and her followers destroyed the King's soldiers that were building up forces in the Commonlands.<br> 
        She then sent her followers to deliver an ornate amulet that she found amongst the rumble of the slain forces to the Queen's emissary.<br> 
        <br> 
        <br> 
        Before reaching the emissary, Ashteth T'Dral met up with Lanys followers and informed them that the Queen was waiting for their arrival and told them to meet up with her in Neriak.<br> 
        <br> 
        Once in Neriak, after finding out about the murders and Lanys' continued defiance, Queen Cristanos Thex warned the followers of Lanys that any Teir'Dar who is cought activity showing their loyalty toward Lanys will be branded a traitors.</p>
