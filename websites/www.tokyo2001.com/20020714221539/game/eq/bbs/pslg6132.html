No proper tale would begin anywhere other than the <BR>beginning! You see, good Halfling, I was once a humble rog. . . <BR>merchant within this here fair city. Oh, how the Jumjum and gol. . . <BR>merchandise flowed in then! Quite lovely, indeed, it was.

Upon one of my several adventures through this <BR>great, glorious land of Norrath, I did stumble upon a [lovely <BR>treasure], indeed! Great skill and cunning was used, skill that <BR>belonged only to Bidils the Quickhand, and has yet to be surpassed <BR>within this realm!'' <BR><BR>You say, 'what is lovely treasure ?'<BR>Bidils the Quickhand says 'A lovely gem, far more beautiful than even <BR>the most delicate and fury feet of a halfling lass! It was larger than <BR>my face, and sparkled more than the most pure of Jumjum catching the <BR>rays of Karana's blessed skies! Indeed, it was a divine treasure to <BR>behold. . . but little then did I know that such a treasure truly <BR>belonged to the King of Thieves. . . and merchants himself!

Right from beneath the arms of Bristlebane himself did I take it! <BR>That was when he noticed me. . . and that is when I was taken from the <BR>humble life of a merchant and placed within the glorious [realm of <BR>heroes]! Of course. . . Bristlebane took back the gem. What a shame. <BR>Indeed, quite so.
