        A few days ago , a royal herald was heard summonin' the appearance of Thubr Axebringer , one of king Kazon's most trusted ambassadors.<br> 
        The king ordered the warrior t' travel o'er to Velious to explore the lands an' deliver a gesture of good-will t'ward the coldain, the race of ice dwarves that inhabit the city of Thurgadin.<br> 
        <br> 
        Upon reachin' Velious, Thubr was met by Harkin Iceale.<br> 
        In order to keep warm , Thubr drank some of his special ale and gave some to his escort.<br> 
        Unfortunately, the Harkin had consumed a lil bit too much and escorted the two off into the wrong direction.<br> 
        <br> 
        Findin' themselves in western Wastelands, where the dangers to dwarves and the like are great, Thubr and his new drinkin' partner was approached by several dragons.<br> 
        Good ole Thubr is always prepared for fight , but his escort t'was not.<br> 
        The great dragon Yeldema quckly grabbed Harkin an' swallowed im whole.<br> 
        <br> 
        Thubr was able to escape an' git help from adventures nearby to stay the beastie.<br> 
        Thubr and the other stayed to slay the remainin' members of this deadly dragon contraband.<br> 
        He said he was proud to fight along side such brave fighters .<br> 
        A bit parched from the adventure , Thubr dished out 'is darkened ale to all those that assisted.

        <p>There's still some uproar in the Qeynos area.<br> 
        Apparently Anronius Bayle ordered the interrogation of anyone that might remotely have information about the plague.<br> 
        <br> 
        When we asked one of our citizens that recently came from that area , he replied with "Hehe ... i dinnar kno' why they be worried about the food. A good supply of ale can keep ye alive and kickin' for a long time."</p>
