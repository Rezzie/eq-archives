          <p><b>&gt;Hail, High Priestess Alexandrian<br>
            </b><br>
            Greetings child, what business do you have here?<br>
            I'm sorry but I will only deal with Clerics that are willing to prove 
            their loyalty to Innoruuk.<br>
            I cannot deal with every single heathen that feels it is necessary 
            to bid me a good day.<br>
            If you are a [Cleric of Innoruuk] I might be able to aid you in your 
            training. '<br>
            <br>
            <b>&gt;I am a Cleric of Innoruuk</b><br>
            <br>
            Is that so Xxxxx.<br>
            Well from the looks of you I wouldn?t say you are much of anything 
            yet.<br>
            However, if you have the willingness and determination to serve your 
            God then there might just be more hope for you then I would have thought.<br>
            Obviously, to move forward in your training, you will need to shield 
            yourself from your enemies and from the elements.<br>
            I believe I have something that could help you if you are still [interested 
            in proving yourself].<br>
            <br>
            <b>&gt;I am interested in proving myself<br>
            </b><br>
            Well I must say that I am impressed by your eagerness to learn, however, 
            you are not the first and will not be the last I am sure that has 
            sworn devotion to our Lord Innoruuk.<br>
            Lets just hope you don't end up in the burial grounds where many promising 
            young ones before you have found their resting place.<br>
            If you are ready to begin gathering items to fashion your very own 
            Initiate Darkpriest Armor then I will present you with a [magical 
            relic].<br>
            <br>
            <b>&gt;What magical relic?<br>
            </b><br>
            I have a box that I have been keeping for quite some time and have 
            been waiting to present it to someone like yourself.<br>
            Someone that I had faith would be strong enough to use it's power 
            to their benefit.<br>
            This magical box can be used to refine certain metals into a magical 
            compound that is used in crafting Initiate Darkpriest armor pieces.<br>
            I have the molds necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest [Helms], [Bracers], 
            [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].<br>
            However there are some [important items] that you will need to collect 
            before the molds will be of any use to you.<br>
            One thing to keep in mind is that I suggest you craft your Breastplate 
            last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items needed for that 
            specific recipe.</p>

          </b><br>
          So, the time has come for you to gather the items necessary for your 
          most important piece of Armor Xxxxx.<br>
          You will need to combine 5 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 Deathfist Templar 
          Scalp, 1 Embalming Dust, 1 Matted Halfling Hide, 1 Woven Grass Amulet 
          and 1 Halfling Skull.<br>
          Once you have prepared this final Refined sheet of Holy Metal place 
          it in a forge along with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's 
          Breastplate.<br>
          After you have done this return to me when you are ready for your final 
          test of loyalty. </td>
