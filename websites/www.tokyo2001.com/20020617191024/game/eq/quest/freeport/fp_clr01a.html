          <p><b>&gt;Hail Salinsa Delfdosan</b></p>
          <p>Pleasure to meet you Xxxxx, I am Lady Salinsa Deifdosan of House 
            Marr.<br>
            I have spent many hours on the battlefield in service of our glorious 
            god however these days I spend my time training new [recruits].</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What recruits?</b></p>
          <p>Well you see sense I am such a well seasoned adventurer my knowledge 
            is very helpful to the young members of our house.<br>
            That is why I have developed a system of hunting and gathering assignments 
            that reward the new recruit with a set of armor that they work very 
            hard to craft themselves.<br>
            Are you a [young cleric of House Marr]?<br>
            If so I will be happy to offer my assignments to you.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am a young cleric of Marr</b></p>
          <p>Great! Let me first begin by explaining how you will be creating 
            your own armor.<br>
            You will use this magical kit I have presented you with to gather 
            numerous [recipe components].<br>
            Your magical kit will be used to gather specific materials that will 
            form together in certain numbers and quantities to create an armor 
            material.<br>
            You must then take the material you have fashioned to a forge along 
            with armor molds that I will supply you with to create your armor.</p>

        <td class="log"> 
          <p><b>&gt;What recipe components?</b></p>
          <p>There are many different items that you will need to collect for 
            your material components in all areas surrounding Freeport and our 
            temple.<br>
            I will be able to supply you with the mold for any armor piece you 
            [want] to craft.<br>
            I have the molds and recipes necessary for [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], 
            [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].<br>
            When you are ready to craft a piece simply tell me what piece you 
            would like to craft.<br>
            For example if you wanted to create boots you would say, “I want to 
            craft boots”.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I want to craft a helm</b></p>
          <p>Any cleric should always be very selective about what headpiece they 
            choose for it can mean the difference between life and death.<br>
            To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of 
            Crude Iron Ore, 1 Leaf Scarab Carapace , 1 Armadillo Tooth and 2 Fish 
            Scales in your assembly kit.<br>
            Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along 
            with this mold to fashion your very own Helm of the Ordained.</p>
