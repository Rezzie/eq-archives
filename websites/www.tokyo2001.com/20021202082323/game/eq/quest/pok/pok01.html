            This great, wondrous city holds a seemingly endless supply of knowledge 
            and power, attainable by all who walk our streets and seek it.<br>
            In an effort to accommodate the travelers, scholars, and heroes alike 
            that have ventured into our midst in this recent era, the citizens 
            of New Tanaan have individually offered their own unique knowledge 
            in almost every area significant to travelers of all professions.<br>
            As a former chemist and knowing that not all of Norrath's great minds 
            have the time or the patience to brew arcane potions, I have taken 
            the liberty to craft some from my memory.<br>
            Those that you will find in my inventory are the ones I felt would 
            best suit our visitors.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I have come for the elixir</b></p>
          <p>That poor lad, he's always catching ill this time of year.<br>
            Unfortunately I am out of the medicine he needs right now.<br>
            Perhaps if you could obtain the key ingredient I am missing, I could 
            brew up a batch for you to take to him.<br>
            I have heard Cador recently came into possession of some black lava 
            powder.<br>
            If you can convince him to give you some, bring it to me right away!</p>

            greetings,</p>
          <p>'Welcome to the district of Selia, traveler.<br>
            Here, you will find that the purity of light that fuels all goodly 
            mortal virtues thrives unobstructed here.<br>
            As the district of Tanaan is believed to be the cornerstone of true 
            mortal balance in the known universe, the district of Selia is that 
            of unobstructed, absolute purity of untainted passion, valor, honor, 
            and justice.<br>
            I sense within you a small shard of this light, though its purity 
            is corrupt by the grey of neutrality that guides your mortal destiny.<br>
            Do not be disheartened or fearful of a zealous preaching, my friend.<br>
            It is a mere observation -- one of hope that you may properly feed 
            that light in the future.<br>
            With this hope, the people of Selia extend a warm invitation to you 
            to learn of our ways through our guidance, should you wish it.'</p>
          <p><b>&gt;Do you have any black lava powder?</b></p>

            Certainly I have no use for it but what do I get in return?<br>
            I'll tell you.<br>
            Narik and I used to be good friends, until he became jealous of my 
            relationship with his former companion Elisha.<br>
            During our fight, he marched off with one of my finest jewels, and 
            I believe still has it.<br>

            This place of neutrality is quite content to have you among us, learning 
            from us what we humbly can teach you.<br>
            Many adepts who were adventurers not too different from yourself have 
            stepped forward and offered their memories as present lessons to those 
            willing to learn of them. I myself was a master of the elements in 
            my time, though I do not make this declaration as one that craves 
            due respect for the title.<br>
            Rather, I hope that you may perhaps be of the same path and if you 
            need tutoring in the way of skills, then I would be more than pleased 
            to oblige your needs.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I have come for the jewel</b></p>

          <p>'So, the snake has legs after all!<br>
            Tell Onirelin if he wants this back, he can come here himself and 
            kiss my. . ., no wait.<br>
            I have a better idea.'</p>
          <p>He draws closer and whispers,</p>
          <p>'Did Onirelin tell you why I took this jewel?<br>
            I did it in response to him taking my lady love, Elisha Dirtyshoes.<br>
            We were to be married until she ran off with him.<br>
            However, she also ran off with my engagement ring I gave to her.<br>
            It is quite valuable to me, and I would be most happy to have it back.<br>
            If you can procure it from her, I'll give Onirelin his jewel back.<br>
            He's suffered long enough, I think.'</p>

            not reciprocated.<br>
            Now I am left with no one to share my life, with only this ring as 
            a reminder.<br>
            Narik may have it back if he desires it, but then I shall be left 
            truly alone.<br>
