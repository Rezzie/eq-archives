        <p>Across Antonica, the plague in the Karanas is known to all.<br> 
        Well it appears that our sister city to the west has pointed an official finger.<br> 
        Qeynos has declared war on the Bloodsabers for their suspected involvement in the plague, but they need help.<br> 
        Well isn't it about time?<br> 
        <br> 
        The Bloodsabers have long been a scourge upon the land and the powers that be in Qeynos have been taken to task more that once for letting them run rampant in the west.<br> 
        Finally we learn the truth behind the inaction-they simply could not handle the problem.<br> 
        Now that their ineffectual policing has resulted in the start of famine-like conditions affecting all of Norrath,they seem at last spurred into action.<br> 
        With the help of hired "investigators," they are finally beginning to make their way slowly up the ladder of that secret society.<br> 
        It is this kind of thing that truly makes one appreciate living in Freeport under the watchful eye of the militia.<br> 
        I for one sleep easier at night knowing that such corruption and apathy could never threaten my home or my way of life.</p>

        <p>Reports are coming in from all around Norrath that famed wizard 
        Al'Kabor has a new project up his mystical sleeve.<br>
        The question is, what is the fallout going to be this time?<br>
        As always with the surly spellcaster,the problem is his unwillingness to 
        share information about what he is doing.<br>
        Last seen chipping away at a Wizard spire in the Dreadlands, we can only 
        assume?<br>
        does he intend to destroy the spires and use their remains so that only 
        he can teleport around Norrath?<br>
        Is he setting a trap for one of his many unsuspecting enemies?<br>
        Your guess is as good as mine,but rumors say that a former gnomish 
        apprentice of his has acquired some of his work.<br>
        Keep your eyes here for more details as they surface.</p>
