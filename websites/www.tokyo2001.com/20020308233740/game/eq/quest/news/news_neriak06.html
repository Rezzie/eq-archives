        <p>THe corpse of Lanys T'Vyl was stolen after it was brought to Neriak for the burial ceremony.<br> 
        The Queen had demanded that the ceremony take place out of respect for the forsaken child of hate.<br> 
        Dorvias N'Keth was to oversee the ceremony.<br> 
        <br> 
        Reports were sent to the archpriest that the three rogues, disguised as priests, that had committed this crime were members of the Primordial Malice, those that continue to remain loyal to Lanys even after death.<br> 
        <br> 
        Dorvias sent a rogue from the Ebon Mask to gather the information about the theft.<br> 
        The rogue, upon his death, sent messengers back to Dorvias with information regarding the forsaken's corpse.<br> 
        <br> 
        When Dorvias received the message, he immediately sent one who was proven to be loyal to Innoruuk to Befallen to retrieve the Ornate Ring that was on Lanys' corpse.<br> 
        Scout Ziana escorted this selected agent.<br> 
        <br> 
        Once in Befallen, the agent found the corpse guarded by Baron Telyx, once a devout Teir'Dal warrior of Innoruuk who fell to Lanys' favor.<br> 
        The agent had to use great intelligence in order to outwit him.<br> 
        <br> 
        Baron Telyx needed to be convinced of the agent's loyalty to Lanys.<br> 
        If the agent were discovered as a spy, the mission would have failed.<br> 
        <br> 
        After a painstaking effort, the agent finally convinced Baron to instill trust and turn over the ring.<br> 
        With the Ornate Ring in hand, Dorvias used it to summon Lanys' corpse back to Neriak so that the ceremony could be completed.<br> 
        <br> 
        Dorvias demanded that the agent hold the Idol of Innoruuk as further proof of loyalty.<br> 
        <br> 
        The Prince of Hate then appeared and called forward the loyal being and explained that for their loyalty they would carry the victory of Hate over their enemy by accepting the chosen duty.<br> 
        He granted the Coin of Malevolence and directed the chosen to Vorshar the Despised in order to obtain the Malevolence.</p>
