          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Shayna Thunderhand</b></p>
          <p>Shayna Thunderhand gives a soft smile and delicate motion with her 
            hand and bow of her head,</p>
          <p> 'Greetings, Xxxxx. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<br>
            I am Shayna Thunderhand -- sorceress of The Rainkeeper and one of 
            many ambassadors to the Jaggedpine.<br>
            The recent events have yielded quite an interesting turn in our [organization's] 
            duties -- and we are very excited to once again be reunited with our 
            brethren and homeland.'</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What organization?</b></p>
          <p>The Order of the Storm Caller is one whose roots are tied with the 
            foundation of Qeynos and it's establishments dedicated to the arcane 
            sciences.<br>
            When the Jaggedpine forest and it's culture and people were still 
            a part of the Qeynos kingdom, the wizards, magicians, and enchanters 
            of Qeynos invited those from the Jaggedpine to partake in their fledgling 
            studies.<br>
            Gladly, our ancestors did so and returned to the forest with their 
            newfound knowledge and passion in the art of the arcane. It was then 
            that our elders felt that a new order must be established -- the Order 
            of the Storm Callers.<br>
            As with all existing orders of The Rainkeeper, we had a [founding 
            member] -- one who made it possible for us to maintain our studies 
            and interweave it into our everlasting faith in Karana.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;Who is founding member?</b></p>
          <p>A wise and stoic woman by the name of Toliara Stormcaller was the 
            first of our ancestors to master the art of wizardry.<br>
            When she returned to the Jaggedpine with her newfound knowledge, the 
            elders were very intrigued.<br>
            She was asked to coordinate the efforts of all the Jaggedpine natives 
            that had taken an interest and shown their adept talents in the ways 
            of the arcane and form an opening ceremony to take place during the 
            winter solstice celebration.<br>
            Gladly and excitedly, she did so.<br>
            The magicians, wizards, and enchanters loyal to The Rainkeeper met 
            for several months, formulating [plans] and establishing [rituals] 
            that would usher their order into the collective goal and cause of 
            Karana's faithful.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What rituals and plans?</b></p>
          <p>The night before the sacred annual ritual and festival, the hierophant 
            of Karana passed into the great Eye of Karana's Storm.<br>
            A new hierophant was to be named at the ceremony sited at the Throne 
            of Karana's Thunder.<br>
            It is tradition that when a new hierophant is recognized, that the 
            elders of each artisan, spiritual, and military order present the 
            sacred item of their order that would then be wielded in the sacred 
            ceremony -- in this case, it was the winter solstice.<br>
            Toliara called upon her brothers and sisters of the arcane sciences 
            and together they forged an [item] of considerable power significant 
            to that which The Rainkeeper sacredly represents.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What item?</b></p>
          <p>The enchanters, who were also artisans highly skilled in the ways 
            of jewel craft and even blacksmithing, were asked to forge a golden 
            scepter with a hollow cradle at its peak.<br>
            The magicians then conjured the elemental essences of the storm -- 
            water and air and sealed them in an azure sphere that was created 
            from pure, enchanted elemental water.<br>
            Toliara and her fellow wizards would spend days researching and creating 
            a spell and rune of their own with which they would fulfill the purpose 
            of the item.<br>
            She etched the sacred runes upon the base of the scepter and sealed 
            the separate items into one whole.<br>
            Upon the dawn of the winter solstice, the fledgling order met at the 
            Shrine of Karana where they would then [firmly establish themselves] 
            among Karana's most faithful.''</p>
          <p><b>&gt;How firmly establish themselves?</b></p>
          <p>The new hierophant was named and it was he that would lead the opening 
            ceremonies of the solstice dawn.<br>
            Tradition dictates that the head of each of The Rainkeeper痴 order 
            would come forward, bearing their sacred item to the hierophant and 
            each in their own way, respectfully representing their order and its 
            foundation, aid the hierophant in the ceremony.<br>
            Toliara, representing the fledgling arcane order, was last to present 
            her order's item to the new hierophant -- whose curiosity was piqued 
            by the beautiful and most apparently powerful item.<br>
            The ceremony began and each item was used in the [conjuration of a 
            great storm].''</p>
