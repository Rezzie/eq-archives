        <p><b>&gt;Hail, Jalil Talih</b><br>
        <br>
        Oh, hello there Xxxxx.<br>
        Thank you for stopping by, but this is just not a very good time for 
        visitors.<br>
        My daughter is very upset over what has happened.<br>
        <br>
        こんにちは。<br>
        せっかっく訪れて来てくれたのですが、いま良くない事態が起きているのです。<br>
        私の娘はその事で非常に気が動転しています。<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What has happened?</b><br>
        <br>
        Jalil Talih looks up and says,<br>
        <br>
        'Oh my, I thought everyone had heard by now.<br>
        Behari has gone missing.<br>
        Been quite some time now, in fact.<br>
        Even the king had gotten involved in the search for him, but...'<br>
        <br>
        Jalil Talih lowers his voice to a whisper so as not to upset his 
        daughter,<br>
        <br>
        'everyone has about given up hope.<br>
        Soroush was the last we know of that had seen him, but he had very 
        little helpful information.'<br>
        <br>
        Jalil Talihは見上げ言う<br>
        <br>
        「おお私が聞いた所ではBehariが行方不明になったそうだ。<br>
        それも長きに渡って。<br>
        国王さえ彼の捜索に関係していた、しかし・・・。」<br>
        <br>
        彼の娘に聞かれないようにJalil Talihはささやく<br>
        <br>
        「皆はもう断念した。<br>
        Soroushは彼に会った最後の人だった。しかし彼は極めて少ししか情報をもっていなかった。」<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;Who is soroush?</b><br>
        <br>
        Soroush has taken over Behari's duties... temporarily, at least.<br>
        He can usually be found right in the throne room in case he is needed.<br>
        <br>
        SoroushはBehariの任務を引き継いだ・・・一時的に。<br>
        彼は必要とされる場合に備えて、いつも王の部屋に待機している。<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;Who is behari?<br>
        </b><br>
        He was a good lad with a very bright future, truly the picture of what a 
        father hopes for when his daughter starts to notice young men.</p>

        <br>
        'It is not easy for me to talk about, perhaps someday...<br>
        I began writing of us, thinking that it would help lift my sinking

        <br>
        As she speaks, she lazily flips through her diary where a story of true 
        love has been recorded.<br>
        <br>
        Kalila Talihは過去の楽しい日々を思い浮かべているかのようだ。<br>
        <br>
        「私は話をすることが簡単には出来ない・・・。<br>
        私はこの沈んだ気持ちを紛らわそうと思い日記を書き始めました。しかし私はそれさえ終えることができなかった。」<br>
        <br>
        彼女は話をしながら真実の愛の物語が記録された彼女の日記をぱらぱらとめくる。<br>

        It is a story I wish had a happy ending, but I do not have it in my 
        heart to create such a thing.<br>
        If you would like to read it, I suppose you may.<br>
        It is probably best that I try to distance myself from this experience,'<br>
        <br>
        she says half-heartedly.<br>
        <br>
        Kalila Talih は、一瞬の間、あなたを見つめる。<br>
        <br>
        「私は書き終えたとは思っていません。<br>
        なぜなら私は幸せな終末をと思っていたからです。しかしそういうわけにもいきませんでした。<br>
        もしあなたがそれを読みたいなら、そうしてもよいと考えます。<br>
        私はこの事件からしばらく距離をおく事が良いでしょう。」<br>
        <br>

        <p>Today I met a gentleman of the palace... Behari.<br>
        As his name implies, he travels often on palace business, to and from 
        Katta Castellum bearing messages of utmost importance to the King 
        himself.<br>
        This is a station that suits his charming demeanor- I am embarrassed to 
        admit that within moments he could have convinced me of nearly anything!<br>
        Oh, and such a meeting it was- I was wandering out in the courtyard, 
        longing for a change of scenery from these walls.<br>
        My forced smile must have belied the wanderlust in my heart, it was no 
        sooner than I had bumped into him (most literally, clumsy that I am)that 
        he spoke of the sights he is free to see.<br>
        My, how he knew just what to say! A strong man and handsome voice, I do 
        hope to see this one again...<br>
        <br>
        It was ad though the stars and the heavens fell in perfect harmony, for 
        I had never seen such a beautiful night, not even in dream.<br>
        Behari did come calling again, as only a gentleman would.<br>
        With the expressed permission of my father(the look on his face was 
        enough alone for me to agree, thiugh I needed no convincing), this man 
        of the world set a dinner for us under the watchful eye of Norrath in a 
        quite comer atop the palace. Everything was simply perfect; the food(for 
        which he hunted and himself cooked) the stars, the enchanting breeze and 
        the touch of his hand on mine...<br>
        I could not know greater fulfillment.<br>
        <br>
        I have little time to write for the excitement, but I want never forget 
        this day!<br>
        The wedding is arranged and just around the corner.<br>
        Father is beside himself with joy! I am indeed the happiest I could ever 
        imagine being.<br>
        <br>
        Behari... has been long in return home.<br>
        Tomorrow was to be our day, but hi is almost a week gone missing.<br>
        I cannot concentrate to write further... he must return to me.<br>
        He simply musst.</p>

        <p><b>&gt;Hail, Soroush Koroun<br>
        </b><br>
        Greetings to you. I have just returned from another trip to Katta 
        Castellum and am trying to organize my notes, I apologize that I've 
        little time to talk.<br>
        Everything happened so suddenly what with the odd circumstances 
        surrounding the last diplomat, I have not quite had time to get used to 
        my new post.<br>
        <br>
        やぁ。私はちょうどKatta Castellumからの旅から戻って、メモをまとめている。<br>
        私は話をする時間が無いことを謝る。<br>
        突然色々な事が起こり、私は新しいポストに慣れなくてはならないのだ。<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;Who is behari?</b><br>
        <br>
        Soroush pauses to find the right words, 'Behari, the last to hold this 
        post, disappeared on his last trip to Katta.<br>
        He was a friend of mine for some time, I never dreamed that I would have 
        to undertake his duties in this way.<br>
        I believe that I was the last to see him alive.<br>
        His behavior at the time seemed peculiar, but I shrugged it off as 
        simply a man blissfully in love,'<br>
        <br>
        he says with a heavy sigh, and adds somberly,<br>
        <br>
        'I was very happy for him.'<br>
        <br>
        Soroushはその言葉を思い返すように筆を止める<br>
        <br>
        「Behariか。このポストの前任者はKattaへの旅を最後に姿を消した。<br>
        彼は私の友人であった。私はまさか彼の代わりにこの地位につくとは想像だにしていなかった。<br>
        私は私が彼が生きているのを見た最後の人だったと思う。<br>
        彼の行動は奇妙だった。しかし私はただそれが恋している男の行動だと思い、無視していた」<br>
        <br>
        そして大きなため息をついて重苦しく口を開く<br>
        <br>
        「私は彼のために非常に幸せであった。」と。<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What is behavior?</b><br>
        <br>
        I never mentioned this to Kalila, I thought it would hurt her more than 
        it would help, but when I bumped into Behari just before he disappeared, 
        he was going on and on about a love potion of some sort.<br>
        He was very excited, said he thought it would be the perfect gift for 
        Kalila on their wedding night, so you see why I never mentioned it.<br>
        Anyway, he said that he had just gathered all of the ingredients and was 
        heading back out of Katta.<br>
        <br>
        私はKalilaにこの事について口にしなかった。私は更に彼女を傷つけるかと思ったのだ。<br>
        しかし彼が姿を消す直前に会ったとき、彼は何らかの媚薬に関連して行くことになっていた。<br>
        彼は非常に興奮していて、それが彼らの結婚式の夜にKalilaのための完璧な贈り物になるだろうと言った。<br>
        だから私は決してそのことを口にしなかったのです。<br>
        とにかく、彼はちょうど全ての材料を集め、Kattaから戻ると言っていた。<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What love potion?</b><br>
        <br>
        I have no idea what he meant by a 'love potion.'<br>
        I have never even heard of such a thing, it just isn't my field, I am 
        afraid.<br>
        Maybe one of the spiritists knows something about it.<br>
        I doubt that it will do anything to help you track down Behari, but I 
        wish you luck my friend.<br>
        <br>
        私は彼が「媚薬」がどんな物か分からない。<br>
        私は一度もこのような物について聞いた事など無いです。<br>
        多分spiritistsの１人がそれについて知っているかと思います。</p>

        <p><b>&gt; Hail, Spiritist Ragnar</b><br>
        <br>
        Well hello... How may I help you?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What love potion</b><br>
        <br>
        Love potion? Never been done and not worth the risk to try after what 
        happened to Kanaad.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What happend to kanaad?</b><br>
        <br>
        Old Kanaad taught me a lot of what I know- he was about the greatest 
        potions expert in the city back then.<br>
        He started gathering legends and lore about some infamous love potion.<br>
        Not some silly thing to make the girl of your dreams fall in love mind 
        you- this fabled tonic was intended to be shared only between two who 
        had found true love.<br>
        If their feelings were strong enough it would... well, that was part of 
        the problem, no one knew what it was supposed to do.<br>
        Kanaad learned of some crazy human in the mountains that had supposedly 
        figured out the secret to the potion.<br>
        The results were not what anyone had hoped for.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What the result?</b><br>
        <br>
        Spiritist Ragnar shuffles a bit uncomfortably, considering whether or 
        not he should be telling you this,<br>
        <br>
        'This is not something that I would normally talk about, but Soroush 
        came by and told me that you are on the trail of Behari- if this will 
        help you find him, then I will tell you all that I know... Kanaad had a 
        time getting the ingredients and was only to make just a very little 
        bit.<br>
        He sat down with his love, alone in a room and intended to share the 
        elixir.<br>
        Well, that was the last anyone saw of her, and he was manic, out of his 
        mind...<br>
        The mixture had driven him from his senses and he snapped.<br>
        It took quite a bit to restrain him and figure out what to do next.'<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What happened next?<br>
        </b><br>
        Spiritist Ragnar considers you for a moment and, as though reminding 
        himself that you are trustworthy, continues,<br>
        <br>
        'Well what we learned was that not only did the mixture drive the 
        drinker mad, but it was incredibly addictive as well- a horrible 
        combination.<br>
        All that we could do was give him a controlled intake of the potion for 
        his addiction and try to treat his dementia.<br>
        With his returning sanity came the realization of what he had done to 
        his love.<br>
        It was the most harrowing thing I have ever seen someone go through in 
        all of my life...<br>
        He is better now, but has never quite been the same and rarely speaks to 
        strangers.<br>
        Give him this and you should at least get a chance to explain.'</p>

        After taking a deep breath, clearly taxed by the memories, he continues,<br>
        <br>
        'My research had brought me to Katta Castellum.<br>
        After a long day's work I took a seat at the end of the bar in a local 
        pub.<br>
        Trying to get my mind off of potions for a while, I overheard a story 
        about a crazy man roaming Tenebrous Mountains.<br>
        Everyone seemed to know him as Hoober the Delirious.<br>
        Seems he had become something of a local legend for his very odd habit 
        of asking people to gather some rather obscure ingredients in exchange 
        for a very rare reward.'<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What Ingredients?</b><br>
        <br>
        The promise of true love and everlasting happiness can make even the 
        most scarce ingredients seem trivial.<br>
        People laughed him off as a lunatic and after finally meeting Hoober I 
        could easily tell why, but his story piqued my interest given my 
        current... project.<br>
        I asked the fellows to repeat the ingredients this man requested, but 
        they were drinking rather heavily and had paid little attention in the 
        first place.<br>
        They were very vague, but what they could remember sounded very similar 
        to a partial recipe I had found a record of earlier that very day.<br>
        Against my better judgement I sought out this wanderer and we had a most 
        interesting conversation.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What Conversation?</b><br>
        <br>
        Kanaad gently closes his eyes and paints a picture in his mind,<br>
        <br>
        'There was no denying the man's state of mind, he was utterly delirious.<br>
        That was why I was so convinced...'<br>
        <br>
        he drifts off, 'so convinced...'<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What Convinced?<br>
        </b><br>
        At this notion, he takes a deep breath and opens his eyes to look at you 
        once more,<br>
        <br>
        'you see when he finally did tell me of the things he was looking for, 
        he was eloquent, impassioned, unmistakably controlled.<br>
        He knew what he was talking about, it seemed like this had to be it, the 
        answer to what I was seeking.<br>
        So I gathered up the components and combined them myself, and then it 
        all went so horribly wrong...'<br>
        <br>
        It takes him a moment to regain his train of thought,<br>
        <br>
        'You wouldn't even be able to have an intelligible conversation with 
        this man due to the cripling nature of the addiction unless someone made 
        you up a batch.'<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;Can you make a batch?</b><br>
        <br>
        Kanaad glances nervously about,<br>
        <br>
        'I am not sure that I should, the temptation would... perhaps Ragnar 
        could... no he hasn't experience with this mixture.'<br>
        <br>
        Kanaad seems to wrack his brain for alternatives, silent for a long 
        moment.<br>
        His inner conflict evident, he steadies himself for what he is about to 
        do, 'I suppose that I am the only one who can mix this potion for you 
        properly.<br>
        I can... yes, I have no doubt that I will be fine.'<br>
        <br>
        His inner demons put somewhat out of his mind, Kanaad looks you straight 
        in the eyes and says,<br>
        <br>
        'I will need a Luclin clover, a drop of moonlight and some essence of 
        sonnet.'</p>
        <p><b>&gt;Luclin clover?</b><br>
        <br>
        The Luclin clover is in many ways just like any other ordinary clover, 
        but the ones that grow out in the Thicket seem to posses an extra 
        sensitivity to magic and enchantment.</p>
        <p><b>&gt;What drop of moonlight?</b><br>
        <br>
        A drop of moonlight is exactly that- not solid, not liquid but a 
        captured drop of light itself.<br>
        Any astrologer worth their salt will be able to harness one for you.<br>
        Dont know much about astrology myself, but I'd guess that the platforms 
        above the palace would be an ideal place from which to see the stars.</p>
        <p><b>&gt;Essence of sonnet</b><br>
        <br>
        This will be the biggest hurdle between you and the potion.<br>
        The essence of sonnet is a rare and wonderful thing, only the most 
        gifted bards will ever produce one in their lifetime.<br>
        No amount of effort or studying will help them either- it is an 
        unexpected thing.<br>
        You see, bards dedicate their life to the telling and retelling of 
        stories, it is their job to inspire others with tales of triumph and 
        tragedy.<br>
        When a bard of the highest order sees or hears something that so 
        genuinely and so overwhelmingly inspires them, something magical 
        happens.</p>
