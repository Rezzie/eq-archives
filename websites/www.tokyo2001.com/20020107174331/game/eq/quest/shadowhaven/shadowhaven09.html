        Well I know that he told me he was going to the Tenebrous Mountains to 
        try to aquire the blood of one of the cursed vampyres there.<br>
        A very brave Gnome he is but also sometimes not very aware of what he is 
        getting himself into.<br>
        He told me that he needed to bring it to Zimloro so that a potion could 
        be made to cure his sick sister that was attacked by one of the cursed 
        not too long ago.<br>
        Perhaps you could go [lend him a hand] so that he could return sooner 
        because his family is very worried about him. <br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;I woll lend him a hand<br>
        </b><br>
        That is very nice of you Xxxxx.<br>
        Im sure his family will be very greatful.<br>
        He should not be there alone and we fear the worst for him.<br>
        If you are to go search for him please take him this note from Zimloro 
        that contains further instructions Please seek him out and do your best 
        to convince him to come home. </p>

        Hello traveller, what brings you to these cursed mountains?<br>
        If I were you I would turn back now, all that really lies ahead of you 
        is certain death.<br>
        The vampires that inhabitant these mountains are some of the fiercest 
        and most skilled.</p>

        <p>I see you were sent by my friends from back home.<br>
        I understand that they are very worried about me but they must 
        understand that I am doing this to help my sister and anyone else 
        infected by this horrible beasts.<br>
        If only I could receive some help in collecting a vampyre blood extract.<br>
        sample I could return it home along with the other components that 
        Zimloro decribes in this letter.<br>
