        <p>This week the Council of Qeynos voted for and nearly unanimously approved a resolution to officially begin investigations into the group responsible for unleashing the virulent plague effecting the Plains of Karana and beyond.<br> 
        Kane Bayle was away on business and unable to vote though he is said to have offered his support to the resolution.<br> 
        <br> 
        Antonius Bayle and council of Qeynos have tasked Vegalys Keldrane with duty of conducting investigations and bringing in suspected members of the bizarre cult for questioning.<br> 
        <br> 
        "The time has come for us to begin to root out this evil that has been festering in our peaceful community for far too long," Antonius was quoted as saying.<br> 
        <br> 
        Vegalys Keldrane, in an effort to expedite the process, has put out a call to those loyal to Qeynos and Bayle for assistance in these investigations.<br> 
        "What we need right now are solid, loyal and trustworthy investigators.<br> 
        I urge any that are interested in becoming an investigator to contact me personally."<br> 
        <br> 
        He also went on to note that preliminary investigations had him a bit shaken.<br> 
        "The more I learn from my investigators the more I find that these Bloodsabers have stretched their tendrils of influence all throughout our beloved city and lands beyond."<br> 
        <br> 
        Still in the midst of this crisis, Vegalys remained optimistic.<br> 
        "Though their true numbers remain unknown and may indeed be vast, we are completely committed to removing this threat from our midst once and for all."<br> 
        <br> 
        When asked about the strategy he would use to accomplish this goal we were told that they already had identified a number of suspected lower ranking members of the cult.<br> 
        He warns the community to expect some arrests in the forthcoming days as these suspects are brought in for questioning.</p>
