        <p>Many of us have taken arms against the foul stench of Cazic-Thule in our lands.<br>  
        Those of you that have not, must ,for we are making progress.<br>  
        The taint is strong to be sure.<br>  
        But the might of Felwithe can make the wrong things right!<br>  
        Reports from thick of battle come in weekly saying that we seem to have won, that the air is blue again and Tunare's blessings have returned but the hold is ever-tenuous, for we have won some battles but not yet the war.<br>  
        Every time we lower our swords the fear returns and the air around you pounds your senses once more.<br>  
        <br>  
        We need you, children of Tunare, every one of you , to join in the fight and hold what Tunare has created for us.<br>  
        Let us take back the Faydark from the edge of horror.<br>  
        Take it , hold it and cure it, for the sake of us all.<br>  
        No more of this back and forth between what is right and what is foul.<br>  
        The creatures of the forest need their homes and me, as children of the Mother of All, are the ones who will deliver it back to them.</p>

        Lanys T'Vyl's very narure has finally gotten so bad, that the dreaded Teir'Dal have turned their back on her.<br>  
        Things went sour between the child of hate and the people of Neriak after her defeat in Kithicor Forest at the hands of Firiona.<br>  
        Tunare's Chosen set into motion that day a chain of events that is only now corning full cincle.<br>  
        The Kingdom of Naythox and Cristanos Thex have made it Publicly known that Lanys is no longer their champion.<br>  
        Indeed they seek to bring her in themselves, by overwhelming force as they seem to always do.<br>  
        Reports say Lanys has overtaken Befallen and is using it as her new home.<br>  
        She still has some loyal zealots and only a fool would not assume that she is not up to something.<br>  
        King Thex seems to be amassing a sizable force, presumably preparing to invade Lanys' new hole.<br>  
        <br>  
        A battle seems imminent and whatever the outcome, Neriak will surely suffer.
