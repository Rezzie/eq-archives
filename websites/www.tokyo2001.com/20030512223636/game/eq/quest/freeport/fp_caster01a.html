          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Shana Liskia</b></p>
          <p>Hail and well met Xxxxx.<br>
            I am Shana Liskia, Enchantress of Freeport.<br>
            I have studied my art for years here in our wonderful academy.<br>
            I am also delighted to meet and teach those that come here to gain 
            knowledge.<br>
            My specialty however lies in Beguiling so I like to train young enchanters.<br>
            Are you an enchanter?</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am an enchanter</b></p>
          <p>Wonderful! Let me be the first to tell you that your training here 
            will be top notch and you will learn all that is to be known about 
            being an enchanter should you put forth the willingness to learn.<br>
            I will walk you through your early training and assist you in your 
            hunting and gathering skills.<br>
            I have created a [special sewing kit] that I present to all of the 
            new initiates.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What special sewing kit</b></p>
          <p>This kit that I speak of is one that is able to magically infuse 
            different components into materials used for creating Arcane Scientists 
            Armor.<br>
            The components that you use will be collected from numerous different 
            areas and shops in Freeport.<br>
            You will use these materials along with patterns that I will present 
            you with to create your armor.<br>
            Once you are [ready to begin] I will present you with your Enchanted 
            Sewing Kit.</p>

          <p><b>&gt;I am ready to begin</b></p>
          <p>Very well. Here you are Xxxxx, in this box you will combine specific 
            component recipes as I mentioned before.<br>
            When you are ready to attempt a specific piece you must tell me what 
            piece you [want] to craft.<br>
            For example if you had intent on crafting a cap you would say, “I 
            want to craft a cap”.<br>
            I can offer you the recipes for Arcane Scientists [Caps], [Bracers], 
            [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes].<br>
            I must also suggest that you attempt your robe last due to the difficult 
            nature of collecting the correct components.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I want to craft sandals</b></p>
          <p>Sandals will keep you save from any harmful things you may walk in, 
            it is a good idea to have them.<br>
            To create your sandal material you will need to combine 3 Woven Spider 
            Silks, 1 Coyote Pelt, 2 Black Bear Paws, 1 Urticating Hairs and Cloth 
            Sandals in your assembly kit.<br>
            Once you have created the proper material take it to a loom along 
            with this mold to fashion your very own Arcane Scientists Sandals.</p>
