        <p>It appears that the Teir'Dal, after the destruction of the forsaken child, regained Malevolence into their grasp.<br> 
        Dorvias N'Keth, the renowned Archpriest of the Prince of Hate, chose a devout follower of none other than the Hateful Prince to wield the revered and supposedly god-like power of Malevolence.<br> 
        How charming.<br> 
        <br> 
        Apparently, the Teir'Dal with their widely feared cunning and wit, were hiding their greed beneath a veil of concern for the world around them, as of course, Malevolence possesses the power to destroy even the gods themselves!<br> 
        Now, who could have imagined such lies?&nbsp;<br>
        And to think that for all this time, here we were truly in thought that the burrowing little scabs might have regard for someone or something other than the destruction of all things Tunare-related and of course, the dilemma of what rear-less chap design will grace the bottoms of their females when next fashion season arrives.<br> 
        Amazingly and truly one of the greatest deceptions in Norrath's history, we must say.<br> 
        <br> 
        Despite having what small regard we have for our pointy-eared and fearsomely diabolical little friends utterly rendered, we do retain some amusement and appreciation for their scheme.<br> 
        After all, their deception was indeed intact to the very end and they were successful in destroying Lanys.<br> 
        We extend a salute of 'Bravo!' to the little, blue, tunnel-dwelling menaces of Norrath.</p>
