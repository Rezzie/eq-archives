        <p>Velarte Selire, priest of Rodcet Nife, claims that with the tremendous outpouring of support for their research they have finally found a way to bring an end to the plague which has been troubling us all for so long.<br> 
        Ironically enough, the solution to the problem about how to end the plague was found within an idol made by the followers of the Plaguebringer himself.<br> 
        In our last issue, we reported on a local area man, who had turned down the dark path and made a pact with the Bloodsabers.<br> 
        <br> 
        In return for his loyalty, the farmer Jansen was given an idol and told to bury it in his fields.<br> 
        His crops flourished.<br> 
        After being discovered, the idol was confiscated and turned over to the Temple of Life.<br> 
        <br> 
        Velarte Selire told the Times that they were able to purify the magical aura imbued into the unholy idol and remove all traces of the Plaguebringer's influence.<br> 
        The priests were then able to modify the magical aura using their current anti-disease research so that the effect is dramaticallly more itense and powerful.<br> 
        <br> 
        When we last spoke with the Priests of Life, they were constructing a number of braziers which were to be imbued with this new purifying aura.<br> 
        The braziers will be filled with a special incense and a massive "smudging" ceremony will take place.<br> 
        The smoke produced will then react violently against the impure elements in the Plains of Karan, eradicating the plague.<br> 
        <br> 
        Some citizens expressed grave concern that the idea was untested and the effects of such powerful release of magic are unknown.<br> 
        However Velarte has assured us that though the sheer force of the magical energy to be released will be tremendous and perhaps frightening to some, he assures us that it is harmless and indeed beneficial to all living beings, plant and animal alike.</p>
