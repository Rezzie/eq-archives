        <p>Exciting news has been reported from the Temple of Life.<br>   
        Several priests claim that they have finally found a way to bring an end to the plague that has troubled the region of Qeynos for so long.<br>   
        The solution was found within an idol made by the followers of the Plaguebringer himself.<br>   
        Previously , we made a report on a farmer in the Qeynos plains who had turned down the dark path of destruction and made a pact with the Bloodsabers.<br>   
        After being discovered by Vegalys Keldrane,the Magistrate of Qeynos,the idol was confiscated and turned over to the priests in the Temple of Life.<br>   
        <br>   
        We have heard that the priests in the Temple of Life were able to purify the magical aura imbued into the unholy idol and remove all traces of the Plaguebringer's influence.<br>   
        The aura was then altered by the temple's current anti-disease research,making the effect much more potent.<br>   
        <br>   
        In hopes of cleansing the plague from their lands,the temple has constructed a number of braziers that were to be imbued with this anti-disease aura.<br>   
        The braziers will be filled with enchanted incense and a special "smudging" ceremony will then take place.<br>   
        The smoke produced is hoped to react violently against the impure elements in the Plains of Karana,eradicating the plague.<br>   
        <br>   
        Many residents of Qeynos,as well as our own scholars,have criticized and expressed grave concern that the idea is untested and the effect of such a wide-spread use of magic is too unpredictable to be performed on such a large scale.<br>   
        However,the priests have assured all skeptics that though the sheer force of the magical energy to be released will be tremendous and perhaps frightening to some,it is indeed harmless and beneficial to all living beings -- flora,fauna,and intelligent residents alike.</p>
