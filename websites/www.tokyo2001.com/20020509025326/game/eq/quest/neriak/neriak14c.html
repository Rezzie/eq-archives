        <p><b>&gt;Hail, High Priestess Alexandrian<br>
        </b><br>
        Greetings child, what business do you have here?<br>
        I'm sorry but I will only deal with Clerics that are willing to prove 
        their loyalty to Innoruuk.<br>
        I cannot deal with every single heathen that feels it is necessary to 
        bid me a good day.<br>
        If you are a [Cleric of Innoruuk] I might be able to aid you in your 
        training. '<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;I am a Cleric of Innoruuk</b><br>
        <br>
        Is that so Xxxxx.<br>
        Well from the looks of you I wouldn?t say you are much of anything yet.<br>
        However, if you have the willingness and determination to serve your God 
        then there might just be more hope for you then I would have thought.<br>
        Obviously, to move forward in your training, you will need to shield 
        yourself from your enemies and from the elements.<br>
        I believe I have something that could help you if you are still 
        [interested in proving yourself].<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;I am interested in proving myself</b><br>
        <br>
        Well I must say that I am impressed by your eagerness to learn, however, 
        you are not the first and will not be the last I am sure that has sworn 
        devotion to our Lord Innoruuk.<br>
        Lets just hope you don't end up in the burial grounds where many 
        promising young ones before you have found their resting place.<br>
        If you are ready to begin gathering items to fashion your very own 
        Initiate Darkpriest Armor then I will present you with a [magical 
        relic].<br>
        <br>
        <b>&gt;What magical relic?</b><br>
        <br>
        I have a box that I have been keeping for quite some time and have been 
        waiting to present it to someone like yourself.<br>
        Someone that I had faith would be strong enough to use it's power to 
        their benefit.<br>
        This magical box can be used to refine certain metals into a magical 
        compound that is used in crafting Initiate Darkpriest armor pieces.<br>
        I have the molds necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest [Helms], 
        [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and 
        [Breastplates].<br>
        However there are some [important items] that you will need to collect 
        before the molds will be of any use to you.<br>
        One thing to keep in mind is that I suggest you craft your Breastplate 
        last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items needed for that 
        specific recipe.</p>

        <br>
        I would definitely agree that you will need some decent Boots if you 
        wish to last long in any extreme climates like Lavastorm!<br>
        Combine 2 Helms of the Lifebringer, 2 Fire Beetle Legs and 2 Flasks of 
        Water to fashion the correct Refined sheet of Holy Metal.<br>
        Once you have done this place the Refined sheet of Holy Metal along with 
        this mold in any forge to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Boots.
