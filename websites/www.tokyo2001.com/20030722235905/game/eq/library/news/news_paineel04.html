        <p>It has come to attension that a member of the Peace Keepers has been captured by the Kobolds of the Warrens.<br> 
        Though we are unaware as to the details surrounding this Erudite's capture, we do know that this young priest is a respected member of the Erudin council.<br> 
        Coriante Verisue has stated that we shall not make any attempts to move this prisoner from Kobold prisons to our own as of yet.<br> 
        though we are keeping a watchful eye upon the actions of the Erudin council in their motives, if any , to release this young apprentice.</p>

        Anronius Bayle IV of Qeynos has issued a search for two members that are suspected to have poisoned the waters of Surefall Glade when the curse of the Bloodsabres first touched the lands of Qeynos in the past.<br> 
        These members have been charged with attempeted murder of Holly Windstalker, several sacred beasts of the Glade , and the murder of Cross Treewind who was destroyed by defiled grizzly.<br> 
        <br> 
        Though we hold little doubt that these debased "criminals" will be apprehended , we are skeptical that the manhunt will give away to any relief of the curse that is plaguing the farmlands of Karanas.<br> 
        Perhaps if the Qeynos citizens would cease their killing of the Bloodsabre members and use a bit of tact , force , and intelligence , they might discover the true composition of the curse and with it a possible cure.<br> 
        But then again , they are a peaceful nation , are they not?&nbsp;<br>
        Such " barbaric " ways are beneath them , after all.
