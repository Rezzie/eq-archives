        <p>The Priests of the Temple of Life bring citizens of Qeynos and Karana residents new hope this week as they announce their commitment to finding a way to bring an end to the terrible plague that has caused us so much heartbreak as of late.<br>  
        <br>  
        One radical idea in development is to use a sort of "anti-disease" enchantment that spreads much in the same way as a disease.<br>  
        However it does not sicken those that come in contact with it.<br>  
        Rather it leaves them perfectly healthy and disease free.<br>  
        The enchantment is currently imperfect and dissipates too quickly to be of any real use right now.<br>  
        <br>  
        The followers of Rodcet Nife have put out a call to anyone that has a sharp mind and a head for research for assistance with their tests as they attempt to refine the enchantment .<br>  
        Anyone interested in assisting should contact Velarte Seline for more information.</p>

    Reports have reached the Times that premier Wizard Al'Kabor continues his scientific research.<br>  
    His latest discovery relates to the ability to fuse together several different compounds using a combination of standard alchemical practices and good old fashioned wizardry.<br>  
    The compound is created from substances not naturally combinable without the use of Al'Kabor's secret process and is incredibly strong.<br>  
    The compound also seems to dramatically increase the flow of magical energy to any who remain in contact with the compound.<br>  
    Al'Kabor used the compound to contruct a Sceptre of incredible power.<br>  
    <br>  
    Apparently, this sceptre was given to an individual who was very helpful in assisting Al'Kabor in his studies.<br>  
    Regardless of this artifact's incredible power, no doubt it is viewed as a mere trinket to the mighty wizard.
