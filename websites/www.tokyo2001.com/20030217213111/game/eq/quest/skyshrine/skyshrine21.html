          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Iago Sabuela</b></p>
          <p>Salutations dragon friend Xxxxx.<br>
            I am Iago Sabuela archeologist, enchanter, and proud member of the [Draconic Loyalist Fellowship].<br>
            Please make yourself comfortable and enjoy your visit to Skyshrine.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is Draconic Loyalist fellowship?</b></p>
          <p>The Draconic Loyalist Fellowship is people like myself of a non-draconic heritage that have 
            pledged obedience to the dragons and dragon-kin of Skyshrine.<br>
            We have proven that we can provide valuable services and resources to the dragons and dragon-kin 
            that would otherwise be difficult or impossible for them to obtain.<br>
            Among the occupations I pursue here in the Skyshrine is the acquisition of lost [draconic 
            artifacts].</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is draconic artifacts?</b></p>
          <p>The dragons and their kin have an ancient and complex culture like any intelligent creature 
            in Norrath.<br>
            I have spent the majority of my years studying the ancient dragon civilizations of Norrath 
            and recovering lost draconic artifacts.<br>
            There are several artifacts I am currently searching for and could use the assistance of a 
            capable group of adventurers.<br>
            Are you interested in [hunting for lost artifacts]?</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am interested in hunting for lost artifacts</b></p>
          <p>Excellent. With the help of the texts provided me by the dragon-kin here in Skyshrine I have 
            narrowed my search down to a few locations where I believe the artifacts I seek may be hiding.<br>
            Before the artifacts may be recovered however you will need a special container in which to 
            store them in.<br>
            They are quite old and who knows what condition they may be in.<br>
            I am missing some materials that are necessary for the insulation of the container thus it 
            would be appreciated if you could provide me with a [crystalline silk mesh] and two [oily 
            goo secretions] I will finish the construction of the artifact container and provide with 
            the information I have obtained of the lost artifacts.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What is crystalline silk mesh?</b></p>
          <p>An experienced tailor must craft the woven crystalline spider silk mesh in a tailoring kit 
            out of four crystalline silks.</p>

          I have no need for this item Xxxxx, you can have it back.
          <p>Thank you Xxxxx.<br>
            Here is the container that the artifacts must be stored and returned to me in once they have 
            been recovered.<br>
            The artifacts I seek are a [Crystal Dragon Eye], a [Golden Dragon Claw], a [Dragon Scripture 
            Tablet], and a [Platinum Dragon Scale].<br>
            When all the items have been recovered, seal the artifact container and return it to me.<br>
            You shall be rewarded well for your assistance, I assure you.</p>
          <p>Your faction standing with Claws of Veeshan could not possibly get any better.<br>
            Your faction standing with Yelinak could not possibly get any better.<br>
