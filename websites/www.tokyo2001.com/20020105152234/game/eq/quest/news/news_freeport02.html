        <p>The plague unleashed across the Karana plains by the Bloodsabres serveral weeks past has finally reached its venomous hand to our portside city.<br> 
        Provisions have been growing steadily scarce due to the lack of neccesary materials to make bread, muffins, and other goods needed by the citizens and travelers alike.<br> 
        <br> 
        One of our prospering merchants, Innkeep Hunter, has expressed his concern with this shortage of certain products.<br> 
        "Although we still have plenty of rations, the production of our most fine of goods has been harmed due to the plague upon the Karana fields.<br> 
        We have fear that the deman for these foods shall grow greatlty, but our supply will only decrease to an eventual and severe lack in these goods."</p>

        <p>We have heard rumors from our merchants and tradesmen who frequent the Highpass area that the goblin miners of Runnyeye citadel have overthrown the Evil Eyes that have enslaved them for several years.<br> 
        The goblins have retakend the citadel as their own and appointed a new leader with the execution of their former king, who was beneath the Evil Eyes control.<br> 
        <br> 
        There is little direct meaning of this event to the citizens of freeport beyond the possiblity of a compromised safety for the merchants who frequent Highpass Keep, as the Pickclaw clan of goblins remain there as members of a free civilization.<br> 
        We merely look back upon the history that led the corruption of Kithicor Wood and the influence the goblins had in that massacre.</p>
