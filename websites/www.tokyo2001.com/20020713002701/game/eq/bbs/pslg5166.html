He seems oblivious <BR>to your presence. <BR><BR>You say, 'what is talon southpaw?'<BR><BR>an iksar master   waves his arms in the air.  'The great master.  His <BR>soul is the wind.  He speaks to us in words of thunder.  He strikes <BR>Norrath with bolts of lightning.  I seek to be as he is.  I have <BR>traveled the globe in search of his fists. I have found only one.  <BR>Another is said to be with [Gomoz].  I shall return it when I am <BR>finished with my seasons-long meditation or perhaps I shall find a <BR>monk to [return the hand to Cabilis].' <BR><BR>You say, 'who is gomoz?'<BR><BR>an iksar master says 'Disciple Gomoz was once Talon Southpaw's <BR>pupil.  It is rumored that he has only one hand.  Unfortunately, a <BR>horde of ogre raiders swiped his bones, along with others, from their <BR>place in Kurn's Tower.  What those simple oafs plan to do with them <BR>is a mystery.  Only one who has studied the arcane sciences could use <BR>them.  They most likely used them as soup bones. <BR><BR>You say, 'i will return the hand to cabilis'<BR><BR>an iksar master   hands you an old tattered sack.  'This shall be <BR>your proof of allegiance.  Prove that you are strong with an intact <BR>mandible of a skulking brutling and the claws of a burynai <BR>excavator.  Prove that you are a monk of fist and tail with a sash of <BR>an exiled human monk and the sparring gloves of a goblin pit <BR>fighter.  Combined, these items make the sack full.  This will earn <BR>my trust and the hand.' <BR>
