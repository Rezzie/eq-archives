          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Kaya Cloudfoot</b></p>
          <p>A pleasure to make your acquaintance Xxxxx.<br>
            I am Kaya Cloudfoot, first Paladin of the Storm Reapers.<br>
            I traveled long ago when I was just a wee sprout to the city of Qeynos 
            far to the west.<br>
            It was there I grew under the tutelage of the Knights of Thunder, 
            a noble order of paladins loyal to Karana, the Storm Lord.<br>
            I have returned now to Rivervale to teach interested young halflings 
            the ways of a Knight of the Storm Reapers so that we may defend Karanas 
            people and lands from the [evil forces] that would see it destroyed.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What evil forces</b></p>
          <p>There are many problems and creatures that trouble Karanas people 
            through out Norrath and threaten our otherwise peaceful ways of life.<br>
            Our common folk here in Rivervale are troubled by the wicked Teir`Dal, 
            the Death Fist Orcs, and the Goblins of Clan Runnyeye and Pickclaw.<br>
            It is the calling and duty of a Knight of the Storm Reapers to defend 
            the common folk from these enemies of Rivervale.<br>
            Are you willing to [defend the commoners]?</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I will defend the commoners</b></p>
          <p>You have made an honorable decision, Xxxxx.<br>
            First you will need to be outfitted in a suit of armor to protect 
            you from the weapons of our foes.<br>
            Seek Jimji Bottletoe here in Rivervale and give him this letter.<br>
            Jimji will instruct you further on acquiring a suit of armor worthy 
            of a new Knight of the Storm Reapers.<br>
            When you have been outfitted in your Bravefoot Armor return to me 
            and I shall prepare you for your [next task].</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What next task?</b></p>
          <p>The Teir'Dal, or Dark Elves that reside in the underground city of 
            Neriak to the east beyond the Commonlands have long been a bane to 
            us Storm Reapers.<br>
            Many of our Druids have fallen attempting to hold back the tide of 
            hate and destruction that has taken hold on the Nektulos Forest and 
            threatens the surrounding lands.<br>
            It was also the Teir`Dals patron God, Innorruuk, who caused the [Curse 
            of Bloody Kithicor].<br>
            Are you ready to [face the Teir'Dal] and bloody your hands for the 
            protection of your Shire and our commoners humble way of life?</p>
          <p><b>&gt;What Curse of Bloody Kithicor?</b></p>
          <p>There was a great war that was fought not long ago between the Teir'Dal, 
            and their evil minions, and the armies of Felwithe, Qeynos, Freeport, 
            and Kaladim.<br>
            In the Kithicor Woods the Daughter of Innoruuk, Lanys T'Vyl, and her 
            minions fought against the chosen of Tunare, Firiona Vie, and her 
            most loyal allies.<br>
            The evil God of Hate, Innoruuk, intervened every living creature in 
            the Kithicor Woods instantly fell dead as a great rift to the Plane 
            of Hate appeared in the sky.<br>
            Since that time, when night falls on the Kithicor Woods blood seeps 
            from the trees and ground and the hateful dead hunt any living being 
            who dares to trespass in the woods that ended their lives.</p>
          <p><b>&gt;I am ready to face the Teir Dal</b></p>
          <p>Some days ago one of our Storm Reapers, a ranger by the name of Botim 
            Bonker, ventured into the Kithicor Forest at daybreak on a routine 
            patrol and never returned.<br>
            That night his bloodied tunic was found hanging on a fence post of 
            Tagglefoots Farm.<br>
            The blood was dried and many hours old.<br>
            We believe that he was slain during the day and that deduction coupled 
            with the fact the undead of Kithicor do not leave the woods nor possess 
            the intelligence or means to sneak into Rivervale and leave the tunic 
            where it would surely be found by fellow Storm Reapers led us to believe 
            they were not responsible.<br>
            We believe it was the work of the Teir'Dal.<br>
            Search the Kithicor Woods by daylight and punish the Teir'Dal responsible.<br>
            Return with the villains severed hands as proof of his death.</p>
          <p>数日前に我々Storm Reapersの１人、Botim Bonkerという名のRNGがいつものパトロールの為に夜明けのKithicorの森に行ったまま戻らなかった。<br>
            その夜になって彼の血まみれになったチュニックが、Tagglefoots農場のポストの上に掛かっているのが見つかった。<br>
            血は乾燥しており、時間が経っていたことを示していた。<br>
            我々は彼が日中に殺され、そしてKithicorのundeadが森から消えた後にRivervale にこっそり入り、そしてStorm 
            Reapersに疑惑を向けさせるようにチュニックを置き残すような知性あるいは手段を持っている者だと推測した。<br>
            我々はそれがTeir 'Dalの仕業であったと睨んでいる。<br>
            日中にKithicorを捜索し、そして疑わしきTeir 'Dalを捕まえなさい。<br>
            死の証拠としてその犯人の手を持ってきなさい。</p>
