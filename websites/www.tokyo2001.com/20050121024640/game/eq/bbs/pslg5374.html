They are <BR>nothing more than a group of thugs not worthy of respect.  They <BR>follow the words of <BR>[Sir Lucan] D'Lere.  He has been a thorn in this city's side for too <BR>long.  If you wish to <BR>aid us in the fight against tyranny, go speak with Jemoz or Sir <BR>Theron.  May the Truthbringer <BR>shine upon your soul. <BR>You say, 'Who is Sir Lucan?'<BR>Valeron Dushire says 'Lucan is a bad seed.  You see, I trained Sir <BR>Lucan.  He was nothing more <BR>than a street rat who was taken in by the Temple of Marr.  The <BR>priests taught him and found him <BR>to be very agile and strong.  They requested either the Priests of <BR>Marr or the Knights of Truth <BR>take him on as a squire.  Gygus could not spare the trainers at the <BR>time and so we took the boy. <BR> The boy became a man, and a very formidable knight.  Then something <BR>[went awry]. <BR>
