        <p>The upheaval in Runnyeye Citadel has caused a great deal of panic amongst the citizens of Rivervale.<br> 
        Clan Pickclaw battled its way through the dwellings defeating the inhabitants, the evil eyes and goblin slaves of Xorbb.<br> 
        <br> 
        Lord Pickclaw personally executed the Goblin King and his minions, and integrated the remaining Runnyeye goblins into his clan.<br> 
        While most were slain in battle, including Borxx, the remaining evil eyes fell back to the Gorge of King Xorbb.<br> 
        <br> 
        After the battle was won, Lord Pickclaw struck a deal with a strange subterranean race of fungal beings called the Sporali.<br> 
        The Sporali would do mining work for the goblins, and in return, the goblins wouldn't wipe them out.<br> 
        <br> 
        Apparently, Lord Pickclaw and his followers had been hidden away for several years building up forces.</p>

        <p>Helping to fight against the plague in the Karanas, our bakers rush to find new recipes each day.<br> 
        <br> 
        One of our key reporters was met with an untimely death while trying to spread the news of the new recipes.<br> 
        <br> 
        Hobie Mullins deemed himself an ambassador of baking.<br> 
        While trying to improve the quality of life amongst the ogres and trolls of the swampy lands of Innothule, Hobie was eaten by a ferocious ogre reporter of Da Swamp News after he gave the beast the recipe for Muskie marinade and some journalistic advice.<br> 
        <br> 
        In memory of Hobie, we have included the recipe that he was trying to share with the world.<br> 
        <br> 
        Ingredients: Rathe Muskie, Vinegar, Spices, Snake Egg Oil, Fish Wine<br> 
        <br> 
        Create the marinade by mixing the liquid ingredients.<br> 
        Allow the Muskie to marinade for several hours.<br> 
        Add spices and cook until skin is golden brown and meat appears lightly translucent.<br> 
        <br> 
        Hobie Mullins<br> 
        We will miss you!</p>
