        <p>In case there are those of you that havenot heard, steer far clear from the Mountains of Rathe.<br> 
        The Dark Elves, in their constant war with themselves, have some splinter group setting up there now (I think it has something to do with the dirty Lanys T'Vyl, but who can keep up with that bunch?).<br> 
        <br> 
        tis a good day to be a halfling<br> 
        <br> 
        The Dark Elves are, as always, at war with each other.<br> 
        The Humans are diseased.<br> 
        The Elves' Champion has run off to Kunark and no one know why.<br> 
        The Dwarves and Gnomes are short.<br> 
        And, alas, there are we halfling.<br> 
        Look around Rivervale, won't you?<br> 
        <br> 
        We are eating well and filled with merriment.<br> 
        Find a mirror and remind yourself how lucky you are.<br> 
        Go down to the river with a fresh bowl of Ell's finest, back in the lazy sunlight and have not a care in the world.</p>

        <p>Word out of Qeynos is that not all of the Karanas are being affected by the dirty, nasty plague.<br> 
        <br> 
        In fact it is just one farmer who seems to grow fertile food.<br> 
        What to do, they ask, what to do indeed?<br> 
        <br> 
        He could just have fortune smiling upon him but there is much fear he works with the plague bringers, poisoning the lands to his own selfish gain.<br> 
        <br> 
        None know for sure, but the humans have had enough and are sending in Vegalys himself to sort it out. . . no doubt there will be more to say on this very very soon.</p>
