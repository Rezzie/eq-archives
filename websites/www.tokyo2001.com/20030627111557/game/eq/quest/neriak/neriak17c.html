          <p><b>&gt;Hail, Talorial D`Estalian</b><br>
            <br>
            On what grounds do you think you are welcome to address me like that 
            vermin?<br>
            I am afraid you will have to prove yourself to me before I can treat 
            you with any respect.<br>
            Do you feel that you are [worthy] to stand before me?<br>
            <br>
            <b>&gt;What worthy?<br>
            </b><br>
            Very well then, you are lucky that I have been looking for some sort 
            of an apprentice to help me out in gathering some hides from those 
            nasty halflings.<br>
            I did have a young one as yourself working for me before but unfortunately 
            they didn't work out as you can see by looking at this autopsy table.<br>
            I would hope that you will complete my [tasks], for your sake.<br>
            <br>
            <b>&gt;What tasks?<br>
            </b><br>
            If you are willing to [gather some items] that are needed for specific 
            halfling hides I can offer you with the resources necessary to fashion 
            your own armor.<br>
            <b><br>
            &gt;What gather some items?</b><br>
            <br>
            Excellent Xxxxx.<br>
            Please take this Old Enchanted Tailors Kit.<br>
            It contains magical power that is able to fashion specific components 
            into a magical version of whatever the core material is.<br>
            If you are a Necromancer you will need to gather halfling hides that 
            have been infused with many different elements that you will collect 
            and combine in this box.<br>
            Simply tell me what pattern you [want] and I will present you with 
            the recipe necessary for [Gloves], [Robe], [Trousers], [Sleeves], 
            [Skullcap], [Bracers] and [slippers].<br>
            I would recommend you fashion your Robe last due to the difficulty 
            and complex nature that is involved with finding the items necessary.</p>

          To make your own Unholy Silk Trousers you will need to collect many 
          items in the forest along with a few in town.<br>
          The halfling hide that you will need along with a pattern to craft together 
          these Trousers will need to be infused with 4 Halfling Hides, 2 Bone 
          Chips, 3 Spiderling Silks and 1 Raw Bamboo.<br>
          All of these items will be collected in the field with the exception 
          of the Raw Bamboo which can be bought in town.<br>
          Please make sure that you have prepared the correct halfling hide before 
          you approach a loom with the pattern I have given you.<br>
