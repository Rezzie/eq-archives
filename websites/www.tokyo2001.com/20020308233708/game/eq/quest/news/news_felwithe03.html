        <p>Something awful has happened,it is time for High Elves one and all to bow their heads in unison and speak to prayer to the Mother of All... our home is in danger.<br> 
        Recently, our dead Princess and Champion Firiona Vie made contact with Tunare in Lesser Faydark.<br> 
        By her side were citizens of Kelethin and the Unicorn Equestruelle , friend of Firiona and a symbol of all that is pure and natural.<br> 
        Upon the Mother's appearance, tragedy struck.<br> 
        <br> 
        Leaves withered and fell and the air grew rank for Cazic-Thule awaited them in ambush.<br> 
        It is not for mortals to say what power possesses the Faceless, but the greatest powers of balance could not stop what was to come.<br> 
        If you have been out to Lesser Faydark since then,I do not need to describe to you what has happened.<br> 
        If you have not been...<br> 
        I cannot, words alone cannot, describe to you the state of the forest.<br> 
        <br> 
        Worst of all,here horn  as the focus, Equestrielle was the target of the hate.<br> 
        In order to save from losing her completely,our brave champion had to do the unthinkable.<br> 
        In order to stem the corruption in the proud unicorn, Firiona Vie was forced to serve the horn from atop Equesrielle's head.<br> 
        Please take a moment and say your own prayers to Tunare for Equesrielle's redemption.</p>

        For all of our safety, the royal guards of Felwithe,with the cooperation of the Paladins of Tunare,do their best to keep watch on the fallen child of hate.<br> 
        However,she has managed to slip beneth their notice for the time being and that can not be good.<br> 
        What she is seeking we do not know,but let this serve as a warning to all of Felwithe to be at its sharpest, for whatever she is up to will certainly involve the High Elves in some way.<br> 
        To do your part, see Talisyn Stormwing in the Faydark.<br> 
        Remember,the safety of the Kingdom is everyone's responsibility.
