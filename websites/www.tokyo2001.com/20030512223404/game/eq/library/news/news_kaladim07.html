        <p>The lovely lasses, Firiona Vie and Lyirae Oakwynd, were seen talkin' to the great dragon, Lady Zavo'Za, deep in the Skyfire Mountains.<br> 
        The high elven princess, Firiona, spoke of her quest to confront the Ring of Scale 'bout the Location of the Lifeguide, Tunare's staff that Firiona held until her kidnappin', but the red dragon insisted that the Ring of Scale refused to speak to her.<br> 
        <br> 
        Lyirae's anger grew strong, as the dragon presented them with the options of pursuin' Venril Sathir, ruler of Karnor's Castle or speakin' with Ghargin Bumblok.<br> 
        The two decided to seek out Ghargin, the bloody ogre that killed her twin brother a year before.<br> 
        <br> 
        When they found Ghargin, he began throwin' large boulders at them while remainin' hidden. Firiona insisted that he not be killed while she called for him to come forward.<br> 
        When she realized that he would not be comin' out, she told Lyirae and the others to search for him.<br> 
        <br> 
        A battle took place to capture him, but he had been possessed by the evils of The Faceless.<br> 
        The lasses were victorious.<br> 
        Firiona had to calm Lyirae down in order to keep her from killin' the ogre.<br> 
        She spoke to him in a stern voice while clutchin' to her mighty sword.<br> 
        <br> 
        He told 'em that the Iksar Danak Dhorentath and Vahlai Ka'lzal, the dark elven wizard, had tucked the staff away on Velious as he continued to mock Lyirae with laughter.<br> 
        <br> 
        Lyirae finally had enough and killed the injured brute with one shot of her brother's bow the mighty Oakwynd.<br>
