<center><font class="MenuHeader" size=+1>An Interview With Brad McQuaid</font><br>
<font size=-1>(By Atomic></font></center>
<br><br>
<font class="BaseFont"><b>
<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/building1.jpg" width=250 align=right>Since its initial release, Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainments Everquest has hooked nearly three hundred thousand gamers into its persistent online world. Its landscape is rich and detailed, each of its individual player races and classes are diverse, and its multitude of quests have gamers battling their way from one end of the world to the other. Its easy to see Everquests appeal in the detailed graphics and vast challenges it provides, but drawing over sixty thousand players a night is the challenge Verant must face. What is it about this game, this company that has drawn so many gamers together to form the largest online gaming community? I was honored with a look inside the doors of Verant, and the opportunity to bring questions from that community which has remained fervent about their avatars in Norrath from the first moment they entered the game.
<br><br>
Brad McQuaid is the man responsible for creating addicts out of the casual gamer. He is sincere and passionate about his creation, and his dedication to continually improve and refine that formula is readily apparent in the sheer volume of satisfied subscribers. I was happy to be offered a chance to speak with him, and ask him questions about EQs evolution from launch up to its soon to be released add-on, Scars of Velious, and how the design for Everquest has impacted the mainstream gaming market.
<br><br>
The first thing fans of the fantasy genre will notice about EQ is how familiar the characters and environments are to your Tolkien-esque, AD&D fantasy setting. Keeping along the lines of elves and dwarves was planned from the earliest stages of its development. Everyone who worked on EQ are fans of the so-called high-fantasy, explains Brad, whether by playing paper-and-pencil games, or reading Tolkien-esque literature. Those are things we read as kids and I, for one, am still an avid fantasy fan. What we want to do is bring that world alive and generate our own original content. Its a sense that it is our own world and we have become its gods and game masters. We want it to be a familiar world where you can see these things youve read about come alive and battle you. People like that original environment and its something were happy to provide.
<br><br>
Placing the style and scope of the project within a programmable game world was a crucial decision. One of the major issues for maintaining stability and creating its unique environment was resolved using its zone-based architecture. Not only can they maintain a massive amount of client data, but they can also style zones to maintain the illusion of the fiction. The technology behind all the major online games is now reaching two-plus years old now, notes Brad, and back when these engines were designed we at Verant concentrated on issues for maintaining the data, the density of the world and visibility, along with other concerns. Were very happy we designed Everquest to be zone-based because it allowed us to create a very detailed and customized world. We found that once we had many places in Everquest looking really neat, we had that wow, I remember this place from before feeling because you recognize the landmarks or the atmosphere, and its a very important immersive element.
<br><br>
Having zones allows the artists and designers to give a specific look to those fantasy elements. Part of the initial design was to give each zone its own theme, while mixing familiar fantasy and real-world elements. We can really control our world and be very unique he explains. We tried to take everything that was cool in the real world and pack it into our landscapes. We can create huge pyramids or thousand foot waterfalls for the game, and it is an exaggeration of our real world and what is cool about it. Were very happy we could create a world like that to interact in. We want to immerse the players, and not have them see rolling hill after rolling hill. We like how players are able to look over that certain hill and see a giant statue, because it also helps them gather their bearings and have familiar landmarks in terms of where they are in this world. 
<br><br>
<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/bmcquaid.jpg" align=left width=250>Brad also knows that every day is a learning experience, and that the processes behind creating what gamers want to play is as much trial and error as it is established knowledge. When you develop a game and write the design document, theres such a creative process especially in this genre that its a lot of uncharted territory and ideas that havent been tested. Were not making our ump-teenth shooter or RTS, were making massively multiplayer on a commercial level which is still fairly new. 
<br><br>
As EQ has progressed it has always added more content and refinements, and Brad is proud to be able to do that. The process is always ooh, I wish that cool thing were in there and stop-reverse-go again. Thats why some things take longer because in many ways we are still learning as we go along. We dont want to stagnate and do exactly what weve done before, so even as we learn new things, we like thinking on to our next new idea. That will remain true for quite some time. More unique quests and class-specific items are things we want to bring to the players. Its all a matter of timing and resources, and I think we have a pretty good record for bringing that sort of content often enough within the game. The game is dynamic to the extent that we constantly add cool new things.
<br><br>
Maintaining the immersive qualities of the game is a constant challenge between the cool new ideas introduced by the team and players, and the time and personnel limitations required completing them. Many players have requested improvements to the AI and pathing of certain mobs and areas, which is an incredible task for the development team. Issues that come in regarding the pathing or AI are addressed on a case-by-case basis, explains Brad. Well get feedback and find theres some section with some information missing. Our GMs will go in there and actually walk around, and see if theres anything that can or should be done. Players will see incremental improvement in many areas, but I dont think its realistic to expect a mass change.
<br><br>
Another hot topic among long-time players has been the Tracking skill. Many players clamored for a revamp of the tracking system to allow better use of the ability as the skill level increased. Brad assured me the project to improve this ability was already being planned, and much of what has been outlined has come directly from the players. Tracking is working according to how we had it planned, but within the last year or so there have been several good ideas and feedback in terms of how we could make it better. We could add filtering in the way of being better at the skill gives you greater filtering of the information and enhance the interface. It is one of our plans post-Velious to upgrade and enhance the tracking system. Ideas such as sorting by monster type, by distance, or perhaps even by level range and how it /cons to you are on the table. Those are the things I see happening for that skill.
<br><br>
Players are difficult to please in any game, be it a massively multiplayer title or not. When they discover a particular area, item or quest, they are quick to respond with lets have more of that! One such instance regards the Kedge Keep, an underwater dungeon zone, and how players feel it is one of the best-designed areas in the game. As a result, many players are interested to see more of that type of zone. Underwater environments are harder to do, he states, since there are more pathing issues because you have to be more meticulous in how you set up an underwater dungeon, but at the same time were very happy with the way Kedge turned out. There are different strategies that the players have to use in that type of environment, which is exciting and unique. So we do plan on having underwater environments in Velious, and as we also add one or two more free zones each year, theres one in particular for planned for Kunark were working on, located in the Lake of Ill Omen. Youre not going to see a ton of them, because of how meticulous you need to be when designing them.
<br><br>
One idea brought to my attention by a player during my research was for an interesting monster. Back from my AD&D role-playing days I could identify with the idea of having a race of evil treants, creatures created from the trees by incredible magic powers. I brought this intriguing player-created idea to Brads attention. There are no specific plans for evil treants, but that is an interesting idea. I can picture a sort of dark forest, a tainted forest for a treant-type monster. Its a cool idea, and if the players are interested in seeing that type of environment, then it is something we may kick around.
<br><br>
Early after EQs release, items and accounts were seen (and still are) on auction sites, fetching hefty sums for high level characters and hard to get items. Verant has publicly stated its distaste for these actions, and Brad went into detail on how they came to the decision on attempting to quell the online business of buying and selling virtual property. There are two issues with those type of sales. First is our players reaction to it. The majority opinion is they do not like it. EQ is centered on earning your rewards - items, levels, and skills - that many players dont feel it is fair to come in at a high level or acquire an exotic item, knowing that in the real world its only because somebody coughed up the cash to bypass playing the game. Many players goals within the virtual world revolve around who you are in that world, and shouldnt rely on the outside influences. Theyre in it to role-play, and what they accomplish or achieve in-game has nothing to do with the real world. By placing items and characters for sale is taking away the fantasy by interacting within the real world. But I try to understand both sides of peoples differing opinions and standpoints. Ive actually had a player tell me at a gathering that he plays but didnt have the time to invest in achieving those goals, and that sort of thing had helped him experience other parts of the game that he never felt he would have otherwise.
<br><br>
The second issue deals with the actual sale of accounts, which is a nightmare of a customer service scenario, he continues. We have had people out there sell an account to someone who is unwary, and that character is hated, maybe even suspended. Maybe hes been a jerk in the game and nobody likes him. These transactions would occur, and the new customer who owns the account might find him- or herself in a situation that really didnt care for. The new player then calls us, and we have no record of the transactions, so according to our records it never took place, and you are the original owner. Thats why we decided it should be against the license agreement.
<br><br>
Verant seems willing to work with the crowd who are decidedly in favor of selling items and accounts, and are working to resolve the barriers between their philosophy and that of the eBay audience. One of our ideas is to perhaps have a server where these sort of transactions could occur, and the people who wanted to play that way could go ahead, or players could join a server where it wasnt allowed for the community or role-playing aspects. Will it make fans happy in that way? Again these are ideas that are still far off, but something were taking into consideration.
<br><br>
Along with the difficulties monitoring the sale of accounts and desired items comes the opportunity for scam artists to try and fool unwary players into giving up their secure information. There was one extreme instance, he begins, where we had a group of scammers taking credit card number IN-GAME. We have to shut that stuff down and keep it out. It just cant be that way. Then again, people should know better than to give control of an actual monetary transaction within any game. Were not scouring the internet actively pursing offenders, but we do constantly monitor the situation and will deal with the offenders.
<br><br>
<img src="http://con.xrgaming.net/gfx/verant/custserv2.jpg" align=left width=250>
The lessons learned after EQ went live prepared them to constantly improve upon an already surging product, and pushed them far ahead of their closest competitors. Listening to the feedback from players, and improving their graphics engine came together in their first add-on, The Ruins of Kunark. Brad explains some of the more important lessons. We learned a lot with Kunark, beyond just the better graphics. The design has matured. The zones are larger, and theres less instances of pathing issues because they are laid out better. We implemented better random loot, especially to cut back on issues with camping. We still have specific key mobs around Kunark holding certain loot, but we can spread it out a lot more.
<br><br>
Along with Kunark came another new batch of deep, involved quests that sucked more life from its fevered audience. Although the actual number of quests is uncertain, one thing is for sure: they havent all been discovered or completed. There are still a few quests left that have not been completed, he smirks. We have over 290,000 subscribers now, and closing in on 300,000. When you have that many people exploring the world, and a lot of web sites around which allow players to share the knowledge theyve gathered its all going to be discovered eventually, so there's not much left. Its why were eager to finish Velious.
<br><br>
The Scars of Velious adds a new continent to the persistent EQ universe, a land scarred by the great dragon Veeshan, who carved the huge canyons into its surface. Among the 16 new zones are included dragon burial grounds and breeding grounds, Giant citadels, two new Planes of Existence, and the lands occupied by the Coldain. The Coldain are a race of Dwarves who have been forced into hiding their numbers under the icy surface due to the conflicts waging between the Dragons and Giants. There will be plenty of NPCs of these new races as merchants and quest-bearers. Ten new races will be discovered, including new factions of Orcs and Gnolls, Sirens, and a race of Undead Dragons. As a result, the add-on will tempt players of level 30+, and travelling in a group will be all but mandatory through the multitude of deadly beasts.
<br><br>
Although well see plenty of these new NPCs, we wont find any new player classes or races, focusing instead on adding hundreds of new quests. The designers will be working up until the last minute and beyond putting as much content as possible, assures Brad. Thats usually our goal. How much is enough? There isnt.
<br><br>
When Kunark was released, players cheered because of the higher level limits that were added for characters. Theres no increase to the character level limit in Velious, but Brad hasnt put the idea to rest. Whether we decide to do one in the future or not, I cant say for sure. There are a lot of variables involved. The more powerful creatures are fifty to sixtieth level, and we dont want to let it get to the point where one player can just walk around killing dragons. Thats not immersive or realistic within the fiction. When we started with Kunark we realized there was a lot of tweaking  involved, and we were able to do all sorts of things once it became commercially available. One of my concerns is that it frustrates some players, so one of our goals set for early next year is to have our characters finally balanced. Then we may be able to go ahead and up the level limit to seventy or some other number. That gives us a whole situation for balancing one class against another yet again.
<br><br>
What will Velious hold, then for players? Aside from the greater texture resolutions, engine enhancements to smooth out the animations, and large zones as found in Kunark, one of the more notable quests involves a bone which allows you to teleport back to your corpse. There is additionally a subway system where players who have defeated the boss of a certain zone will receive a token for that zone, and be able to use the Druid Rings scattered over the continents surface for quicker access for certain locations.
<br><br>
With Velious weve implemented new ways to teleport, and that related directly to the improvements we made in how Velious works, beams Brad. Both the indoor and outdoor areas are comparable to Kunark in size, and thats a good thing. By allowing 80 players in a larger zone makes it easier to find a group, but at the same time doesnt allow for too much crowding. There a delicate balance between making a zone that large, and not making it tedious for the player to traverse because those two desires are simply at odds. In Velious there are a lot of sprawling outdoor areas with plenty of interesting things to find.
 <br><br>
With the advent of broadband access becoming more mainstream every week, as hundreds of thousands of homes are gaining faster access to the internet, the lure of this incredible technology hasnt gone unnoticed by Brad and his team. A surprising amount of EQ players are using cable now, and DSL is becoming more and more prevalent. Still you get to a point where you still cant take full advantage because you still have a significant number of people using conventional analog modems, and thats not going to go away by the time the second generation games roll around. Maybe well see better concessions for broadband users when the third generation games come out, but no one can say for certain at this point.
<br><br>
He also explained that it would put a great strain on the internal fabric of the EQ franchise - the servers. There are issues on our end in terms of pumping out all that data, and the cost issues associated with that much bandwidth, and the huge pipes wed need coming into our servers. So we constantly need to analyze the data to make sure we remain cost-efficient in that area. Even if a user could handle 10Mb per second, its not very practical at this time to spew 10Mb to 290,000 users simultaneously. The more immediate benefits will come from downloading expansions or patches, and loading zones for users of that technology.

Verants future remains focused on creating immersive environments for hundreds of thousands of gamers. The future of gaming is always changing, and riding the crest of the next wave of gaming technology are the consoles; most notably the Playstation2 and X-box that are blurring the lines between PC and console games. Brad sees it as part of the companys evolution. Were very interested in experimenting with it and working on engines and communication libraries for next generation consoles. I feel very confident that at some point down the road massively multiplayer console games will be huge. There are a lot of issues that go along with that however. Many people who buy consoles are not as technically savvy and arent familiar with configuring modems or broadband, and the entire technical process that comes along with it. There is a lot of catching up to do on the side of the consumer there, as well as how we as developers can figure a way to make it easier for them to access the internet and help make that less of an entry barrier. There are issues with the hardware, as often times consoles have shipped with certain configurations or alternate equipment. It isnt always successful. [look at Segas Saturn - Atomic] I still think the console market has some maturing to do but is again, I think going to be huge. Console numbers have always been larger than the PCs, and I certainly think console gamers would enjoy playing a game with hundreds or thousands of their friends. I dont see any difference in the potential there. Were committed to exploring that and working on some technology foundation there, and when the time is right we will definitely have the games.
