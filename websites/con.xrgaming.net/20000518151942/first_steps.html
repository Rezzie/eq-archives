<HR><P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><Font CLASS="BaseHead">First Steps in EverQuest</FONT><BR>by <A HREF="mailto:darimar@xrgaming.net">Darimar</A></P><P>Well, after a long anticipated wait, I finally managed to acquire a PR account so that I may venture forth in the lands of Norrath, Phase 3. I had read numerous articles that have been written up in the recent months and found that most are quite enthusiastic, if not all-out worshiping of this grand title. I just had to play it! But there was something else I noticed about these articles. Most were written by those already quite experienced with the game. What about the newbies? What will their first experience be like? Darimar to the rescue! (or in this case, Tylin, who is my newbie character). </P><P>Now, before I jump into the good stuff, I'd like to clarify some of my goals here. Not only did I want to offer some opinions from a newbie perspective, I wanted to see for myself just how easy the game is to learn and use without getting an 'A' in EQ 101 (or in my case, a 'B-'). After spending eight years as a Software Quality Engineer, you learn that the design quality of a program's interface can pretty much be summed up in the first thirty minutes of tinkering around <I>without</I> reading the manual. If your design is good, a new user shouldn't have to refer to the docs for anything other than the most difficult of tasks. Unfortunately, I found myself needing to do this with EverQuest, and I'll go into more detail below. </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>The Birth of Tylin (an elf)</B> </P><P>After installing from the CD and waiting for the initial patches to download, I was greeted by the first glimpse of EverQuest... the beta agreement! Cool! I hurriedly clicked on "I accept" and waited impatiently to continue. The main option page is decorated with a couple of well endowed females engaged in battle. I'm embarrassed to admit that, more than once, my attention was deterred from the buttons on the right to the buttox on the left. Too bad they're not in color.... </P><P>Anyway, after locating the option to log in, I was quickly teleported to the character selection screen. Here, I found the option to create a new character and away I went, arriving soon at the character creation screen. "High Elf Cleric", I think was the default. Maybe Human Warrior would be more appropriate? But I wasn't too concerned. I had already chosen my desired race and class: Elven Ranger. Hmmm, no standard elf, and "Ranger" is not available for the high elf (I'll have to go back and read up on EQ's definition of high elf as I recall a different one from AD&amp;D). After locating the Wood Elf race, I then selected the class of Ranger and checked out the example character model in the center of the screen. The model struck me as quite similar to the ones in Heretic II. Personally, I expected more detail from a game that will release two years after the Quake II engine did. There's still plenty of time, though, and I hope a lot of attention will be given to character models and appearance. There is also a very limited number of choices for faces. I'd like to see a dozen or so for each race. I also noticed that, as the character "danced" around in demonstration of it's various movements, it appeared rather artificial. Motion capture would be a nice touch. But overall, I was not hindered by the character creation process. The ability customization on the right could have been made a little clearer, but I'm not sure how. I'm an AD&amp;D junkie and wasn't sure exactly how much better a 100 agility was than an 80. However, I quickly spent my 20 extra points on the choices I thought would make me a better character and continued. </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>A Spot on the Globe</B> </P><P>After completing the character creation task, I was greeted by a map with numerous places marked on it. My only complaint here, is that the invalid locations could be indicated a little more clearly from the valid one(s). Maybe display them in gray? It was also not immediately apparent just what I was doing at this map. Is this my birth place or my starting location? Perhaps some more obvious instructions could be placed at the top somewhere. Regardless, I quickly found my brain and continued onward. </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Who am I?</B> </P><P>After selecting my starting location, I was a bit confused to find myself back at the original character selection screen. For me, my new character didn't appear on the list right away, leading me to wonder if all that work was for naught. But a bit of patience (brain lag) gave the program the second or two needed for the screen to update and show my new character. One thing in this process I'd like to see is an option to just journey onward at the end of character creation, rather than having to go back and select my new character. I think 99% of the people who create a new character are going to want to play that new character right away. Please spare us lazy people this extra step. :) Anyway, a click or two later found me at the main chat window. Not much to comment on here, as it appeared to be a typical chat interface where one may socialize before venturing forth. The huge "Play EverQuest" button was my next objective. <I>Click...</I> </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Learning to Walk</B> </P><P>As with all newborns, there's a lot of learning to do up front. Well, since I had already learned to crawl and stand (I was standing, as far as I could tell), I first needed to learn how to walk. Well, being versed in the languages of Quake, Duke, Unreal and others, I clicked on the right mouse button and willed myself to move. </P><P>My legs refused... </P><P>I pressed the 'A' key like some games accept, but still my legs mocked me. </P><P>Aha! The up arrow must get the signal to my disobedient appendages! </P><P>Success! I moved! However, my real-life arms were not comfortable reaching to such unaccustomed angles, so I sought out an option to change it. And being the "huge" Quake fan that I am, I wanted to make my right mouse button move me forward. <I>Options | Mouse Controls</I>... What? How do I make my right mouse button move me forward? <I>Back | Keyboard Controls</I>... Huh? No way to do it here either. Needless to say, I'm mildly annoyed. </P><P>Back to the main interface. <I>Left-click, left-click-drag, right-click, right-click-drag.</I> Aha! I willed my head to look about! </P><P>Nice scenery! </P><I><P>Right-click + up arrow key</I> Hmmm. My arms are cramping up. <I>Right-click and hold+left click.</I> Hey, now were walkin'! And walkin' REAL SLOW! (Any chance this can be sped up just a tad?) </P><P>I attempted to convince my legs to run by holding down the "shift" key (yet another button), but to no avail. Where did I hear the controls are similar to Quake??? Well, turned out that I had inadvertently hidden the Run/Walk button beneath some other option (the inventory I think). If you want to do it from the keyboard, it's like <I>Up arrow and hold + Alt</I> then release the up arrow key and then the Alt key. Cripes!! This barrage of things needed to get the damn character to run would turn off all but the most patient of players. 989, please add a temporary key for running. In my opinion, the movement controls should be as close to other 3D games as possible. Yes, I know originality is sometimes good, but in this case, use what works. I will say, though, that after playing with the standard mouse configuration for a while, I did get used to it. I can see a need for it to work this way as well, but it would be nice if it was more consistent with other first person games. </P><P>Anyway, now that I'd gained some control over my body, I proceeded to look about the incredible city of Felewithe. I must applaud 989 Studios for this creation. Never before have I seen such a place in a game. The entire city is built above ground and with a graceful appearance appropriate for the elven populace. One problem, though. How the hell to I get down? I couldn't see any signs directing me to stairs, ropes or escalators! Side Note: Later on, I did find the way down. And it's pretty cool, too. :) </P><P>Well, I learned that jumping <I>isn't</I> a good way down. </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Kill or Run Away Screaming</B> </P><P>The gods were kind, though, and I soon found myself back to life, and on the ground this time! Now off to adventure. As I walked around the landscape, gazing upon the huge trees, I notice the myriad of players chatting with each other, yet, I see no one in my area. I yell out "Hail!", but no one responds. I find it discomforting that these voices fill my ears when there is nothing physical to attach them to. Despite that, I continue onward, seeing no one for several minutes. Then I run into an orc (or rather it ran across me). The realization sinks in as he proceeds to pummel me into submission. I hadn't learned how to equip my weapon, or even how to attack yet! Needless to say, by the time I figured out how to put my sword in my hand, click on the orc to target it, and then click on my primary weapon to engage it in melee, I was dead. I'd like to see a simple attack button that I can click on and <I>then</I> click on my target, rather than the other way around. I'm still not sure I fully understand combat, yet, though. :) I did notice that I couldn't see my weapon as I attacked or even while I held it in my hand. It appears in the inventory, but not in the main view. I hope this is still on the list to add. Hint, hint. All-in-all (after learning how to engage in melee), I found combat to be rather fun. With a little skill, one might be able to run in close to hit and then back off before the enemy can react. The AI seemed rather intelligent as well. While engaged with a skeleton, at one point it broke off and ran for several feet before turning on me again. Variety in battle! Now that's cool! </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Are Ye Deaf?</B> </P><P>After being bested by the orc, the gods were kind enough to return me to life again, and I was soon wandering the woods, the birds chirping happily in the tree-tops, the dew-touched undergrowth crunching beneath my boots, the wind whistling... Hey! Where <I>are</I> the birds? Where <I>is</I> the wind whistling through the leaves? In fact, there was no sound at all! I was <I>wondering</I> why the game seemed so lifeless. You do hear the sound of spells as they're cast, doors as they open and close, the sounds of battle, but the ambient sound is absent. Never fear, though. I've learned that Phase 4 will come with a new sound engine. Let's just hope the birds aren't forgotten this time. ;) And with the likely support for the latest in 3D audio, this could be one awesome experience! </P><P>It wasn't long before I found another player, a sexy female elf. Hubba, hubba! I helped her fell an attacking orc and quickly followed up with "Well done, milady! Are you well?" </P><P>Silence was her answer. </P><P>I began to ask again, but before I could mutter another word, she dashed off without so much as a nod. "How rude!" I thought, but then I began to wonder if I needed to learn to speak, in addition to walking and running. However, I knew only to type in my words and hit "enter". Must I speak in a special way for others to hear me as I hear them? Alas, I haven't researched this enough to understand it. I find it very difficult to follow conversations in the "log" window, though. Things scroll by so fast, I'm not sure if someone is talking to me or someone else. The method of communicating seems awkward to me. I must continually take my eyes from the main view area to see what people are saying, or even if they are talking to me. That could be a serious hindrance while in battle. Don't talk to me while I'm fighting. I won't hear you. :) With a little experience, however, one may find this method preferable, as text does not clutter up the main view area. </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Say Cheese!</B> </P><P>After learning to walk and flee from monsters I began to play around with camera angles. While this may be useful for taking screen shots, I found it impossible to play in. In any other mode other than first person, the mouse changes to control the angle and zoom of the camera. In my opinion, that is not the best way to do it. I think the mouse should be used to move your character regardless of what camera view you are in. Then, if you want to change the angle or zoom, use the keyboard. A game I feel has done a good job implementing the third person view is Heretic II. I suggest a similar method. </P><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Miscellaneous</B> </P><UL><LI>When I first got into the game, I noticed the log window flickering horribly and to the point where I could not read it. My mouse also left trails as it passed over the interface. I happen to be using a Voodoo2 card, and someone suggested that I turn off Triple Color Buffering in my card settings. That did the trick. However, I do not have any problems with other games, so I assume this is a problem that still needs to be addressed. </LI><LI>When entering my login name and password, I'd like to see an option to save my password. Those that get emailed after signing up will be difficult to memorize. If security is an issue here, I suggest letting us choose our own password, so that we may remember it more easily. </LI><LI>When logging in to the initial chat, it appears that you are currently identified by your login name. I think that's a mistake. I would like it to be your current character name. </LI><LI>I hear there is still work to be done on character models and textures. During my brief time in-game, I saw a limited variety of appearances. As I understand, there will be additional body styles, but what about clothing. Can I wear robes or a cloak? How about hats and boots and gloves? These are things I have yet to find out, but I'm optimistic. </LI></UL><P>&nbsp; </P><B><P>Conclusion</B> </P><P>As I mentioned before, one of my goals was to write up this article as a newbie in a new land. There are some problems I have with the game, and I hope I've related those properly so that they may be addressed. I am confident that the goal of 989 Studios is to listen to the public and to create a game that we will all enjoy. Also understand that, because this article was written based on such limited experience, it shouldn't be assumed that all the problems I ran into are relevant. Some of them may have been the result of my own assumptions on how the game should work. Either way, the game will be loved by some and hated by some. The bottom line is how <I>you</I> feel about it. In my opinion, the game <I>is</I> fun as it is now and will be even more so when it's done. 989 Studios is definitely going to take the gold for their efforts in creating, what I feel, will become one of the best online games of it's time. </P><P><CENTER><FONT CLASS="SmallFont"><A HREF="http://con.xrgaming.net">Crossroads of Norrath</A></FONT></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
