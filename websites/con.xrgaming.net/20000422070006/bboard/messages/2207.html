Why not just start a post saying &quot;My class needs to be improved&quot; and not &quot;My class compared to this one blah blah&quot;.  People that compare classes are the types of people that played tank mages in UO.  They want the benefits of every class.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wizards deal damage fastest and most powerful both in DD and AE.  That's what they do.  They also teleport (being one of the only ones which can tele into a certain plane at the moment).  That short amount of time that lets them cast faster is usually what can kill another casting class that is trying to get a spell off before he/she dies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can't compare wizards to magicians, necros or enchanters.  There are just too many negative areas in each class which cause them to be balanced to each other.  But of course people that post messages like that purposely don't count these negative sides from the other classes and instead just compare the fact that their class is 'bad'.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I would have posted this to that forum but probably would get flamed.  =P&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
