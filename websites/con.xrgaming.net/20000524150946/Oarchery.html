<HR> <P> <FONT CLASS="BaseFont">  <p align="center"><b>Treatise on Archery and Fletching</b> </p>  <p align="center"><b>&quot;What do you mean I can't use my bow standing next to the mob?&quot;</b></p>  <p align="left"><b>Introduction:</b> </p>  <p align="left">OK, here we go. But, first let me put forth a little background information about this research, and my motivation behind it. In sitting on the sidelines during P3, I constantly made mention of the fact that I <i>never</i> saw an archer EVER in any of the screenshots that made it to the various news sites. Every time I asked about it, I was always presented with the following answer: &quot;It's too expensive&quot;. So, I began researching it from the perspective of an outsider -- focusing on weapons charts, and class skill charts that I could find anywhere. Finally, when P4 started, I was eager to jump in and test the theories I had started developing, and was rudely interrupted by the simple fact that I had NO money, let alone enough to get by. So, needless to say, I was discouraged -- my primary character is Veranasta, a Human Ranger. I've played various and sundry incarnations of her for nearly 20 years now, and she has ALWAYS been a Master Archer. I didn't want that to change. </p>  <p align="left">Then, the trade skills happened. And the light blossomed -- the heavens opened -- the birds sang... Erhm, well yeah: you get the idea. The Fletching skill was turned on, and it encouraged me to actually put together some research INGAME, and I was floored by how wrong I was initially. Simply put, Archery is, even in and of itself, relatively cost effective. Add Fletching to the mix, and you have a wonderful alternative weapon for your character, that can aid you in many ways -- not the least of which is money. That's right, I said money. Continue on, Dear Reader, and see for yourself.</p>  <p align="left"><b>The Facts and Figures of Archery:</b></p>  <p align="left">OK, first off, let's look at Archery by itself, exclusive of Fletching. Since the prime argument against using Archery is that it is too expensive, let's look at it in comparison to the melee weapon that best approaches it in terms of Damage -- the Great Staff. Notice I said Damage, and not Damage Ratio. Why, you ask? Simple: Because the nature of archery is NOT like it is in UO. You absolutely cannot use your bow when the mob is within melee distance to you, so the key to archery is not ratio, but actual damage. The reason is due to the closing speed of mobs, as you will most likely only get one hit before it gets too close, and when they run away, you generally only need a few hitpoints, necessitating perhaps two hits to finish it off. Before I detail the exact numbers, let's clear up some possible confusion about how Archery works in terms of determining Damage Dealt. </p>  <p align="left">The Bow in Archery is only a quarter of the equation. The Arrow is not even that much. By far, the prime factors in determining Damage Dealt with <i><b>any</b></i> weapon are your skill rating AND your overall level. Please bear in mind that a &quot;Base Damage&quot; figure is only really a multiplier -- your skill and level is far more important in the final result than either your weapon/ammo combination OR your statistical bonuses (which do come into play with Archery, though how is not clear). There have been confirmed reports of character increasing the Damage Dealt with a melee weapon as much as <b>25%</b> by merely going up ONE level -- certainly, increases of 10-15% are common. With that in mind, then, let's look at the numbers as detailed by &quot;examining&quot; each item in game. </p>  <p align="left">With Archery, one must <b>add</b> the Base Damage figure for the bow and arrow together, to get the total Base Damage for the combination (the same applies to Range, as well). In our ongoing &quot;store-bought&quot; example, I will be using the <i>best</i> bow money can buy (from an NPC): the Long Bow. </p> <div align="center"><center>  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">   <tr>     <td align="center" bgcolor="#808080" colspan="6"><font size="3"><b>Archery Damage</b></font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Name</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Damage</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Delay</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Dam.

The cost of a Great Staff from a vendor NPC is 21p, 6g. Whoa! So, now we see that a Long Bow is not that expensive after all. &quot;But wait!&quot;, you say: &quot;I only have to buy that staff once, and I'll have to buy arrows for the rest of my life!&quot; True enough. However, let's do a little math and see what the difference in price can get you in arrows from an NPC: </p> <div align="center"><center>  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">   <tr>     <td align="center" bgcolor="#808080" colspan="2"><font size="3"><b>Price Comparison</b></font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Item</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Price</b></font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">Great Staff</font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">21p, 6g</font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">Long Bow</font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">3p, 9g, 6s</font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Difference</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">17p, 6g, 4s</font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Retail Value</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>1960 arrows</b></font></td>   </tr> </table> </center></div>  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust me on this one, folks -- Not only will you NEVER buy that many arrows at once (you can't carry that many, since you'd be encumbered into the dirt ;), but it will take you a LONG time to even use that many. Besides, Archery is NOT meant to be a primary weapon for any character, unless that character is acting as behind the lines artillery support in a group situation. This can get expensive, but you don't really think that buying arrows from the Fletcher NPCs is the best way to go, do you? Of course not -- that's why you're reading this (still, I hope!). The answer? The trade skill of Fletching. </p>  <p align="left"><b>Fletching: A Fiscally Responsible Archer's Paradise:</b> </p>  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me be blunt: If you are an Archer, you SHOULD be a Fletcher. I'd say, &quot;You <i>Have</i> to be a Fletcher&quot;, but looking at the above numbers puts forth a decent argument that it's not really necessary. However, in this world of Norrath, where money is SO rare, the <i>smart</i> Archer is also a Fletcher. However, this adds to the real &quot;cost&quot; of being an archer, spending skill points. Anyone who has spent any time at all in the world of Norrath can tell you just how difficult it is to put together more nearly 4 platinum -- JUST to buy the bow! So, the best thing to consider is any way to lower your entry cost into the Archery market. There are two ways to do this. One, is to buy a &quot;Hunter's Bow&quot;, which will only put you back 2g, 7s, 2c. This is a relatively reachable mark for even a Level 3 character. However, the cost of arrows for any Level 3 character is very high (relative to the influx of cash you get at that level), so while it's possible, I suggest that you do NOT take this tack. </p>  <p align="left">The best way to approach Archery is through Fletching. Now, this requires you to spend a goodly amount of skill points into the Fletching skill, in an effort to keep your materials cost down -- I suggest 10 skill points. Now, in order to do that, you must continue to Level, so that you can ALSO put skill points into your Archery skill, just to have a fighting chance at creatures for your level. Why? Because you only have a chance to gain skill points from taking on creatures that con Blue or higher to you, and if you don't use your Archery skill early on, it will too far behind your level to be able to successfully hit those types of creatures. <i>This</i> is the real cost of Archery -- you cannot save up those skill points for later -- at least not until Level 6 or so. I suggest that you do not try Archery seriously until you have been able to put in at least <i>half</i> of the max skill points for your particular level. </p>  <p align="left">Let's make this clear by using an example -- a Human Ranger. You start with 5 skill points at character creation, which the smart player applies to the weapon skill of whatever they have in their inventory (1-Handed Slashing for all Archery-capable characters, except Thieves who get Piercing). Continuing to Level 3 (you didn't spend any of those points at Level 2, did you?), you get Foraging, where unless you are a Wood Elf, you want to spend at least one point here, leaving us with 9 training points remaining. On to Level 5, Ranger's get Kick, so we spend one point there, and we have 19 left. Continue on to Level 7, and NOW we have 29 points, which is just about enough to take Archery seriously. Plus, we are now are a level where the mobs that work for us provided enough cash flow to support the Fletching necessary to keep us going. Here's how I'd spend the points: 10 to Fletching, and 19 to Archery (one below half of our Level Maximum). Those 10 points in Fletching are <i>vital</i> to making it a viably usable skill -- at least in terms of self-sufficiency, and the 19 Archery points give us a fighting chance at successfully hitting the mob we're attacking long range. You could probably get away with putting 14 points into Archery at Level 6, but bear in mind that a weapon skill only increases with a successful hit. I'll leave the final decision up to you. </p>  <p align="left">Now, what does that 10 points of Fletching get you? A LOT. I'll show you: First off, you want to buy a Fletching kit, which will put you back 1p, 1g, 3s, 1c. This is pretty expensive compared to other kits, but there is only one size, and no one I know has had theirs wear out. However, this more than pays for itself by two things. First, you can create arrows at a savings of more than 50% -- 4c instead of 9c from an NPC. The Fletching Book you can buy from an NPC tells you very important information regarding the creation of Arrows -- I suggest you buy it in game, and see for yourself. I've heard that keeping it (even if only in the bank) increases your chances of success, but I can't say this for myself (I bought the book and didn't sell it back). Long story short, there are 4 components to buy for your most basic arrow, and each component costs 1c. This &quot;Wooden Arrow&quot; that results from a successful fletch is the equivalent to the basic &quot;Arrow&quot; you can buy from an NPC. Now, how often does one succeed -- the key to maintaining fiscal fluidity with Fletching? At a Fletching skill of 10, I get somewhere between 3 out of 4 to 3 out of 5 success rate. For the sake of argument, let's say 3 out of 5. This makes our relative cost of an arrow 6.667c. Now, going back to our previous numbers with store-bought arrows, we see that at 9c per arrow, we can buy 1960 arrows. Even factoring in the cost of our Fletching kit and using the conservative estimate of 3 out of 5 success rate, this number jumps up to 2476 arrows. Bear in mind, at 10 Fletching skill, making the simplest arrows will still increase your skill for a few more points, increasing your success rate even further, and increasing your fluidity margin as a result. But, let's stay conservative, for argument's sake. </p>  <p align="left">I've come to the point where I must admit to being a bit hesitant in telling the truth, and I'm about to reveal the <i>real</i> secret of Archery and Fletching. But, in the interest of fair reporting to you, Dear Reader, here goes. There is another, far more amazing, benefit to spending those initial 10 points in Fletching -- you can create your own bows, as well. Now, there are far fewer Bowyer books out there (same rules apply here), so I'll let you find them. But let me run the risk of sounding like a fool by making this bold statement: <b>&quot;Even the least powerful bow that you can make for yourself is MORE powerful that any NPC store-bought bow.&quot;</b> And the bows you can make at higher levels of the Fletching skill are MIND-BLOWING in their possibilities. Again, I'll let you discover the particulars for yourself, but here's just one example. There is one part for a bow that costs in excess of 450 PLATINUM. And this isn't even the best one of its part type, nor does it even consider the use of some tools to make the bows even more powerful than normal. here are the hard numbers on the least powerful handmade bow, vs. the Store Bought Long Bow. </p> <div align="center"><center>  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">   <tr>     <th align="center" bgcolor="#808080" colspan="6"><font size="3"><b>Bow Comparison</b></font></th>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Name</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Damage</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Delay</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Dam.

In terms of price, I don't want to make mention specifically, since there's the chance of creation failure. But, if one is lucky and gets a successful Bowyering on the first shot, the cost to the Fletcher is UNDER 3 gold. Specifically at 10 skill, the success rate is slightly under 50/50. So, NOW let's add the consideration that the smart Archer doesn't buy a bow, but crafts one for themselves, and run the numbers again. Here's the full chart, comparing a store-bought Great Staff and a Handmade Hickory Bow with Hemp Bowstring. </p> <div align="center"><center>  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">   <tr>     <th align="center" bgcolor="#808080" colspan="2"><font size="3"><b>Price Comparison</b></font></th>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Item</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Price</b></font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">Great Staff</font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">21p, 6g</font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">Hickory Bow*</font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">5g,3s, 6c</font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Difference</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2">17p, 6g, 4s</font></td>   </tr>   <tr>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>Fletched Arrow Value**</b></font></td>     <td align="center" width="10%"><font size="2"><b>3160 arrows</b></font></td>   </tr> </table> </center></div>  <p align="left">* -- I'm basing this figure on one failure before you successfully make one (50/50 chance). </p>  <p align="left">** -- I am continuing with the assumption that the success rate of Fletching a regular Wooden Arrow is 3 out of 5. </p>  <p align="left">There you have it. If you still need convincing, then don't be an Archer! *smiles* </p>  <p align="left"><b>Concluding Notes:</b> </p>  <p align="left">Finally, I'd like to bullet some random notes about Fletching and Archery in general. They are in no particular order. </p>  <p align="left">-- One of the biggest complaints about Fletching when it first started was that you couldn't stack components. This is now possible. However, as a personal recommendation, I wouldn't suggest trying to create with stacks, as it's all-or-nothing. Yes, it can be tedious, but in terms of arrows, you're 99% of the time making them for yourself, so the numbers don't have to be too high. Use your judgement, based upon your financial status. </p>  <p align="left">-- Just because the easiest arrow and/or bow are as easy as it is, don't think that the next higher step is just a little harder -- it's not. It's ALOT harder. Just improving the bowstring from Hemp to the next level with the same Hickory Bow shaft decreases the success rate to less than 20% with the same skill, by my best judgments.</p>  <p align="left">-- &quot;Findables&quot; are more common now, it appears. Although, I credit this phenomenon with the fact that more players are into the higher-level areas, where mobs use bows and arrows. The gnolls in Blackburrow sometimes carry worn Hunting Bows and a couple of regular arrows. Bear in mind that any results you might see using this particular bow/ammo combination are FAR below what you'd get with the combinations I detail above. But, it might be of use to help improve your Archery skill at an earlier time, thereby saving you training points. </p>  <p align="left">-- If there are some of you out there that cling to the UO idea of Archery, forget it now. First off, there are not homing missile arrows -- you hit online, or not at all. Other things in front of your target (be they party members, or other mobs, or anything) that block your shot WILL block your shot, regardless of your bow, arrows OR skill.</p>  <p align="left">-- Once fired, and arrow is gone forever. This is both good and bad. A &quot;miss&quot; blinks out of existence completely; i.e., you can't find it on the ground. This is probably to prevent people from picking up arrows all over the world, and selling them, but is also possibly because having the servers constantly account for them would increase lag by a lot. That's all good. What's bad is that a &quot;hit&quot; will never be found on the &quot;body&quot;. I think this could be altered somewhat -- perhaps a 1 in 3 chance the arrow survived it's use. </p>  <p align="left">-- Archery does indeed improve slower than melee weapon skills, but for good reason. Technically, they increase at the same pace: about once every x times used, whatever x is. The key difference is, however, that one uses their melee skill about 20 times more often than Archery -- making you constantly put skill points in as you Level. If you like to hold your points for down the road, I'd suggest not choosing Archery as a weapon skill. Those training points are a huge cost in its use over time. </p>  <p align="left">-- The argument has been presented to me that in comparing the financial aspects of Archery and Fletching to the retail cost of a Great Staff, I am not making a valid comparison, since as the person said (paraphrased), &quot;No one buys melee weapons for retail anyway&quot;. That may or may not be true, but I defend my comparison on the grounds that, were Archery as popular as it could be, then no one would buy Bows for retail either, and then you have the argument about what's a fair price, blah, blah, blah. I will stick to the hard numbers that I witnessed wth my own eyes (having a 75 Charisma), and there's nothing more fair than that. Besides, now that I've let the cat out of the bag, as it were, regarding Bowyering, my guess is that no one will care about store bought bows anyway. And those handmade bows sell for a far lower price (based upon my observations in the /auction channel) than the store-bought bows, breaking us even again. That may sound confusing, so here it is in a nutshell: Perhaps no one pays retail for melee weapons, but I contend that the serious archer will not pay retail for his/her bow, either -- and the odds are they won't want an NPC-crafted bow in the first place. So, let's just use retail, as all auction prices are subjective, and such fluidity leads to all sorts of problems. </p>  <p align="left">Last but not least, do not consider Archery as a primary weapon skill -- it wasn't in real life during Medieval Times, nor is it meant to be in EQ. At it's most effective, the Archer uses his/her skill to lure mobs to the party, and finish them off when they run -- saving the mages needed mana should the party get jumped suddenly. It is possible to act as close support artillery while the warriors/paladins/monks act as tanks, but they will likely get in the way of your shot, making your success rate of hits plummet. </p>  <p align="left">So, enjoy the hunt! And appreciate the implementation of Archery in EQ, as I feel it's VERY effective, if you really look at it and take it seriously. But, you must be patient, and you must realize what's really meant to do. And, you must be willing to sacrifice training points over the entire lifetime of your character since it increases much more slowly in relation to your melee skills. </p>  <p align="left">-End</p>  <p><a href="http://con.xrgaming.net">Back to The Crossroads of Norrath News Page</a>.</p> </body> </html>
