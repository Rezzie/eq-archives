Yes it was the revenge of the mean critters in Commons.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So I zone in and low and behold what rare beast is stomping on by but a HG! Well it parked its butt right in front of me *Thanks invis spell* and just stands there. Well no more than a min later pop! A player zones in stomp stomp slice dead. Another player zones in stomp slice dead. And this was going on for a good 10 mins in a row with seven players dead. =)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After laughing my arse off I headed out ohhh! A young kodiak! So I cast my spell and pop five kodiaks poped out of nowhere and started to chase me. DOH! I make it to safely and wandered over a bit and zoned in again. A griffin pecks you for 96 dmg! DDDOOOOHHHHH! I quickly jump backwards into the zone line again safe for the time being.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So this is going great right? Every mean critter is hanging out on the other side of the zone. So I go invis once more and go in.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ah safe.. So I make my way to my hunting grounds by the lake and I don't know what hit me but it was some spell that hit me and pushed me right into the pirana infested water! So I'm being chewed up to death and I swim out to be pelted with arrows and another blasted spell pushed be right into the water again! It was some kind of wind spell or something... So I was dead pirana food and a practice dummy for a druid or ranger. &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Isn't life wonderful? =)">
