<INPUT TYPE=hidden name="obody" value="I started a High elf wiz without seeking advice on starting stats and ended up with what I call he HP of a gnat on steoroids.

Did ok for the first day, then boom!, I'm with a group and I cast my usual spell to assist in killing a medic and a mercenary starts hitting me. Two whacks, and I am dead! I go to get my corpse and just as I get everything together, I go to cast on an orc they are fighting and two warriers turn thier attention on me and I only cast once. Whack Whack, I'm dead! Dead twice in five minutes!! I'm quite disgusted and decide to go back to ole crushbone where I at least had not died like crazy and I get teleported there and I go into cb and go to the castle and I see a blue oracle and I cast on it and a legionarre comes rushing out and an emmisary and another leg from the other direction and its two whacks and I'm dead.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Im near in tears and I go get my corpse and go and I see nothing at castle, and I see the oracle spawned again and I think .. &quot;I've killed this oracle that spawns here many times before and never have I been swarmed before, its just my bad luck&quot; So I cast on it and I see a swarm of large orcs fly out of the Oracle cove and this time, I don't wait at all but start running to the zone to beat the band. &quot;An orc Legionarre tries to hit you but misses you.&quot; An orc Emmisary hits you for 44 damage&quot;, &quot;You are hit by the rift of frost&quot;. Orc legionarre hits you for ?? damage You are stunned. (Quadruple attack) You have been slain by an or legionarre&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After respawning, I contemplate my two bubbles of exp loss and I go to my corpse, gather all my things and go to kelethin and give everything I have away and after committing suicide several times jumping off kelethin and attacking the guards while weeping (It was born when it wasn't considered the purvey of a man to cry and I always considered that to be a load of crap) I deleted it and started over as a druid AFTER asking for advice.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now my druid is level 26 and two bubbles, I'm happy with him, he rarely dies and can meelee for more than two nanoseconds before being killed. He's survived trains 3 times as big as what decimated my wizard in 3 seconds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So, the dumbest thing was creating that wiz with those stats. The smartest thing I did was deleting it and starting over. I wasn't happy with the wiz anyway. Druids get much finer stuff - Sow, Heals, Teleport, Binding. ">
