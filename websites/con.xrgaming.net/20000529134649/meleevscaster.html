<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two distinct class types in Everquest, spellcasters and melee characters.
Melee characters compose of Monks, Rogues, Paladins, Rangers, Warriors and Shadowknights.
Spellcaster classes compose of Wizards, Clerics, Shamans, Magicians, Necromancers, Druids,
Enchanters and Bards who in my opinion is the middle of the two. I&#146;m am going to
offer a small rant in defense of the melee classes because in my opinion spells and new
abilities make the game fun and for most melee classes their growth and development can be
quite ordinary and quite frankly repetitive. </p>

<p>Let&#146;s look at spellcasters, they get a new set of spells every 5<sup>th</sup>
level. So for their entire career they get new abilities all the way to level 49 where
they receive their top-notch spells. Now they don&#146;t get a lot of the abilities that
melee classes do, but the skills that melee classes get are really just new lines that
appear across the screen. I played a rogue to level 22 and I must admit it was a lot of
fun but once I hit the barrier and got one of my final three remaining skills I began to
wonder what exactly I had to look forward to past this level. I must say I questioned if I
would continue and I decided to start over as a spellcaster. Spells make the game and much
wonder why we are seeing less and less good tanks around. Well the reason is simple, melee
characters pretty much have the same role throughout their career. To play 30 days worth
of game time building a character to level 50 with just a handful of skills and no real
interesting things past the 20&#146;s I began to wonder how people can stand playing their
melee characters past the point I did. Most melee characters save hybrids don&#146;t have
much versatility, warriors and rogues come to mind quickly. Rogues get some neat skills
but a lot of them are either useless or just aren&#146;t viable. I was told by someone
that instill doubt was a great skill once you build it up because you could cause the
monster to flee and get in a nice backstab. Well they screwed instill doubt by making it
so you can&#146;t backstab the creature on a successful instill doubt. Not to mention the
fact that the skill raises so pathetically slow that I&#146;d rather not wait 10 levels
for it to even start being of any use. Warriors while needed in parties just don&#146;t
have anything over other melee classes other than higher caps, which is merely numbers if
you want to pay attention to it. Having a higher cap is not something that will make a
game last. Having unique abilities to your class is. If warriors were to get say a super
attack that they could use every 15 seconds that would make the class fun. Also giving
them say specialization ability where they say attack a little quicker than other classes
would be a nice addition. Of course these abilities would be for higher levels past 30. I
mean what do you have to log forward to past 30 once you get that final skill for melee
classes? Hybrids get a few new spells but rogues, warriors and monks get nothing, just
more numbers. I really feel Verant needs to do something to make goals for these
characters past level 30.</p>

<p>Spellcasters always have new spells to look forward to, always a new spell to try out,
always doing more damage or better tricks to do to monsters. They look forward to better
buff spells, better direct damage spells, new summons, etc, etc, etc. This is why you are
seeing a lot of druids popping up because well they get some of the neatest spells in the
game. I am now playing a druid for this same reason. At level 24 I get to change into a
wolf. At level 29 I can teleport parties across the land of Norrath. At high levels I can
change my whole party into wolves, now tell me that isn&#146;t something to shoot for? You
might say items also are something to shoot for, sure but it doesn&#146;t equal out melee
versus spellcasters does it? I mean both types have equal amounts of items to shoot for.
My druid after conducting a trade can always put a smile on the other persons face after
our business has been conducted by giving them Spirit of the wold and a levitate. I&#146;m
sure they have a blast running around with that =). Bards get a new spell every level!
Always something new when they level up, that makes bards fun all the way to level 50. Now
my goal may seem like hitting level 50, no it really isn&#146;t. My goal is to have a ton
of fun all the way to level 50. With my rogue I was so burned out because the only thing I
had to look forward to was new items because my abilities just weren&#146;t cutting it for
goals anymore. </p>

<p>Rogues are a different story, most say that they are fine most likely because they
probably played one into the teens. Sure it was so much fun playing my rogue through those
levels but past double attack you might think those next abilities will be fun but once
you get them it&#146;s just a big disappointment as to really what use they are. How much
fun would it be for rogues at say level 35 to get a new ability called climb walls? The
ability to climb a sheer vertical surface would be awesome and fun to show off. A new
skill at level 32 called sprint where the rogue could run at normal speeds while hidden
and with a sneak type effect on at the same time. Now that would be useful. Or how about a
skill called disguise, which would give rogues the ability to change their form? Say
disguises themselves into another race such as ogres or trolls? That would be quite the
fun thing to do! But instead we get bland abilities that don&#146;t offer much in the way
of new opportunities to play what a rogue is to us in our eyes. </p>

<p>Well I&#146;m done ranting now, don&#146;t tell me I&#146;m a whiner or wrong because
well quite frankly it&#146;s just my opinion and well we all have our own. I just hope
Verant realizes that some new things need to be offered at high levels for the melee
classes other than just weak spells for hybrids and more hit points and numbers. </p>
