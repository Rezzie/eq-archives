<HR> <FONT CLASS="BaseFont"> <P ALIGN="CENTER">The High Road</P> <P ALIGN="CENTER"></P> <P>&nbsp;</P> <TABLE WIDTH="100%"> <TR> <TD WIDTH="75%"> <FONT CLASS="BaseFont"> <FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>Breath leaving my body in great spasms of hot steam; my arms clutched round each other as I bounced on my heels to keep warm, and relieve tension.  </P> <P>&quot;Are you alright?&quot;</P> <P>&quot;Aye…I’m alive.&quot;  The apprentice wizard was slumped against the ice-cold stone walls of the region, the gaping wound on his leg knitting itself back together quickly.  The other wounds, the lighter ones, were barely even visible now; the healing powers of a druid are nearly unmatched.  &quot;Are you sure you know where you’re going?&quot;</P> <P>I scowled at him.  &quot;Of course I do.  I’ve traveled this path a few times before…and besides, I can find my way anyplace.&quot;  Sure, if only <I>he</I> would believe that.  Truth was, I had no clue which way we were to go.  These icy mountains were a labyrinth of twists and turns, with Tunare-only-knows what lay behind each corner.  I should like to blame it on the environment- there was no sun to guide me here, the sky was blanketed in heavy clouds.  There were no creatures to tell me which way to go, no visible signs of the elements at all to direct me.  That would be an easy enough excuse, except that I have been through these peaks time, and time again.  I should know my way.  Some druid; I felt as though I had been kept away in a tower all my life…much like my high elven friend.  At least he had an excuse.  I had a feeling, though…a terrible feeling that our way out of this maze was past the tunnel…the one area which had a path well-trodden by many feet…though it was dark, and as we just found out, contained beings of the…less noble mindset.  We had been attacked by two such creatures.  Gnolls, though taller than their cousins near Qeynos.  And surely more powerful.  Thank the light a guardsman noticed our near-murder, and came immediately to our aid.</P> <P>&#9;&quot;Come on, then…get up.&quot;  I outstretched my arm towards Samwen, and he heaved a sigh as he let me pull him up.  And so, we once again progressed down the lightless tunnel.  Not far along, I heard a shuffling of feet in the distance- I jerked to a stop, and turned around to motion for Samwen to keep quiet…but when I turned around, I saw the look of horror on his face.  Then I felt the axe drive into my back.  I fell over in terrible pain, unable to breathe, much less run from my assailant.  I heard Samwen calling out to me, yelling, &quot;Eron, <I>get up</I>!! The guards aren’t too far from here- you have to run!&quot;  Fending off blows from my would-be murderer, I rose to my knees…then my feet…before I moved, I willed my skin to knot together once again- and I instantly felt anew.  I dashed off to find this guard of which my friend spoke, when I saw Samwen waving frantically, and pointing at me.  <I>Whack</I>.  A blow to the head.  Dizzy….where is he? Two? I clamped my eyes shut for a moment, reopened them and forced them to focus- and I ran like the wind for the form of my friend.  </P> <P>&#9;The guard was drunk…or asleep…or…a friend of my killer?!  I ran around, calling for his assistance, shouting for any aid at all, and the soldier walked away from me, without a glance.  I began to chase him…and received another stab to my back…and another.  And before I could cast a spell of healing, my world went black.  I could vaguely hear Samwen shouting curses at the halfling who so easily brought me down…and the rain of blows stopped.  I awoke, for a moment…long enough to shout to my friend, &quot;Run, you fool!  You are next once I am dead! Run <I>now</I>!&quot;  And so he left me there, to face the scarred, snarling, grizzly rogue.  The evil thing didn’t even say a word as he took the last slice of life away from me…</P>  <P ALIGN="CENTER">**</P> <P ALIGN="CENTER"></P> <P>&#9;The gods showed mercy on my soul, and awakened me to life once again, in the city of Freeport.  I was days away from my friend and companion. I had no food, no water, and nothing but the clothes on my back.  I sent him a thought…&quot;I come.  Wait for me in safety, I shall be back to my place of death shortly.&quot;  I heard his acknowledgment within the roaring storm inside of my head.  And so, I began the journey once again…alone, exhausted, and aching.</P> <P>After days and nights of creeping through the woods unseen, running for my life like a madman, I arrived in the Kithicor Forest, where Samwen waited for me, with a beaming smile on his face.  We cheered and laughed as I ran near, and embraced as I arrived.  Finally, we could get on with our journey!  And what a better surprise- he had gone back to the spot where my corpse lay, and retrieved all of my items for me.  As he handed them to me- he held a sly grin on his face…as though he knew something that I didn’t.  </P> <P>&quot;Alright…What is it?&quot;  His grin spread to cover his entire face as he cleared his throat…then recited, in a terribly lofty way, the precise directions though Highpass Hold!  A traveling Erudite was good enough to give them to him…And so we were off at last!</P> <P>The trip through the icy mountains was swift, and easy, thanks to the traveler.  Soon, we found ourselves in The Karanas…the descent down the mountain into the plains was truly amazing.  Someone, or many someones, must have taken many, many painstaking years to complete it.</P> <P>Days passed, and the adventure was great.  Fleeing from Lions, charging their cubs- hiding behind bushes to watch the great Hill Giants stomp past…excitement and terror filled the both of us, until finally, after what seemed like forever, the gates of Qeynos came into view.  And that is where the story begins.</P> </TD> <TD VALIGN="TOP"> <A HREF="screenshots/eobear1.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eobear1sm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> <A HREF="screenshots/eobear2.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eobear2sm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> <A HREF="screenshots/eobridge2.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eobridge2sm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> <A HREF="screenshots/eoeronsits.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eoeronsitssm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> <A HREF="screenshots/eoface3.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eoface3sm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> <A HREF="screenshots/eoqeynossign.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eoqeynossignsm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> <A HREF="screenshots/eowaving.jpg"><IMG SRC="screenshots/eowavingsm.jpg" BORDER=0></A><P> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </BODY> </HTML>
