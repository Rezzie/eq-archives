<INPUT TYPE=hidden name="obody" value="Kedge is really a lot like Lower Guk in level range. The Lancers are like the Shin/Vis/Wan part of the frog spectrum.

You'll want a healer or two to try them: they hit very hard for mobs of their level - into the 60s and low 70s sometimes. It will probably be difficult to talk enough folks into trying it. But, if you do, it'll only take one or two kills before you'll start hearing &quot;wow, awsome exp&quot; coming through /group.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And, unfortunately, it only takes one or two drownings to break a groups morale. Ah well, risk is commensurate with reward.">
