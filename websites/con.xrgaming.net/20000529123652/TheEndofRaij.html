<HR> <P> <FONT CLASS="BaseFont">  <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><H4 ALIGN="CENTER">The End of Raij</H4>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P>&#9;Raij thought that it would never come to this – that the very air could be filled with death; that it would waft on the breath of his brethren, the trees and the plants; that such darkness could be made to permeate even the All Mother’s goodness.</P>  <P>&#9;It made him sick.</P>  <P>&#9;It made him despair.</P>  <P>&#9;But most of all it made his bones burn with anger.</P>  <P>&#9;It was all the fault of the Orcs.  Their evil had sapped the lives of so many.  His parents, his friends, all died at their hands.  So deep and profound was his hate for the denizens of Crushbone Keep that he dedicated his life to their extinction.  And he was good at it.  Filling his days with an endless number of broken bodies.  Honing his skills at the expense of their dishonorable lives.  He had littered the fields with their dead and been proud of it.</P>  <P>&#9;How ironic that that would bring about the downfall of all he sought to defend.</P>  <P>&#9;What a cruel twist, that their corpses feeding the grass and the trees with their decay would quietly poison the forest until it came to this.</P>  <P>&#9;Nature corrupted.</P>  <P>&#9;Nature dying.</P>  <P>&#9;Raij felt, at least in part, responsible.</P>  <P>&#9;What was worst of all was that it seemed that few, if any, noticed the change that spelled their doom.  A few did, he had seen them about in the tree-city his folk called home crying that the end was near and getting drunk at the inns.  But none listened.  They just laughed and scoffed and went about their business.  Some grew agitated and even started fights with the doomsayers.  Everyone this day was quick to anger.</P>  <P>&#9;It seemed that people responded to the corruption of the land, even without recognizing it for what it was.</P>  <P>&#9;Doing his best to ignore his phobia for crowded places such as this, Raij made his way to the guildhall of his friend, Kaali the Druid, just in time to see his sometime companion emerging haggard from the Guildhall door.</P>  <P>&#9;&quot;Hail, Soapfoot!&quot; he called, drudging up an old joke between friends.</P>  <P>&#9;Kaali greeted him half heartily.  The druid looked haggard, and though his skin was unblemished – the healing of his magic assured that – his countenance was that of one who’d recently seen the business end of someone’s club.</P>  <P>&#9;&quot;You look like something even the cat would refuse to drag in.  What have ye been up to?&quot;</P>  <P>&#9;Kaali blanched at the insult, but was quick to relate the tale of the previous day’s &quot;quest&quot; (his term).  It seems he had determined to visit the high-elf city – a ghastly, claustrophobic place – then offended the townsfolk by taking a dip in their moat, and been kicked out.  He had then helped out some of the fools who’d been waylaid by an orcish raiding party.</P>  <P>&#9;At that last I began to get an idea.</P>  <P>&#9;Listening to him talk, I realized how much he relished the combat, even as unsuited for the task as he was.  When he got to talking about a certain warhammer he fancied, but could not afford, I knew I had him.</P>  <P>&#9;&quot;Ever seen Crushbone?&quot; I asked, knowing he hadn’t.  </P>  <P>&#9;What I was contemplating was suicide, and involving my friend in it was tantamount to murder, but I knew what I smelled in the air around me.  The world was dying.  The trees, the grass, the land.  Not in years or months.  Evil had poisoned all that grew in the wood, and it was dying now.  </P>  <P>There was maybe a day left, little more.</P>  <P>And if everyone was about to die anyway, it seemed no crime to have them dying for a noble cause – that of striking a blow at the heart of the evil that had caused our downfall.</P>  <P>Of course I could tell none of this to Kaali, so I regaled him with tales of wealth to be found in the pockets of the dead we would be producing inside the orc caves.  Once, long ago, I had taught him how to make cash for what could be killed and collected from the wood, and ever since he had assumed in me a mercenary spirit.</P>  <P>I used that to my advantage now.</P>  <P>Soon, he was convinced and we were making our way.  Alone I could do little to hurt those that would soon be killing us, but with the help of his magic, perhaps I could strike a blow that would count – something to assuage my fury for all they had taken, for all they would take.</P>  <P>The trek to the orc camp was easy.  I’d been there often enough, and Kaali and I were quick to join a throng of warriors battling those orcs foolish enough to show their ugliness in the light of day.</P>  <P>To me it was nothing new, but it fueled Kaali’s confidence and bloodlust, and soon he was bombarding me with requests to go further.</P>  <P>I told him to wait, so that I might have a chance to scout out the keep.  I had wandered across the entrance once, but was much younger then, and thought only of escape.  Finding it again proved difficult.  I followed the orc footpaths, but their meandering branches quickly had me lost, and I gave up their direction for that of my own skills.</P>  <P>Finding the cave that way was easy.  I merely followed the stench.</P>  <P>Soon I found myself on a hill overlooking the keep, and quickly made the call to signal Kaali to follow.  Twin orc guards stood beside twin bonfires in front of the cave entrance.  They were oblivious to my presence.</P>  <P>I shivered in the night air, muscles twitching with the thrill of the hunt.</P>  <P>A few minutes later I heard a rustle of leaves and the light tinkling of men in armor moving stealthily.  I turned to find Kaali trundling along with a band of dwarven warriors.  Kaali ran up to greet me and I felt a twinge of anger at his lack of caution, but looking at the band of fighters he’d brought with them filled me with hope.  These were powerful fighters, and their aid would help us cut deep into the heart of our foes.</P>  <P>Kaali bantered with the dwarves briefly, but I paid little attention.  I was intent on the guards below.  Fortunately they heard nothing over the roar of the bonfires, and the wind blew from them to us, carrying our scents safely away.  </P>  <P>The leader of the dwarves, whispered orders to his lieutenant and two soldiers made for the guards with more speed than their tiny frames seemed capable.  Their movement was stealthy, loud only to my trained ears, and in a second the first guard was down.  The second went a moment later.</P>  <P>What happened next was confusing at best, as most battles usually are.  We rushed the cave in force, and three more guards inside went down.  I spied Kaali and some others looting corpses, but I couldn’t wait.  I rushed ahead, rounding a corner and quickly discovering that the Crushbone cave opened back upon a hidden valley.  Several orcs milled about, obviously unprepared for an advance on their homes.</P>  <P>I and several of the dwarves quickly relieved them of their lives.</P>  <P>Something was definitely wrong.  Within minutes we had cleared the area of orcs, but it had been to easy.  This was the orc’s home, and yet only a handful were here.  There was no sign of tents, houses, no orc city.</P>  <P>Quickly noting that both Kaali and the dwarves were all right, I began searching out the craggy wall of the valley, in search of my answer.  A stream cut deep through the rocky floor, and I had to hop from stone to stone in places to advance.  A lone tree grew thick in a cleft in the rocks, and as I approached its gnarled trunk, I saw what I had been looking for.</P>  <P>On the other side of the cleft, the orc city lay.</P>  <P>My heart sank.  </P>  <P>Before me stood not a camp, but a whole city, teeming with my sworn foe in numbers I couldn’t even begin to count.  Huge warriors in armor mingled among the rabble.  </P>  <P>I knew I had come here to die, but for the first time I felt my death upon me.  It made me feel old.</P>  <P>Just then, I heard Kaali call my name from somewhere behind me.  I turned just in time to see him hopping across the stream at a spot I knew was too wide to jump, but I was too late to warn him.  He went down, splashing noisily into the rapidly moving water.</P>  <P>I raced after him, chasing as his body sped down the stream carried on swift currents, but I could not keep pace with the stream.  Several of the dwarves had also seen him fall and were speeding along the far side of the stream, but it curved away from them in a direction they could not follow.</P>  <P>I went on alone, cursing myself for dragging him into this mess.</P>  <P>Without thinking I followed the path of the stream blindly, stopping only when I realized that it had carried me right through the middle of the orc camp.  Before me a lone orc looked up from a campfire.  Shock at my presence seemed to hold him for a moment, and I took the opportunity to put the blade of my battle axe in his throat before he could loose a cry for help, then sped on after my fallen friend.</P>  <P>The blow was late, and though the first orc fell, half a dozen appeared to replace him.  I charged into the fray, ducking blows, and swinging wildly with my axe.  As I landed each blow I dedicated them to those who had fallen by orcish hand – my father, my mother, the land, the trees.  When I was done, I stood alone.</P>  <P>Ahead the stream flowed into a cave, and I heard the sounds of splashing and battle.  Without thinking, I dashed into the cave, hoping to find my friend intact.</P>  <P>As I entered the cave my hopes were dashed.  Kaali lay flat on his back, blood flowing swiftly from wounds to his head and his back.  An orc centurion lay dead next to him, but the legionarre standing over Kaali’s body was very much alive.  His club was raised over his head to strike the killing blow.</P>  <P>Just then three arrows sprouted from the orcs massive chest.  Somehow the dwarves had found their way here.  The orc staggered back, and I lunged, burrying my axe in his forehead.</P>  <P>The battle was over.</P>  <P>Below, Kaali groaned.  I knelt to him and felt my heart sink in my chest.  His skull was fractured, and his back bent at an impossible angle.  I knew it was broken.  Without thinking I did my best to bind his wounds, knowing that it was too late, and when that was done, I carried his limp form from the caves.</P>  <P>I had killed my only remaining friend.</P>  <P>Setting him down, I mumbled a prayer to the All Mother, wishing him in the next life, better times than he had known in this one.  Then I muttered a prayer for myself.</P>  <P>I said:</P>  <P>&quot;All Mother, this world’s time is at hand.  I give my life unto your service, gladly, and when it ends I pray that you will take my bones, and make of them what goodness you may.  This world is ended, but like all things, it will begin anew.  </P> <P>&quot;I hope to be a wiser soul in that world, than I have been in this.  And I will serve you always."</P>  <P>And then I returned to the caves, to face my death as I had faced my life.</P>  <P>In battle.</P>  <P>&nbsp;</P></FONT></BODY> </HTML>
