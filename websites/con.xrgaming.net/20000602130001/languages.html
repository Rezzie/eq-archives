<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong><big>What language are we speaking?</big></strong></font></p>

<p>It seems pretty clear from where I'm sitting that the majority has spoken. I a poll
conducted at the CoN over the last few weeks we've taken in over 350 votes. </p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td><big><strong>75% of us made it clear!</strong></big></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF0000"><big>66%</big></font><font color="#800000"> </font></strong>want
to: &quot;Greatly reduce the initial understanding of the common tongue for non human
races&quot;<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><strong>9%</strong></font> are more dramatic and want to:
&quot;Eliminate the common tongue from the initial understanding of the non human
races&quot;<br>
<strong>22%</strong> want to: &quot;Keep it as it is.&quot;<br>
<strong>1%</strong> want to: &quot;Give all characters a basic understanding of all
languages.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<p>I've felt for some time, that the language aspect of EQ provides on of the greatest
roleplaying opportunities in a long time, but as every race begins with such an easy way
of communicating with each other, it is utterly lost. Please Verant, here our prayer!</p>

<p>There is so much opportunity for roleplaying &amp; racial unity that can come from this
opportunity. We implore you! 71% of us say that the increased chances for roleplay
outweigh the added burden of losing the easy common tongue... you don't have maps or
'recall o rama' either, as convient as they may be. Please... Verant, here our prayer!</p>

<p>Just imagine... Having reduced the initial understanding of the common tongue- the
female wood elf who travels to a distant land known as freeport, will have to speak with
her lost half brother (a half elf ) - in hopes of finding <font color="#BE0064"><em>Boots</em></font>®
the Human Necromancer who has been secretly sending her love tokens for so very long.</p>

<p>And that's just the beginning!</p>
