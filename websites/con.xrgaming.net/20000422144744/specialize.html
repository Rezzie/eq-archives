<p align="left"><br>
When pure spell casters (Wizards, Magicians, Enchaters and Necromancers) reach level 20,
30 in the cases of Clerics,&nbsp; Druids and Shamans, they are given the ability to
specialize in the different schools of magic. The different schools of magic are:
Alteration, Abjuration, Evocation, Divinination, and Conjuration. One can specialize in
all of them, but you may concentrate only in one school. You get better in a given
specialization school as you put practice points in the given skill or cast spells of a
given school.<br>
<br>
Specialization in a school of magic is independant of your school skill. You may be a
master in Conjouration, yet very bad in Specialize Conjouration. Specializing in a school
gives the caster the benefits of fewer fizzles and a decrease in mana usage when using a
spell of the school you have specialized in.&nbsp; This is a key thing to keep in mind
when deciding which school to concentrate in.</p>

<p align="left">The school in which you concentrate in is determined by the first
specialization skill that reaches 51.&nbsp; If you have 50 in Specialize Conjouration and
50 in Specialize Diviniation and you want to concentrate in Diviniation, you can either
put a practice point it Specialize Diviniation, or pratice Diviniation based spells.&nbsp;  Once you have selected your concentration, all other specialized schools will be capped at 50.  The order in which the Specialization skill show up on the trainers is: Alteration,
Conjuration, Abjuration,&nbsp; Evocation, and Divination.</p>

<p align="left">Now lets take a look at the classes that can specialize and look at the
schools you might want to make your concentration and why.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u><a name="Clerics">Clerics</a></u></p>

<p align="left">Clerics may have a tough time choosing the school they want to concentrate
in.&nbsp; The healing and resurection spells use the skill Alteration, thus allowing the
Cleric to heal more in a given battle.&nbsp; Another role of the Cleric is to inflate the
presense of his warriors by buffing them.&nbsp; Buffing uses the school of Abjuration, and
concentrating in this would reduce down time after buffing the party since less mana may
be used.&nbsp; Lastly Clerics are very good verus the undead.&nbsp; The Ward Undead line
of spells, as well as other direct damage spells use the Evocation skill.&nbsp; So
concentrating in this would allow the Cleric to take on more undead foes since the Ward
Undead lines of spells would become that much more mana efficent.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u><a name="Druids">Druids</a></u></p>

<p align="left">Druids have a bit of everything.&nbsp; They need to consider concentrating
in Abjuration to reduce the down time when buffing their party.&nbsp; Alteration for the
ever desired healing, labor reducing traveling and evacuation spells.&nbsp; A Druid's DoT
combat spells come from the school of Conjouration.&nbsp; And a Druid's combat direct
damage spells rely on Evocation.</p>

<p>(Thanks to Mintaka for this insight.)</p>

<p align="left">Back to the <a href="#top">top</a>.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u><a name="Enchanters">Enchanters</a></u></p>

<p>Enchanters have many schools to choose from for their concentration.&nbsp; The first
one a young enchanter might look at would be Abjuration.&nbsp; This skill is all about
buffing shield spells. Another would be for Conjouration.&nbsp; This is used to summon the
Enchanter's animations as well as some of their combat spells.&nbsp; Evocation is the
heart of the Enchanters direct damage spells.&nbsp; Divination is the key for all of the
shape shifting spells.&nbsp; The final school an Enchanter might want to concentrate in
would be Alteration since most of the combat related spells fall into this category.</p>

<p>(Thanks to Mynx Incantare (Povar)&nbsp; for the information provided on Enchanters)</p>

<p align="left">Back to the <a href="#top">top</a>.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Magicians"><u>Magicians</u></a></p>

<p>A Magicians strength lies in Conjuration and Evocation. Conjuration is used to summon
pets, weapons, food, and various other items. There are also some DD spells used by the
Conjuration skill such as the &quot;shock&quot; line of spells. Evocation is primarily
used for the other line of DD spells, burn and bolt spells. </p>

<p>(Thanks to Zolthar for these views on Magicians)</p>

<p align="left">Back to the <a href="#top">top</a>.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u><a name="Necromancers">Necromancers</a></u></p>

<p align="left">The Necromancer, Master of Damage over Time.&nbsp; Necromancers are also
second only to the Cleric versus the undead.&nbsp; DoT spells come in two flavors. &nbsp;
Those that use Alteration (The heat blood series) and those that use Conjouration (The
darkness line).&nbsp; Also summoning pets and the limited DD spells that a Necromancer
have use the Conjouration school.&nbsp; On the flip side of the coin, the Necromancer's
life suking line of spells use Alteration.&nbsp; So the Necromancer much choose between
lower down time after summoning a pet, more mana effecient DD spells, and able to cast
more of the darkness line of DoT spells, versus mana effecient life sucking spells and a
more mana efficient Heat Blood line of spells.&nbsp; Another thing the Necromancer would
want to consider is that the Ward Undead line of spells use the Evocation school of magic.
</p>

<p align="left">Back to the <a href="#top">top</a>.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><a name="Shamans"><u>Shamans</u></a></p>

<p>The two things that shaman are best at are healing and buffing. Almost all of the
buffings spells and all of the healing spells are fall within the realm of Alteration.
Being able to cast healings more often for less manna will save lives in combat,&nbsp; and
make you an even more valuable member of the group. As you travel through Norath, you will
find that you are most known and loved for your buffs, which are much more diverse than
simply Spirit of the Wolf. The only problem with buffs is that they tend to be manna
expensive, so casting them for less manna is definitely very wecome, and will allow your
group less&nbsp; down time waiting for you to regain that all important healing manna for
when the battle begins.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><u><a name="Wizards">Wizards</a></u></p>

<p align="left">Wizards....&nbsp; there are really only two things a Wizard might want to
consider concentrating in.&nbsp; All the attack spells of the Wizard use Evocation. &nbsp;
Concentrating in this would make your mana effcient spells even more mana efficient.&nbsp;
The other thing to consider would be alteration.&nbsp; This shcool of magic is used for
group gate spells as well as the evacuation spells.</p>
