<HR> <P>  <p align="center"><b>OOC Comments from Jythri, Bard and Wanderer.</b></p>  <p><b>1) How do you prepare for your performances? </b><br> Well, obviously a lot of PR has to be done, announcements both in and out of game. I also try and find a few people to help me with the event, either as announcers, or crowd-control, or as performers. I also set up several macro screens for the things that ARE repeatable, like beginning and ending a song, clearing my throat, waving, etc. Then, I double-check things that could get in the way, like being sure that jump isn't set to the space bar like it used to be, and removing Chords of Dissonance from my memorized song list, just to avoid accidental death from upset guards (Yes, it has happened.) </p>  <p><b>2) How did this performance compare to past ones in P3? </b><br> This was the highest-attended concert I've put on. Of course, that means it was also the most lag-burdened. Until yesterday, I had never crashed during a concert, either formal or informal. Yesterday, I crashed 7 times, but was able to get in fast enough so as not to lose most of the crowd. Also, there were a lot more rude people in this concert, probably a testament to their being many more KewlDoods in this Phase than the last. I've never had a problem with stage divers before yesterday. Just for the record, I don't like that type of thing, and I DO keep names of people who interrupt out-of-character. </p>  <p><b>3) Will you be performing again in the future? If so, will you travel to different towns?</b><br> Absolutely. My whole goal with Jythri is to capture some of the in-game legends, and cast them in a light similar to what a true bard might have. That gives other players a nice ramp for RP, I find, and helps set a good tone for the rest of the game. I'll host one more large concert in Phase 4, and then in the commercial release, I will probably hold about one per month. Of course, I sing small concerts about every other night as I travel normally. Trust me, it doesn't take much prodding to get me to sing a song or two! </p>  <p><b>4) The songs are very fluent, how do you type it so quickly? </b><br> What can I say! I write software instructional materials for a living, so typing is an important part of my job. Also, I spent many, many years playing MUDs which are all about typing. Everything you do in a MUD to build a character has to be typed in since MUDs are entirely text-based. Bottom line: I'm just fast. No, I don't use macros. EQ doesn't have enough macro space for even one song, let alone seven or eight of the length I write.(My longest ballad, The Ballad of Cein the Rogue, takes 45 minutes to perform in-game in its entirety, typing at Jythri-speed.) </p>  <p><b>5) Will Isara be a regular partner in your performances?</b><br> One of my goals is to find and inspire some other talented writers of prose and verse to do what we're doing. I'd love to see other bards capturing the in-game history and glimpses of players, as long as its done in a bardic fashion, and in-character. I am constantly looking for other people to participate in my concerts, but I have a pretty high standard for what I'll accept. Isara has done some excellent work, especially for her first couple of ballads. Look forward for some more exciting material from her. </p>  <p><b>6) Do you have any final words for the CoN readers? </b><br> A lot of people are complaining about EQ being boring. I think that's a prety shallow interpretation. Verant hasn't given us a movie here, they've given us a stage. If you're looking for a thrill-a-minute Splat-O-Rama where you sit and watch the game entertain you, or get pushed through a pre-fab story line, you're going to get tired with EverQuest eventually. The challenge in EQ isn't to see how fast you can level, or how many dungeons you can exploit, or whether or not the orc cheiftain has the +5 magic bracer this time; the challenge of EverQuest is to live and breathe your character, and to do what your character would do. <br> The most fun I've had in the game hasn't been hunting, or really hasn't even been the concerts. The most fun I've had in EverQuest has been the interaction with other in-character players, who interact with Jythri in their own ways. When players do this, EQ turns into a spectacular fantasy novel. Except rather than reading what the characters do, you ARE one, and get to interact with the story around you in a spectacular manner. </p> </body> </html>
