</strong>By Boots</p>

<p align="center">For those interested in choosing a race for its night sight abilities
here is a side by side comparison of each race:</p>

<p align="center"><small><small>(If you don't see the huge differences between the first
two races adjust your contrast and brightness)</small></small></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">One of the things you might not be able to tell from these screen shot, is
every race that shares either Infravision or Ultravision has some subtle differences in
their effectiveness, and your ability to see in the dark will be reduced under foggy
conditions.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">I was really surprised with the Dark Elf night vision.&nbsp; Myself being
accustom to the Human's lack of night sight, and the spell Deadeye's infravision, the
drastic difference in the Dark Elf shocked me at first.&nbsp; I didn't expect to see the
blues.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">All the characters used to collect these images were level 1, except the
human (level 20) and the barbarian (level 6) and none used any kind of
&quot;man-made&quot; light source when taking the picture.&nbsp; Each one started from
their home town and braved the perils to get to the East Commonlands so that the could all
look at the same view.&nbsp; Most of the characters made it with little trouble, but here
are some of the fun things to happen along the way.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Barbarian</big><br>
</u>This character had been developed somewhat, but with a few bad run ins with the
Blackburrow natives I stopped playing him.&nbsp; But when I started to do this I thought
&quot;great, he won't get killed in one hit and might make it&quot;.&nbsp; Well.....
&nbsp; I found someone in Highpass Hold that does not care for barbarian rogues, so I had
to start from Halas again.&nbsp; Also when I was running through Kithicor it was about 7
or 8 pm, and I literally could not see more than 3 feet in front of me.&nbsp; Really
really fun!</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Half-Elf</big><br>
</u>Not too much to report here.&nbsp; Its an easy trip from Freeport to Commonlands.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Ogre</big><br>
</u>Well, after running around the city of Oggok for about 15 minutes and not finding the
exit, I took the easy way out.&nbsp; I attacked a guard.&nbsp; I laughed hysterically when
he said 'Me am victer. Me am vic...... Me win!&quot;.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Halfling</big><br>
</u>When you are 3 feet tall, it seems like you move at mach 1.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Human</big><br>
</u>My level 20 Necromancer took the shot on his way somewhere else.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Dark Elf</big><br>
</u>Wow... its easy to get lost in Neriak.&nbsp; Real easy.&nbsp; I did find the
Necromancer guild on accident.&nbsp; The humans should look and learn how to build a
temple and worship those who command the dead, that guild hall is spectacular!</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Wood Elf</big><br>
</u>Yay, I'm stuck on an island way far away from where I wanted to be.&nbsp; In the trees
no less.&nbsp; Well I got sick of trying to find the lift down and so I jumped. <small><small>(actually
I fell off)</small></small></p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Troll</big><br>
</u>Same basic thing as the ogre.&nbsp; Except this one ran into a mummy in the Southern
Desert of Ro, scared me to death seeing that thing take a really hurtful swing at me as I
came over a dune.&nbsp; My neighbors heard me yell &quot;Run Gumu, run!&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Gnome</big><br>
</u>I didn't spend too much time inside the city, because gnomes tinker up all kinds of
neat gadgets.&nbsp; They have mechanical guides that can lead you to some other part of
the city.&nbsp; Very very nice touch!&nbsp; I was really impressed with that.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>High Elf</big><br>
</u>Not too much to say about the high elves, other than at this point it was my fifth
trip of the day on the boat from Kaladim to Freeport and not knowing when the boat would
arrive, so I wasn't in the best of moods.&nbsp; It would have been only four trips, but
the Wood Elf thought it was someone else and one of the &quot;evil&quot; residents of
Freeport killed her on sight.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Dwarf</big><br>
</u>One nice, undocumented, benefit of being a dwarf..... is the view.</p>

<p align="left"><u><big>Erudite</big><br>
</u>Well this one had the most happen to her.&nbsp; After sprinting through zones that
level 25+ people are challenged in, and dodging EVERYTHING I see.&nbsp; I finally made it
to the Commonlands unharmed.&nbsp; Well when I got there there was a party with light
sources and a bard singing.&nbsp; While asking them to kindly stop singing and to turn off
their light, a skeleton thought I would look better dead.&nbsp; In a moment of panic I
managed to finish the /tell, switch to full screen and take the shot.&nbsp; One second
later I was loading the Erudite city zone.&nbsp; I wasn't sure If I had taken the shot in
time.&nbsp; Luckily I had.</p>
