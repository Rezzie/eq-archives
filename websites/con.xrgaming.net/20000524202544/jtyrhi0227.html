<HR> <P>  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#000000"><b>The Bardic Performance of Jythri and Isara</b><br> Saturday, February 27th <br> 11pm CST (9pm PST) <br> Theatre of the Tranquil, in West Freeport <br> Fennin Ro </font></p>  <table width="85%" border="0" align="center">   <tr>     <td width="69%" valign="top">A crowd gathered around a small wooden stage in Western     Freeport last night, to listen to the wonderful musical talent that has made Jythri a name     known across the land by Troll and Elf alike. He had already performed in a few concerts     before the advent of Phase 4, but this was his first large-scale concert in the new phase.     How would the newly arrived citizens in Norrath welcome his music? I travelled to the     Theatre of the Tranquil to find out. <p>Around 50 people had gathered around the stage to     listen to what Jythri had to offer them in this evening of musical festivities. People     were calling Jythri's name before he was on stage, excited about the prospect of seeing     and hearing this famous man. When he was introduced by Kaelar, cheers and whistles could     be heard all throughout Western Freeport. The area was illuminated by spells, and people     eagerly awaited his first ballad. When order was restored and people were sat in front of     the stage, Jythri began the concert.</p>     <p>The crowd thoroughly enjoyed the songs that Jythri had composed, and joined in on many     when a familiar chorus came along.I managed to scribble down the lyrics to one of the most     popular songs of the evening, about a Gnome named Fynas:</p>     <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>Fynas&#146; Hands</b><br>     by Jythri, Bard and Wanderer </font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">&quot;<i>Fynas, oh,     Fynas! Where are your hands? <br>     Who&#146;s pocket are they now invading? <br>     Did you come up with cash? <br>     Or an ill-gotten rash? <br>     Or necklace from goblin-whelp raiding? </i></font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Fynas, oh, Fynas!     Where are your feet? <br>     Who&#146;s homeplace are they now intruding? <br>     Did you sneak there inside to quietly hide? <br>     Until you can do a good looting? </i></font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Fynas, oh, Fynas!     Where are your eyes? <br>     Who&#146;s backpack are they now a-spying? <br>     Do you see a strange bulge, <br>     Who&#146;s truth you divulge <br>     By taking the straps and untying? </i></font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Fynas, oh, Fynas!     Where is your nose? <br>     Who&#146;s riches is it keenly snifting? <br>     Is it platinum made, Or Diamonds and jade? <br>     Or gold that you soon will be lifting? </i></font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><i>Fynas, oh, Fynas!     Where is your neck? <br>     Who&#146;s purse did you try to get loose? <br>     Why Marshel Anrey! He caught you today! <br>     And I think he&#146;s preparing a noose! <br>     <br>     Sirrah <br>     I think he&#146;s preparing a noose</i>&quot;</font></p>     <p align="left">Halfway through the concert, young Isara took over whilst Jythri took a     back seat. She proved to be very popular amongst most of the men in the audience, and     captivated them with her music. Jythri took over again to finish the concert.</p>     <p align="left">I managed to find Jythri alone, away from his fans, after the concert. He     agreed to answer a few of my questions, and this is what he had to say:</p>     <p align="left"><b>How do you prepare for your performances?<br>     </b>I always have a Feywine before I sing to loosen my throat, and to calm my nerves. I     also spend some time polishing the scuffs from my boots, repairing the travel-wear from my     clothing, and polishing my lute so that it shines. Then a few silent moments to collect my     thoughts are usually all I need.<b><br>     <br>     How did this performance compare to past ones in P3?</b><br>     Very well, I thought. A splendid event with many of my new friends and companions, as well     as some old acquaintances. The crowd was a little unruly, but overall much more placid     than some of the taverns I frequent. I consider it a triumphal success.<br>     <br>     <b>Will you be performing again in the future? If so, will you travel to different towns?</b><br>     I am both Bard and Wanderer. To do any less than travel the world and sing would be to     disregard my very nature!<br>     <br>     <b>Will Isara be a regular partner in your performances?</b><br>     Well, the lass has some talent! I think I can say with some certainty that she will be     performing with me again. I would hope, though, that she'll be able to host concerts     herself in the future, and have other younger bards sing with her.<br>     <br>     <b>Do you have any final words for the CoN readers?</b><br>     Listen and live! Life is more than hunting, and if ye want any kind of thrill of living,     especially after ya have hunted every creature and delved every dark whole in the land,     take time to enjoy the land and its people. No, ya don't have to like my singing! But stop     by taverns for an ale, rather than sit on a blood-strewn hillside. Listen to a good tale     now and then. Or, if ya have the talent, spin a few of your own! </p>     <p align="center"><b>****</b></p>     <p align="left">Accompanying Jythri on the stage was the beautiful half-elven lady Isara,     an up and coming Bard who is already stealing the hearts of many men across Norrath with     her spellbinding voice and cheery personality. I had a chance to chat with her after she     had performed:<br>     <br>     <b>How did you find the performance?</b><br>     Well, after an attack of butterflies, I think it went rather smoothly! Although, it does     seem to have made me popular among the men in the audience.<br>     <b><br>     Did you have any trouble remembering your lyrics?</b><br>     Nay, I practised it upon Jythri a couple of times, then I used it to try and put the     beasties I was fighting to sleep so I get a bit more practice. The dance was a bit more     difficult!<br>     <b><br>     Will you be a regular feature alongside Jythri?</b><br>     Honestly, I dont know. I hope to do my own show some day, but I was honored when Jythri     asked me to perform in this concert.<br>     <b><br>     Were you nervous at all from the presence of the Verant staff in the crowd?</b><br>     I did not know about it! But the staff of Verant are very supportive of this sort of     thing, so I see no reason why I should have been nervous.<br>     <b><br>     Where did you get the inspiration for your songs? Surely not bought from a local     shopkeeper?</b><br>     Well, I wanted to write something that wasn't common. Jythri focuses on ballads, where I     would probably expand into storytelling and mythology.<br>     <b><br>     Do you have any final words for the CoN readers?</b><br>     Hmm, to keep your eyes open to those in need, and embrace these roleplaying opportunities     as wholeheartedly as they can because it is this community that will make Norrath great.</p>     <p align="center">****<br>     </p>     <p>I had the chance to speak with one of the guides present at the concert and asked him     of his opinions about the performance. He also mentioned that he is an avid CoN reader!     The views that Trok expresses are his own personal views, and not necessarily the same as     the rest of the Verant staff. This is what Trok had to say on the matter:.<br>     <br>     <b>Are you enjoying the performance so far?</b><br>     Aye, I have seen a few of Jythri's concerts on the Test Server already. Fennin Ro is     excellent for RolePlaying. The crowd is also well behaved.<br>     <br>     <b>Do you consider yourself a big fan of Jythri's music?</b><br>     Aye, I do enjoy his performances!<br>     <br>     <b>What do you feel this gives to EQ?</b><br>     Events like this show a real sense of community developing which I love to see.<br>     <br>     <b>Are the Verant staff supportive of such events?</b><br>     Of course! We are all behind any events like these as they really promote Role Playing,     which is important to us all.</p>     <p>This account of Jythri's Concert was written for you by Razi.
