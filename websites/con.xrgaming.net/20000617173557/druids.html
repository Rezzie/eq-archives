<HR><P><FONT CLASS="BaseFont"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;And So it Begins, A Druids Tale.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">Part I</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P>&#9;As I walked out of my guild hall for the first time in years, I was greeted by a sight I had nearly forgotten existed.  My homeland of Greater Faydark stood before me, shrouded in mist, the sunlight scattering thru the trees that were life to us all.  Such a sight it was.  I stood in awe, drinking it in.  In the distance I could see many folk scurrying about in their daily tasks.  The town was as alive with activity.  So much so, I felt awkward, almost as an intruder to be witness to it.  I had been gone so long.   I knew no one I saw, and yet thru the morning mist all was strangely familiar. </P><P>&#9;As a boy, I had entered the guild hall to begin my studies.  My parents both lost to the Orc's that infest this land.  My guild master, Master Heartwood, had taken me under his wing, in order to teach me the ways of the druid.  Without his guidance and kindness, I would surely have perished on my own.  I owed him, I owed him all I was.  While it would be presumptuous of me to call him friend,  he was by far the closest thing to it I have in this world, as I leave the only home I have more than a faded memory of.</P><P>&#9;While in his most capable care, he taught me of patience, and of compassion for all the "proper creatures" that inhabit our land.  He taught me of the spirits that gave us life, through virtue of the storms.  Of how when the mother of all sent the lightning crashing from the sky into the sacred tree, the very tree that our guild hall was built upon, creating my people.  Known to the greater world as Wood Elves, we live as she, the mother of all, meant her creations to live.  Amongst her creations, in perfect balance with all she had sent to us.  Yes, balance was all.</P><P>&#9;Master Heartwood had also taught me of the abominations that infect this land,  as a plague upon us all.   The same plague that had taken my parents, and many many of my people.  He told me of how it was our duty to care for the world, and its proper creations...and to cleanse the lands of the disease that was upon it.  A hard, but wise man was he.  </P><P>&#9;He showed me the ways of the magics.  The spells, that through hard work, devoted study, time, and as always, patience could change and mold this world and bend aspects of it to our will.  To control the fire that was a gift to my people from the mother of all, the storms and their many incarnations, and the trees themselves, the guardians of our way of life.  With these teachings, he also conveyed discipline in its use.   Such powers were not to be taken lightly, and much of it was awarded only to those with the experience and strength to use it wisely.  This worthiness was to be determined by the master, and he alone would decide when I was ready.</P><P>&#9;My initial schooling was done.  It was now time to take my place amongst my people and become a part of the living society that was that of the Wood Elf.  </P><P>&#9;He had come to me that morning and awoke me with poke from his strong hand.  "Kaali"  the master said, "its time...".  As he turned and walked from the room, I started to ask "Time for what master?", but he had already left and was waiting outside.  </P><P>&#9;I stumbled into the outer room where he stood waiting.  I was still half asleep and confused as to what he wanted of me.  As I came in, I saw that he held in his hand, a tunic of our guild.  I knew the look of it well, as those who had ventured out into the town always wore them, and I spent many an hour washing them as part of my duties.  "What is wrong master?  Did I ruin another tunic?"  I asked.  He smiled a knowing smile and said "No Kaali, this is yours....its time for you to apply what you have learned, for the good of our people."  He then looked hard in to my eyes and held out his open hand, waiting.</P><P>&#9;I knew then what was to be done.  I went back into the room where I had been sleeping, and retrieved the only item that still existed from my arrival in the guild all those years ago.  A note, written by my fathers hand, telling me to find Master Heartwood at the Soldiers of Tunare guild, and give him the note.  The master had told me upon my arrival that I should keep it safe, and that he would take it when the time was right.  </P><P>&#9;This was that time.  </P><P>&#9;As I handed him the note, I felt a swell of pride in my chest.  This is what I had been working towards.  I had awaited this moment for as long as I could remember..and finally it was here.</P><P>&#9;He took the note, read it, and tossed it into the fire that was always burning in the guild room.  He then turned, and with a smile that I had rarely seen upon his face, he handed me my tunic, and said "Bring pride upon our name, Kaali".</P><P>&#9;Excitement and apprehension gripped me.  I knew nothing of the outside, but was now a part of it, whether I thought I was ready or not.   I gathered what few belongings I had and prepared to leave.  A spellbook, with the spells I had dutifully researched, scribed carefully into its pages, a club, hand crafted from a fallen branch of the sacred tree, and some rations and water from the kitchen.</P><P>&#9;So there I was...standing outside my guild hall, looking into the face of a new world.   A world of which I knew nothing tangible, but in which I had a purpose.  Maintain the balance that the mother of all had decreed, cleanse that which was unclean, and care for and protect my people to the exclusion of all else, even at the cost of my own life.</P><P>&#9;Such is the life I had chosen, and such was the life now before me.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
