    lovely impish Gnome Magi was conducting her daily sweep of those things that she felt
    needed fixing in the land of Steamfont. &nbsp;By the waning hours of the afternoon she was
    laden with all sorts of bric-a-brac that she had taken from the spiderlings across the
    land.&nbsp; The legs and silk were valued for alchemy, and her impish smile was proudly on
    her face.</td>

    <td>Leaning heavily on her staff, she drew a deep breath and spied a small nook in a
    distant mountain that had previously passed her eye unnoticed. Curiosity got the better of
    her <em>(as is common among Gnomes)</em> and although she was tired from her travels, she
    felt overwhelmingly drawn to the landing. As she approached it, her fascination grew
    stronger and stronger. She thought to herself &quot;It clearly is a landing big enough for
    something... but what? Gems perhaps? Could I be so fortunate?&quot; Her imagination was
    cut short by the swift blade of evil.</td>

    As life was brought back to her crumpled body by the gentle Gods, Arcy was utterly
    stunned. Never before had any such thing happened to her, she simply didn't know what to
    do.</td>

    Most importantly, her faith in Gnomkind would never be the same. She simply sat down and
    cried... Wailing about the criminal known as Mydl Byrz.&nbsp; Another Gnome shouted out
    sympathy. As did another. Then came a new cry, that of a brazen fellow - <a
    href="http://con.xrgaming.net/screenshots/Arc/new/garnet.jpg" target="tw">Garnet</a>
    bellowed out, that &quot;Mydl was not worthy of the title as a criminal.&quot; Arcy was
    again in disbelief... and called out to Garnet, that if he were of such an opinion perhaps
    he could help to slay the evil Mydl Byrz. </td>

    windmills, for I would have to lead him to Mydl. He joined her as promptly as possible.
    There that sat and rested, and made plans for the attack on the criminal. Arcy was still
    skeptical of Garnet's boasting, and she suspected that he too was beginning to wonder if
    such talk of bravery was beyond his skills. Yet, they were prepared for battle.</td>

    imagined.<font color="#800000"><strong>* </strong></font>Soon after they awoke, they began
    the journey from the mills to the hiding place of Mydl. Arcy's heart raced, and Garnet
    moved with the cautious steps of an experienced adventurer.&nbsp; As they approached the
    platform, Arcy searched out everywhere for Mydl, fearing again he would leap from behind
    and end her life without forethought. But Mydl was no where to be found. Indeed, it seemed
    he had fled when it was clear that Garnet would join in the attack.<font color="#800000"><strong>*</strong></font>
    Her precious guild robes had been destroyed by his blade, yet all the other possessions
    were intact. And most gratifying, was the notion that Arcy's faith in fellow Gnomes was
    much restored. The new morn, was spent singing a song of praise for Garnet, as she skipped
    her way back to the city of Ak'Anon.&nbsp; Her perception of life was forever changed, and
    yet Arcy knew it somehow had changed her for the better.</td>
