All those times that made your spine tingle in excitement, or your heart beat quickly in panic - send them to me to be included here. When we are months into our playing in the Final release of EQ, you can drop back here to remember your time in the Beta Test and the adventures that you and others got up to! </P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">***** </P></B><P>On Friday 12th March, at midnight PST, the Phase 4 Beta drew to a close and the servers were given a break. After just over a month of constant testing and playing, thousands of people quitted the beta for the last time and uninstalled EQ from their machines. &quot;Are you sure you want to quit EverQuest?&quot; the client asked me. My mouse hovered over the Yes button, and a single click took me back to my Windows desktop. It was over. What had I learnt about the game? Did I enjoy it? Will I be playing again in Final? </P><P>These questions must have been going around the heads of the majority of testers. It all ended with a bang for most people, and more of a fizzle for others. Living in England, my alarm woke me at 5:30am so that I could be there and say &quot;I was there when the server went down&quot;. I logged on and tried to work out what was happening around the world. I heard of a battle against the gods in North Ro desert. My Barbarian Shaman stood no chance of making it all the way there, he hadn’t even travelled to Freeport before. I created a human in Freeport and ran over to North Ro - where hundreds of bodies scattered the grounds, but no sign of gods. After half an hour, I duelled the highest level player around. Back with my Shaman, I decided to head into Halas and get drunk. No one else was around, so it was a little disappointing. My Shaman must have died many deaths that evening, especially when I decided to pick on an Ice Giant in PermaFrost. At Level 6, I didn’t really have much chance. I managed to take down two Gnolls outside of BlackBurrow in the closest fight in my entire time playing, constantly healing myself and swinging my staff around. The last gnoll died, with me only have 6HP remaining. Out of food and drink, and my mana empty, I wasn’t going far. I trotted back into Halas, met with 1 or 2 others, and got slowly drunk. The server died whilst I was sitting next to the well in Halas. </P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">***** </P></B><P>So many memories of EverQuest in such a short space of time. Verant look to be very co-operative with their customers, fixing bugs and squashing rumors every day. Reading through the boards to see what people are thinking and answering plenty of questions. In the game, their ideas really seem to be working out for the good of the game. But what events will I remember for the rest of my playing time? Which circumstances and situations will make me look back and smile, remembering the fun that I had in Phase 4 with my friends? That’s the question that I have been asking on the CoN General Board recently, and here are some of the responses that were given to me: </P><B><P>Romany Fox:</B><BR>Somehow seeing the Gnoll God attack Halas and throwing my pitiful 2nd level shaman against him - healing the more powerful warriors that fought him, trying to smack him with my club - all of that was hugely fun. The gods walking the earth gave me such a sense of immersion and scope, i couldn't help but compare it to Lord British's pitiful participation in UO. <BR>Later I went to the North Ro desert for the first time and watched the moon rise in monument valley while my friends and I battled the desert tarantulas. It was just unearthly beautiful. We joined with a wizard we met on the road - another thing that brought home the difference between EQ and UO, meeting a stranger and not having him try to kill/steal from you. <BR>Later that night I stood on the ‘Academy of Magic’ in Freeport and watched the moon as the world ended. I was totally immersed in the world, and i thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. </P><B><P>Surpher: </B><BR>When I first got the Camouflage spell with my Wood Elf Druid I went exploring Crushbone - all by my 5th level self. Now Camo has to be THE most stressful spell in the game because you NEVER know when you'll return to view, so I knew I was walking a thin line when I first went in CrushBone - little did I know what danger awaited me! <BR>As I ventured in, my camo seemed to be holding rather well and so I felt pretty bold - wandering in and out of buildings face-to-face with the dreaded "Legionnaires" which all con'd red to me at the time. I wandered into the main throne room, peeking about and feeling quite confident in my Camo. As I approached the main room I noticed "An Orc Oracle begins to cast a spell". &quot;Bah!&quot; I thought as I entered the main chamber, &quot;Its just casting defense spells&quot;. <BR><BR>"You are now revealed" suddenly appeared in my screen; surrounded by everything that con'd red to me! I instantly hit my gate button, but it was all too late. I lasted a good 5 seconds. Anyway, this game has definitely invoked numerous emotions upon me and others I've observed - genuine fear, joy, guilt, etc. Quite amazing, and will definitely be here for the long run. Kudos to EQ; you've made it </P><B><P>Sledgor: </B><BR>Although I heard about trains over and over again, I still almost fell out of my chair when I saw some unlucky soul running for his life with about 4 kobolds and another 4 frogloks right on his tail. </P><B><P>Mastiral: </B><BR>This happened in P3 in Misty Thicket back when I was a young monk. It so happened that I met Cyber, who was a halfling named Hammish (don't ask where he got the name from!). We got in a group of several Halflings, well, me, being the tall one, stood out quite well, decided to vanquish the evil goblins in Runnyeye. We went in and cleared the top part of Runnyeye. Then we headed deeper into the dungeon, only to find a group of Goblin Workers there. Needless to say, being the young, daring monk I was, I engaged the goblins, only to find myself STUCK in a slime of some sort. Immediately, the 3 goblins around me converged, and out of nowhere, more poured out of the passageways. Some of us tried to help but were stuck in the slime. I wiggled my way out, and ran as fast as I could to the exit. I remembered surviving that one, and it was a hair-raiser considering how deep we had headed into Runnyeye. </P><B><P>Nathan: </B><BR>My favourite moment was when I entered in to the Estate of Unrest zone, a zone with rarely any other players and I knew I was one of few to ever see and know about the place, when I did eventually run into people in here they were extremely courteous and supportive of someone else who had been lucky enough to find the place. </P><B><P>Foxa: </B><BR>Ok here's is my favorite memory from phase 4. The phase was about halfway through and i was still playing with my first charactor. By this time he was a level 8 or so paladin and this particular night i was running around west karana with two of my friends, noxin and strauss. We didn't know the zone too well at the time and we soon found ourselves up in the mountains in west karana. For anyone who doesnt know, this is a very dangerous area, lots of hill giants, bandits, and as we soon found out, an ogre camp. Well we came to the ogre camp and we saw a npc in the middle named Chief Goonda. Well, my friend Noxin in a moment of dumbness got a bit too close and chief Goonda comes running up. Well Strauss and I take off immeadiately but poor noxin got punched to death (in about one punch) by Goonda. Well he met back up with us and we went to get his body. Body was too close. Goonda comes running back and we all take off. But then something strange happened. A strange looking icon popped up on my effects area of my screen and I'm told that i have been charmed. Next thing I know I have tons of high level buff spells cast on me like Spirit of the Wolf, Center, Spirit Armor, etc. I also notice that I can't do anything, can't type commands, can't type anything, cant press any buttons, absolutely nothing. Oh great, I think, he's gonna lead me into the middle of that camp. Well, he didn't. Instead I turn around and see Strauss. <BR>"<I>You ok?"</I> he asks. <BR><I>"You slash Strauss for 14 points of damage." </I><BR><I>"Watch it. Where's Noxin?"</I> he responds. <BR><I>"You slash Strauss for 18 points of damage." </I><BR><I>"WTF you doing??" </I><BR>He starts running, but with spirit of the wolf, there's no way he can get away. He runs for about 5 minutes, then turns to fight. But with the buff spells I have, and the fact that i'm a couple levels higher he has no chance. He starts running again. He ran and ran and ran with me right behind him the whole way. I chased him literally across west karana, which is a HUGE zone. He's about a minute from the zone line when i land a couple hits and he's too hurt to continue running. <BR>Luckily he has his lay hands available, and is able to continue. But he starts to get hurt again and only a few feet from the zone line he's reduced to a slow walk. Luckily again a passerby heals him and he is able to make it to the zone. Unfortunately I didnt take to kindly to him being healed and proceeded to kill the healer. I don't remember his name, but if he's reading this I'm really sorry. =) Anyway, after Strauss escapes Goonda runs me halfway across karana again, takes me up to the highest mountain there, and I jump to my death hundreds of feet below. This was by far the funniest, most amazing thing I've ever seen in any game. And someday I'll have my revenge on Chief Goonda.</P><B><P>Akeala:</B> </P><P>My most memorable moment was the first thunderstorm I was witness too. I was new to the game, couldn't afford any light source, it was dark in the East Commonlands.I was fleeing from a fire beetle, trying to weave in and out of the trees (I know now that that doesn't help, but at the time I thought it would). The thunderstorm broke and it was pitch black. When the lightning would flash was the only time I could see. It was amazing. I died and it didn't matter because I was so blown away by the emotional affect the storm had on me and my present circumstance. It might seem trivial (weather effects and the like), but I had never experienced anything this awe inspiring and well done. </P><B><P>Jacir:</B><BR>I don’t have long memories of EQ since I was a P4 tester but I was impressed with the game from the start. My first time logging in I was taken aback by just the variety in the races and classes I could choose. The last online game I played did not offer choices like this, which opened up a world of possibilities. I knew what my starting character would be and went to work on giving him life. I started in Surefall Glade and the pure beauty of the area had me stunned. I spent a while just looking around and talking to PCs and NPCs alike just to discover what kind of personality the place had. A lot of players were doing the same as I, and spending time taking in the graphics of the world around them. <BR>I found out about a few quests and was ready with my new guild robe to adventure on. I exited the glade and was in for another treat as I saw …outside. I looked at the sky and saw clouds that actually moved, I overheard conversations between NPCs that clued me into a greater plot than what I was currently aware of. I saw rolling green hills and differing landmarks to make up the personality of Qeynos hills. I started off at a trot and just took in the sights and enjoyed the pure immensity of the zone. <BR>I noticed that it was a little quiet so I checked my chat filters and turned on a few and suddenly the land wasn’t so quiet anymore. I enjoyed listening to the shouts of fellow players although many were confused as to what should be shouted and what should be placed on OOC. I journeyed on and entered North Qeynos and promptly got lost in the huge city. I spent a great deal of time running around and talking to NPCs and learning the layout of the city. I sat at the gates and overheard the guards make fun of a wandering guard and mutter about some internal politics. I was greatly impressed that the game had not just quests you seek out but if you keep your ears open you will find out about a lot more going on in the city. </P><B><P>Acappella: </B><BR>I remember running around the Butcherblock Mountains as a young level 7 Bard. Eventually I came over a hill into a box canyon. Layed out before me was a giant chess board. This is the first time I had seen anything within EverQuest that wasn't just trees or rocks. This really opened up my eyes to just how good EverQuest was. It wasn't just killing monsters, but it was also discovering fantastical places. This was the moment I truly became immersed within their world. </P><B><P>Krodothlhren: </B><BR>While adventuring with my wood elf druid in Crushbone I met a rather excitable young orc centurian just out side the entrance to Crushbone. Litttle bugger took one look at me and decided he needed help, so he took off running around the corner. About a minute later I see my little blue freind come running back with about 4 other orcs, some rather big ones included. They proceed to come straight at me screaming something about the desputable glory of clan crushbone. Ok now Im the one running straight back to the forest. the artificial int in this game is awesome. On another occasion I was fighting a orc centurion in the camps near Kelethin when an orc oracle walks up and starts healing the guy im fighting he then turns an starts casting a spell at me (snare I think) I didnt survive that encounter since my opponent was healing faster than I could hurt him and my retreat was slowed. The oracle was more than happy to start bashing me in my head once the battle turned in their favor. </P><B><P>Kayd: </B><BR>One of my clearest memories was of creating a new character on one of the new servers that were added part way through phase 4. Soon after entering the Toxxulia Forest it dawned on me that I was completely and utterly alone. No other players were there, no /tells no /shouts, no /ooc chatter, it was jut me against the whole forest. It was disconcerting and peaceful all at the same time. Disconcerting because there was nobody to share the experience with, and nobody to help should I get in trouble. Peaceful because of the tranquillity and quiet that comes from being completely alone. It's not something I would choose to do all the time, but a rare opportunity to play a massively multiplayer online game as if it were a single player game. An opportunity that I will probably never have again. </P><P>The second experience was undertaking a journey from Erudin to Felwithe, two cities at the far opposite ends of the world. It was a trip filled with a sense of, adventure, suspense, and awe. A large part of the sense of adventure sprang from the fact that I had left home with no clear idea of how to reach my destination. I found my way by trial and error and an occasional stranger along with way. The suspense came from the many times I found myself lost or fumbling in hostile territory, not knowing when or how I would find my way out. Most of all though I will remember the sense of awe I felt on first encountering the many sites along the way. It would require far to much space to describe them in detail. Even if I had space words would not be sufficient. No words or pictures could fully describe the sense of vastness I felt as I first crossed the endless Plains of Karana, or the massive scale of the chasm that leads up to Highpass Hold, the wonder of seeing the Gnome Statue that guards the entrance to Ak'Anon, or the tree city of Kelethin. Only after completing this journey did I begin to get a true appreciation for the scale of Norrath. The journey had only taken me through a small portion of eighteen of the seventy zones in the game yet it had taken more than five hours. One of the things I took away from this experience is that Norrath is a massive world full of wonders just waiting to be explored. </P><B><P>Razi: </B><BR>My own personal memories of EQ aren’t great, as I didn’t really play the game to get the levels, and in the last week I rarely even logged on (hey, it costs me money by the minute in the UK). The group that I travelled with to Kerra Isle (Me, Torowa, Jacir, Veranasta, Groupal) was a fun time for me, exploring an island like that in our own small group. You should have heard Groupal wetting himself when he went into some high level castle on the island. However, my hobby in EQ is cliff and bridge diving. If there is a great fall into water, you can be sure that I’d jump into it with no regard for how the hell I get back. The centre of BlackBurrow is great fun, followed by the bridge in Toxullia Forest. If anyone can tell me the highest point in Norrath, with water at the bottom, I’d love to hear it! </P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">***** </P></B><P>At the time of writing, there is only a day until Final rolls around. The chance to work on a character that you know will always be with you, who wont disappear at the end of the month. Thousands and thousands of people flooding in for their first taste of the world, completely lost and amazed. The past month has been spent playing every combination of character that you can think of, seeing which one you enjoy more than any other. And now, your mind is set on a final few, narrowed down from all of the combinations available. There is still so much to explore and see, places to learn about and other people to laugh with or argue against. How will you make a name for yourself? The one name per server rule really works wonders, people will learn about you and know what you are like. If you are powerful, people will tell tales of you. If you are rude and unhelpful, people will hear about you. It does work, and I’ve heard it at first-hand. </P><P>You all have the chance now to play the finished and final version of this game. Aye, there will be constant updates and fixes every few days or weeks, but there it’s finally happened. The real thing. The days of Beta that took up so much time - from hearing small extracts of information in the early phases (everyone must have read the story from Loki Abashi - the first glimpse of information about the game from the inside) - to the lifting of the NDA in Phase 4 and information just pouring out everywhere. For the people who didn’t get the chance to participate, your long wait is over. For the people who were in there, you have learnt so much about the game and the areas - it’s your chance to get a little headstart. But don’t forget to help the new people to the game - it can only help you later in the game when they remember how you gave them advice. </P><P>If you wish to add your own feelings and memories of EverQuest beta testing, please send them in. It doesn’t matter if you started in Phase 4 or .5, if you are a Guide or even a member of the Verant Dev team - send me a couple of paragraphs (of around 150 words) for me to include in this editorial. The more memories and entries that I get, the more this editorial will serve it’s purpose as a reference of Beta testing when we are months into our playing days! </P><P>Send any comments or entries to me at: <A HREF="mailto@razi.xrgaming.net">razi@xrgaming.net</A>.
