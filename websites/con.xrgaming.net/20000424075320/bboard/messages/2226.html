Right now she's a bubble and a half from 24, and someone has asked me to reach 25 ASAP so we can group together. He says he has a gift for her too when she gets there. :-)&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As distasteful as I find the levelquest to be, I'd like to honor this request since it comes from a good friend who's done a lot for me. So a couple of questions for y'all:&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(1) Is it possible for an untwinked ranger to solo into the 20's? The last time I soloed effectively was about level 17. Since then I have been having a hard time even with low blues (or greens, if they are casters). All my experience since then has been gained in groups. But I've heard of rangers soloing into their 30's. How the heck do they do it?! My usual group is temporarily scattered and grouping with strangers is always a shaky proposition, so I'm wondering if there's anyplace I could go safely alone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(2) What zones would you recommend to do this in? Someplace with decent experience for this level where it's not too tough to find a group? The most reliable places I've seen experience-wise are Highkeep and Najena; Highkeep is so crowded that it's tough to get into a group, and Najena has the opposite problem - no one is ever there. Any other suggestions?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(3) Anyone out there want to party with a bellbottomed half-elf? *laughs*">
