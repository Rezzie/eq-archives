Ok, I am looking around all of the boards trying to find the answer to my question about enchanters and religion. &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                           Does anyone know, or has anyone seen any official word on religion rendering illusions irrelevent? &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                           Is this just a bug that Verant is too lazy to fix, or is there some reason that they have designed something that cripples&lt;br&gt;
                           a class at level 12 (for good races 4 for evil) for some reason? Why are people not warned about this during character&lt;br&gt;
                           creation. &lt;br&gt;
                           Did they think it would just be funny to ambush people like this?&lt;br&gt;
                           Why is it that the first level minor illusion is more powerful then the 12th level delf illusion? Has anyone seen any official&lt;br&gt;
                           word on this?&lt;br&gt;
                           In all seriousness, I can't understand why it is done this way, does anyone know? &lt;br&gt;
                           I choose a religion thinking that it would be fun to role play a follower of the child. Boy I learned my lesson, wont try&lt;br&gt;
                           and role play again! &lt;br&gt;
                           I understand that choosing a religion should have an effect on the game, and that it should limit my choices for things I&lt;br&gt;
                           can do in the game, however no other race/class combination suffers such a penalty for choosing a religion. &lt;br&gt;
                           No other race/class is denied the use of their race/class specific skill by choice of religion. Its like Shamens being denied&lt;br&gt;
                           alchemy for not being agnostic. Also why didn't it come up with HARD as my race/class/religion difficulty level? At least&lt;br&gt;
                           some sort of warning that you are not going to be able to cast illusions that ANYONE will beleive would be appropriate&lt;br&gt;
                           at the time of character creation. &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                           thanks, &lt;br&gt;
