            <p>First off, let me say I write this from experience. I am a level 
              54 Erudite wizard on the Rathe.  At times, the game was painful 
              to play, as a wizard at times can be a difficult class to level.  
              There seems to be a series of levels where you just seem to cant 
              make any ground.  At least that was my experience.  Maybe this was 
              my tendency to solo a lot and get brave.  I liked to solo, and if 
              you do too, a wizard is one of the best classes to solo.  Of course 
              if I had to do it all over, it would be a little easier.</p>
            <p>Wizards are a very straightforward class pretty much, dont let 
              anyone tell you different.  Its when wizards start to believe that 
              they are something they are not that gets them in trouble.  You 
              are a caster. You deal damage with spellpower.   Let the melee types 
              do the meleeing.   This does not mean you should not mix it up. 
              Let me explain:</p>
            <p>Up to the first 20-22 levels, some wizards think (once they get 
              a staff that does damage) that they can melee mobs (and indeed they 
              can inflict some damage at these lower levels).  In fact when starting 
              out it is necessary to use your melee to finish mobs.  This is temporary.  
              The higher you get, the harder mobs get and their hps go up exponentially.  
              Soloing a level 45 Tatterback Gorilla (he has over 6000 hps - yes 
              you too WILL be able to solo this) in Kunark will not be possible 
              with meleeing.  In fact, the key to survival is to not let him hit 
              you at all. One hit of double damage can be 137 hps per shot.   
              Why did I go over this? Because I want you to think about what you 
              spend your character creation points on and your skill points when 
              you level.</p>
            <div align=right> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img height=5

      href="#top">top</a></font> </div>
<p><font color="050056"><b><a name="1"></a>Character Creation/Important 
              Attributes:</b></font></p>
            <p>This is a roleplaying game and as such, will probably determine 
              what you select for race. You have several options of course.  High 
              Elf, Erudite, Human, Dark Elf, Gnome.  </p>
            <p>The most important attribute is intelligence of course. Everyone 
              knows this for casters.  Intelligence determines mana, especially 
              at the higher levels.  More mana means more usefulness to your group 
              and yourself.  But alas, what is the second most important?  Hands 
              down, I say Agility. Why? Because Agility makes you run faster. 
              The more you have, the faster you can run.  And speed is the key 
              to surviving as a squishy wizard. You must be able to make the zone 
              point when hauling ass from a pack of mobs.  In theory AGILITY also 
              helps you take less hits and it seems to work this way.  Who has 
              the best agility starting out? Gnomes and Dark Elves.   Selecting 
              a class of wizard with their starting attributes is of course the 
              most important decision you must make. High INT? Use Erudite.  But 
              dont think you have any special advantage with a beginning high 
              intelligence wizard. It is so EASY to get intelligence enhancing 
              items as you advance through the game, you can reach the 200 level 
              cap easily in your 30s.  If your twinked, wellmuch earlier.  Agility 
              enhancing items are a little less plentiful for a wizard so I recommend 
              dumping a LOT of creation points into AGILITY when starting out.   
              In fact, go ahead and pick your class and dump as many points into 
              AGILITY as you can and the rest into INTELLIGENCE.  You will not 
              regret this when you make 50. Trust me. I made an Erudite wizard 
              with starting 142 Intelligence, and dumped the rest into STAMINA 
              because the game defaults this as important to a wizard.  Trust 
              me, whatever race you play, your starting STAMINA will be perfectly 
              fine to keep as is for your entire life. It is just not that important 
              for a wizard (contrary what the guidebooks and game steers you toward).   
            </p>
            <p>So I started with a low 70 Agility and 142 Intelligence. I was 
              slow. I was easy to beat on. I had problems til I got Journeyman 
              Boots and AGI enhancing items.  My intelligence is now 212 and my 
              AGILITY 135 with stat enhancing items.  Not overly impressive although 
              my other stats are well rounded out: 70 STR, 115 DEX, 103 WIS, 80 
              CHA. I always believed I should be a well-rounded wizard since I 
              started myself at an AGILITY disadvantage.  My AGI will never go 
              much higher because I can hardly raise it anymore with items. I 
              already am loaded up.  But if you start your character wisely, imagine 
              your stats at 54?  I can: INT: 200-205, AGI: 180+++???.  Who cares 
              so much about the rest? They will take care of themselves in time.</p>
            <p>Remember about starting a Gnome. You will be always looking up 
              to people (I never liked this).  Human? Your stats are average across 
              the board. Dark Elf? You will be hated in a lot of places.  But 
              this only matters if you want to see every city.  I personally have 
              ruined most factions nowadays and it dont much matter to me. Just 
              personal preference. They like me in North Freeport. I can still 
              get all the supplies I need there.</p>

              Tox forest sucks to hunt in.  Its pretty simple living the wizards

            <p>Join a guild.  You will have a much easier time leveling (especially

              for life so to speak.  They may give you free stuff. Do it, do it

            <p>Once I hit level 12 or so, I went to West Karana and its rich hunting 
              grounds.  I frequently started to group here with others taking 
              on bandits.  I dont see W Kar as crowded and popular as it used 
              to be. Many peeps like the Ro Deserts and Oasis of Marr and other 
              places.  Its up to you and your starting Characters race.  You 
              will find a place and partners in time.  I cannot possibly tell 
              you all the combinations.  Read websites about mobs and such. Download 
              maps.  Get an edge before you go into a place. Do your homework. 
              After all, that is what you are doing by reading this huh?  You 
              will save yourself much pain if you gather information first.  Too 
              many peeps dont take advantage of the wealth of info out there 
              and maps.  USE THEM!!!  Start now.  I still see so many people getting 
              lost even at level 50 plus and dying because they DONT BELIEVE 
              IN USING MAPS! Hogwash I say! Who wants to die? This game is tough 
              enough as it is. EQAtlas is a very nice place for general zone/mob 
              info and has very nice maps. Of course Allakhazams is one of my 
              favorites.  They have links to all the nice maps and other websites. 
              Also learn how to use the location command.  Do it, learn it now. 
              It will make your life easier when someone gives you their LOC and 
              you are too stupid to not know how to find them.  You are a wizard.  
              If anything, you will be one of the best at getting around and travelling.  
              You SHOULD be an expert on this.</p>

            <p>Levels 20 -24 can be tough on your own. This is where you definitely 
              want to be grouped. WHY? Because you will find yourself still using 
              a level 16 direct damage spell and your level 12!.  Soloing these 
              levels were tough for me, and I almost quit the game.  Died many 
              times and you start to find out that maybe you are not the most 
              powerful class out there.  So group up.</p>

<p><b><font color="050056"><a name="6"></a>Early Mid-Life Rewards:</font></b></p>
            <p>Let me tell you where to hunt once you hit level 26: In Beholder.  
              Solo the named evil eyes at the temple in the canyon.  You may die 
              a few times in this level, but mostly you will prevail and make 
              exp fast and get rich.  After 26, I dont remember dying here except 
              for maybe once.  I made well over 5000pp soloing eyes from levels 
              26 all the way to 31.  This is still BIG coin for your level.  This 
              is one of your first camps also. You get Polished Bone Bracelets 
              (PBBs) which go for about 100pp each. Also a lot of gems and such 
              drops. It all added up. I was able to buy myself my first real gear. 
              Int items and stuff.   When I was there, the camps were not very 
              crowded and I usually quickly got one of the 2 spots.  Why? Because 
              many peeps try this camp too early. Watch them get charmed and die.  
              They quickly give it up. Eyes are too dangerous for many, but perfect 
              wiz food.  Low hps and such.  Blast the hell outta of them. Root, 
              shoot again. Dead Eye. Do not be afraid. Face your fears. EQ gets 
              much scarier later on.  Learn to deal with eyes at this stage in 
              life, and you will be prepared mentally to face much tougher opponents 
              later on. They say wisdom helps you from getting charmed and it 
              seems to be true.  If you have problems, try buying a few wisdom 
              items to boost this resistance. I rarely got charmed, but then again, 
              I started with higher wisdom than most wizards being an Erudite.

            <p>Remember I said AGILITY is the most important secondary stat? Well 
              this is true but now lets talk Dexterity.  When I came through the 
              ranks, I always read that high DEX helps you recover from a hit 
              while casting.  This is still debated by many and never been totally 
              clarified.  Actually I had but ignored AGI until level 40 or so 
              when I realized that I had made a mistake investing so much into 
              DEX early on.  But did I make a mistake then? I had boosted my DEX 
              at one point to 142 with items, and I still believe it helps you 
              recover from interrupts and continue casting. My experience tells 
              me it did and still does. I wasnt kiting mobs at this point yet. 
              Still mostly root and shoot..  When doing eyes, and buying items 
              with all that coin I earned, I bought DEX items mainly (remember 
              I had high starting int).  I think it helped me with my root, shoot 
              solo experiences early on in my late 20s and 30s and beyond.  
              So dont discount this stat. There are many relatively cheap items 
              (serpentine bracer that not only boosts AGI but DEX as well. And 
              I remember the day I bought platinum Star Ruby Vail and Golden Star 
              Ruby rings.  I played with these items on me for many levels.  Actually 
              when soloing in these level ranges, it may be MORE important than 
              AGI, because lets face it, without Journeyman Boots and until you 
              get Bonds of Force at 29, you cant kite mobs.  Ill let you decide. 
              If you started with high AGI in your character, INT and DEX items 
              are probably the way to go for now. </p>
            <p>One more important point: Be frugal with your money. It is such 
              a crock that lower levels think plat is unimportant at higher levels. 
              Baloney! Actually, it is more important. Peridot costs 11pp a pop 
              (used for many high level shield spells and such).  You will want/require 
              better equipment and more diversified equipment.  So do RESEARCH 
              on an item before you let some dupe talk you into spending your 
              hard-earned plat. Once again, many websites such as MaximumEQ have 
              nice pricing guides. Do the research, know what you want to buy, 
              and go get it with knowledge as your bargaining chip! </p>

              Post 50 spells are dropped from mobs after this point.  So you can

              many wizards who will make/give you spells nowadays.  There are

              runes/spells.  So dump your points into DEFENSE first if you can.

            <p>I used to practice my spell casting while fishing to max it out

              sessions can be boring, but you may find that your casting skills 
              start to fall behind when you level up.  Take some time to practice 
              casting while fishing on a dock.  Remember every little edge helps. 
              Also when you gain Specialize skill at 20, make SURE you specialize 
              in Evocation.  This skill will go up to 200 or so over time.  The 
              other 3 specialization will stop at 50.  Evocation is your bread

            <p>Of course it seems I am talking a lot of solo experiences in my 
              life.  This is just my preference.  I certainly have had my share 
              of groups and enjoyed most of them.  But as a wizard, you have the 
              ability to solo well at higher levels that many classes do not.  
              I got through levels 37-40 by soloing Vhalen Nostrolo in South Karana. 
              I just rooted and shooted! Once again, at first it was scary but 
              if done properly, will propel you through these levels. Of course 
              you will take unrecoverable faction loss with League of Bards. Oh 
              well, such is life.  </p>

<p><b><font color="050056"><a name="12"></a>Mid-Life Grouping:</font></b></p>
            <p>It used to be that once you hit 35 or so, you went to lower Guk 
              or SolB.  I never did Guk much, and had preferred SolB.  Of course 
              you have many options now with Kunark out.  But I tell you SolB 
              group fighting propelled me through the 40s in no time at all.  
              Just dont die a lot. Guk has more loot stuff but dying is probably 
              easier there.  But then again a high level wizard is the master 
              of Lower Guk.</p>
            <p>In SolB and Guk a common mistake is to go there too early.  At 
              level 35 in a group there you are actually hurting yourself because 
              peeps will be hogging all the experience usually.  Dont go until 
              40 or so. I always got in the King group (just get on waiting list 
              they always need a good nuker) from 41 on and pretty much stayed 
              there til 47!  And that didnt take long.   I also did groups in 
              South Karana doing gnolls at the spires a lot in the early 30s.  
              Whatever your preference, just keep safety in mind. Dying is not 
              a way to level. Thats why at these levels I did SolB and such, 
              because of easy escape routes.  Remember, in the mid to late 30s 
              and 40s you must adjust your former tendencies to overburn mobs. 
              Now you must learn more patience. Now is when you use Tishans Clash 
              more and just STUN the mobs until an appropriate time to burn em 
              down.  However, I found that in the frantic action of the King group 
              in SolB, I was a nuking powerhouse.  If in this group, dont be 
              afraid to throttle it up as being TOO conservative is worse than 
              overnuke.  I got hit a lot there and you know what, my DEFENSE got 
              maxxed out there (145 I think for wizards). Higher defense means 
              a little more AC.  You should get your defense maxxed out in King 
              room. </p>
            <p>One wizard fallacy I want to dispel: At all costs conserve mana. 
              This is not necessarily true.  What good is having a full tank of 
              mana when youre all dead or running?  In a group, full mana = wasted 
              mana.   Yes.  Think about it.  If I sit at max mana for 5 minutes 
              that is at least 400 (or more) damage I could have had on a mob.  
              Max mana only helps in dire situations but by then it is usually 
              out of control anyway.  On the other hand, dont always be too low.  
              They need your finishing touches if things get out of hand.   Strike 
              a balance for the situation. If the group is steady solo pulling, 
              you can afford to burn mana a little more than if your in a dangerous 
              camp with multiple spawns. </p>
            <p>You will know when to adjust your style, as a good wizard will 
              know this.   Sometimes it is best to use a Stun, sit, Stun approach 
              in a more controlled pull/multiple mob camp situation that is well 
              in hand.  On the other hand some camps require quick deaths so that 
              mobs dont spawn on top of each other. Adjust accordingly to your 
              group and camp.  Never let anyone tell you that you MUST play one 
              style or another. The SITUATION will always dictate.  You will learn.</p>

              power of Ice Comet, you have the option of camping mobs for loot 
              to sell for plat. My specialty was learning the spawn patterns in 
              sola of the Kindle and his precious impskin gloves.  Always seemed 
              to get lucky with him and sold them for 2000-3000pp at the time.  
              I also did ancient croc in Upper Guk, did the hero bracer camp/quest, 
              and a few others. It is up to you. By now you should know your capabilities. 
              Just look at an item you want and go camp it. Utilize websites and 
              once again do the research first. It makes life easier.  You can 
              also go and exact revenge on those mobs that killed you early in 
              life. I particularly liked killing Chief Goonda and his cronies 
              in West Karana!  If you need the cash, consider camping an item.</p>

              Boots and Bonds of Force:</font></b></p>
            <p>I got lucky. I zoned into South Ro one time and immediately locked 
              on the ancient cyclops. My heart raced. Surely it will be engaged 
              before my slow self gets there! But alas, I ran and ran and I was 
              so nervous that I almost blew it. My heart raced. I was firing upon 
              the ancient! My dream, Journeyman Boots!  Well, I did it rather 
              easily, you see I was 50 at the time.  I did the rest of the quest 
              and soon had Journeyman Boots. My wizard life changed a bit after 
              that.  No longer did I have to beg for sow (though I never did, 
              isnt my style - I always preferred to be self-reliant). Let me 
              tell you this: Try and get Journeyman Boots.  I had been trying 
              since level 40 or so. I always popped into South Ro and looked for 
              the ancient. I got lucky one time. He is not hard to kill in the 
              40s as a soloist.  You can camp the one in Ocean of Tears with 
              a friend (hard to solo Ocean of Tears ancient at these levels, S 
              ro ancient much easier).  I always kept an ear out while in South 
              Karana too.  You MUST get them.  Life is sweet when you do.</p>
            <p>After Journeyman Boots I had discovered a little spell I hadnt 
              used much: Bonds of Force.  A wiz snare with a good definite set 
              length of time.  My kiting career took off from here. I soloed anything 
              and everything that conned blue. Simple. Snare, run, blast, run 
              a little, blast more, dead.  You may find you want to employ Bonds 
              of Force much earlier than I did, but then again, I was in solb 
              in the 40s and did fine with root and shoot from 37-41(Vhalen remember?).  
            </p>
            <p>I now kite regularly in Kunark whenever I feel like soloing.  Level 
              45 plus mobs, no problem. In fact I mostly use the more mana efficient 
              post 50 direct damage spells. Many quick blasts, dead mob. I have 
              never died yet from kiting mobs here. Their aggro range is small 
              and I can outrun them if I get in trouble. Once in a while I have 
              to use root if Bonds of Force fails, but it mostly doesnt.  My 
              best mob to date was soloing a Mature wurm in Skyfire. I had clarity 
              and used Harvest once during a lengthy tactical battle.  I wound 
              up doing over 9K of damage to take him down.  And he dropped a post 
              50 wiz spell I needed!</p>
            <p>One other point about kiting. Learn to use the 3<sup>rd</sup> person 
              view.  When I kite I approach a mob, stop hit F9 3 times til Im 
              in LAST view mode and pan around by holding down right mouse button. 
              Go to last view mode because if you quickly need to change back 
              into first person view, you just need to hit F9 one more time.  
              I then cast by left-clicking spell icons.  I run using the arrow 
              pads on my keyboard. It takes a little practice, but soon it will 
              be second nature. Some prefer using hotkeys to cast but Im a mouse 
              user except when running in this mode.  The third person view allows 
              you to see not only where you are headed, but how far the chasing 
              mob is behind you if you learn how to pan quickly.  I highly recommend 
              this method.</p>

            <p>The post 50 spells are not bad at all. I am still learning them. 
              However, most peeps dont want you to even THINK about using AE 
              spells in their presence.  Most prefer the mezmerize, one at a time 
              approach to killing mobs.  Dont think this will ever change cause 
              Kunark mobs have tremendous hit points.  I just got a new spell, 
              Pillar of Frost.  I snared 3 Kunark mobs in Burning Woods and took 
              em all out at once for experience on all 3!  Its a little tricky 
              to run and get them all lined up, but it worked with great effect.

            <p>At higher levels you will have the money hopefully to buy items 
              that will alter your statistics any way you want.  I keep multiple 
              items on hand for different situations.  For instance if youre 
              gonna do Lord Nagafen, equip up with fire resist items or else you 
              may die before you get off more than 3 Ice Comets.  When you do 
              Gods and such, you need to equip yourself accordingly.  Those seemingly 
              worthless buff items become more important than ever. Ask any professional 
              god killing meleer.  They have lockers full of gear according to 
              the situation. </p>
            <p>You can pretty much buy items to alter your stats any way you like 
              it.  That is why the starting attribute stats are so important. 
              You cannot change these.  I have stressed Agility because I found 
              that that is the second most useful attribute besides Intelligence.  
              It is easy to enhance your intelligence more so than agility. Of 
              course, get your intelligence to 200, dont ever neglect that. You 
              can also opt to go the mana enhancing item route. I.E. - Black Sapphire 
              Plat Necklace gives you 55 mana, 35 hps, a nice item indeed that 
              is very useful when in large planes groups.  Adjust your wearing 
              of items according to what the situation calls for. I wear AGILITY 
              for speed when soloing. I wear mana items when in Plane of Fear. 
              I put on CHA items when selling back gems to NPCs and such.  You 
              can never have enough equipment it seems. Dont think you are stuck 
              with your stats. If you dont like them, do research on what you 
              would like to have and make a plan and get them! I could have over 
              260 intelligence easily. In fact, someday when I get enough money 
              again, Ill experiment with this setup.  I just believe in maintaining 
              a well-balanced character and I can usually go into most situations 
              with what I have on just fine. </p>
            <p>Just dont get too hung up about it as your coming through the 
              ranks.  You probably will not have enough money to buy all the equipment 
              you want anyway.  You will do fine even if you cannot afford backup 
              items.</p>

<p><b><font color="050056"><a name="18"></a>Spell Book Organization</font></b></p>
            <p>Simple enough but keep it organized.  This is how I do it: I put 
              all my self buffs, invis, snare, root spells etc. on page 1 -2 and 
              my most frequently used damage spells on pages 3 - 4. My gate is 
              left top of page 5 and rest of 5 -6 is gate spells. 7 - 8  are teleport 
              spells, and 9-10 my evac spells.  I stuck all my defunct obselete 
              spells on like pages 23 on up and arranged them there by type. It 
              just makes it easier. Oh by the way, you wont be evaccing in Kunark 
              hardly ever. The distances involved in getting back are just not 
              worth it. Of course make a LOC hotkey, a CORPSE hotkey, sit, camp, 
              assist, etc. hotkey. These are basics for all classes. I also have 
              a guild all hotkey, etc.  Its your preference but take advantage 
              of the games offerings to make your life easier from the start.</p>
            <p>Well I hoped you enjoyed my ramblings as an EQ wizard. Look for 
              me on the Rathe. Daneric, Knights of Phoenix.  Ill let you know 
              what life is like as a level 60 Sorcerer hopefully by summers end.  
              Post 50 levels truly are hellish.</p>
