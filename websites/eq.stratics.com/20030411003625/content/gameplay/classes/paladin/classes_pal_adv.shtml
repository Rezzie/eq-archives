                    Paladins are a combat-hybrid class in EverQuest, combining 
                    the qualities of Warriors and Clerics, with more of the former 
                    than the later. Where a Warrior is the unquestioned master 
                    of the brutal give and take of toe to toe melee combat, and 
                    the Cleric the best healer on the battlefield; a Paladin combines 
                    qualities of both into a single class. It is a not sum, but 
                    rather a blending where some parts are lessened or left out 
                    to avoid overpowering other flavors in the mix, and the result 
                    is a class that is surprisingly effective and resilient. Don't 
                    play a Paladin if you want to be known as a powerful caster; 
                    you won't be. You will receive spells, and you will be using 
                    them; but Paladins are secondary casters, limited in spell 
                    selection and mana reserves. A Paladin's true strength is 
                    his ability to function to roughly eighty percent of the full 
                    combat effectiveness of the Warrior, while retaining the casting 
                    ability as a reserve. While playing a Paladin, remember the 
                    mix is roughly three-fourths Warrior to one-fourth Cleric, 
                    playing accordingly, and you'll excel. </font>

                      Paladins take their skills from both parent classes. The 
                      basic combat skills (All weapons, offense, defense, taunt) 
                      follow the level cap formula of (Level * 5), which is five 
                      lower than the level cap of a Warrior. Additionally, the 
                      Paladin receives most advanced combat skills up to five 
                      levels later than the Warrior will. Bash is enabled at 6th, 
                      Dodge at 10th, Parry at 17th, Double Attack at 20th, Riposte 
                      at 30th, Disarm at 40th. However, once received they will 
                      quickly progress up to the Paladin's level cap, and soon 
                      be an integral part of the battle. Additionally, Bind Wounds 
                      can be learned at 10th, and can serve the Paladin equally 
                      as well as it does the Warrior. A recent addition to the 
                      class is Archery, available at 1st level, but one that can 
                      help make the Paladin's life a lot easier on the battlefield.

                        The spellcasting skills start arriving at 9th, with the 
                        addition of all the basic casting abilities (Abjuration, 
                        Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation and, of 
                        course, Channeling). Meditate doesn't come until 12th, 
                        but once it does the Paladin is a fully enabled warrior 
                        of his God, able to fight with a high degree of efficiency. 
                        All spellcasting skills level cap at the same formula,

                        The Paladin's unique ability is Lay On Hands. When used, 
                        it will heal up to one thousand (so I'm told) hit points. 
                        After laying on hands, a Paladin will be without this 
                        ultimate intervention of his god for the next Norrath 
                        day, roughly ninety minutes of real-time. Remember to 
                        use the targeting properly when attempting to lay on hands; 
                        if you try to save yourself with it, but fail to press 
                        F1 to target yourself instead of the monster you've been 
                        dueling with, your laying on of hands will be wasted on 
                        the monster before you, and most likely lead to your anguished 
                        death. When it comes time to 'push the paladin panic button', 
                        the sequence is F1, find LOH hotkey, push hotkey. Always 
                        force yourself to watch what you're doing, and to breath 
                        before just blindly stabbing at the keys; when you need 
                        the effect, you can't afford to waste it with a miskey.

                          When a Paladin receives his spells, he begins to feel 
                          complete. When he receives Meditate, he truly is complete, 
                          and will only add to his arsenal as new levels arrive. 
                          While only Rank 1, the Paladin's spells enable him to 
                          function far more effectively as a solo combatant; and 
                          provide useful backup and relief for the group's dedicated 
                          healers. The ability to cast Minor Heal and Cure Poison 
                          enables the Paladin to begin tackling fights and monsters 
                          he might have avoided before. At Rank 2, at 15th level, 
                          with the addition of Lesser Heal and Cure Disease, the 
                          Paladin really begins to have a lot of fun. All spell 
                          ranks beyond 2 only add to the fun. </font>

                    Paladins basically come in two flavors, melee based or magic 
                    based. Either is viable, but considering the class is a tank 
                    with magical abilities, rather than a mage with some tank 
                    aspects; the prospective Paladin is perhaps best served in 
                    the long run by focusing on the tank side. Most Paladins use 
                    their magic as a compliment to their melee, not the other 
                    way around; magic is used before and after combat, and very 
                    sparingly during. While battle is joined, let your weapons 
                    speak for you; afterwards use your connection with your god 
                    to prepare for the next. </font>

                      Namely, Strength, Stamina, Agility and Dexterity. Unlike 
                      in games like the ever-popular Dungeons and Dragons, EverQuest's 
                      attribute systems are a bit more nebulous, and not as they 
                      are in other games. The attributes in EverQuest do have 
                      impact on the character, and on the way the character will 
                      play; but it is different than what a veteran D&D player 
                      would assume, and requires one to examine closely to determine 
                      the differences. </font> 
                      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                        The most obvious benefit of Strength is increased encumbrance 
                        capacity; each point of strength is one pound that can 
                        be carried without penalty. As a tank class, Paladins 
                        will be called upon to carry the battle to the foe, which 
                        typically demands the best armor possible, and weapons 
                        to match; just this basic tank gear can easily weigh quite 
                        a bit, upwards of 80 or 90 enc even before standard carry 
                        gear like backpacks, food and water are considered, and 
                        to say nothing of all that loot you'll be taking out with 
                        you. But the other benefits from Strength are just as 
                        important. Many players complain about their 140 STR Ogre 
                        Warrior not hitting for more with the rusty longsword 
                        than their 90 STR Human Warrior; there is a possiblity, 
                        unconfirmed at this time, that higher strength might more 
                        directly affect the damage dealt at higher character levels. 
                        Rather, and this is also unconfirmed but suspected by 
                        some in the game; higher Strength increases the overall 
                        average damage inflicted. Meaning, specifically, a higher 
                        Strength character will hit for maximum or near maximum 
                        damage more often than a lower Strength character. Aside 
                        from damage, Strength affects the Attack rating of the 
                        character; increasing Strength increases the Attack rating. 
                        Strength may do other things as well.</font>

                        Stamina is perhaps the most 'dull' of the Physical attributes, 
                        but is important. It has the most direct affect on Hit 
                        Points gained per level. Stamina also directly affects 
                        the fatigue bar, the yellow bar under the blue mana bar. 
                        Your fatigue bar will last longer, and return quicker, 
                        with a higher stamina. In my opinion, Paladins have a 
                        sufficient starting Stamina, and those Paladin races that 
                        have a low starting Stamina have other weakness that are 
                        more important than Stamina to be addressed.</font>

                        When most people consider Agility, they think of defense; 
                        and this is true in EverQuest. Agility directly affects 
                        your character's defenses in two ways. By increasing the 
                        Defense rating, and also by adding an 'agility bonus' 
                        to each AC gained from a piece of armor. This will result 
                        in the character getting hit less often in combat, which 
                        enables him to have a higher combat hang-time; possibly 
                        living where others died. Agility also has a small affect 
                        on the Attack rating. Finally, Dexterity affects several 
                        things. The Attack rating is impacted by Dexterity, as 
                        is the likelihood of successful Channeling rolls (to avoid 
                        spell interruption). Dexterity also affects trade skill 
                        rolls like Blacksmithing or Jewelcrafting. And when wielding 
                        a weapon or item with a special effect, the check to determine 
                        when and how often the effect goes off is based on your 
                        Dexterity.</font>

                        Wisdom is that attribute. For a Paladin, as with a Cleric, 
                        Wisdom is the attribute key to the Paladin's magic; determining 
                        mana. Wisdom is also rumored to have small effects on 
                        skill learns and skill success rolls, and also in resisting

                    The single most defining decision in a character's creation 
                    after that of class is of race. The race a player selects 
                    for his character will determine how other players react to 
                    the character, where the character begins, how NPCs will react, 
                    and even restrict where in the vast world of Norrath a character 
                    can safely travel. It is an important decision, for roleplaying 
                    reasons equally as much as statistical ones, and should never 
                    be rushed or made in haste. You'll be stuck with this character 
                    for a long time if you decide to play it, months certainly; 
                    be happy with your decision. There are five races that can 
                    choose the path of a Paladin. They are Dwarves, Erudites, 
                    Half-Elves, High-Elves and Humans. Each has strengths or weaknesses, 
                    in one form versus another. The choice will determine the 
                    type of paladin you play, not just during interactions, but 
                    also on the battlefield. Certain races are better suited to 
                    certain aspects of the Paladin's lot than others. Keeping 
                    these limitations in mind will prevent resentment over an 
                    inability to dominate in a weak area of your chosen race.

                      These short, hardy folk are renowned for being resilient, 
                      strong and quite stubborn. In historical fantasy literature, 
                      they tend to be intensely loyal, deliberate in decision, 
                      fanatical in pursuit of a grudge or slight, and are often 
                      portrayed as stalwartly shouldering great burdens as a people. 
                      In EverQuest, they are always strong and sturdy, with good 
                      hands and common sense. They pay for these advantages with 
                      a slightly lower nimbleness, a slow speed of wit and a decidedly 
                      off-putting demeanor. </font>

                        Dwarven Paladins begin with unmodified stats as follows: 
                        100-95-70-90-88-60-55. First, make note of the makeup 
                        presented you. The Strength is quite good, +25 over the 
                        EverQuest average of 75; Stamina is high as well, +20, 
                        and Dexterity at +15. Agility is only -5. Wisdom starts 
                        +13, while Intelligence is -15, and Charisma -20. Dwarves 
                        have the highest Physicals, and the highest STR, STA and 
                        DEX. They share the second highest WIS (with Erudites). 
                        However, they have the lowest INT and CHA, and also the 
                        lowest AGI.</font>

                        As always, character design ideas and notions will vary 
                        widely from player to player, one seeing advantage in 
                        one combination of increases while another thinks exactly 
                        the opposite. But, typically, when designing a Dwarven 
                        Paladin, it's probably a good idea to emphasize the strengths 
                        of the bases, and simply accept the drawbacks presented.</font>

                        which would give over +25 in the two main prime attributes 
                        for the class (STR and WIS), and provides an excellent 
                        magical compliment to the dwarf's already good physical 
                        side. Alternately, the points can be used to boost the 
                        low INT, resulting in 100-95-70-90-88-80-55, for design 
                        even more balanced across the attributes than the WIS

                          Strength at -5, Stamina average, Agility -5, Dexterity

                          dwarves, and hold the highest INT, hands down. They 
                          also benefit from a not so low CHA, though it is only

                          Due to the more than adequate INT, and perfectly respectable 
                          WIS, Erudite Paladins typically focus on the physical 
                          side during design. Since the Paladin is a melee class, 
                          an overemphasis on the mental side presents serious 
                          potential to slow growth for Erudite Paladins. The already 
                          high mentals can support everything a melee class might 
                          want to do (and often doesn't have the INT to back up). 
                          Also, armor and weapons loadouts can get quite heavy 
                          until high level magical and rare items are obtained; 
                          encumbrance problems always nip at the heels of melee 
                          characters with low STR. Having said all that, a highly 
                          recommended design for Erudite Paladins is STR heavy, 
                          90-75-70-70-88-107-80. A 90 STR is on the low side of 
                          what's considered acceptable for melee types, but can 
                          be made to work; especially with some judicious application 
                          of low and mid level magic items that enhance Strength. 
                          If one is determined to not invest in Strength, a design 
                          that pumps into AGI (70-75-90-70-88-107-80) or DEX (70-75-70-90-88-107-80) 
                          can certainly be made.</font>

                          Splits involving INT or CHA are not recommended, because 
                          such low Physicals in a melee character demand serious 
                          attention during character design.</font>

                          historical fantasy literature, half-elves were wanderers,

                          often presented in varying manners as bitter against

                          as elves with more sense than typical elves, as humans 
                          with more grace and beauty than typical humans, and 
                          as those who bridge two separate cultures. In short, 
                          there are a variety of 'acceptable' personalities applicable

                            results. The low WIS will have a direct impact on

                            there is no 'plain elf' race in the game universe. 
                            There are only Wood Elves, presented as the common

                    Each is a mirror opposite of the other. Paladins are three 
                    parts tank, one part healer. Clerics are three parts healer,

                    in mind when you play your paladin; you are a tank. To be 
                    technical, you're a self-filling tank; you can burn off some 
                    fuel, then replenish it yourself. </font>

                        Archery is the one tough one. Archery is a skill that 
                        requires a continual expendure of cash, unlike the other 
                        combat skills which simply require a one-time, up front, 
                        investment in a weapon. Arrows, even self made for 4cp 
                        - 6cp each, can begin to drain a young character's resources. 
                        For this reason, it's often best to leave Archery largely 
                        alone until you enter the second or third phase of development.</font>

                        Through this period, expect to use the newbie weapon, 
                        and then an appropriate rusty weapon that you find. Also, 
                        Cloth armor is what you should get used to. Towards the 
                        very end of this phase you may be able to obtain Patchwork 
                        armor, which is a great upgrade from Cloth for a fledgling 
                        tank. Money from newbie monsters is simply very hard to 
                        come by; you should make enough to pay for food and water, 
                        perhaps fishing bait and poles, and not much else. </font>

                          Paladins receive Bash at 6th, their first special combat 
                          skill, and their only alternate attack. Bash requires 
                          a shield to function, and is a good excuse to acquire 
                          one if you haven't prior to this point. The increase 
                          in AC will help out, and the added features of additional 
                          damage and good caster interrupt will assist you during 
                          battle. At 10th, you receive Dodge, your first automatic 
                          combat skill. Train one point and watch it start to 
                          rise. By the time you reach about 50 points, you should 
                          begin to notice at least one dodged blow per battle. 
                          Also at 10th, Bind Wounds becomes available. Unless 
                          you know a Magician who can summon bandages for you, 
                          this is a very expensive skill to practice, and a frustrating 
                          one as well. You have to reach a high level of proficiency, 
                          well past 60 or 70 points, before you'll begin to notice 
                          significant benefit. This phase will seem to drag on 
                          and on though, as Warriors start to look like a better 
                          deal than Paladins with their more accomplished abilities, 
                          and your lack of magic. </font>

                            At 9th, the first of three major landmarks arrives 
                            for a Paladin, spells. Rank 1 Cleric spells may not 
                            seem like much to jump around for, but after all that 
                            time of being promised another facet of your character, 
                            to finally receive it is a great blessing. Immediately 
                            proceed to your guild and train one point in each 
                            of Abjuration, Alteration, Divination and Channeling. 
                            Then start practicing your spells. Unfortunately, 
                            you'll never match the mana reserves of a pure Cleric, 
                            effectively count yourself as your level minus eight 
                            for purposes of determining mana in the fashion a 
                            Cleric would. But if you make it a point to always 
                            have less than full mana, unless heavily engaged in 
                            combat, you should soon find your skills in magic

                            If you haven't already so attired yourself, you should 
                            be in full Patchwork very early in this phase. Typical 
                            prices for Patchwork are 2gp to 5gp per piece (7 pieces 
                            makes a full set of Patchwork, as Verant hasn't implemented 
                            patterns for all the possible body location), and 
                            you should be charged on the low end of the scale 
                            if you provide the tailor with a ruined pelt or two 
                            per piece. As you move through 8th or so, you should 
                            start to collect leather and rawhide armor, which 
                            should run you about 5gp to 7gp per piece. You'll 
                            be able to find leather for all body locations, and 
                            by the time you reach 10th you should be in full leather 
                            with a few low level magic items in various slots 
                            (studded or spiked collars, rusty spiked shoulderpads, 
                            dervish rings, things like that). If you know a smith, 
                            or if you hang out in heavily populated zones, you 
                            might even manage to acquire a piece of banded or 
                            ringmail here and there, but it will probably still 
                            be a bit out of your price range. </font>

                              Also, right as you hit 6th, you'll start to really 
                              chafe against the limited abilities of your rusty 
                              weapon. Priority one for this phase should be to 
                              upgrade your weapon. The 'normal' versions of the 
                              weapons (Longsword, as opposed to Rusty, Tarnished 
                              or Fine Steel) are prohibitively expensive; so much 
                              so that you'll never buy one (by the time you can 
                              properly afford store prices for these 'normal' 
                              weapons, you'll be using magical or other unique 
                              weapons). There are two major options for rising 
                              tanks; the infamous Minotaur Axe, and a Fine Steel 
                              weapon in your chosen flavor. For 2h-s wielders, 
                              you pretty much have the Fine Steel 2-Handed Sword 
                              or Axe as your best option for now. The Minotaur 
                              Axe should run you 4pp or less, especially if you're 
                              on Feydwer; prices may be higher in Halas or Qeynos. 
                              The Fine Steel 1h-s weapon should cost between 5pp 
                              and 10pp, but 8pp to 10pp is the 'sock-it-to-the-buyer' 
                              area of that price range. The Fine Steel weapons 
                              typically sell to vendors for about 3pp to 4pp, 
                              so asking 5pp to 7pp is a reasonable profit over 
                              that, and provides a service to your fellow player. 
                              Hopefully, young paladins will find a kind soul 
                              who's not eager to graft from those younger than 
                              he. You'll also need to buy a shield, look through 
                              the stores to get a feel for what's available to 
                              your race and class, and maybe ask over auction 
                              if anyone has what you're looking for, then make 
                              the purchase. The shield you get now will probably 
                              be carried through the next two phases or so.</font>

                              Archery is a lot more feasible here, if you keep 
                              it to a dull roar and make your own arrows. Roughly 
                              3pp should buy you a fletching kit and a Hemp strung 
                              Hickory bow from a more accomplished Fletcher, and 
                              get your first hundred or so arrows worth of components. 
                              Getting Fletching up to about 50 shouldn't cost 
                              so terribly much, and will give you the ability 
                              to make basic Class 1 arrows costing about 6cp each 
                              with a success rate better than 75%. Practicing 
                              Archery requires either an understanding group (willing 
                              to let you stand off and shoot arrows, instead of 
                              engaging in melee), or requires several hours of 
                              hanging around areas where the fights are white 
                              or better to you and shooting into the backs of

                              comes at 12th, the second major landmark for Paladins, 
                              and you'll suddenly wonder how you ever got along 
                              without it. Indeed, prior to 12th, you'll find soloing 
                              incredibly painful as you complete a fight and then 
                              enter a period of casting Minor Heal, sitting for 
                              five minutes to restore some mana, casting more 
                              Minor Heal, etc... After Meditate though, you replace 
                              the Sit button on your primary keybank with Spells, 
                              so you simply complete a battle, cast some post-battle 
                              spells, then click your Spells hotkey and use your 
                              mouse to start Meditating. Also, after Meditate, 
                              you'll notice memorizing spells takes far less time 
                              than it once did. </font>

                                The other waypoint is at 15th, when you receive 
                                your Rank 2 spells. Of these, the most welcome 
                                is Light Heal, which will be a sorely needed upgrade 
                                to the now inadequate Minor Heal. Further, you 
                                receive Cure Disease and Lull, both of which have 
                                their places. You also get Hammer of Wrath and 
                                Ward Undead, both spells that represent the first 
                                chance you have to work Conjuration and Evocation, 
                                respectively. It's recommended you wait until 
                                now to put points into these skills because of 
                                the way EverQuest handles the 'learning the basics 
                                of...'. By waiting, you'll save training points, 
                                and have a higher rating to show for it. In any 
                                event, because of the high casting costs and low 
                                initial skill levels, these are painful spells 
                                to practice. Some tips for doing so are shown

                                  magic to hit, so you should be able to hold 
                                  out just a little longer.</font>

                                  As for Archery, there's little reason not to 
                                  upgrade from Hickory to Elm; you should expect 
                                  to pay from 4pp to 7pp for an Elm bow strung 
                                  as you like, depending on the fletcher. Or you 
                                  can work your fletching up and construct one 
                                  yourself; a few tries with a skill in the 50s 
                                  or 60s should yield a bow.</font>

                                  Another two waypoints await you here. The first 
                                  is at 17th, Parry. Like Dodge, this is an automatic 
                                  combat skill, and one you'll soon learn to love. 
                                  By the time you get to about 50 points, you 
                                  should see one parry per battle. Combined with 
                                  Dodge, the duo make for quite a few shots that 
                                  simply don't hit you. Toward the end of this 
                                  phase, when both are reaching into the 90+ points 
                                  area, you should see them go off several time

                                    receive Double Attack for your last major 
                                    landmark. During the previous and current 
                                    phases, you had to suffer Warrior Envy as 
                                    you watched Warriors and Rangers run around 
                                    with two weapons, and as you watched them 
                                    both out perform you blow for blow. Especially 
                                    as you near 20, you should notice you have 
                                    a lot of difficulty taunting MOBs off fellow 
                                    Warriors simply from the sheer amount of damage 
                                    they're dealing. Double Attack changes that, 
                                    finally moving you back into contention as 
                                    a respectable Tank.</font>

                                    you'll notice a definite increase here, especially 
                                    if you move into the pure dungeon zones for 
                                    your adventuring. Befallen, Cazic Thule, Guk, 
                                    Unrest, High Hold Pass and other zones will 
                                    become like second homes to you, yielding

                                    that you'll really start to feel like a part 
                                    of the world, no more merely ignoring auctions, 
                                    but actually looking at what's for sale, and 
                                    determining if you want it, rather than simply 
                                    shrugging it off because you know it's out 
                                    of your reach. Further, you'll be far more 
                                    free to travel without constant fear of instant 
                                    death from anything moving. This freedom is 
                                    rather enjoyable, and enables you to explore 
                                    the continents.</font>

                                    or your armor? Either can be correct if you

                                      magical, should cost you about 100pp. Full

                                      around 120pp or 130pp. You'll notice the 
                                      lower frequency of hits, and the lower damage

                                      or Combine. Combine weapons are available 
                                      from the Gypsy camps scattered through the 
                                      realm of Norrath, research the EverQuest 
                                      websites to determine where to find one. 
                                      Not all camps carry all Combines, and not

                                      for, expect to pay between 50pp and 65pp, 
                                      depending on Charisma, for a 1h-s Combine 
                                      weapon like a Longsword or Scimitar. For 
                                      a Combine 2-Handed Sword, expect to pay 
                                      from about 90pp to as much as 110pp. The 
                                      advantage of Combines is their stats are 
                                      identical to the familiar Fine Steel weapons, 
                                      and they're readily available with no waiting

                                      the players' market, and are subject to 
                                      availability and location. If you're after

                                      Tomahawks, Bone Bladed Claymores and Shiny 
                                      Brass Halberds. The advantage of Uniques

                                      (a bit more damage or a bit less delay than 
                                      comparable combine weapons), and also tend 
                                      to have a few low to mid range magical effects. 
                                      If you can put together a group, you may 
                                      want to try and fight your way through the

                                      the desired item yourself; but don't hold 
                                      your breath for the highly desired items. 
                                      Let's just say there are some extremely 
                                      rude and greedy people playing this game.</font>

                                      The point of upgrading your weapon is twofold, 
                                      however. To increase your weapon efficiency 
                                      (if possible), and to also add the ability 
                                      to tackle magic-only MOBs, like the ghouls 
                                      that have probably been plaguing you for 
                                      a while now. Some zones, particularly undead 
                                      zones like Befallen and Unrest, require 
                                      enchanted weaponry to make in headway in. 
                                      The loot makes up for it, but first you 
                                      have to make a downpayment.</font>

                                      Also, if you're following the Sword and 
                                      Shield route, you'll want a magical shield. 
                                      The easiest to get, either by fighting (if 
                                      you can make it past the hordes of farmers 
                                      in Crushbone) or by purchasing, is a Shiny 
                                      Brass Shield. Expect to pay 15pp to 20pp 
                                      on Feydwer and be able to find one without 
                                      too much effort, and up to as much as 30pp 
                                      to 40pp on Antonica depending on how far 
                                      from Freeport you are, with more effort. 
                                      The point of getting a magical shield is 
                                      the ability to bash magic-only creatures 
                                      without getting the dreaded INVULNERABLE 
                                      message in combat. If you're not going to 
                                      get a magic shield, you might as well get 
                                      a magic 2h-s weapon for fighting in such 
                                      zones. While it is not very important when 
                                      fighting in heavy undead zones, because 
                                      many undead are magic only, you should be 
                                      able to upgrade from an Elm to Ash bow at 
                                      this point, and will probably appreciate 
                                      the change. There is a price jump, from 
                                      roughly 3pp in materials costs to about 
                                      20pp, but an Ash bow will serve you well. 
                                      If you purchase an Ash bow, expect to pay 
                                      between 25pp to as much as 40pp, depending 
                                      on area and the fletcher. It might help 
                                      if he knows you personally. Unfortunately, 
                                      you'll likely be unable to afford a coveted 
                                      Oak bow until the next phase.</font>

                                      Here, you have a few things to look forward 
                                      to. At 22nd you receive your Rank 3 spells, 
                                      including Root, Center and Invisibility 
                                      to Undead. There are good uses for most 
                                      of the spells you receive. At 30th you gain 
                                      access to Rank 4, which brings Healing (upgrading 
                                      from Light Healing), Expluse Undead (upgrading 
                                      Ward), Soothe (upgrading Lull) and Stun 
                                      (adding a spell that produces a Bash stun). 
                                      All are welcome. Also at 30th you get Riposte, 
                                      which will further upgrade your melee skills. 
                                      When Riposte goes off, you get an additional 
                                      attack against the MOB. Since you get a 
                                      Riposte check against every swing of the 
                                      MOB, it's possible for a character, with 
                                      enough luck and skill, to Riposte several 
                                      times in a single round. Riposte attacks 
                                      don't replace your normally allotted attacks., 
                                      but rather supplement them. </font>

                                        As you enter this phase you'll really 
                                        be raking loot in, all kinds of unique, 
                                        interesting types of weapons, armor and 
                                        equipment, and also cash. Depending on 
                                        where in the world you're fighting, you'll 
                                        have had the ability to add any low to 
                                        mid level magical item you like; earrings 
                                        and rings, bracers, collars, shoulderpads, 
                                        belts, boots and other items that bring 
                                        attribute bonuses or add some type of 
                                        ability. In fact, you'll feel almost compelled 
                                        to obtain these items, as your tank status 
                                        will urge you to continually better yourself 
                                        and your equipment. At this phase, you'll 
                                        want to be working on as much as twenty 
                                        or thirty points of bonuses to your base 
                                        attributes, and possibly even have multiple 
                                        'bonus attribute configurations' (one 
                                        for combat, one for a different type of 
                                        combat; like STR and STA for meleeing 
                                        vs. DEX and AGI for archery, CHA for selling 
                                        loot, INT for working trade skills, etc...).

                                          Armor wise, you should certainly be 
                                          in full metal armor, at least banded, 
                                          very early in this phase. Store bought 
                                          plate is still prohibitively expensive, 
                                          and, like normal weapons, will likely 
                                          remain so. By the time you can truly 
                                          afford to purchase it, you'll most likely 
                                          be wearing various forms of magical 
                                          unique armors (like Rubicite, as an 
                                          example). At this phase, you'll start 
                                          to adventure in zones dependant upon 
                                          the possible loot; not just for the 
                                          cash value of the loot, but for the 
                                          actual loot itself. Tanks always need 
                                          the best possible equipment, and fighting 
                                          against ever more powerful MOBs will 
                                          continually remind you of this.</font>

                                          Regarding weaponry, your basic Combine 
                                          or other mid level unique weapon should 
                                          continue to serve you well; though you'll

                                          and to investigate rumors of Holy Swords. 
                                          As far as the players of EverQuest know 
                                          at this point, some Holy Swords do exist, 
                                          but are fairly rare, and hard to get. 
                                          Be prepared to camp spots for upwards 
                                          of a week to obtain even a known sword 
                                          like Ghoulbane. Other swords are little 
                                          more than myth at this point, though 
                                          Paladins continue to eagerly track down 
                                          their existences.</font>

                                          Somewhere in this area, you should be 
                                          able to obtain an Oak bow, strung as 
                                          you like. When getting an Oak bow, be 
                                          sure to get a good one, worked with 
                                          the tools you request. Examine some 
                                          fletching sources on the web, and have 
                                          the bow done just as you like. There 
                                          is a sizable price difference between 
                                          an Oak and Darkwood bow, so you'll probably 
                                          carry your Oak bow for several weeks, 
                                          at least, before being able to lay down 
                                          the platinum on a Darkwood bow. Constructing 
                                          these is quite expensive, and purchasing 
                                          them even moreso. You may wish to buy 
                                          one from someone selling, as it eliminates 
                                          the chance you might make a very expensive 
                                          failure on your own fletching roll. 
                                          Paying 100pp over the materials cost 
                                          is a small price to pay for the guarantee

                                          the upper 30s, Lower Guk is supposed 
                                          to support into the mid 40s. Kerr Keep, 
                                          a dungeon located beneath the waters 
                                          of Dagnor's Cauldron, doesn't start 
                                          until the low 30s. Mistmore, in Lesser 
                                          Faydark, is designed to begin in the 
                                          extreme upper 20s and hold you right 
                                          on to 50. Permafrost Keep, on the Everfrost 
                                          plains, is supposed to be similar to 
                                          Mistmore, maybe starting a bit higher.

                                          various evil zones and amuse yourself 
                                          killing guards that plagued you so when

                        like it should do. However, Verant left the Beta ability

                        in the game, and thus all the identification spells are 
                        largely ineffective. Sense Magic does have one important 
                        benefit; it's a very easy way to practice your Divination 
                        skill. While resting or fishing, repeatedly cast it on 
                        yourself to increase Divination. Divination may seem kind 
                        of useless right now, but the Divination school of spells

                                A Paladin has fewer mana points than a Cleric 
                                does; remember, your mana bar doesn't start counting 
                                until you hit 9th. So a 17th Cleric who's Out 
                                Of Mana (OOM) will have to meditate for a lot 
                                longer than you will at 17th. In fact, you can 
                                usually cast a full mana bar of healing, meditate 
                                back up and cast another full bar and be fully 
                                meditated again before the Cleric's Full Mana 
                                (FM) again. Clerics are there to cast healing 
                                during battles. Paladins are there to cast healing 
                                before and after battles. This seems simple enough, 
                                but a lot of Paladins don't see it. It's ok for 
                                a Paladin to enter battle with low or no mana; 
                                for a cleric, it's a waste of time. When you see 
                                your puller running toward you with MOBs in tow, 
                                hit him with a heal as he runs up. After the battle, 
                                tell the clerics to sit down and start meditating 
                                while you start topping people off (puller first, 
                                then tanks evenly, then everyone else evenly).

                                burn your mana after the last MOB falls on heals, 
                                so they can start meditating back to full mana 
                                that much sooner. The quicker your healers are 
                                full, the quicker the group can tackle another 
                                tough fight.</font>

                                  the spells as often as you can find a target, 
                                  even if it's yourself, when you first receive 
                                  Rank 1 spells, and this skill will fill out 
                                  just fine.</font>

                                  Divination is a head scratcher for most Paladins, 
                                  but if you look ahead at the spells on the higher 
                                  ranks, you'll see some spells that anyone can 
                                  find a use for that use Diviniation. At Rank1 
                                  you receive two spells that will let you practice 
                                  this skill. The easiest way to practice is to 
                                  cast Sense Magic on yourself repeatedly when 
                                  waiting for any reason, while fishing, sitting 
                                  to heal, waiting for group members to return. 
                                  This process will bring your Divination up nicely, 
                                  and enable you to be fully prepared to begin 
                                  using the more appealing spells when you receive

                                  Evocation, however, comes at 15th, and produces 
                                  some extremely frustrating hours for most paladins. 
                                  The spell that uses it at Rank 2, Ward Undead, 
                                  is a fairly expensive spell to cast; taking 
                                  most of a bar of mana. Further, it must be cast 
                                  only on undead, which can be hard to find sometimes. 
                                  And the endless fizzling produced by the lack 
                                  of skill in Evocation isn't designed to improve 
                                  a paladin's mood. The best way to practice Evocation, 
                                  therefore, is to find a newbie skeleton somewhere. 
                                  Kill it with a Ward, a single Ward will cause 
                                  it to crumple, and will give you some practice. 
                                  Then sit next to the skeleton's corpse and cycle 
                                  between meditating to regenerate mana, and casting 
                                  Ward on the undead corpse. This will cause your 
                                  skill to increase, a few hours, at most, should 
                                  bring your skill up to a very respectable level, 
                                  and eliminate the fizzling problem that had 
                                  you tearing your hair out at the roots. Ward 
                                  is still an expensive spell to cast, but the 
                                  corpse targeting will allow you to practice 
                                  very efficiently without having to constantly 
                                  search for targets.</font>

                                  Conjuration is the final skill, and the one 
                                  least used by paladins. Some don't even bother 
                                  to work the skill. If you do, be prepared to 
                                  spend a lot of time fizzling and meditating. 
                                  The only way to aleviate the pain of Conjuration 
                                  practice is to wait until Rank 3, when you receive 
                                  Halo of Light, which has a lower mana cost than 
                                  Hammer of Wrath. But since there are only three 
                                  skills on the known Paladin spell lists that 
                                  use Conjuration, it may just be a trinket kind 
                                  of thing to practice the skill.</font>

                    This is one of the most infamous 'fights' in all of EverQuest. 
                    It's a lot like the 'Superman could beat up Luke Skywalker 
                    - no he couldn't!' fights you used to have when you were younger. 
                    Verant has largely done a pretty good job of balancing this 
                    game, and even in areas where it's not totally even, it's 
                    still fairly close. There is no one 'best' weapon, or one 
                    'best' weapon skill. Read that again. Think about it. Now, 
                    understand; most games are unbalanced, in that with a little 
                    research into the numbers behind it, you can find the one 
                    'killer combo' that gives the most advantage over the other 
                    combos possible. Gamers are used to broken games, and are 
                    trying to apply those rules to EverQuest. So far, they're 
                    not succeeding. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      So, here's how the 1h vs. 2h argument breaks down for all 
                      involved. First, you must understand weapon efficiency ratings. 
                      Divide the Damage by the Delay, round to three decimal places, 
                      and you get a number that looks a lot like a batting average. 
                      This number represents the default efficiency of the weapon.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Notice I said default efficiency. Meaning the weapon's efficiency 
                      when used in a completely controlled test environment. We 
                      all know that doesn't happen in EverQuest, you never get 
                      perfect conditions, and no two fights are exactly alike. 
                      So the ratios are only a rule of thumb. They're a convenient 
                      thing to look at and rub your chin sagely when pondering 
                      a weapon purchase. Typically, the good 1h-s weapons have 
                      ratios in the 0.200 vicinity. For example, a Fine Steel 
                      Longsword (6/28 0.214), the popular Minotaur Axe (8/37 0.216) 
                      and the less common 1 Handed Dwarven Axe (6/26 0.231). There 
                      haven't been any reports of any 1h-s weapons past 0.250 
                      that aren't unique, class specific weapons; examples, Painbringer 
                      (Warrior Only 7/23 0.304) and Ghoulbane (Paladin Holysword 
                      15/34 0.441). Most of the best 1h-s weapons are rare loot 
                      drops, are magical, and are highly sought after.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Typically, the good 2h-s weapons have ratios in the 0.250 
                      to 0.300 range. For example, a Fine Steel 2 Handed Sword 
                      (12/43 0.279), a Halberd (14/50 0.280), or a Dwarven 2 Handed 
                      Axe (14/43 0.326). Some of the best known 2h-s weapons have 
                      ratios that reach into the 0.350 and higher range. Examples, 
                      Executioner's Axe (Warrior Only 25/50 0.500), Bone Bladed 
                      Claymore (17/45 0.378 but with a nasty attribute hit), or 
                      Shiny Brass Halberd (16/48 0.333).</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Now, here's where you have to be able to use your mind a 
                      little to understand the concept of 'neither is better, 
                      just different'. There are two things to focus on when considering 
                      weaponry, aside from any beneficial or negative enchantments 
                      (like Polished Granite Tomahawks have a great Strength enhancement, 
                      and Bone Bladed Claymores have a heavy Agility hit); the 
                      amount of damage it does, and the delay factor involved.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Sound simple enough, but it's where most players stumble 
                      and miss the details. Most players focus exclusively on 
                      damage. It's somewhat understandable, everyone likes to 
                      see big numbers. Most players look for a weapon that will 
                      give them a big number when they hit.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      What these players are completely discounting is the time 
                      between hits. Take two very common examples, the Minotaur 
                      Axe (8/37 0.216) and the Fine Steel Longsword (6/28 0.214). 
                      On Efficiency, these weapons are all but identical. The 
                      Minotaur Axe hits twenty-five percent harder, but is twenty-five 
                      percent slower. So it doesn't matter which you pick, right?</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      And it's on this one point, this one question, where the 
                      two schools of thought diverge completely. If you think 
                      Superman's king, he'll always be better than Luke Skywalker. 
                      If you like the young Jedi Knight, you'll never like the 
                      Man of Steel as much. There is data to support either position, 
                      but it largely comes down to a semantic issue.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Delay directly affects how many swings you can get off in 
                      a one minute fight. Faster weapon will receive more swings. 
                      In the case of the Fine Steel Longsword and Minotaur Axe, 
                      you'll swing twenty-five percent more often, but do twenty-five 
                      percent less damage, or vice versa. There are some situations 
                      where you're certainly better off with one vs. the other 
                      (for example, against casters, where interruption of spells 
                      is critical to success; another example, in tough fights 
                      where you may miss often; missing with one out of four swings 
                      isn't as critical when you're swinging twelve times as it 
                      is when you're swinging only eight; or when you want to 
                      stun or demoralize an opponent, higher single swing damage 
                      totals tend to do this more often), but largely it's a matter 
                      of personal taste.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      So that considers just weapon vs. weapon. It does not include 
                      in the factoring the presence of the special combat attacks 
                      like Bash (and Slam, for the large races) and Kick. For 
                      Warriors, especially Large Warriors, it doesn't matter. 
                      They can use 1h-s and a shield and still bash or kick, or 
                      they can use 2h-s and still kick (and slam if they're Large). 
                      But for Paladins, they can only Bash when equipping a 1h-s 
                      with a shield. Simply put, when wielding a 2h-s weapon, 
                      Paladins are not as combat efficient as Warriors wielding 
                      a 2h-s weapon, or even a Ranger (who also retain Kick). 
                      The efficiencies of Kick and Bash are much more murky than 
                      those of the known weaponry, but they do add to the overall 
                      efficiency in combat. Going to 2h-s without a special combat 
                      attack very well means yielding points of efficiency to 
                      the Warriors and Rangers. This may not preclude consideration 
                      of 2h-s as a viable combat option, but is a definite factor 
                      when comparing the performances of the classes to one another.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      And none of the above considers the combat situation with 
                      the Armor Class enhancing qualities of the shield equipped, 
                      or with the possibility of using the shield as an extra 
                      slot from which to garner magical enchantment bonuses (+10 
                      Magical Resist from a Shiny Brass Shield, or +9 Strength 
                      from a Darkwood Shield, for example).</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      When you add it all up, Paladins tend to be more suited 
                      to 1h-s and Shield than 2h-s, but it's still a fairly minor 
                      issue. Nothing says you can't use 2h-s, or that you have 
                      to use 1h-s and shield. Personal tastes, availability of 
                      equipment, hunting styles, group configuration, mood and 
                      much more will factor this choice. But perhaps, after fully 
                      thinking the facts through, you'll be able to make a more 
                      informed position; and not merely one based on rumor and 
                      hope. </font>

                    especially during combat. You only get six buttons per hotkey 
                    bank, and have to use the mouse arrows or the (faster) shift-number 
                    keys to change banks. Those six keys start out filled with 
                    extraneous stuff like fishing and begging, but quickly grow 
                    crowded. Before you know it, you're branching out into two, 
                    three, even all six of the banks. You place your buttons just 
                    so, and grow quite accustomed to them. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Because you only get six slots per bank, it's important 
                      to group them by bank for the maximum amount of relevance 
                      and efficiency; you don't want to have to continually shift 
                      key back and forth between banks to get at buttons you need 
                      on a regular basis. Place the buttons that you need for 
                      your play style, and change them only when you need to; 
                      you'll find you get quite unconscious about where a button 
                      is, and will find yourself stabbing at it even after you've 
                      changed the position.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      I recommend players set up one, possibly two, combat hotkey 
                      banks; the primary and secondary. It can also be of great 
                      use to have a 'travelling', 'goofing off' or 'corpse recovery' 
                      bank. You may find use with a spell bank, or an inventory 
                      bank.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      First, look at your keyboard, if you're not a touch typist 
                      (and therefore know the keyboard by heart); the A key for 
                      'Auto Attack On' is right next to your 1 - 6 number keys. 
                      You can rest your hand on the left side of the keyboard 
                      and still operate the mouse with your right. If you want 
                      to get really fancy, remap movement keys to the left side 
                      of the keyboard in some fashion to enable you to never touch 
                      the right side of the keyboard (including the number pad 
                      for movement). But even if you switch between both sides 
                      of the keyboard and/or between movement and mouse control, 
                      you can operate your melee attack without hotkeying a button 
                      for it. That saves you a slot right there. Now, you have 
                      a Ranged Attack; this is probably a good choice for your 
                      combat bank. The chance to take bow shot will often come 
                      and go quickly, you don't want to miss it do you? Bash, 
                      if you're equipping 1h-s and a shield, is another key you'll 
                      certainly need. If you have Meditate you need a Spells button 
                      (so you can mouse click the Meditate button, which you can't 
                      hotkey, sadly); if you don't have Meditate you'll need a 
                      Sit button available somewhere. You need Taunt during combat, 
                      gotta have Taunt or your casters will hate you. And you 
                      have spells that you might want to get off at a moment's 
                      notice. There's also Lay On Hands, Sense Heading, skills 
                      like Fishing, containers like a Backpack, console commands 
                      like /time, /corpse and /loc.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Having said all that, here are the bank setups I use.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      My Primary Combat bank is on Shift-1, and is where I spend 
                      the majority of my time. Range Attack, Bash, Spells, Taunt, 
                      Healing (whatever Healing Spell I currently am best at), 
                      Ward Undead. Ranged Attack so I can switch from melee to 
                      range quickly, which I often do in combat. Bash and Taunt 
                      should be obvious. Spells is in my primary combat bank because 
                      I will complete a fight and immediately cast and then meditate. 
                      The Healing slot is there because I hate fumbling for the 
                      mouse in the middle of a battle, someone could die before 
                      I get the cursor over to the spell icon and click it; likewise, 
                      Ward Undead is there for the same reason regarding mouse 
                      fumbling. When I stop hunting in a heavy undead area I'll 
                      replace Ward with something else, Sit again maybe, or a 
                      spell like Yaulp.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      My Secondary Combat Bank is on Shift-2, and is my emergency 
                      bank. I have Lay On Hands, Sense Heading, my healing and 
                      curing spells, and the sit command. There are two reasons 
                      I have LOH on the secondary bank. One is I got tired of 
                      occasionally hit the wrong key and wasting my LOH for the 
                      next ninety minutes. The other is it keeps me on my toes, 
                      when I shift over to my secondary, I know I'm in serious 
                      trouble.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      On Shift-3, I have my travel and corpse recovery keys. Sense 
                      Heading, /Corpse, /Location, /Time, /Sit and /Fishing. When 
                      I'm journeying from one zone to another, I use this bank 
                      because it has what I need. I can check my direction, see 
                      what time it is, drag my corpse after me, see where I am, 
                      sit down to rest and start fishing with my rod in hand (I'm 
                      a Master Fisher, by the way). To program your own buttons 
                      with console commands (even with things like shouts or default 
                      emoticons or says), click the Socials button on the main 
                      screen (the F10 windowed screen), then pick a button you're 
                      not using and rename it, and type the slash command in the 
                      box below just as you would from the command line.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      I haven't filled up any other banks, but there's no reason 
                      to not do so; you can change them at anytime. Maybe have 
                      one whole bank for your spells, or for opening your backpacks? 
                      How about an Emote and Roleplaying bank full of things like 
                      /say Thanks very much, I greatly appreciate it!, /em waves 
                      excitedly at you, /em looks sorrowfully at the corpse, or 
                      whatever else you might like. Design a control interface 
                      that best enables you to play, and have fun! But do put 
                      some thought into it, so you can play better, and earn the 
                      respect of those you adventure with. </font>

                      areas are a source of wonderful fun. As you wander around, 
                      or transit through, these areas, target the players around 
                      you and check their health. Heal those who are hurt. Respond 
                      to Disease and Poison calls with cures. Buff up people who 
                      seem to be having trouble. Stop and lend a hand with some 
                      heals and maybe a few arrows or sword swings if someone's 
                      being hard pressed to win a fight. Not only is it a lot 
                      of fun for both you and the newbie (I know I loved it when 
                      I was a wee little Paladin, to have a big character come 
                      by and drop a buff on me, or cast healing), but it's a great 
                      way to meet people and make friends. The newbie you save 
                      now might be the 30th level you group with later. And he'll 
                      tell his friends you're an ok guy. It all adds up. Think 
                      of it as EverQuest karma, of the good kind. </font>
