                    Starting your character as a halfling in Rivervale can be 
                    a very fruitful experience, not only for the starting areas, 
                    about which lie great hunting spots, for anyone up to about 
                    20th level. Halflings have a number of great attributes to 
                    start with and you will always be satisfied with what you 
                    come out of character creation with. I am going to divide 
                    this guide into two major sections: one for roleplaying the 
                    halfling and one for building the halfling's stats--I advise

                    I am sure many of you have read J.R.R Tolkien's works and 
                    yes, a lot of how hobbits are displayed pertains directly 
                    to EverQuest. Halflings are the homey types who would rather 
                    not bother with much but a cozy abode and some fine wines 
                    and fish patties inside the confines of Rivervale, but a great 
                    deal of halflings do set off to find adventure in new lands 
                    and take up professions which accommodate these travels. Now 
                    this section of the guide will give some information on how 
                    the halfling race is portrayed and display hints on how you 
                    can roleplay a halfling, which are consistent with the Norrathian 
                    halflings of Rivervale. Mind you that these merely represent 
                    my experience and views on halflings, and should not be taken 
                    as a bible of sorts or a 'how to roleplay the "correct" way 
                    guide'. </font>

                      Halfling society of Rivervale is quite humble, besides the 
                      growing goblin threat about. One of the biggest occasions 
                      for any halfling is the harvest, which the druids of the 
                      Vale prepare monthly with the help of the whole community... 
                      as well as Shakey Scarecrow, who, even in his old age, still 
                      seems as young as the day he was stuffed. It seems more 
                      and more are joining the fight against the numbers of goblins 
                      in the thickets and it seems as if the goblins' numbers 
                      are lessening more and more, but this is not true... with 
                      the Citadel of Runnyeye nearby and sightings of an orc priest 
                      and his knight and foot soldiers camping near an uninhabited 
                      section of the Thicket, I don't see the threat to Rivervale 
                      dying down anytime soon. </font>

                      large number of the peoples of Rivervale are the hardworking 
                      types; usually farmers, fishermen, merchants or craftsmen 
                      laboring daily to keep their economy and town strong. Many 
                      others besides halflings are helping to keep Rivervale a 
                      thriving social center as well: dwarves and gnomes are very 
                      common in the Vale and perform work associated with their 
                      cultures in order to help the "little" town of Rivervale. 
                      The halflings are the type of people who celebrate almost 
                      anything and have fun after a long days labor at the local 
                      tavern or market. These festivities grow even more frequent, 
                      especially with the constant defeat of Runnyeye goblin thugs 
                      and the new additions to the Wall Squad, whose deputies 
                      are growing rapidly on a daily basis. Rivervale is widely 
                      known for it's agricultural products, and, though they haven't 
                      a port for importing, you will still find a wide selection 
                      of goods from other cultures, including some of the Vale's 
                      goods that you can't find anywhere else. </font>

                    Most warriors in Rivervale are considered deputies and are 
                    expected to help rid the increasing goblin and orc threat 
                    that hampers the Misty Thicket and other local lands that 
                    surround Rivervale. Fierce to say the least, warriors let 
                    nothing stand in their way and are masters of all weaponry 
                    and armor. Adhering to the codes and laws of Rivervale very 
                    seriously, they take pride in being a halfling and a guardian 
                    to all those around them. Their guildmaster is Sheriff Roglio, 
                    a fine example of a warrior of the vale, and second in command 
                    next to Mayor Gubbin himself. Halfling warriors usually have 
                    very calm attitudes towards anything, even during battle, 
                    and are never quick to retreat when death is near... nor will 
                    they leave a companion to die. Halfling warriors are known 
                    to become great adventurers and heroes very quickly, and their 
                    fame compliments their abilities. Most warriors worship the 
                    Duke of Below. </font>

                      take pride in being pilferers and thieves and, within vale

                      as much as is in some other socieites... thieving is actually 
                      a quite honorable line of work in Rivervale. Halfling rogues 
                      are quick and unseen in their actions, are a welcome addition 
                      to any party and, like warriors, they gain status and skill 
                      very quickly. Most of the time these burglars can be found 
                      hanging around "The Fools Gold" tavern where drinking and 
                      gambling are commonplace.Almost always a welcome addition 
                      to any party, the halfling rogue is very dexterous and quick, 
                      not to mention small--which would hamper any enemy's concentration 
                      in a battle. </font>

                        way, but when in a tight spot or an intense battle they 
                        are quite cooperative and will usually be directly in 
                        the fray or sneaking around for the backstab. Also, halfling 
                        rogues take definite pride in being the trickster, much 
                        like the fairies of Faydark, and are usually devoted followers 
                        of Bristlebane. </font>

                        and giving, these halflings are at all times a great companion

                        the blows, but can also take them and heal them as well. 
                        Devoted only to Bristlebane, clerics are almost always 
                        of the witty type--which is the case with most I have

                          the upcoming harvests of the Vale, which in my eyes 
                          is a great thing. Druids are cryptic and mysterious 
                          people, never letting one know too much about them.

                    to get your halfling where you want in terms of skill,experience,money, 
                    and equipment at lower levels. Pay mind to the fact that getting 
                    high in level does indeed take lots of game time, but is worth 
                    every second of it. Also, getting higher in level can also 
                    be very expensive on your hip pouch... but as long as you

                      you first create your halfling, you will want to assign 
                      the proper hotkeys and get your equipment situated properly. 
                      Then you will want to head to either of the exits from Rivervale 
                      and stay near the entrances back to town for a while in 
                      order to do battle with weaker monsters and animals, at 
                      least until level two. After you've gained a level or two, 
                      you will have very little money, but, by level three, you 
                      should have enough to buy a fishing pole, which is almost 
                      essential to making money at earlier levels. Fishing equipment 
                      is cheap to obtain and maintain, you make a lot of cash, 
                      and you can do it anywhere where there is water (even ponds).

                        experience. When you first set out at level one, you will 
                        want to head for the Misty Thicket, commonly known as 
                        just "the Thicket" or "Misty". Within these thickets are 
                        a good deal of monsters that will suit any level up to 
                        about 15th. You will want to start on fire beetles, spiderlings 
                        and young goblin workers, because they hold the best possible 
                        experience at the lowest levels. Also, remember that, 
                        if you happen to get into trouble, you can always run 
                        to the guards that are stationed throughout the thickets... 
                        just to be safe try to stay by the entrance to Rivervale. 
                        Around level four you will want to head out past the gate 
                        and into the goblin lands of the Thicket and group with 
                        others in order to take on the three goblin camps and 
                        the orc camp. I warn you, however, to use your /con ability 
                        often, in order to tell whether or not you can handle 
                        your prospective opponents. In addition, for early experience, 
                        you will want to ask your guildmaster and others about 
                        jobs or quests to make extra money and good experience. 
                        At around 9th level you will want to start adventuring 
                        the world daily and finding other places of interest. 
                        I advise going through Runnyeye to the Beholder's Maze 
                        in order to take on minotaurs with a group. </font>

                    level nine or ten, you will have to decide for yourself where 
                    to go and what to slay, for I cannot name every creature and 
                    NPC throughout the land and nor would I. So, not to spoil 
                    the fun of learning by yourself, I will leave you with some 
                    tips on playing in general... just guidelines, really. </font> 
                    <ol>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Always 
                        carry food and water: if you starve it can be fatal to 
                        yourself and those around you. And don't always try to 
                        buy the cheapest kind, since it runs out a lot faster. 
                        Also, ask around for high level clerics or druids (around 
                        10th-14th levels) for food and drink--most are pretty 
                        nice and will surely accommodate your needs. </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Group 
                        whenever possible to ensure your safety by numbers, but 
                        keep the grouping within reason. </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                        low levels sell as much as you can to get boxes and backpacks 
                        and other assorted pouches and such--they are invaluable 
                        to your bartering due to the large inventory in which 
                        you will have to place animal hides and such. </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
                        grouping try to have a healer type and a caster of magicks, 
                        and, if possible, add along a rogue and a warrior type. 
                        A balanced group is the key to success within EverQuest. 
                        </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Talk 
                        to many NPCs and PCs about current quests. With NPCs try 
                        everything... everyone knows something. Quests are something 
                        that you should not set aside--they are one of the greatest 
                        features of the game! </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barter 
                        and trade as much as you can; cut deals and negotiate, 
                        and, if possible, become a part time merchant--it is a 
                        great way to make money. There is always someone who needs 
                        something you have, or vice versa. </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use 
                        the /con command all of the time (of course) and never 
                        take on anything that appears to be a risk or gamble without 
                        the help of others. </font>
                      <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be 
                        nice and play fair--etiquette in EverQuest is much obliged 
                        by others. When someone's in a fight, DO NOT help them 
                        unless they request you to do so, and always ask before 
                        healing them and helping with their opponent. Try to be 
                        nice to others--unless of course you are roleplaying a 
                        racist or evil character--and help them as much as possible. 
                        The action will probably be returned and possibly to your 
                        advantage some day. Lastly, if you are in a spot where 
                        someone else is waiting around for the same monster (camping), 
                        share with them by alternating kills. </font>
