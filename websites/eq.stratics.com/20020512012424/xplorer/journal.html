<p><a name=15><b>Journal Entry - 990526 - 4:52pm</b></a>

<p>Heya,

<p>Been some time since I last wrote something here. School is almost over (just 2 more weeks [ending 12th June]) and I got exams up to my ears. I've been playing a little now and then (hard thing now is finding time for it) and I've actually hit level 10! But it's not much to talk about really. I'm currently zone mongering like crazy in the Thicket, killing anything coning blue. I've been grouped up from time to time, I've experienced some really nice grouping. Especially the time when I played with Kasai, a half elven bard, Maven, a rogue dark elf and Thabor, a human monk. We didn't get to play much, but we sure were efficient, being a mixed party. I've also experienced some bad too, I bumped into some KeWlD0oDz by mistake, left early though :).

<p>I've also encountered a really nasty mob residing in the Thicket, called a dread corpse :). It took me by surprice will I was meding near the rune hill, and I found myself "stun-running" toward the guards :).

<p>I don't really have much more to add though. It's still the same in the Thicket. I've moved on from killing gobs to kodiaks and wasps. I'm desperately trying to reach lvl 14, and at the same time filling out the 3rd rank spells (6 to go I think). Until then I won't be doing much updates to the journal, sad as it might be for some of you (at least I hope it will :P). I guess I could write about me killing mob after mob, but what fun would that be? I've already experienced everything there is to experience in the Thicket, and it will stay that way until I get Spirit of the wolf and Bind affinity :(. Then I'll stop worrying about leveling, and start to play EQ like I intended to play it, exploring the lands of Norrath.

<p>Even though I won't update the journal much (depending on how much time I have and how interesting it has been), I'll still add a screenshot now and then. The stories will HOPEFULLY be up before June.

<p>Until then, keep safe.

<p>P.S I'm still having terrible trouble with roleplaying. I guess it'll come more naturally outside the "zones"?

<p><a name=14><b>Journal Entry - 990514 - 2:36pm</b></a>

<p>I guess I got time for another entry, here it goes:

<p>Logged in again yesterday. I thought I should seize the opportunity and hit level 9 when everyone else were out watching Star Wars :). So I went back to the thicket, this time trying out some things on my own. I thought if I stayed with blues through out the whole night (a period of 2.5 hours :) I was destined to hit level 9, at least I hoped so. There were only about 8 players in the thicket, so I sort of had all the mobs for myself. There weren't many blue creatures around though (only green and yellow/red ones) so I had a very hard time finding something to kill. Plus the fact that our oh so goodie friends Deputy Asler and Keld were out running around in the MIDDLE of the zone, cleaning out everything in their path which made it even harder (there's nothing worse than finally finding one of those blue bats and see them go down before your feet by a white and black clad lil fella :) I did find some though who were left alone by the deputies and changed between fighting shadow wolves, tree snakes, goblins, spiders, giant wasps, black bears and giant/large bats.

<p>Even though tree snakes con blue I find them a real gamble :). If they hit you with a poison early in the fight you are close to start running when the combat comes to an end (I always start running at two bubbles, kept me alive at all times but three). The same with spiders. They can score some really nasty hits and with a poison and a numbers of fizzles from your side can be very very lethal. Btw, you should have seen me when I decided to take on a spider on my own. I started to burn it with lightnings and when it was down to about 10% of it's life (whereas I had about 3 bubs of life and 1 bub of mana) Deputy Asler came and thought "Time to die a giant spider" and that was the end of it. It's so damn aggravating when you've just finished meditating, found a prey, used up all the mana, and then when everything looks dandy those little black things come running in :P.

<p>Later that evening I safetly fought blue spiders and I thought it was time to try out my first wasp. I started to burn (using burst of fire), but just like the spiders, it didn't take enough damage. So I switched to lightning and depleted the whole mana bar on the wasp. Although I scored 22-24dmg hits with the lightning it wasn't enough. So I was forced with a 30 seconds of meleeing before it finally went down. Now I don't like that at all. First, my meleeing skills suck, they're nothing compared to my burning capabilities (I need a Fine Steel Scimitar, this rusty one sucks :). Secondly, unlike spiders, wasps are social creatures and if there's another one coming you'll die pretty fast as a giant wasp is nothing you'll run away from. The good side about wasps though is that they give good experience and excellent loot. A wasp can have multiple parts on them and both eyes and legs sell for over 1gp each (yet to try the wings). It'll probably be my main income during my painful period of filling out the 3rd rank of spells (yeah, I want them all - even Invis to animals).

<p>Oh btw, almost forgot... I had my first encounter yesterday with a very nasty mob - a lesser mummy. It happened when I went up the rune hill (as I call it) and found some skeletons to pick on. While I was fighting one I saw from a distance that there was a player, human looking, sitting down at the rune resting. When I had finished the fight with the skeleton I targeted the person and hit the H button. "Hail a lesser mummy", what the...? He wasn't really pleased with my show of etiquette and I wasn't likely to stay around explaining myself :). So with my back turned on him I ran straight toward the guards and sat down and rested.

<p>At this time I was low on water, and my foraging skill had only given me fishing grubb. I knew at this point that fishing grubb weren't edible so everytime I caught one I destroyed it (you should have seen me when I thought they were edible and had about 20 of them in my backpack :). Although the zone was short on players, it wasn't short on helpful ones. A friendly half elven female, named Maksatpa, gave me some water and we enjoyed a somewhat small roleplaying experience.

<p>Now let me halt my story here for a while and talk about roleplaying in Everquest.

<p>Roleplaying in Everquest is tough, even tougher than I thought, and it's all thanks to the game setup. In UO, roleplaying was very easy, at least for me. Without the /tell and all those commands roleplaying came natural (though it was tough roleplaying at the banks at some times, but no, I never used the phrase "Vendor buy bank guards" :). I'm a big fan of Elizabethanian English (thou's and thee's) and the "ye speakin' " dialect as I call it. I tried develop my ability to speak both of these "languages" during last summer, using a semi-graphical mud called Illusia. It didn't share Everquest's 3D engine, but what it did share was the text area, totally isolated from the rest of the game, if you know what I mean. I tried to stay in character, but it was futile as most of the others kept speaking like they where in an IRC channel, chatting about their equipment, levels and experience. It becomes so awkward and it feels just like we're all sitting there in one big happy family, chatting in the evenings, leveling in the mornings.

<p>At the end of the summer I started to play UO and just over three months I had developed my thou's and thee's to a level where I felt good about it. Now, before some guys get the wrong idea about me I do not think that roleplaying is ONLY using thou's and thee's. What I mean is that the atmosphere that comes with using these "languages" really help you roleplay. Anyway, I had a blast roleplaying both a Necromancer and a Scoundrel, using Elizabethanian for the Necro (not an evil one. He originated from Tenebrae (Ultima VIII: Pagan)... long story :) and the "ye speakin' " for my Scoundrel.

<p>Now, in Everquest I think I've used "aye" twice and a ye by reflex ;). What it all boils down to for me is that there's a /tell-, a /gsay- and an /ooc command. It's so close to IRC that it's frightening. It was the same with Illusia, using /telepath and whatever. People are constantly /shouting and /oocing about whether it's okay to kill that or that person. And with the /tell command you'll be changing from roleplaying in normal talk to ordinary chat. Now, why can't I use roleplaying speech in both normal talk and in /tells? Because, all people don't like people roleplaying to an extent (or at all). Furthermore, Everquest is mostly combat oriented, period. I haven't seen any players roleplaying when in a group fight, nor while they are meditating or resting. People are even playing this game just to be the highest level of their server, how's that for roleplaying? But hey, I might be totally wrong. Those people leveling may be the most serious people on their server, roleplaying all the time. I did actually come across some high level characters in Rivervale who were roleplaying using their whole Elizabethanian vocabulary. It was nice to actually find some hardcore roleplayers, but for me it felt like they were the ones who had come to the wrong place, and not all the other non-roleplaying players inhabitating Norrath.

<p>Personally, I adapt to the situation. If I find roleplayers, I start roleplaying. If they are chatting normally, then that's what I will do too. Sure, I find roleplaying so much better, but we must remember that people have come to Everquest to play for a million and one reasons Not just for the roleplay, sad as it might be.

<p>A disclaimer though. I am not really entitled to make this kind of rant in my early intermediate period of Everquest life, powergaming to get to level 14 as I am (that way I'll get Bind Affinity and Spirit of The Wolf which will help me explore. Can't do it now, what if I die? Don't got the money to go running for my corpse on the other side of the continent). I'll elaborate more on this though, and I'll keep myself in roleplay mode during my next play. If it goes well, I'll convert myself to a full blooded Everquest roleplayer, just like in "good old" UO :).

<p>Anyway, back to the story. I went on with my killing, now only 1 bubble away from level 9. Soon I made another rare encounter; a white goblin. No, it wasn't a snow goblin. It was a goblin conning white :). He stunned me pretty hard and I was dropping fast in life. I ran back towards the guards and they took care of him. Soma (Veon/Caranthir, you know :) informed me later that it was probably one of those goblins holding one of those spike hooks or what they are called. Anyway, after 30 seconds of meditating (god, I really do love meditating, almost no downtime at all) I went back and attacked yet another goblin. This was blue to me, but my hps went down pretty fast anyway. Luckily, a Barbarian named Kadori was nice enough to support me with heals and I was able to knock it down.

<p>Woah, I could almost feel level 9! But wait... what's this? "You are encumbered"... d'oh! :). I gated back to Rivervale, gave my beads to the sheriff, sold off my loot and went back. It only took a tree snake and two goblins before I heard that wonderful sound:

<p><font color=yellow>DRONG!!!</font>

<p>Welcome to level 9! Yay! What a milestone! I have now crawled out of my newbie skin and entered the grand era of intermediate... something :). After a total playing time of 1 day, 19 hours and 12 minutes I have finally reached the goal I set out several weeks ago. Now I have "only" five more levels to go before I will actually start playing Everquest the way I wanted to; exploring and having fun.

<p>Once again I gated back. I withdraw my 11pp I had made so far and spent half of it for Ignite and Light Healing. Before I could inscribe them though I had to know whether the Winged Courier spell existed or not. After a couple of /tells to some high level Shamans (rumours went that it was indeed available in the Halas Shaman guild) it turned out that it did not exist and that it had been taken out during beta. With this I didn't save up a slot for it and inscribed Ignite and Light Healing. Didn't have the time to try them out though, as it was about midnight.

<p>Ouch, my fingers hurt. Been my first journal entry with an attached rant, if you can call it that. I'll log in tomorrow (Saturday) and try the spells out. I have about 4-5pp left, but I need to save them for a Fine Steel Scimitar. If Ignite is as good as it is said to be I'll probably be fighting wasps during the whole evening (I am really starting to get tired of powergaming). Not just because they'll go down without much trouble, but they'll also host good loot. I also need to fill out my bug collection, only three items missing being: wasp wings, giant beetle legs and a ventral sac from a scarab. I think I can get the wasp wings by myself, but I better go grouping for the other parts.

<p>Hail again. I've actually played some EQ during the week (school holiday).

<p>I had some free time and decided to play a little EQ last Wednesday. I connected and was ready to go. Turned out I had some patching problems though. I tried twice, but my computer didn't want to connect to the server. I'd experienced this a lot in UO thanks to the gawdawful spacefiller virus and I feared that EQ would respond similar to an infected computer. So I logged off and rebooted with my sfscan program. Turned out my hard drive was clean. I went back to windows and connected again. It took some time, but finally the patching kicked in. Ugh, turned out that I had to download a file.

<p>After a total of 30 minutes I was finally greeted by the splash screen(s) and I logged in properly. Upon entering Rivervale I went straigth to the thicket. I made a /who command and found out that there were very few people actually playing. Baffled by this I sent a message to Nexxis and she told me it was because all the americans were queing up Star Wars :). Great, another evening with the whole zone for myself. I killed some gobs on my own, but I found killing kodiaks in a group more exciting. So I went back to the wall gate and announced about forming a party. Soon a halfling, named Adrack, joined up and right after, a Human, named Donadiel joined forces as well. Adrack was a level 7 druid and Donadiel an 8th level one. We decided on going for big prey, kodiaks and spiders, while leaving gobs and others alone.

<p>While walking within the middle parts of the zone we bumped into a kodiak. It conned red, but we thought we could take it on anyway. We started to burn, running into melee. We might have had the favor upon us in the beginning of the battle, but with the hard hits of the kodiak, it soon turned to the kodiak's side. I went down to two bubbles and switched place with Adrack. He couldn't cope with the bear either, and he went down fast before my eyes. The situation was pretty panicked and I was cursing, wondering where the heck Donadiel's heals where. Soon I too joined up with Adrack in the netherworld and my computer began loading...

<p>Coming back to the world with nothing but my newbie skin I asked Donadiel if he'd come out ok and where he'd been. Running back to the corpse I received the reply that he'd been burning from a distance and that he'd run towards the guards and made it out alright after I'd died. I dunno if there had been a misunderstanding or something, as we said before the fight that he'd be the healer. I guess he could read the situation better than me, I being in all the chaos, and that he'd decided to burn for a fast kill. I don't blame him at all though, it just hurts loosing almost a bubble of experience because of a misunderstanding or bad group tactics.

<p>After Adrack and I had re-equipped ourselves we sat down and discussed some tactics. First and foremostly, Donadiel was to be the tank, as he haid more combat experience and hit points. Adrack, with the lowest amount of hit points became the prime healer. I, myself, became something of a support person, burning and meleeing, depending on the situation. I didn't know how this would work, if at all. Some people don't like rules and other people ordering others around. It turned out good though. We decided on staying clear of red kodiaks and soon we found a yellow which we tried. With Donadiel's strong body as a tank we made it out ok with this kodiak, and I was slowly working my way back to those two bubbles of experience. Donadiel was much better suited as a casting tank and Adrack also enjoyed himself, as all the heals increased his alteration ability.

<p>Next up we took on a spider (staying away from the yellow ones) and we came out victorious with just some of us being poisoned (which we cured in an instant). After that the zone became somewhat empty, and we had a hard time finding stuff. We agreed on camping up at the hill, left from the wall gate, and have someone fetching for us. Donadiel, having the highest knowledge of the area, became the fetcher. Things were awfully slow for a while, but soon there was a respawn and Donadiel came back with both kodiaks, wasps and spiders.

<p>I had never fought a wasp before, and I was curious if we could take it on. Turned out it was almost too easy, but it did score some nasty hits of 20 dmg. After a couple of mobs, with a spider being the last, Donadiel struck 9th level. He went back to Rivervale to purchase some new spells while I and Adrack rested on top of the hill. Of course there had to be a huge spawn of yellow kodiaks and white/yellow wasps while Donadiel was in town :). Speaking of wasps, Donadiel messaged back that the eyes and legs of a wasp sold for over 1gp, good loot I'd say!

<p>While Donadiel was purchasing his spells I and Adrack decided to kill some blue things, just to get the time going. We killed a gob or two, and a black bear. Then Donadiel came back with his new spells and we set out on the goal to have Adrack reaching level 8.

<p>We killed some bears, wasps and whatever (my memory is kind of blurry dealing with this period of time) and soon Adrack too raised a level. Shortly after he had to leave and Donadiel and I went alone, now killing giant wasps with little risk. The evening came crawling up on me and I too had to call it a night. At this time I had replaced my lost bubble of exp and added it up with another half. Might not have been my most efficient play session, but I did enjoy myself a great deal with our organized tactics (sure, we did hit a spider and a kodiak at the same time one and then there was that red kodiak, but that's ancient history now :). I gated back to Rivervale, sold off my beads to the sheriff and called it a night.

<p>Woah, I have to tell you, there's nothing better than an organized group of players, each of them knowing what to do and when to do it. At the end I had great confident in both Adrack and Donadiel, I just hope they felt the same about me :).

<p><a name=12><b>Journal Entry - 990510 - 4:28pm</b></a>

<p>Sorry for the late update. I've been playing EQ most of my spare time. So, in other words... this will be a long entry, brace yourselves :)

<p>Ok, when I logged in on Saturday I imediately checked for teleporters. There was one wizard who were capable of teleporting me, but he was busy in Najena (and would remain being so for the rest of the night :). So after about 15 minutes of /who commands and whatever I finally decided to go to Crushbone. I might as well do something while I'm waiting. My memory is kind of blurry of what really happened in Crushbone, but all I can tell you is that I killed a couple of orcs outside. After some time I met up with a Half-Elf named Kideten and we went grouping a while in the outskirts of CB. We had a great time and I could see my exp meter moving, barely. At one time we hit a nasty bunch of orcs and Kideten hit the dust. I went back to meet him in Kelethin. We retrieved his corpse and I sold him my spare set of patchwork (tunic and pants), as he only had cloth armor (how did he get to lvl 7 with just cloth? :). Kideten had to leave at this time and I joined up with a wood elf warrior named Drizzner.

<p>Drizzner took me straight into the heart of CB, well at least it felt like it :). We came to an area filled with boxes and *poof*, he ran away in some direction. Not really being familiar with this place, and the fact that there had been a recent spawn, I decided to hide behind some of those boxes. Soon I could see Drizzner's life going down on my group meter and he reported "damn legion.." something :). Moments later he died. When he got back to life he told me he would try some other place... mino something. Without my warrior friend I decided to gate back to Kelethin. After all, I actually had some loot at this time.

<p>Back in Kelethin (still no teleporters) I announced that I was looking for a party to group with (now being just one small bubble away from level 8). Soon a person named Lendar replied and asked if I had just been grouping with Kideten. It turned out that this was Kideten's brother :). We killed a couple of orcs outside (I think) and after a while we decided to check out the inside of Crushbone. Lendar took me to the right this time, through that small path leading to the legionnare area. I asked him if we could actually fight these guys and if we were really safe where we were (with all the damn trains and all). He told me it was fine, but just soon after he told me to run! Figures :). We had gotten a legionnare and his buddies on our backs and we were running back to safety. I ran all the way back to zone border where I got the reply that Lendar had an orc fighting him just outside of the entrance cave. I went back and we finished it off without much trouble. After that we decided to try out the legionnare area once more, this time being more alert. We found one and jumped into combat. We got a lot of hits on us, but after some nice teamwork we killed it, and I went level 8!!!!

<p>Woohoo, meditation - finally! After all these gawdawful hours of pain I've finally reached the level where Atherion will become something more of a wizard. I told Lendar that I had to gate back to Kelethin to train it up one point and that I would be back in about 2 hours (had to log off). Before I logged off I went back the druids guild and on my way I found an old friend of importance - Chalise. She were the person who taught me how to fight during my first hour of EQ'ing. I've had contact with her throughout my whole progress, but this was the first time in weeks that I met up with her personally. We talked for a while and then I remembered I had to log out. I waved good bye to Chalise and told her I'd see her soon. And I did, as I came running back, asking her to show the way to the druid's guild :). Finally there I trained a point, thanked Chalise and logged out.

<p>Three hours and one movie later I logged in again, hoping to find a teleporter. After some /who's I did. Aiin was his name and he agreed on taking me to the West Commonlands, and from there escorting me to Rivervale. All I now had to do was to get to Aiin, who was waiting for me in Butcherblock. Luckily for me, a nice High Elven cousin, named Yishujia, offered to help me out. He showed me the way through all the winding paths. After a while we reached the obelisks and that's when I lost him. I was just trying to spell his name right for a tell when I was prompted to the gawdawful sign: "The server is not responding".

<p>Drat's, the EQ player said, spilling out some coke on his keyboard in frustration. The thunder laid heavily on the landscape and the apocalypse was inevitable. The birds stopped their singing and awaited their doom.. ok ok... let's not get melodramatical here, back to the story :). Tarrew wasn't down, all I had to do was to log in again and soon I was in the woods again, with Yishujia waiting for me. We resumed our running and soon we came to the Butcherblock zone border. I thanked him and went through.

<p>Woah, Butcherblock is nice during midday, and I was able to get off a really nice screenshot of Aiin Wildfire, who was waiting for me. Before we started teleporting I told him that the last time I did that my computer froze up. So if anything was to happen I had to be sure that he would wait for me :). The computer started loading normally and this time I wasn't dropped out. Instead I found myself in the West Commonlands, near the ruins. Aiin threw a Spirit Of The Wolf on me and woah, was that cool or not? I really want to get level 14 now :). We ran through the whole zone in what felt like mach speed (although I've never experienced mach speed in real life I have played one or two flight sims during my lifetime :). I wasn't even scared of the hill giant who stood tall at about 200 feet away. After some running (didn't take long, really) we hit the Kithicor zone border. Next up we came to a very very pleasant sight - the Rivervale cave entrance.

<p>Woah, I've never ever complain about the polka sounding Rivervale music :). Aiin threw me a bound affinity and I thanked him with all my heart. The SOW (Spirit Of The Wolf) was still on me and I decided to check out the Thicket, a place well known.

<p>Oh man, why the hell did I leave this place for this place? Oh I remember... something with quests and newbie areas... hmm.. let's forget about that :). I still knew my way around in the Thicket (unlike some other areas beginning with a Greater and ending with a Faydark :). Soon I met up with an old friend...

<p>Take that you filthy goblin! Damn, I've missed you :). Fighting gobs was actually a LOT easier than fighting orcs, still I get the same exp. With meditation I am now able to keep burning through out a whole fight, woah is that efficient or what? Unfortunately though I had to log out at this time. It was getting very dark outside and when I checked my watch it said 1am, oh well :)

<p>Logged back in the next day (Sunday) and went straight to the Thicket. This was at about 3-4pm my time, and I could sure tell that most americans was either sleeping or working, as I had practically the whole intermediate area of the thicket for myself. The sow was still on me and it sure came in handy when I went to a camp... threw a burn, and got three angry gobs on my back. I went back to the guards all the time and soon I had cleared all the camps :). I went back to the one at the Runnyeye entrance and waited for spawns. I did great with my meditation and I wasn't really experiencing much downtime. While I was meditating though an Orc Centurion and his friend - a goblin warrior - started to crush me (actually scored some good hits on me). I was stunned and I panickly made it for the wall gate. I had lost 3 bubbles of life (should have staid and defend myself instead of running like a coward). The guards saved my back though and I sat down and rested. Suddenly Teron, now playing his High-Elven Cleric Derin, contacted me. We agreed on grouping up and now, with meditation, I really noticed that I had boosted a lot when it comes to combat efficiency. We easily killed gob after gob, and I actually found a small wooden shield to replace my old buckler (turned out I found 3 shields through out the time I played). Oh btw, finally found Budo, and I'm now on a mission to kill lots of goblins :).

<p>Anyway, we'd been grouping for quite some time when Derin told me he had to go - dinner time. The timing couldn't have been better, as I was loaded with Runneye beads, swords, bucklers and whatever. I gated back to Rivervale and when I was talking to the Sheriff upstairs I got a tell from Veon. I thought he would have been level 15 by now, but he was still fighting on - as a level 9 Rogue. I sold off my loot and went back to the thicket, where Veon was waiting for me. We grouped up and decided to go for big prey - kodiaks and spiders. I was very suspicious if we could take on a kodiak, but we gave it a try. Veon being the tank, dropped fast in health. Now being experienced that minor healing during fights often ends up with both of the party members going down I decided to continue burning. Thankfully, (depends on how you see it :) the kodiak got mad at me for burning him to a crisp, and he started to beat on me. But his powerful blows were futile, as he went down after another burn or two.

<p>Woohoo, we actually killed a kodiak :). But it was a close one. Veon was down to 2 bubbles, and was close to 3, while my mana was all depleted. We sat down a while and decided to take on a spider. After our resting we spotted one, and strangely as it might seem, it was blue to me. We started to bash and I had to interrupt my burning once in a while to throw a cure on Veon. Still we did okay and it soon went down before our feet. Feeling somewhat invurnerable at the time, we decided to take on another kodiak. Same procedure here, and it worked. Sure, our hps went down like flies in a snow blizzard, but at least we could see the change on our exp meters.

<p>After a couple of spiders we were asked by Elron, a Paladin (lvl 8), if he could join our forces. We invited him, because with Elron by our side we could take on Scarabs. I had to leave soon and I was very anxious of trying a Scarab before I left.

<p>Thankfully we found one right down the slope and before I knew it we were all in fierce combat with the Scarab. It started to beat on Veon while I was getting his frenzy up with all my burns. After half of the combat the Scarab started to concentrate on me. I just kept burning, and with Veon's and Elron's powerful blows we were able to finish it off. I didn't have much time to cheer over our victory as I was going on extra time. I waved farewell and disbanded, making my way towards Rivervale. After half the walk toward Rivervale I remembered I had Gate memorized, d'oh!

<p>So... what's to say about the return to the Thicket? Amazing! Plain 'n simple. I know my way around and the trip to the merchant back and forth is nothing compared to the Faydark, where you have to run all the way back to Kelethin to sell of some stuff. I've already made 2 bubbles of experience, and I am certain that I will hit level 9 next week. Oh btw, I now have about 8pp in the bank. 8pp! phew :). That means I can go and purchase that Fine Steel Scimitar I've been keeping my eyes on. But I can't - Light Healing and Ignite are top priorities.

<p>Also, received a mail from Lamron (Gram!!! :), who gave me some valuable information about some of the areas in Norrath. He even offered me a guided tour of the west parts of Antonica. But I'll have to decline the offer until later. I'll start my exploration between level 9-14. I also have to go to Halas, to purchase the legendary Winged Courier spell. But first I'll experience some goody goody leveling in the Thicket.

<p>Argh! I've just decided, I totally hate the Faydark and Crushbone :). I'll fill you in (note: My English sucks at the moment :)

<p>I logged in and found Terron waiting for me. We headed straight for Crushbone. He'd just hit level 9 and I was really anxious about getting level 8 tonight, just being a bubble away. When we got to the zone wall we saw a lot of people sitting down. We figured there was a train right inside and sure there was, all the people zoning out with low hps. After we'd waited a while I threw a camouflage on both me and Terron and we headed in.

<p>There were a lot of corpses around, but just a few orc centurions. We ran towards the bridge at the left and up the "hill pass" toward the slaver hut. We encountered a couple o' centurions which we easily dispatched with just minor injuries. The Orc slaver we found turned out to be a bit tougher, but with a lot of burns and slashes we took him down as well. Now I gained a lot of experience, but was it showing on the meter? no :(. I didn't get much loot either, and just a couple of gold pieces in money.

<p>Anyway, when we'd dispatched the slaver there was a train coming. I threw a camouflage on both Terron and me. Being somewhat safe we witnessed the whole massacre of people :). The train died out soon though and we headed back to the slaver's hut. Terron had attracted himself a couple of centurions, and with just three bubbles of life left I was forced to draw all my mana into burns for some quick deaths. Thing is that my healing spell can't keep up with two centurions beating my little friend to pieces. We succeded and Terron was down to two bubbles. Feeling a need of rest coming we sat down at the nearby slope and regenerated.

<p>Things were slow but we did saw a couple of trains coming along :). At that time Terron had to leave and I was all alone again. Deciding Crushbone wasn't a place for me, being level 7 and all alone (only 12-18 level players in CB), I threw another camouflage on me and zoned out of Crushbone. Outside wasn't much unlike inside Crushbone. I ran straight into a train of yellow centurions and I was forced to make a run for the zone border again. When I appeared there the train was thankfully gone and I could sit down and lick my wounds. Before heading outside again I refreshed my camouflage and faded away. When I then finally got to the other side it was empty, figures :). I decided to check out the nearby camps and came across a yellow centurion who enjoyed stunning me a couple of times. Being somewhat scared of dying I ran as fast as I could towards the zone border again.

<p>[Insert LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... here]

<p>When I got to the other side I was facing yet another train of orcs, d'oh! I had no choice but to run back to the outside.

<p>[Insert another one of those thingies here]

<p>Phew... I was down to one bubble and someone had thankfully dispatched the remaining orcs of the outside. I sat down and regenerated. At that time I had talked with a fellow wood elf named Otharion about going grouping. We met up at the CB entrance and agreed on going hunting at the camps. After a lot of running we finally found a couple of orcs and we were able to dispatch them, but it costed me 3 bubbles of life. I was just about to start healing when there were yet another yellow centurion stunning me (god, are they annoying?). I just turned my back at him and ran away as good as I could. Otharion was able to kick in a heal for me in a distance but I was soon dropping, and dropping fast. I dunno how many orcs were after me, but I think it was somewhere between 1-3 of 'em. I had run around quite some time, been stunned while turning around (and thus, spinning around uncontrolably) and I was totally lost. Then I was down to a 1/10 of a bubble and I was knocked unconsious three times :). I hit the loc button and awaited the end. Before dying I checked my group meter and saw that Otharion had also been slain, there must have been more than 1 then.

<p>Ugh... 2nd time ever now, and I really hate dying. And don't even talk about retreiving your corpse. Sure, I had the loc command, but do I know what to do with it? Heck no :). Luckily, Otharion knew how to retreive a corpse and he guided me towards mine. I thanked him and told him I was fed up with the Faydark for now.

<p>That's right. After I had retreived all my equipment I checked if there were any wizards or druids online, capable to throw a teleportation or two. I'd seen Kalo on earlier this evening, but he wasn't online now, ack! I checked with another person, a level 29 wizard named Cellerto. He couldn't take me to Rivervale, but he could take me to North Karana. I was told that it would be pretty hard getting to Rivervale from there, as I either had to pass Highpass or Beholder's to get there. Not really wanting to risk that (without being bound either) I asked him if he could take me somewhere else. He told me he could take me Toxxulia forest, the newbie lands of the Erudines. That wasn't really what I had in mind, but I had heared that Erudin was a nice town. I could always check it out, and there would surely be a wizard there at some time who could escort me to Rivervale later. I was all set for Toxxulia when Cellerto told me that he had to leave, ack! But I was promised a trip later if he had the time. I thanked him for his kindness and thought about logging out for now.

<p>I have, with the hopes that Kalo or someone else will come on later this evening (being 10:59pm now). I really want to go back to Rivervale, with the gobs and the non-confusing zone called the Thicket. I now know that my biggest mistake ever was to leave Rivervale for Kelethin. The quests at Kelethin are like for newbies or pros only, and I don't feel like hunting decaying skels for swords or something. Nor is Kelethin as easy as I thought it would be after a while. There is not one time where I run to the bank and back without getting lost at least one time. And with Faydark being a large zone (thus freezing up my computer once in a while) makes it lethal to navigate on those platforms. 

<p>Oh well, I guess I don't have the time to get teleported right now, I'll try it tomorrow. Pray for me :)

<p><a name=10><b>Journal Entry - 990505 - 12:19pm</b></a>

<p>Actually had some time to play yesterday, during one of my painless periods of backstraining :).

<p>I logged in and I found Teron on ICQ. He asked me if I was to play and we agreed on meeting up at the main lift of Kelethin in about 5 minutes. I told him I was logging in and I started EQ. Eehh... sorry, we've got a patch coming for you, this will only take a minute or two. I thought it would be done pretty fast, turned out "pretty fast" was half an hour. Anyway, finally in the game and I was standing there at the priest of discord lift. Terron came and picked me up. We took a direct left turn and went straight through the whole zone. Eventually we ended up at the gates of Crushbone, and what a sight it was! We had stumbled across a train in action. Now for you who don't know, a train is when there's a mass of mobs running in a straight line, killing everyone in sight. There were at least 15 people there, and about 5-10 orcs. I didn't realize that the orcs originated from the outside camps, so I asked Terron if there actually was a zone border in the cave, as I thought all the orcs came from Crushbone itself. He told me there was and that we were going in.

<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

<p>During the last seconds of the loading the sound usually kicks in. It did and I could hear a lot of bashing and grunting. I was in command of Atherion again and I blindly followed Terron to the left side of the area. This is where the easy orcs spawned and I we killed a couple of orc centurions. I sat down and rested a bit while Terron was running all over the zone attracting orcs for experience. We joined up again and I told him to stick with me, as I didn't want to be left alone on my first visit here. He understood and we went to one of the huts and opened the door, in hopes of finding an orc slaver. We did, and it turned out blue for us. Now I've heard that slavers are tough mobs, but this one we could take down with just a couple of burns.

<p>Next up I find myself running after Terron into the rooms under the center hill. There were some people there and we saw a slaver. It began attacking me and I thought we could take it out. Turned out I was wrong. After two "An Orc Slaver hits YOU for 17dmg" and a "run!" from Terron I quickly did the jump/run procedure and litterarely flew to safety to the bridge at the easy spawning point (turned out he was red when I considered him :). I noticed that Terron was still trying to kick his ass, stubborn dwarves... I told him to high-heel over to me and I would be ready to start healing. When he arrived he was down to 2 bubbles and my healing could barely stand against the brute force of the orc. The orc was down to about 1/4 of his life and everything was looking ok. Then there came a spawn of one of those easy orcs, but that became too much for Terron and I saw him drop in about 2 swings. I stopped healing and I had only one thing in my mind: ZONE! It felt like I was playing XCOM and all my soldiers had become panicked :). I saw that I was pretty much alone in Crushbone and when I got to the zoning area I was welcomed by about 3 Orc Oracles :). I just plunged right through them and all I could see was the "Filthy Wood Elves like you are better left dead than alive!" spamming my screen as I zoned.

<p>Phew... was I lucky? I came back on the other side where things were cool and I could sit down and rest. I had been dropped to 2 bubbles during my zone (do they keep pumping on you while you are zoning?), but I was alive, Terron wasn't. He came back, retrieved his corpse and messaged me that it was ok to zone back into the heat. I took his advice, threw a shield spell on me and off I went. When the load was over I saw Terron standing at one of the walls. There were three orcs bashing on the people and soon about 8 or more orcs came and joined in, one being a very big nasty fella'. I froze and I didn't know what to do. I saw Terron fighting one and I thought that if he was joining in, we might win this thing. I ran around trying to find a good place to attack, while not being attacked myself. I came toward Terron, just to see him drop like a fly. I knew this was it and I was both stunned (I hate when you get stunned when you are pressing the left or right button... stop spinning around!!! :) and took multiple hits. I tried hard reaching the zone border. I saw my life going down to one bubble and soon I saw the "Loading, please wait".

<p>At first I thought I had made it. Because if I would have died I probably would have been greeted by a "You Are Dead" sign or whatever, but now it was just loading. Shocked was I when I saw myself standing at the priest of discord lift, wearing nothing but newbie clothes. I become panicked... all my stuff! Now Caranthir's corpse had disappeared at one time and all his hard earned stuff went boom boom (that's what made him unplayable, he didn't get no reimbursal either),  and I did not want to find myself in a similar state. I ran back to the Crushbone entrance and I saw a lot of people sitting there, also waiting for the orcs to disappear. I sat down and thought I could rearrange my spell list a bit. To my horror, all my memorized spells were gone. It's probably logical that you loose them in your mind when you die, but here am I... looking at a red meter dropping down while I memorize, with the money flying out of my window for no better reasons. It wasn't that bad though, as I couldn't do anything at the time anyway.

<p>When I was all done with the memorizing I saw myself alone on this side of the Crushbone entrance. I thought it was ok so I prepared myself for the task that was ahead, operation "Getting-all-my-hard-earned-stuff-back-without-dying-again". I threw a shield spell on me and I was ready to go. I quickly hesitated and remembered to throw a camouflage on me as well. I faded out and I went loading...

<p>I saw three people and an orc fighting it off. I quickly located my corpse, took a screenshot (afterall, this was a historical event, being the first time I had died) and went for the loot interface. Argh!! Dang it's slow... I fumbled around with the mouse pointer and I managed to equip myself. I saw in the upper right window (the one showing your character, also working as a rear mirror) that there were orcs coming this way, and hordes of 'em!! I fumbled with my last containers and one accidently fell to the ground. I was just about to zone when I noticed the "The item falls to the ground" message. I quickly dove back, picked up the bag and made it for the zone border. I can't explain enough how much the adrenaline was rushing through my system :).

<p>I made a safety check and saw that I had really retrieved everything. Terron had to log out and told me he'd retrieve his corpse tomorrow. Without having a guide in there, I decided to stay out of Crushbone during the remainder of the evening. Instead I went picking on the orcs within the surrounding camps. There were others who used that strategy as well. And even if we all joined in at the same time to kill a mob, I seldomly found myself being the one earning the experience. After about half an hour of orc picking I noticed a yellow centurion. Everyone suddenly stayed clear of it, instead of swarming around it like flies. I watched him a long time as he walked around right inside the entrance of Crushbone and suddenly he made a run for it towards me. I was about 30 feet away and I quickly turned around and made a run for it toward the dense forest. I did the jump/run procedure and after I had runned for a while I turned around and saw that he was still on my tail, but now from a far distance away. I started to cast a cammo spell and I faded away just as he was running by me. Not really wanting to risk my life again (one half a bubble experience loss is enough for one day) I ran back to Kelethin. I took the main lift up and camped just beside the merchant.

<p>So... what's to say about Crushbone then? Worth the travell? Honestly? no, plain and simple :). There are constant trains which can transform my hard invested hours of gameplay to mere dust. I strongly believe though that one can level faster in Crushbone than in the Thicket, but it's more of a gamble in CB. You might level fast, but you're bound to die trying so. The main reason for leaving the Thicket (except for plain boredom) was the long run from the Rivervale entrance to the wall gate. Baah.. atleast you didn't have to zone to get to a merchant in the Thicket. In CB you'll be constantly zoning back and forth either because you got stuff to sell, or because there's an evil train of vicious orcs molesting half of the players in CB. And don't even talk about the pain running from CB to Kelethin. Ugh... I really wished I had stayed in the Thicket. Sure, it was boring with just the goblins, but atleast there were another place there which I forgot to check out; Kitichor Forest. The worst thing though is the damn "Your target is too far away, get closer" messages you get, even though you are standing right next to the orc. Next up you find him dead a couple o' blocks away, blown to pieces by a powermad wizard... sigh.

<p>Good thing though... I talked to Nexxis and she's on Faydwer as well with Newf. They are having a blast in Steamfont mountains. Maybe it's worth checking out. Though, I do feel like a half-elf - Some of my friends are growing older (level-wise) than me, and some of them are even leveling slower than me. I'm in the middle. I play with a group one weekend, log on the next week and find them being level 14ish or something, or they've decided to make new characters... dooh :). Anyway, what other good places are there on Faydwer? We got Butcherblock, and I have to check into that one. Problem with Butcherblock is that the merchants won't deal with me, being the "filthy" wood-elf I am (???). We got, as meantioned earlier, Steamfont. But I've heard that that's grouping area only, nothing for solo'ers. Oh well, I guess time will tell. I'll really try to enjoy the Faydark during the coming weekend. But... if I haven't leveled properly (or are experiencing excessive "Your target..:" messages) I'll ask Kalo again about sending me back. If not, I'll just take the boat... it's worth it. Besides... I haven't checked out what that nice town called Freeport has to offer me...

<p>Ah dang... I've strained my back real bad and I've missed two school days so far (oh no! :). Anyway, my back is getting better and it's time for me to finish up some unfinished work, such as this.

<p>So, I logged back in on Sunday and went straigth to the Thicket to go gob hunting. I wanted level 8 bad and I thought that if I sticked with solo I would have it in no time, killing blues. Turned out it went slow as always. I killed gobs, bats and bears, still I could barely see the meter filling up. During the whole time I'd been doing /who commands, searching for teleporters. Finally I found what seemed like a good "target" :). His name was Kalo Stormshadow and he was (I think) a level 29 Druid. I sent a message to him as politely as I could and it turned out that he was more than willing to do it for me, cost free! Not really knowing what to do (feeling the same way as when you are a newbie, and taking advantage of it, getting great stuff for free :) I just did what I was told to and went to the Wall Gate.

<p>Kalo appeared and announced that there was a gate going to Butcherblock in 1 minute. Butcherblock? I thought. I hoped of getting directly to the Greater Faydark, as I didn't really know my way around in Butcherblock. Heck! I didn't even know my way around in the Faydark :). Anyway, soon the people who wanted to go (only being one Paladin) were assembled and Kalo began to cast......

<p>Waaaah!!!! My computer couldn't handle all the data and it froze real bad. I screamed in fear of my character either getting corrupted or he ending up in a swarm of butcherblock meanies. I had to reboot and I really started to get all stressy. The rebooting took about a minute. Then I had to connect with my modem, which took an additional minute. Next up I had to wait for the EQ patching thingie (is there a way to skip that??) and then there's the totally useless "I Agree" thingie.... then three splash screens.... one intro movie (lots of Esc clickings here :)... Login next... Server page... splash screen (1 minute)... character pick... splash screen (1 minute) and finally I was back in the game, non-corrupted, but perfectly alive.

<p>Now, let's take a stop here and discuss the login system of Verant/Sony whatever. Why on Earth does it require you to watch two gawdaweful splash screens for 2 minutes? In UO it takes about a total of 30 seconds to be in the game, starting from the main screen. I find it very disturbing, especially when there's money involved here. What is the reason for these two minutes? Are Verant using a really high tech, security high, firewall which forces the information from your modem to check their ID card over and over again, telling them it's ok? Or is it so that there is so much more information needed for Everquest? I still find it hard to believe, as we are working with the same things as in UO. Both games gives the user the environment and all graphical bits on the hard drive, while the actual "information" of your character and everything are on their server. But why does it take four times longer in EQ than in UO? Sure, UO is 2D, while EQ is 3D... but don't we have the world and the engine on our hard drive??

<p>Anyway, time to get back to Atherion... I found myself at the obelisks of Butcherblock. Kalo couldn't bind me to that area so I was on my own to reach Kelethin. I thanked him for all the things he'd done for me and I was on my way. A friendly dwarf, named Tenakah directed me to the crossroads and told me to follow it and I would end up in Kelethin. I thanked him and followed it around and found myself... at the impressive gates of Kaladim, the dwarven city... D'oh! I knew I couldn't trust those little dwarves :). I messaged Teron (now using his dwarven paladin, named Terron) and he was able to direct me to Kelethin. I came across a pass in the zone wall and I went through. Rightfully so, I did end up in the Greater Faydark. I followed the path and finally I came across a sight that made my heart go nostalgic. The lift system of Kelethin, what a sight it was. I hadn't been to Kelethin since I made it to Rivervale. Within seconds it struck me of why I had ever went to Rivervale in the first place. I started to lag, badly. My connection was fine... it was just that my ram and processor couldn't cope with the constant flow of information (and this being one of the largest zones... kind of like playing on the largest maps in Dark Reign). I guess 64 in ram just isn't enough for the faydark. Things that had baffled me really bad in the early days of my newbie stage started to happen again. Not being bound I didn't want to attack something big. So I targeted a normal bat and began burning. That's when I get the message "The target is too far away, get closer!". Uh... ok, I stopped burning and walked by him trying to get a swing at him... what's this? Target is too far away? Hmm... I circle around and find the bat 40 yards away fighting another newbie, ugh!

<p>Things like this happened all the time when I was newbie killing in the Faydark and I forgot about it when I was in the Thicket, where everything went totally ok. And Kelethin, also called the "Ewok village"... I thought I knew it by now, but... no. All these platforms everywhere, and it doesn't help that once in the while the computer freezes up and you find yourself facing another direction. Deadly! If not at least very confusing when you are trying to navigate in this town. Oh, Rivervale... sob... what a beautiful town you were... sob.

<p>Not really wanting to make a wrong turn and up dying, I went back to the main lift (aka Priest of Discord lift) and started to announce for someone to bind me. I finally found a level 14 wizard and began messaging... but my tells didn't show up on my screen. I ran around for about 5 minutes wondering why I couldn't use the tell command. Everything else was running fine... especially the /ooc and /shout commands throughout the zone :). A minute later I pop out of the game and the "Server Not Responding" thingie hits my eyes... drats!

<p>Turns out that it's my damn modem that has frozen up again. I rebooted and had to go through that damn procedure again. On my return a binder stands right next to me, named Alder. He bound me for free and I got another tell from Terron, telling me he was on the boat from Freeport... coming to show me Crushbone. Turned out though that an orc killed him halfway to Faydark and that he was now standing on the docks again, looking newbie'ish... oh well :). I didn't want to wander off to Crushbone all myself so I told Terron that it was getting late and called it a night.

<p>Now, I truly hope that Crushbone will be worth the effort of leaving Rivervale. Because Greater Faydark simply sucks for me. Kelethin is aggravatingly confusing and I don't want to spend time trying to figure out where that damn bank is everytime I got a little bit o' gold in me pocket.

<p>Woah, played a lot last night, enjoy:

<p>Upon connection I saw that Newf was now on the other side of the ocean, in Steamfont. She'd taken the boat and moved on. Oh well, guess I could always go grouping with other people. When I was Num Lock running toward the wall gate I made a who command and saw that my old buddy Caranthir was online, now in the shape of Veon, half-elf Rogue. Old Caranthir had been exposed to a bug which made him un-worthwhile for continous use. Veon was already level 7 and I asked if he wanted to group. We met up at the gate and went killing. We encountered a LOT of weapon wielding gobs, which made a big change to my funding :). But, as always, the exp was scarce, so we both, after some time, split up to go solo. Before that we did encounter a couple of skels though which made me going level 7!

<p>Going solo I just kept killing anything that was blue to me.. bats, rats and gobs. My exp meter was going as slow as when I was grouped, especially now when I was lvl 7, so I thought that I might as well go grouping with a bunch of people. Knowing that I had seen Evany earlier that night grouping with a bunch of people I asked her if I could join. Sure I could, and with me, we had a full group of fearful people. Besides Evany and me, we had Wuntvore, the Human Monk, Lorellin the Halfling Druid, and Zivere the Dwarf... something?

<p>Anyway, we ran around the whole zone looking for big prey. I even got the task to go fetching :). Although I didn't know the zone that well (I'm still learning my way around) I did succeed of bringing a young kodiak back to the group. Everything was going great until we decided to attack a Giant Scarab. I, foolishly, started nuking while the other were going into melee. My mana, with my attention, went down to a bubble or two and suddenly I heard Lorellin crying for help. I saw that his hp meter had dropped down to 1 bubble or less. Drats, I thought, trying to target him in all the cluster of pixels. I don't know if I even scored one heal on him before he died. The rest of us finished off the scarab and we sat down and awaited the return of Lorellin.

<p>The time passed and there was no sign of Lorellin. I had to run back to the town, and Wuntvore and Evany had to split up too. We said good bye and I pressed the dispand button. Eeeehh... wasn't working; need the whole group to be present. Oh great, I thought, using the /petition command for the very first time. There was no reply, but soon afterwards Lorellin's character dispatched from the game completely and we could all dispand correctly.

<p>I went back to town and sold of some of the loot I had aquired. At this time I was so fed up with the Thicket. That long walk back and forth from the town and the wall gate. All the monsters either being blue or red. Wasn't exactly my cup of tea or how you say that :). I felt an urge to move back to good ol' Kelethin, but I couldn't afford the trip, in RL, to do it by foot. So I messaged a 29 lvl wizard and asked him if he could teleport me back to my homelands. He could, but the time he would have to invest from going from Unrest to Misty would cost me about 30pp. Declining his offer as polite as I could (only having 2pp in the bank :), I sighed and logged out for some thinking.

<p>What was I supposed to do? Should I go with the fun, but awefully slow, grouping in the thicket to level 9? That would be tedious and I've grown really tired of the thicket. What about my homelands then? I know that Faydark is way populated and that there aren't much prey left over, but I got Crushbone there, which would invite to some exciting grouping. Another good advantage with Faydark is that I got my druid guild there, supporting me with a lot of different quests, something that I've seen missing in Rivervale (except for the squad ring.. and no, I still haven't found Budo). Faydwer is also a smaller continent, and it's consisting of a lot of newbie zones. That's good, as I want to start exploring, but I don't want to go to places where I would probably need the Bind Affinity spell, in case I die (I'm really afraid of dying.. wasting a lot of hours spent = money). So, right now I guess it leans to getting to Faydwer.

<p>Anyway, I posted a message on eqvault (tarrew board) for a teleportation. After that I logged back in and grouped up with Evany again. We went to one of the camps and strangely, it was rather empty of people, we had the whole camp for ourselves. Everything was going great until a young kodiak came and attacked Evany (thank god I am a druid, kodiaks don't attack me). She quickly zoned to safety through the Runnyeye entrance. The problem remained though, as the kodiak got stuck towards the zone border. Evany zoned back, only to be yet again chased into a commercial less zoning (sorry, had to add that :). I used the /shout command whether someone couldn't come and dispatch this big furball of power :). Someone came (forgot his name... grrr) and took the bear for a walk to the netherworld and Evany could come back. We resumed our gob chase but soon we both had to split. I sat down at the wall gate and logged out.

<p>Currenlty, I'm 2.5 bubbles away from level 8 and I hope that I will reach it during my last 2 hours later today. I doubt it though. I also need to find someone to teleport me without charging me more than 2pp, it'll be hard, but I'll give it a shot :).

<p>I logged back in and saw myself standing on one of the hills in Rivervale. I checked my friends list and went zoning to the Thicket. When I arrived in the Thicket I took good caution on what way I was supposed to take... now the one that forks directly to the left, that's Rivervale, while the longer straighter path is to the Thicket... no more loading mistakes I guess :). Running across the zone I saw that everything was green to me, fire beetles, spiderlings, you name it. Using the Num Lock running feature I announced if anyone would be interested in grouping with me. A player named Nexxis responded and we were to meet at the wall gate. When I approached the gate I saw that she'd also invited a Rogue Halfling, named Tobbun. Great, the more the merrier... or how goes it? :). I thought with 3 people in the group we wouldn't have much problem tackleing gobs and the likes. Turned out we did...

<p>During a heavy spawn three gobs came running for us. Nexxis, being very low on hp, told us to zone to Runnyeye. She disappeared and I and Tobbun considered if we could take them on or not. This is where I also saw the problems of being a druid. A druid can be anything from a meele at low levels to a burner or healer. BUT, you can only be ONE to be efficient. I and Tobbun was both in meele, and I scored a burn or whirling wind once in a while. Turned out that my mana nor my healing spell could keep up with healing Tobbun when being attacked by 3 gobs, some of them white for me. We came to a missunderstanding and Tobbun eventually hit the dust. Petrified as I was, I finally took Nexxis advice and ran toward the Runnyeye entrance. The loading kicked in and I didn't know if the gobs would continue kicking my butt while I was zoning or not. Turned out they didn't, but I was down to two bubbles and no mana. I hid and began recovering. While I was resting I saw all sorts of messages such as "A Goblin Shaman starts to cast a spell" and whatever. Persistent to stay hidden, Nexxis had a lot of trouble locating me to escort me back to the Thicket (I had been circling around all the time... silly me). I unhid and she was actually standing on top of me (so that's why I kept hearing strange tapping sounds all the time? :). We went outside and spotted 3 gobs just standing there. We ran through, but they came after me allright. I quickly ran toward the entrance again and zoned...

<p>Back inside I was down to 3 bubbles, ouch. At this point Tobbun had hit the dust again. We weren't exactly experiencing group efficiency, and I guess I could take some of that blame on me :). I told Nexxis that I would come back later, said farewell and gated back to Rivervale where I logged out.

<p>One and a half hour later I decided to resume my adventure and, hopefully, find Nexxis and Tobbun to party with. I went online and my modem froze 4 times in a row. Cursing loudly, I had to reboot my computer. That didn't do much either... my modem kept freezing up and I decided to try again a little bit later.

<p>After another hour I was able to get my modem co-work with the ISP correctly and I started up Everquest. I went through the annyoing "I agree" stuff, the three splash signs, and finally the intro (thank god there's an escape button :). I typed in my password and... d'oh... "Can't get a response to the Login/Chat server. Please try again". I did, and nothing was working. Finally I gave up and closed Everquest and entered #Everquest2 (the first one was taken over :) on EFnet. I was told the login servers were down, and that there wasn't much else to do than to wait. Then a guy said "Server's are up!". I closed IRC and went through the login procedures of Everquest. Grrr, the servers were still down. Reconnecting to EFnet again I was greeted with one of the operators just changing the topic to "Servers are up". Oh well... might as well try again eh?

<p>For the third time, I went through the "I agree" stuff, the three splash screens and the intro movie. Upon connecting I was indeed greated by the server page. I pressed "Play Everquest" and had to cope with the splash screen of the girl with some music.... then the Zelda sounding music started and I was greeted by the character creation/picking thingie. After that I was greeted by the girl with the music and then, after hours of waiting I was finally in Rivervale again and the polka music kicked in!

<p>I ran across the Thicket zone and messaged Nexxis again. We decided to, once again, meet up at the gate. I dunno where Tobbun was, but Nexxis and I decided to stay clear of the gobs this time, and go for other things such as bats instead. We ran around the whole zone, killing anything from bats, rats, wolves and skeletons. Strangely, my exp meter wasn't moving. I recieved exp, but it decided to stay at two bubbles.

<p>After some running around I saw that another player, named Newf, had joined our group. I was told Newf was a pro in this game and I didn't ask twice when I saw her wielding a Combined Scimitar :). Without really knowing it, our group grew bigger within seconds. We picked up a halfling warrior at the gate, named Evany, and a another wood elf druid, named Bree. Feeling somewhat invurnerable we took on lots of gobs (using Newf as a fetcher :), and this time we were actually experiencing some of that fine team work. We hadn't made up any roles to play, so we were just burning, meeleing and healing as we saw fit, and fun it was! :). We even knocked down a Giant Scarab and I found myself only a half bubble away from level 7 when I had to call it a night. The team split up and said good night, time being 1am here.

<p>So what's to say about larger group fighting? Well, it's just plain fun. Even though you might not recieve as much exp at the time, you forget about keeping track of it as there's a million things to keep up with going grouped. When I logon tonight I really hope Nexxis, Newf and the other's will be online, as this has been my best EQ experience yet (except for the travel from Kelethin to Rivervale, which was a top notch experierence).

<p><a name=6><b>Journal Entry - 990501 - 10:22am</b></a>

<p>I've been busy all week with school and I never got the time for my last sunday entry. So here it goes:

<p>I logged back in and found that Teron, another friend of mine, had just logged in as well. We agreed on fighting goblins in the Thicket. The server was pretty crowded that night and we found ourselves running from one camp to the other, as they were all occupied with other players waiting for the spawn. And that's when it struck me... there ARE spawnpoints in EQ. People I had asked before I bought EQ said that there were no spawnpoints at all.... oh well :). Finally some people dropped out and we got a camp for ourselves for a while. We easily dispatched the goblins spawning, one by one. Then there were a spawn of two goblins, and that became too much for us and Teron hit the dust. Not really experienced with this area (I didn't even know the way back at this time), I quickly ran up the zone border hill and rested, awaiting his return.

<p>After he'd retrieved his equipment from his corpse we decided to try out something else. I spotted a bat and we began burning. Now, personally, I favour large and giants bats. They are not, unlike goblins, social... which means you won't have to worry about his pal sneaking up behind ya. If I'll go solo in this zone (which I eventually will) I'll be burning bats and shadow wolves until they are green to me. Shadow wolves, however, are social creatures, so I'll have to make sure that the first wolf I'm attacking is blue. Anyway, after dispatching the bat we went wolf hunting, and before I knew it, I hit level 6!

<p>Teron had to leave at this time, so I headed back to town. Besides, all the loot I had gotten were slowing me down. I sold them off and filled out the 2nd rank of spells for the money I got for my loot. Caranthir, now playing Veon, a rogue half-elf, told me to give all my runnyeye warbeads to the sheriff. I gave him 4 at a time, as another player had told me to (forgot his name...), and my faction went up and down with a lot of places and I got some exp, and 2 silver. 

<p>Satisfied with today's playing, I logged out. I now have a complete 2nd rank and I have no idea how I'll be able to spend money at this time :). I guess I better start saving up for those 3rd ranks.

<p>A lot of things happened last night. Here we go:

<p>I resumed my game in the Thicket and continued my beetle bashing. I don't know how many I killed, but the exp meter was sure going slow, and I mean dead slow. Two thirds of the beetle population were blue to me, yet I didn't get much experience. One thing I did get though was loot, and lots of it. I dunno how many times I zoned back to Rivervale to sell off my loot, but it took a long time with all the zonings. And that's when I noticed it... there's a merchant in the Thicket... can you say.. d'oh? :).

<p>My efficiency sky rocketed up now when I didn't have to zone every 20 minutes or so (and still no commercials, I guess Verant hasn't seen my page :). Soon I had built up a nice pile of silver and copper and it was time to aquire some new spells. During the whole evening I bought the following spells: Camouflage, Cure Poison and Disease and Gate. Camouflage was the biggest turn down. I thought it would make my skin all cameleontish (if that's a word :), really making my D3D card working, but... no. My character just said poof and he was rendered totally invisible. Now some of you wonder what's wrong with that? Well, let me tell you. Have you ever tried to steer your character, using chasecam, while he's invisible? Not the funniest thing to try out :). And no, I don't want to switch to the 1st person view, I love the chasecam mode!

<p>Anyway, something nasty happened after that. After running around like crazy trying to find spiderlings and fire beetles I suddenly came across three of 'em, all spiderlings. Yes, I said as they all turned out blue. I threw a whirling wind and then they came after me. Now, even for a level 5 character, 3 spiderlings can get on your... hit points :). I was down to 3.5 half bubble when I had knocked down one of them, and that's when it happened. At first I noticed that I wasn't slashing on them anymore. Next up I saw the lag meter going balistic, everything turning red. I cursed as I saw the "Server Not Responding" and I quickly tried to get to the login page. When I re-entered my password it said the chatserver was down. Oh great I thought. At least I was safe though, or so I thought. Turned out my modem had frozen up, and soon it self disconnected (I hate that sound... t'click!). I've had this problems earlier when playing EQ, and I knew I had to reboot my computer to be able to get my modem alive again. I was certain that I would now meet death for the first time in the game. I just wished I would have met it in a nicer way.

<p>After 10, painful, minutes of loading I was in the game again. To my relief, I was standing upright :). My hp was down to 3 bubbles, so I was never in any real danger. I recovered from the stressful shock and went back to Rivervale to purchase some more spells (I had not bought all of the above at this time).

<p>While I was in Rivervale I talked to Marshal Ghobber about the squad ring quest. He told me to seek out Budo at the Great Wall. Unfortunately I couldn't find him. While I was searching for him I saw a person named Qyanshu something being attacked by Mooto, the goblin spellcaster. I instinctively hit my hide button as I didn't want to die. Now I didn't know whether I should heal him or not. The combat was definetly leaning to Mooto's side and I didn't want to get my butt kicked for nothing so I remained hidden. Qyanshu was soon down on the ground and Mooto was looking for another victim. I ran away a bit and threw a camouflage on myself and then I went back to the Wall entrance, where it had all taken place (where were the guards??). Qyanshu soon returned and Mooto was already gone. I told him that I saw him dying, and that I didn't had the courage to help him. He just said "Cool, I was downstairs doing my laundry". I don't know what else to say but... "Americans" tsk tsk.. :). They are, with the Canadians, the only people who're constantly online, even if they're sleeping, eating or working. *Sigh* I wish I had a cable modem :).

<p>Anyway, I went back to my bug killing and soon a halfling stood at the thicket entrance, asking for food. I have my forage skill up at average now so I don't have any probs with food, so I offered him to give him some. He thanked me and asked me if I needed any water, which I did. Myrren, which was his name, then asked me if I wanted to go grouping, as he was level 5 as well. Sure, I replied, telling him I'd never group fought before. He told me we should try out the goblin camps in the intermediate area, and rightfully so we did.

<p>Now, for all you solo'ers out there; Grouping rocks! I've never had this fun in EQ before, nor in UO. We fought a couple of giant bats and goblin warriors and I saw my exp meter actually moving, compared to the bug killing :). I had great use with my whirling wind, as it does 22 dmg - a good opener. I also saw a lot of giant spiders, eeew... Oh btw, upon turning around a black bear I heard a sound which sounded very familiar. It was the same sample of the bears roaming in Daggerfall, how nostalgic. I actually enjoyed myself a lot in this new area, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it until I reach level 9, that's when I'll start exploring Norrath.

<p>After a while Myrren had to go. He left kind of abruptly, and I found myself left alone in the zone. Good thing I had gate memorized and I thought of giving it a spin. I succeeded on my 2nd attempt and was, after a commercial-less zoning, back in good ol' Rivervale. I sold of my loot, a couple of scythes and some other stuff. I've heard that I'm to give all the Runnyeye warbeads I got to some sherrif. Time will tell, because this is where I ended my show last night.

<p>I'm currently 3 bubbles away to level 6 and I can't wait reaching level 9. I know it'll take some time, maybe 2-3 weekends of constant group fighting. Even if it'll be tedious I am sure I will enjoy it, as grouping is really nice in EQ. Anyway, I'll waste my last 2 hours of online entertainment later tonight. Stay tuned.

<p><a name=4><b>Journal Entry - 990424 - 4:18pm</b></a>

<p>Heya.

<p>Been a week since I last played, and I could surely feel that when I logged back into Everques and resumed my adventures with my character, Atherion. Took a while for me to get used with the controls (using american keyboard setting). Anyway, when I had my controls all set and remembered what I stopped doing last I placed some coins in the bank and headed out to the thicket again, trying to reach level 5 within my 3 hour play. I had heard that I should kill fire beetles and spiderlings, being level 4 and all. Those are supposed to be the "highest" blue creatures, thus equalling more experience. I killed one, I killed two, I killed a train of four, I killed everything that had more than 4 legs. Eventually I hit my weight allowance and I had to zone back to Rivervale, and that's when it happened...

<p>D'oh! Don't you just hate it when you've finished loading the new area and you turn the wrong way and zone BACK to the previous area? argh!!! I did that 6 times in a row! 6 times! Talk about frustration. Not did I only waste time, but I also wasted a lot of money during this period (which took a long time, using a 28.8 modem calling from Sweden :).  Speaking of zoning; Why can't they just skip the 10$/month and instead do advertises during zoning? I mean, there are like 20,000 users online during peak times and about the half during non-peak times. Now, what if all of these people zoned about 4 times an hour? That's commercials going 80,000 times an hour during peak times , even more. Talk about reaching your crowd :). And for once, the commercials wouldn't be a nuisance, as there's nothing to watch from the beginning. I mean, might as well look at something. right? :)

<p>Anyway, once I got out of the zoning circus (I threw a sense animal and through that I could pick the right path :), I made it to the merchant. I think I made about 1pp with the loot I got (fire beetle eyes for 2sp 2cp and bixie stingers for 4sp, oh yeah :). I wisely put all the money aside for future fundings, as it turned out later that I would really need it. All I bought was some water, since that is pretty hard to forage up (I only get fishing grub and berries, don't ask me why :). Anyway, back to the thicket, I was anxious hitting level 5 and to get my hands on a new set of spells. I kept killing and my inventory started to fill up (thank god I got 3 containers) and all of the suddenly, some guy advertises in yellow: "The world will go down in about 10 minutes, sorry for the inconvinience". Argh, couldn't be more right, me being only one bubble away from level 5. The first thing that struck my mind was that I would probably be time warped, just like in the good old UO days. Not really knowing what to do I sat down and awaited the horror. After a couple of minutes I was kicked out and met with the most god awful sight in EQ: "Server not responding".

<p>I closed down EQ and checked my email and, if any, new updates on the vault and stratics. Not really seeing anything interesting I restarted EQ and tried to log in. Now it said the chat server wasn't responding, dang... I kept pressing the connection button and after a lot of "Chat server doesn't seem to responding" or whatever, I was greated by the server page. Tarrew was still down, but when I pressed the "Sort alphabetical" it turned up on the screen, 63 users at the time. I smiled and pressed enter. To my amazement, I resumed where I had last been standing, woo hoo, no timewarp! I did a /who command and noticed that there where only 3 people in the thicket, the usual number is 22 or something. Heh, did I have all the kliknaks for myself or what? :). My connection was at it's peak too. During the evening I had experienced a lot of lag (that first set of numbers had been red most of the time) but now it was great. I watched my exp bubbles and after a couple of hard found spiderlings, I reached level 5!

I cheered out and headed back to Rivervale, anxious getting my level 5 spells. I sold all my loot I had and went to the bank. Ahh... 12gp, what a sight. I placed all my money in my inventory and headed for the Farmstead. When I eventually found the right halfling (took a while :) I was shocked about the prices. Dang, I thought 12gp would at least fill out half of the 2nd rank. Turned out I had enough money to buy just 3 of them. Oh well, life goes on and I could always get more money. I decided to buy Invoke Lightning, Burst of Fire and Whirling Wind.

<p>Then came my next disappointment. When I previously filled out my 1st rank I was level 3-4 something and then it didnt take much time to inscribe the spells as it did at level 1. Now to my horror, it took as long time inscribing my new spells as it did inscribing the 1st rank spells at level 1. Ugh... that's all I could say about it :). Inscribing and memorizing the spells took at least 5-10 minutes. Now this doesn't sound much to you americans, go grab a sandwich or something, that's what you would say. But here? bah... 5-10 minutes online here costs a small fortune, well... almost :). Oh well, I guess our phone companies are the ones to blame and not EQ :). Anyway, after my stressful tappings on the keyboard I had all my spells ready for testing. I ran back out in the thicket and saw that all but the spiderlings and fire beetles where green to me. Green means no experience... d'oh. Not really caring I targeted a bat and cast invoke lightning on it. Eeeeeh... big turn off. Here I was expecting lightning bursting down from the sky sounding as cool as the real lightning sound in EQ during rain, but no... I had to be satisfied with this small ring of pixels, resembling a group of fire'ish flowers or whatever, scary :). Well, at least it did take care of the bat, heh.

<p>Next up was the whirling wind spell. I thought my character would conjure up a lesser tornado or something, but... no :). All I saw was this blue light filling up the screen. At first I thought I had used my healing spell by mistake. Oh well, it did look cooler than the lightning, it wasn't all that bad. Unfortunately, the monster I had targeted (being a vicious large rat) resisted the spell and I ended up with nothing but an empty mana meter.

<p>With most of the monsters being green I decided to check out the place on the other side of the Thicket wall, the zone supposed to be targeted for level 5-10 characters. First thing that I spotted was an Orc Centurion. Ready to run to the guards I considered it, and to my surprice, it turned out blue for me. No problem I thought, starting to cast Burst of Fire. I struck him twice, whereas another player bashed him down in a blow or two, I guess he was already fighting it when I started burning. I approached the person, named Blod, and asked him about the area. During our conversation I spotted a giant spider... just like one of those I had spotted earlier, on my trip to Rivervale from Kelethin. It turned out red for me and I decided to stay alert, really really alert :). Next up I heard a buzzing sound, thinking it was one of those annyoing bixies. Turned out it wasnt. Instead it was a Giant Wasp. Now I had seen drones or the likes in the faydark, and they where considered to be newbie creatures. Turned out this wasn't. Not really wanting to think about what was going to be on my tombstone I and Blod decided that it was better for me to go kill fire beetles and spiderlings since they still gave me exp.

<p>At this time I had to log out, my 3 hours were up. Sitting here now, I have no idea on how I will approach level 6. Should I go fire beetle wacking or should I group and risk my neck while doing so? I have yet to die, and I am glad I haven't experienced it earlier. But now I really don't want to die, I'll loose exp. Exp means invested time, and invested time means money, and I don't have much of the latter so... :). I guess time will tell. I still have another 3 hours tonight and I will use it wisely, pray for me :)

<p>Ok, logged in at about 5pm my time (Central European Time, or CET for short). My memory is kind of blurry right now (school day :), but I think I went straight to the Thicket upon connection. I went killing during the whole time, really wanting to hit level 4. Once in a while I had to zone back to Rivervale to sell off my loot (actually got myself encoumbered for the very first time). I made almost a whole pp yesterday, selling loot to merchants and ruined wolf pelts to other players. I didn't know what I could charge for them, so I sold them for how much the buyer would pay for them. I sold them from 7cp a piece to as high as 2sp a piece. Speaking of pelts... don't you feel really happy when you get a black wolf pelt from a black wolf? I mean, those thingies are 7sp or something, a real treasure, while the ruined, favourable, pelts goes for 7-8cp at a good merchant. I find it confusing :)

<p>Anyway, I did great skill-wise. My offense is at 15 something, while my defense is as high as 20! My 1H slashing was almost maxed out during level 3. That's right... eventually I hit level 4! At the time, I'm only 4 bubbles away from a total new set of spells! With the money I got through the loot I filled out my first rank of spells. I wonder why I didn't buy Sense Animals earlier, it seems like a great spell. While I was purchasing the spell scrolls I checked the price for the spell Ignition (a 3rd rank spell). Now I don't know if I mixed it up with another spell but the price was 8pp or something! Gee, if that's correct I better start saving up :).

<p>Btw, at level 5 I'll start loosing exp for dying, as well as my newbie equipment. And I haven't even died once yet! I guess I better go grouping with others at level 5, which will only make me enjoy the game even more.

<p>Notice: Checked back on what I had previously written. It says that the bixies were white to me, couldn't be. I must have mixed up the "Wood elves like you dont belong in our realm" with the con message. I guess they are blue to me, sorry :)

<p>Anyway, time for me to go now, I got tons of homework. So I'll cya all on the weekend. That's right, I can't play EQ on weekdays. I need to save my money.

<p>Until then. Cya!

<p>Lots of things happened yesterday. When I logged in there were about 800-900 users on Tarrew, and it felt like at least half of those people where running around in the Faydark. Before I got EQ I decided that my Elf would go to Rivervale as soon as possible, and I had made arrangements with Caranthir that he would guide me there. So when I was running around killing bats (those are the only creatures that gets left alone in Faydark) Caranthir asked me if I still wanted to make the trip. I decided I wanted to, so Caranthir (who was on Antonica already) left and made a wood elf so that he could escort me to the Kaladim docks. I was looking forward making this trip, but as soon as we headed down the main lift, darkness took place. It felt kind of eerie running around in the big forest in the middle of the night, especially when I felt that there were Giant Spiders everywhere, which there weren't :). Anyway, we came upon our first zoning, and I almost freaked out. Now, I wasn't ready for a zone and I got a lil shakey when everything froze for a moment. Sitting there looking at my modem as the lights where flashing, I felt nervous, would my modem die?

<p>Thank god it didn't and once again I could move my character. Caranthir, who was now playing Indis, a wood elven female, told me that we've made it to butcherblock. Running across the zone I came across my first giant snake. Those suckers are big :). Finally we came upon the wall that seperated Kaladim from the "outdoors". I didn't get to see much of the city as we were in a hurry to make it to the boat. The boat wasn't there though when we got there. Some guys there, fishing, told us it would arrive in about 20 minutes. Ugh, 20 minutes. I don't know what the americans feel about that, it's aggravating just to sit there waiting, but we Europeans pay while we play, approx. 1$/hour. Now I was both wasting time and money. Thankfully, it arrived after another 10 minutes and we jumped on board.

<p>Woah, I gotta tell you, being on that boat ride was really cool. The scenery with the islands, and the boat itself, was amazing to watch. Something that was not so hot though were the other characters on the boat. They kept jumping from pixel block to pixel block, looked really strange and took away some of the enjoyment of the ride.

<p>Then all the suddenly, my computer froze yet again: ZONING! I dunno about you guys, but every time I zone I feel that same feeling I felt years ago, playing on my c64 (no, not N64, I'm talk ancient stuff here :). While it's loading you're not supposed to touch anything, lest something might go wrong, and you have to reload everything (which takes about an hour :). Now standing on that boat I was afraid of getting dumped, dont want to end up in Kaladim for a boat wait again, even worse: ending up in the middle of the ocean dying with all my patchwork on. Thankfully, I went through the zone ok. Caranthir didn't share my luck though, as he was swiped off the boat, never to be seen again. Feeling somewhat lost without my guide I took up conversation with the other passangers. They weren't too talkative though, but they promised me that they would tell me when we got to Freeport. Moments later I recieved a message from Caranthir, now playing his main char, that he got swiped and he was now in Freeport waiting for me. I felt a little bit better and soon we zoned once again.

<p>Phew, at last! Freeport in sight, and what a magnificent sight it was. Now I found Freeport as the nicest city I've ever been to. It looks pirateish (dunno if that's a word :) and very fitting for a fantasy world. Kind of reminded me of the beginning town in Heretic II. Anyway, off I jumped and said farewell to the boat. At the docks, Caranthir was rightfully waiting for me. He fetched a wizard that bound me (forgot his name, sorry), and off we went. Now, Freeport might look nice, but boy is it confusing! We ran through stores and stuff and out to other streets and well I dont remember very well. I was more than busy hanging onto Caranthir :). We got outside and out to the Freeport field, night fell again (it was day during the boat ride) and we zoned in the darkness. I think we ended up in East Karana/Commonlands whatever, and Caranthir told me to stay real close now. We stayed near the zone wall, up on the hill and ran on that all the way to Kitihor forest. During our travels we found the entrance to Befallen, the North Ro passage, and encountered lots of Hill Giants, ugh... they got me spooked off even at a distance. In Kitichor forest we followed the marked paths and this is where I first saw a Giant Spider. Now I really have to give the developers some credits for it, because, woah, did it feel real or what?

<p>Finally, after 1.5 hours of travel, we arrived at the entrance of Rivervale. This is also where I first saw a halfling (what a coincident :). No harm intended for any halflings, but the first time I saw one of those running I couldn't help laughing :). Those feets of their seem to go in mach speed if you know what I mean. Anyway, upon entering Rivervale I really wanted to find someone who could bind me. Turned out, no one could. Caranthir told me to try later in the evening, when there would be more players online. I sat down and camped.

<p>Three hours later I decided to log onto EQ again, to find myself a binder and to check out the Thicket (the reason why I'd been travelling through Hill Giant territory). My luck was with me, as there was a binder standing right behind me when I logged back in. Wendy was her name and she bound me for free. She also showed me the way to the bank. I rearranged some of my belongings and when I went out of the inventory mode I saw a sight that paraylised me. Right in front of me, there was a Human or something, dressed in chain and wielding two screaming maces. What really shocked me though was his name; Lamron EbYhw. Now, some of you might recall him as being Gram, from gramsplace.com. Not really knowing what to say, I asked him if he was Gram (d'oh, intelligent question :). I told him it was my 4th login ever or something and that I was making this page (as he has made a similar one to both UO and EQ). His reply was if I would be playing with Atherion as my main character. And before I knew it, we were on a wolf hunt to make me a complete set of small patchwork armor :). 

<p>He took me straight into the Thicket and showed me the wall that seperated the newbie land from the intermediate one. We knocked down a couple of wolves, but not many of them held ruined wolf pelts. We split up and I went newbie hunting, killing large rats and stuff, while he was tracking down wolves. After a while he told me to meet him in town. He'd made me a tunic, a pair of pants and boots, all in the size small. My inventory was full at that time so before I knew it he'd given me three boxes as well. Been given this much, I told him that I wanted to pay for myself. He didn't want my hard earned money instead he told me that I should do the same to some other newbie some day.

<p>At this time he departed from EQ and I went straight to the thicket to do some killing on my own. Now, all you people struggling in Greater Faydark, I feel sorry for you. You have no idea how much better the Thicket is compared to the Faydark. After only a couple of fights I finally struck level 3. But the exp gain didn't stop there. I soon found out that I could take on bixies, and those were white to me. Another thing that's good about the Thicket is all the loot you get; Bixie stingers, Fire Beetle eyes, wolf pelts, different rat parts, spider silk, etc...

<p>Feeling somewhat rich again I purchased my first item (except for scrolls and food): a buckler. I also found a tailor named, Sallow, who traded a pair of great wrists (wolf wrists something) for 9gp and 1cp (all I had, flat broke now). Feeling somewhat invurnerable I went to do some more bashing in the thicket. I killed rats, goblin workers, fire beetles, spiderlings, black wolves and bixies. My defense and 1H slashing sky rocketed up. Especially my 1H slashing, which ended up at 15 or something. Things were going just fine when I encountered my first yellow in close combat, a Monger Rat or something. All I saw was "hiss hiss SNAP SNAP" and then I ran for my life. His first hit only did 5 points on me, but it gave me a disease as well. I ran toward the cave entrance to Rivervale in somewhat of a panicked state. After the zoning I saw that the disease wasn't really as bad as I had thought. I sat down at the "town center" and asked if someone could cure me. Suddenly I was surrounded by a giant green circle. I checked if my disease icon vanished, but it didn't. Instead I found myself floating in thin air! Turned out I'd been a target for a levitate spell, figures :). Oh well, I must say it looked cool when I sat there floating like a yoga-dude. Finally a halfling came to my rescue and cured me (forgot his name too, grr...).

<p>I headed back to the Thicket, staying clear of the area where I had first spotted the Monger rat. I went along killing the usual monsters, especially fighting bixies. The fun thing with bixies is that they move during combat. You have to actively back off, change direction and so on, not to step on that point where you cant see your target. They're still white to me, being lvl 3, still I dunno if they give me a lot of exp. Time passed and I found myself sleepy. I ran back to the town and logged off. I'll resume my EQing later today with the goal of hitting level 4.

<p>Woah, things went good last night. Now when I knew the basics I decided to create my main character that I will, hopefully, stick around with for a long time. Still Wood Elven, but I changed my face from the blonde one to the first "default" one. I put 5 points on my strength and the remaining 25 on wisdom. Then I typed in Atherion in the name slot and off I went.

<p>After I had given my newbie note to the guildmaster, inscribed and memorized my two first spells, my first priority was to get the Burst of Flame scroll. That way I could attract monsters and enhance my odds a bit with the foe I was fighting (ok ok, so 4 dmg isn't all that much :). Not having any money I asked a high elf, named Darelduin, if he could supply me with the funding. I kept my profile low as I don't really think one should beg, but being the total newbie I was, I swallowed my pride. Now tell me, did it come as a shock to me when this nice High Elven person gave me a full pp? That's 10 gp, a major treasure for a newbie such as myself. I thanked him and promised I would remember him (*waves to Darelduin* :). After purchasing and memorizing the Burst of Flame scroll I felt ready for some action. I took the main lift down (it was easier finding my way around now when I was mapping the place out as I was running around) and headed out in the forest. I fought some bats, and an occasional decaying skel. I was pretty impressed with myself when I killed my first skel, and I soon found myself at level 2.

<p>At that point I saw Caranthir auctioning about something. Now Caranthir is one of my oldest buddies on the net (from the daggerfall era) and I quickly used the tell command and told him about my whereabouts and that Atherion was my new character. We met at the main lift and I asked if he had any scimmies lying around (as my newbie club wasn't exactly Thor's Hammer :). He told me he'd get me one whilst he was looking for some leather pants for himself. I thanked him and went out in the forest again. 5 minutes later he'd aquired a scimmie for me. Even though it was rusty, it made some severe changes to my combat. My killing pace accelerated to top speed and I was killing bat after bat after skel after bat. Still, the exp meter wasn't moving an inch. I did recieve exp after every kill, but I could hardly tell the meter moving. Now being the druid I am, I dunno whether I can attack giant wasps and especially, black wolves. I'll take my changes later today and kill one, pray for me :).

<p>One thing I did get from my kills though was loot, and lots of it! I'd never traded with a merchant before so I thought I should give it a try, after all, I had no more slots to stash stuff (thank god some items are stackable). After I had sold all my bat furs/wings, bone chips, and rusty swords I had almost 2pp. Feeling somewhat rich, I decided it was time to buy patchwork armor. Announcing through the in-game feature called /auction didn't do much, just people selling Legionare bands or something :). Then I met up with Darelduin again. He asked me how I was doing. When I told him I was in search of patchwork armor he told me to follow me to the bank, something about finding a friend. I thought he had a tailor friend running around somewhere so I followed him. When we got there he simply gave me a bag. Upon inspection I saw that it was containing almost a full set of patchwork! And he didn't even charge me! I have no idea what I've done to him to achieve such fine things from him. When I've got a flowing economy I'll repay every copper he's given me.

<p>Dressed in almost full patchwork (arms, gorget missing) I remembered that I still have some money in the bank. So I went to the guildmaster and bought myself some spells: Dance Of The Fireflies, Endure Fire, Flame Lick and Snare. Ugh, did that take a long time, inscribing and memorizing? I just wish I had meditation. 
And then to another turndown, fire beetle eyes needed for Flame Lick, drats!

<p>Oh well, with patchwork and a scimmie I had almost no downtime at all, healing. Though, once in a while there would be an orc chasing me back to the guards. I did manage to kill an Orc Pawn though. My faction went up and down with different guilds, but I didn't get no exp, nor could I loot the body. This is what I find the most confusing about EQ. Have you ever targeted a decaying skeleton or something and just started to cast an attack spell, and you get the message: Your spell was interupted? Only to see that some other player has engaged with him. Sometimes it turns out to be a caster vs caster thing on who'll get to defeat something, everyone standing there casting and running into melee, hoping that the skel or whatever will attack YOU. But it's not a major problem, and I only notice it when the peak time for the U.S comes crawling in, otherwise it's fine.

<p>Well, enough talking, time's 3pm soon and I'm going for some skel killing, I hope it won't be as crowded as last night.

<p><b><a name=first>First Journal Entry - 990416 - 10:21pm</a></b>

<p>Argh, what a mess it's been! The beta testing of Everquest was over and I thought of giving EQ a try. I ordered it through a Swedish gaming company. They were all out, but I thought they'd have it soon. I ordered two, as my friend wanted one too, that way we would be able to split the mailing costs. Well, things were slow and we phoned the company (we ordered through the web) and asked them when they were to recieve it. They told us it would come the week after or something (turned out to be three), and they'd accidently only put one copy of it on the order, it should be two. Oh well, things were changed and I sat back and relaxed, thinking that EQ would come before Easter. 

<p>It turned out it didn't, and soon afterwards, EQ wasn't showing on their website anymore. Now it had been three weeks since we ordered it at the first place, and we were ready to dial 'em again, asking what was happening. To my relief, I found that it dropped down my mailbox that day, but only one copy of it. Upon dialing them we found out that there had been only twenty copies of them shipped to Sweden, and that I had been one of the few lucky to get one through their lottery. Oh well, I guess I should be a bit happy, my friend was to get it the next week (which is today). Anyway, all we now needed was a credit card. So off to the bank we went, but we couldn't get one right away, and since it was Friday, we would get it the next week... d'oh! Feels kind of akward sitting here with the game that I've been waiting for and now I have to wait for my credit card too :).

<p>Anyway, today (Thursday) I did discover the credit card and now I was all set to play something a little more involving than the offline tutorial (which I've played about twenty times. That "There's trouble at the graveyard, come quickly!" keeps ringing in my head :).

<p>So, after passing the billing form I was finally greeted by the server section. Now I don't know about you, but I find the interface VERY confusing. I took me at least thirty good seconds to find the "Play Everquest" button :). Anyway, character creation. Hmm... I'd been planning for days to be a wood elven druid, and that was what I became too. But I became rather disappointed with the faces. There's not one good Wood Elven face in the game, at least not for the males. Finally I decided to go with the blonde face, it didn't look good, but it sure was looking better than some of the other faces. Not really thinking this would be a character to stick with for long, more like a test character, I quickly pressed the name generator and it suggested Lanyen, not a too bad of a name.

<p>After the selection I was met with yet another splash screen, that same High Elven female, but this time... with music! I had never experienced music in EQ before (not much to say about the Tutorial :). Although I wasn't impressed with the tunes I still felt that they gave some flavour to the atmosphere. After a long load (I need more ram) I saw myself standing in that Kelethin town. Now I've heard a lot of critisism on how easily one could fall to their deaths here and how confusing the city really is. Well, I didn't think it was confusing, at least not when looking at a map. But ingame? that's something totally different :). Thank god though that I started at the druid guild. I gave the guildmaster the note and inscribed and memorized my first two spells (gee, that really took a long time). At this time a nice wood elven female had come to my newbie rescue of lostness. Her name was Chalise and she helped me out with finding the bank, which I haven't been able to locate myself since I last saw it :). After that she took me straight out in the Greater Faydark and showed me how to kick some bats. Heh, I gotta tell you, fighting is very confusing, and dangerous, when you're changing your camera view instead of your interface selection :). I found myself low on hp and tried to run away and cast minor healing on myself, that didn't go well, but Chalise was watching me and suddenly I was surrounded by blueish healing lights. I finally pulled off the strength to wack one of those suckers down. At that point Chalise had to split, but before she went she gave me a couple of gold pieces, a pair of shoes and to top of it all, a staff. That was too kind, thanks!

<p>After that I thought about placing the coins in the bank. Just one problem, where was it now again? :). I ran around in the trees for some time, which included two modem crashes (I dunno why). I soon became aware of that I'd taken the wrong lift, as I ended up at the Scouts of Tunare, d'oh! After finding my way back to the lift I was escorted by some nice player to the main lift, and after that a player named "Kerranthan" or something (I hope I spelled that right) showed me the bank. I deposited all my valuables, including my coins and a bat wing :). Soon after that my modem froze up again. Too tired of reconnecting and loosing some more bucks on just to log on to the server and watch the splash screens again, I decided it was time to call it a night. And yeah, that's right, we pay by the minute here in Sweden (1$/hour).

<p>What's to say about my first impressions so far then? Well, it do look a lot like Daggerfall, enhanced with 3dfx graphics. The overall gameplay is confusing and aggravating, still I do enjoy myself. I saw both serious roleplayers and kewldood language, which is similar to Ultima Online. Anyway, time is ticking away and I better prepare myself for school tomorrow. I'll resume my adventure in Everquest at 11am pacific time tomorrow, on Tarrew Marr. If you see me, don't be surpriced if you see me running up and down like a headless chicken :).
