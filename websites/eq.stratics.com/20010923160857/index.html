I am also pleased that the casters damage will be looked at. However, I have one minor point I'd like to make regarding the following comment:<br><br>"Damage output is by no means the only thing that a caster brings to a fight. It's much more complicated to evaluate the effects of debuffs, haste, buffs and even evacs when talking about combat effectiveness." I counter that damage is the only thing that wizards (in particular) bring to a fight. Admittedly, they do have evacs and I have even gotten a group once or twice (could probably count on one hand) because of my evac ability. Most of the raids these days camp a cleric and do rezzing, but there is still the occasional need for an evacer. Nevertheless, most (all?) wizards became wizards to do damage and it is the number one reason we can still get into groups. Do you think these changes will further devalue the role of the wizard in a group and aggravate the problem of wizard's getting groups?<br><br>Thanks for your time,<br>Shakarr Shockweaver<br>58 Evoker<br>Bristlebane</blockquote></b>Well, I was talking about casters in general, not one caster class specifically. Each class will be considered with it's own abilities, specialties and restrictions.<br><br>I don't think the changes we are proposing for melee combat will make any caster more or less wanted in groups. These changes will not suddenly have people asking for rangers to replace druids, or paladins to replace clerics. Nor will you see groups refusing wizards or necromancers in favor of shadowknights.<br><br><blockquote><b>Just curious, why are rangers and monks getting triple attack but not rogues or warriors? Their double attack lvl cap is higher than either monks or rangers, so it seems they should be more adept at a triple attack. Will triple attack be a skill that needs to be learned, or will it be based off the double attack skill? <br>Vellvett Shadeau<br>25th lvl dark elf rogue<br>Test</blockquote>I also wanted to address this concern, I've seen it voiced by some rogue players, that rangers and monks are now getting triple attack and they are the only pure melee class without it (warriors already have triple attack).<br><br>Basically, rogues do not need any increase in damage output. Regardless of other considerations, such as being the only one of the three pure melee classes that doesn't get it (and I can see how that might sound unfair). When the final decision needs to be made, comparing the fact that rogues meet and even slightly exceed our desires for their damage output to the worry that they will be the only pure melee without triple attack, game balance must take precedence over appearance. We're certainly not trying to upset rogue players, but the truth is that rogues just don't need triple attack, and we're not willing to raise the bar for all other melee classes just to give it to them.<br><br><blockquote><b>Quote from Absor:<br><br><i>We are going to review casters in much the same way we reviewed melee. Melee is, however, a lot easier to quantify. It's not so easy with casters. Damage output is by no means the only thing that a caster brings to a fight. It's much more complicated to evaluate the effects of debuffs, haste, buffs and even evacs when talking about combat effectiveness. But we certainly have plans to review spell casting.</i><br><br>Quote from Kendrick (from The Safehouse):<br><br><i>Briefly, on the subject of casting classes. They are next, and they are a lot easier to balance out amongst each other and against the melee classes. The bulk of caster changes can be done via content, rather than code, and they WILL receive attention.</i><br><br>So which is it then?<br><br>Draknn Fels, 54 Necromancer, Bristlebane</blockquote></b>I've seen people taking these two comments out of context and trying to make it seem as though Kendrick and I are at odds with each other in some sort of battle of the pod people.<br><br>Kendrick is talking about the difference between how hard it is to change code and how hard it is to change content. To make a lot of the melee changes we've got on Test a programmer or three had to be sacrificed to the volcano to get it all done. Most of what I'm guessing would need to be done to make changes to casters would be things that designers do, like spell and database changes and such. I wouldn't be surprised if we had to make a few programmer voodoo dolls, but the coding changes would probably be less extensive.<br><br>That's 'easier' to a game designer, because the changes will be made by game designers. Programmers are, after all, pod people of a different type and they are hard to understand at times... :)<br><br>I was saying that figuring out what changes need to be made for casters and what form those changes will take will be harder to figure out than just looking at damage numbers and seeing if they are high enough. It seems to me like it will be a more complicated process, since you can't just say that Snare is worth X amount of damage and add that to the Y damage that AC buffs are worth...<br><br>So, and I'm sorry if this disappoints some folks, Kendrick and I actually get along just fine. We talk to each other, and we find ourselves in agreement over complicated issues more often than we disagree. The office here is not a place of name-calling and teeth gnashing. While there is no shortage of debate, it's not chaos here.<br><br>Though there is often a hand slapping when it comes to the Friday morning donut feeding frenzy...<br><br>:)<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Tons of Melee Q&A.. argh!

Why make their fighting ability approximate a warrior's? Shouldn't there be a significant penalty for having more flexibility and options? <br><br>Also, as a warrior, it is already often difficult to keep the attention of the opponent.

So let me try to address those concerns.<br><br>After all of these changes, hybrids will not be able to deal out the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of rangers, who might be able to get close. The warrior, monk and rogue will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin. That difference is in part what hybrids lose for the power of their spells.<br><br>Also, warriors will always have the broadest selection of weapons and armor.<br><br>Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points.<br><br>Their role as primary tank will not be endangered.<br><br>Taunt has come up a lot with players in regard to this. It is not the warrior's job to control all the aggro of the group. It is the group's job to control the aggro of the group. I'm certainly misunderstanding what I'm reading, but I get the impression from the comments that have come in on this issue that warriors want to be able to ensure that the NPC(s) in question never decide to attack anyone but the warrior. Obviously that would make for a silly and boring combat.<br><br>We'll watch these changes play out on Test. We'll see how things go. But right now we have no intention of changing the way that aggro and taunt work now. Think about what we've changed.. we've given a few classes the ability to do more damage, but none of them have surpassed any of the existing damage dealing abilities of other classes. Aggro management may be a little more complicated after these changes, but it shouldn't be any more or less possible than before.</blockquote>Rainboh then stops by to get this bit in:<br><br><blockquote><b><blockquote>"Warriors, Rogues, Monks and Rangers are on the same table.<br>Hybrids are on a separate, weaker table."<br><br>Maybe some of the reason this is confusing is that most people consider Rangers to be a hybrid?<br><br>I've also been meaning to talk to you about adding some code making halfling-cast spells unresistable...<br><br>Rainboh / 30 Druid / Test</blockquote></b>Ok, I see where the confusion is coming from. My bad.<br><br>I'll edit that to read:<br><br>"Warriors, Rogues, Monks and Rangers are on the same table.<br>The other hybrids are on a separate, weaker table."<br><br>And what was that you said? You'd wanted to talk about adding code that made spells that halflings can't resist?<br><br>I'll get right on that.</blockquote>Darkleaf then wonders when Rangers will get the triple attack skill... Absor responds:<br><br><blockquote><b><blockquote>Absor,<br><br>Simple enough request can you please tell the ranger community when it is going to recieve the Triple attack skill? If you have a chance to read the Ranger's Glade Forum you will see that there seems to be a bit of confusion regarding this skill. The general thoughts of the community seem to be from my reading that getting the skill at 60th level seems a day late and a dollar short. If this isnt the case then please clarify and if it is the case consider moving it down to level 55 or 57ish where it can actually be of more use to us in our group desireability. another interesting idea came up from there as well.. the inclusion of a "Lure Jolt" spell at 60th to help offset enraging mobs and the seemingly high resists of mobs in general post 50th<br><br>Thank you<br>Respectfully.<br><br>Darkleaf Nightwanderer</blockquote></b>Rangers and monks will be getting triple attack no sooner and no later than warriors get it.<br><br>As for any spells that might or might not be considered for rangers, we haven't delved all the way into that yet. But I don't predict any sort of unresistable or nearly unresistable Jolt for anyone.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Whew Absor, your on a roll!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Absor</b> stopped by the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_blank">EQ Developer's Corner</a> to clear up some confusion about the proposed changes to the Combat Tables. Read on:<br><br>It seems that a few people are confused about the changes to the combat tables that we are proposing...<br><br><blockquote><b><blockquote>An important question that derives from a confusion I read into your posting on Melee Changes (hoping I can clarify for myself and others here)...<br><br>What the post says is that:<br><br>1 - Pre-50, Warriors and Hybrids share the same table, but Monks have a different table with increased damage output.</blockquote></b>Yes<br><br><blockquote><b>2 - Post-50, Warriors and Hybrids move to the Monk table, and everyone stays on the Monk table.</blockquote></b>No. Currently post 50th level Warriors, Monks, Rogues and Rangers are on the same table. Hybrids are on a separate table (a weaker one). There is currently no 'monk' table post 50 like there is pre-50.<br><br><blockquote><b>3 - This will be changing so that Warriors and Hybrids will STAY on the Melee table, and the Monk table will be improved at higher levels.</b></blockquote>No. This will be changing so that all melees and hybrids use the old Warrior, Monk and Ranger post 50 table, except for Monks who will be on a separate and slightly better table.<br><br><blockquote><b>When I initially read this, it seemed somewhat contradictory. It seemed as if moving everyone back to the Melee table would actually LOWER their performance (since they would no longer be on the "Higher Damage" table).</b></blockquote>I can see how you thought that. But you misunderstood what the original conditions were.<br><br><blockquote><b>However, what is not clear from the message is the way that the skill caps work in relation to this. Tell me if this is a bit closer to the correct interpretation:<br><br>1 - Pre-50 Warriors and Hybrids share the same table, but Monks have a different table with higher damage output. This is combined with the fact that Monks have higher skill caps with weapons and Hand-To-Hand attacks (plus the inherent Monk Haste), puts their overall damage output above Warriors and all other Hybrids. Warriors and Hybrids have comparable skill caps, on the same tables, and are generally similar, except for differences from Dual Wield/Dual Attack abilities and skill caps (which cause Hybrids to generally do less damage, even though they're on the same tables with the same pre-50 skill caps).<br><br>2 - Post-50, Warriors and Hybrids move to the Monk table, and everyone stays on the Monk table. Monks skill caps are only nominally higher than Warriors post-50, but are still a good deal higher than Hybrids. Because these tables were designed with higher Monk skill caps in mind, Hybrids have increasing trouble keeping up with Warriors and Monks on these tables as the gap between skill caps increases.<br><br>3 - This will be changing so that Warriors and Hybrids will STAY on the Melee table, and the Monk table will be improved at higher levels. Because they are on tables more appropriate for their skill levels, the gap between skill caps (on Warriors -vs- Hybrids) should become much less noticable.</b></blockquote>Your number three is pretty much correct, though 1 and 2 are based on a false premise.<br><br>Don't confuse combat tables and skill caps, though. They are not the same thing. Skill caps are one thing, combat tables are another. The combat table does not determine skill caps. It, basically, determines how effective a class is when using that skill cap. <br><br><blockquote><b>I have made a few assumptions here that may or may not be valid. First, I'm assuming that the Melee table (non-Monk), if it were blanket-applied to Warriors and Hybrids post-50, is a much more "solid" damage output, which would potentially put the Warrior and Hybrid damage output in competition with the Monk. My assumption is that this is why the Monk table is being improved...to retain their ability to deal better damage.</b></blockquote>Yes, that's exactly why the Monks will be on a separate and better combat table.<br><br><blockquote><b>I also assumed that the Monk table was designed around a concept of "Higher damage with higher skills, less damage with lower skills", which would have expanded the skill cap gap between Warriors and Hybrids. The assumption being that the Warrior table is more "forgiving" of this (i.e. damage is not quite as dependent on skill level), and will provide a more stable damage output with the lower Warrior/Hybrid skill levels.</blockquote></b>At this point you've lost me...<br><br>Let me summarize that changes again at the end of your post, maybe I can be more clear if I word things differently.<br><br><blockquote><b>Again, my aim here is to try and clear up my confusion with the initial post...not to criticize or speculate. Without a 50+ melee character on Test, I can only wait for the changes to move to Production before I can have a solid opinion .<br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names</b></blockquote>Melee Table Changes review.<br><br><b>Existing setup.</b><br><br>Pre 50:<br><br>All melee and all hybrids are on the same combat tables, except for monks who are on a better table all their own.<br><br>Post 50:<br><br>Warriors, Rogues, Monks and Rangers are on the same table.<br>All other hybrids are on a separate, weaker table.<br><br><b>Proposed changes:</b><br><br>Pre 50:<br><br>No change needed.<br><br>Post 50:<br><br>All melee and hybrid classes moved to the existing post 50 warrior, rogue, monk and ranger table. So all hybrid and melee classes will be on the same combat table (the best of the previously existing tables), except for monks. Monks will be put onto their own table which will be better than the one the others now share.<br><br>Remember, combat tables and skill caps are related, but they are not the same thing. The combat tables basically determine how well a class uses those skill caps.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Whew, Thanks Again Absor!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Absor</b> engaged in a little Q&A session with players over on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_blank">EQ Developer's Corner</a>. Read on:<br><br><blockquote><b><blockquote>Well, I suspect you guys are getting a lot of "Melees are getting better on Test, why can't casters be better too! This isn't fair!" emails, so I thought I'd make the tone of my post a little better.<br><br>Let me start by saying that I think the changes on Test you guys are making are cool...definitely I hope they go live. 2handed slashing is so far overshadowed by the dual wield skill that it's hardly funny, and the way you've rebalanced all the melee's damage outputs sounds like a good call. Awesome job. *insert cynical comment about how it's only because DAoC is coming out shortly here*.</blockquote></b>These changes are not spur of the moment changes. We've had to do some rather in-depth work to be able to make these changes. We wanted to make certain that when we did it we could be confident that the results matched our desires, and that our desires were well considered.<br><br>We're certainly not ignoring Dark Ages of Camelot or any of the other games that are coming up. But we're not working any differently than we always have. I can say that we're honestly impressed with the work that other people are doing. And, sure, that drives us a bit. But our goal has always been to make EverQuest the best game of its type. This change works toward the betterment of the game.<br><br><blockquote><b>That said, I do have one question: Are you also considering increasing caster damage output?</blockquote></b>We are going to review casters in much the same way we reviewed melee. Melee is, however, a lot easier to quantify. It's not so easy with casters. Damage output is by no means the only thing that a caster brings to a fight. It's much more complicated to evaluate the effects of debuffs, haste, buffs and even evacs when talking about combat effectiveness. But we certainly have plans to review spell casting.<br><br><blockquote><b>If the answer is yes, more power to you. Do it in your own time, make sure it works, and thank you in advance.<br><br>If the answer is no, I have to ask: Why not? PLEASE don't tell me "Luclin focus items". Besides the obvious counter that very few people will have them (due to Trivial Loot Code preventing you from killing green mobs for them, and the other mobs that con blue to 55+ characters being camped 24/7...Obviously some will trickle down, but consider melee haste items as a parallel...They stay fairly rare), the fact remains that casters since beta have been based on being gearless. For a long time you've told us that's the price we pay for coming up short behind the melees in end-game power - they can get gear to improve them, while caster gear improvements are fairly limited.</blockquote></b>Well, while casters are less dependent on gear, it's certainly unfair to claim that they are based on being 'gearless'. As for the end-game power, the idea is that nobody should come up short. Gear has to be a consideration when determining what is and what is not enough oomph. The focus of this analysis will indeed consider Shadows of Luclin ideas. We do need to look at the whole game when doing this. We certainly can't make changes in the name of 'balance' and then add items in an expansion that blow that balance into little bits.<br><br><blockquote><b>Fair enough, then. You've increased their power a bit - could we get an increase too, in order to stay in line with them?<br><br>Branar<br>60th Enchanter<br>The Seventh Hammer</blockquote></b>Actually, you have to look carefully at what we've done.<br><br>We have not increased the power of melee classes as a whole.<br><br>We have, using warriors as a sort of measuring bar, brought the melee classes and hybrids in line with each other. Warriors should now be a little more flexible in that they should find more use for two-handed weapons. But they haven't gained the ability to deal more damage.<br><br>What we did was to carefully dissect the damage-dealing ability of all the melee-type classes (for sake of this discussion this includes hybrids) and we determined our goals for them when compared to each other. It was an internal comparison. The combat ability of these classes should now where we want them, relative only to each other.</blockquote>Here Fopoode takes a turn:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><b>Just want to say how positive I'm feeling about recent changes and proposed ones.<br><br>The feign death fix was great and much appreciated. I haven't had chance to check out the TLC quest item drop changes yet, but if this allows higher levels to do more quests for fun and/or faction then this is great also.<br><br>Having read the test patch message the new melee changes seem to have balanced the melee and hybrid classes against each other IMO near perfectly. (well on paper - obviously I haven't had chance to experience them yet) Fixing some long standing issues and make several classes more viable in the highend game. I hope these all go live. </blockquote></b>You bring up something that I wanted to stress (and that we stressed a lot in the Test patch message). THIS IS ONLY ON TEST. Though we've done a lot of internal testing, we want to see these changes work in game a while before we put them live. We may make further changes. We might find that these changes mess everything up and they might not go live at all. Certainly we believe that these changes are well thought out and will be just the thing that is needed. But they are on Test for testing. So please don't assume they are certain to go live.<br><br>We need to be able to use the Test server to test things. The arrival of something on Test is not a promise that it will make it into the game.</blockquote>And here we have Khross, a Level 60 Warder from my home Server, Innoruuk!<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><b>Absor,<br><br>I've just finished reading all of the changes proposed to balance out melee classes and I'm very happy with all of them. However, the defensive change for rangers should be a reverse parity of the offensive increase for the other hybrids. As Paladins and Shadowknights receive 25 points of Offense and corollary weapon skills post 50, Rangers should receive 25 points of defense. I think you will find that changing the increase from 10 to 25 points will both elate your Ranger population and refrain from frustrating or angering any of the other melee classes. After all, Rangers will still be the only non Priest, non Caster class who's defense does not cap at 255.<br><br>Khross<br>Level 60 Warder of Tunare<br>Innoruuk Server</blockquote></b><br><br>The ten point increase meets our desires for the defense of Rangers. I can strongly emphasize that we've taken a lot of time and careful calculation to determine those ten points. This analysis was done without consideration of who might be upset and who might be elated. When options were available for ways to make needed improvements, then we looked at what we thought people would like the most.<br><br>This isn't to say that we don't worry about what people think. But when this examination was done we wanted our decisions to be driven by fact and numbers primarily. When all is said and done, we expect to be very confident that we've done the right thing as far as the balance needed to make the melee classes fit our goals.<br><br>And 25 points of offense is not directly comparable to 25 points of defense. Two different skills, unrelated to each other except for the fact that they involve combat. You can't directly compare them, and it's unfair to assume that they have the same meaning to the ability of a class.<br><br>Keep in mind that the hybrid classes will also receive examination when we review spell casting in the near future.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks Absor, I'm sure well see more questions pretty soon!

Finally, it may be necessary from time to time to execute character and/or equipment wipes in order to maintain the integrity of the test platform.<br><br>September 18th, 6:00pm<br>-------------------------<br><br><b>** Melee changes **</b><br><br>We're wrapping up an extensive look at the way that melee works in EverQuest. These changes are appearing now on Test (in fact, most of them are working as of right now). We wanted to make you aware of these changes in some detail so that you can give us the feedback that we need on them. Please try these changes out and comment on results that you've seen.<br><br>We will be beginning our final analysis on casters in the very near future.<br><br><b>* Melee Tables * </b><br><br>Melee combat is based, at least in part, on tables that determines how each class functions. Up until 50th level melee and hybrid classes are on the same table, with the exception being monks who are on a separate table (one that has them doing more damage). At 50th level warriors, rogues and rangers were all moved to the monk table along with the monk, who did not receive a new separate table.<br><br>The problem here is that post 50th level the disparity between these two tables, combined with lower combat abilities for the hybrids as well as a more restricted selection of weapons acted as a double (almost triple) penalty, making them less effective in combat than was really intended.<br><br>Therefore, all melee and hybrid classes will be basing their combat off the melee table once they reach 51st level. This should increase the combat effectiveness of hybrids noticeably.<br><br>Monks, however, are intended to be somewhat better at dealing out damage in combat than warriors. To slightly improve their combat prowess they will be working from an improved combat table once they reach 55th level and again at 60th level. This will improve the combat ability of monks somewhat, essentially placing them a half a step ahead of everyone else in toe-to-toe combat in the same way that they were prior to 50th level. The rogue will still maintain a margin of superiority when you consider their ability to backstab.<br><br><b>* Two-Handed Weapons *</b><br><br>The effectiveness of these weapons falls slightly below our desire for them. This tends to make those that rely on them most often (shadowknights and paladins) also fall slightly behind our desires for their damage output, at least at levels beyond 50. We'd also like to see a broader range of weapons used by higher level warriors, and it would be nice to see two-handers as a more viable option.<br><br>Therefore, we will be increasing the minimum damage of these weapons for all classes once they reach 50th level. There will be an increase in the minimum damage of two-handed weapons based on the wielder's level and delay of the weapon. The higher level the character and the larger the delay, the bigger the bonus. Obviously we're not going to give out exact numbers, but this should result in a solid increase in damage output when using two-handed weapons.<br><br>We also believe that there has been a bit of disparity between the very high-end one-handed weapons and their counterpart two-handed weapons. The ultra-high end one-handed weapons are comparatively better than their two-handed counterparts. We will, on a case by case basis, be improving many of the high-end two-handed weapons. Because this is essentially a fix for an oversight on our parts, we will be making these changes retroactive (meaning you won't have to trade the items in or hunt for new ones, existing weapons will just change).<br><br><b>* Rangers *</b><br><br>We've also noticed that rangers, while intended to be hit harder in combat than other melee/hybrid classes, are getting hit harder than we planned. Again, this only happens in the 50+ level range. So we will be increasing the defense cap for rangers again slightly to 210 at 60th level. Exactly how these points will be distributed is uncertain, but probably just one point per level after 50. We will also be giving rangers triple attack.<br><br><b>* Monks *</b><br><br>Monks will be getting triple attack. This along with the improvement of their combat tables should place them about where we want them, combat-wise.<br><br><b>* Bards *</b><br><br>Bards are indeed intended to have the least ability to deal damage physically of all the classes we're discussing. However, with their lack of double attack they didn't meet even our intentions for their damage output. We will, therefore, be raising the offense and one-handed weapon caps for bards over 50th level to match that of warriors. This should place their ability to do damage by means of melee within our intended range without making them more effective than the knights at any given level, since double attack is a potent melee skill that bards do not get.<br><br>Obviously we want to see how this all pans out when applied to the game. Feel free to send your comments on the results you see to us through the Developer's Corner on our web site, or contact our staff if you see them on the Test Server.<br><br>It is very important that you understand that these are changes that we are testing. These changes (and any others made on the Test Server) may not be moved to Live Servers. After all, that's the reason we're testing them.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote>Thanks Guys!

We are all players of this great game and for the first time in my experience here I have seen just how powerful this community can be. I will not use real names except my own. <br><br>After that horrible event in New York we were frantic when we learned that he was visiting or going to visit a cousin in tower one. Here in Canada we watched with growing horror all day as people were removed from various locations around the site and transported to area hospitals. With no way to get in touch with anyone there we waited two days to finally get news that was almost credible. We were told by friends there that they had located him at a hospital just outside the city after many phone calls. It turned out not to be him. <br><br>To escape the pain and anguish of continued waiting my fiance escaped to EQ as there was nothing we could do except wait. While on line he explained to on line friends what was happening. Many players apparently live in and around the New York area or have friends there. Those that were unaffected directly started to do what we could not from here. Well thanks to EQ'ers we found our loved one for real and I will forever be grateful. My fiance was even invited down by a player who shall remain nameless who is in law enforcement in the US and was not attached directly to this event. He is there now as I type this. <br><br>Before I say anymore I am so sorry for the thousands that died in this tragedy. Yet I cannot help but feel relief that our loved one was so lucky to survive with livable injury's. I would like to say THANK YOU to all the people on The Rathe server on the Bertoxxulous server and the server that started the search the Ayonae Ro server. You know who you are and I love you all. My heart breaks and my prayers go out to all those affected by this monsterous crime commited on all of us. We lost one family member who will sorely be missed. But thanks to the heroes of that day and EQ players we found and rejoiced in the life of another. <br><br>P.S I have no way of acknowledging all those involved from this game but I just wanted you to know Verant that you have a wonderful and surprisingly generous group of people in your world. Who returned to the real world steadfast and determined who unselfishly went out of their way to help. God Bless. <br><br>Rebecca Post <br>Toronto Canada</blockquote>There are alot of good people out there.

Read on: <br><br><blockquote><blockquote><b>I was just wondering what the difference is between the Trilogy and Everquest: Deluxe Edition that appeared in stores a couple of weeks ago. It appears that it's the exact same thing as the trilogy - limited edition (EQ, RoK, SoV, action figure, map).</blockquote></b>EverQuest Deluxe is the European version that UBI Soft shipped. The difference is our version includes 1) a new user guide, 2) larger figures, and 3) US "code" (i.e. our installer, additional games - Cosmic Rift, etc, movie trailers (Knights tale, Final Fantasy, etc.).<br><br>Alan</blockquote>And Here, Ailuvan Torv has a funny question:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><i>A Limited Edition of the EverQuest Trilogy Collection will also be available which includes all the great features mentioned plus two collectible action figures.</i><b><br><br>How common will the Absor figure be? Can we make a board to trade action figures for?</b></blockquote>There will not be an Absor figure.<br><br>...<br><br>Ok, you can stop cheering now.<br><br>But maybe an Absor dartboard would be a good idea. <br><br>Alan</blockquote>That might be more popular than EQ itself! *grin*
