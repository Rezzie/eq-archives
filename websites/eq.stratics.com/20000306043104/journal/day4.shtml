Yeah, mighty big time range up there, during which I slept twice. :) I spent 6:00 PM to 2:00 AM yesterday catching up on my past exploits and working on Stratics. Once 3:00 AM hit (this is after I'd completed the last entry and proof-read it online, as well as taken some time out to grab a bite, have my hair done and get that French manicure that I've always wanted :), I dove back into the game.
<p>
As you may remember, I left Talonmarc in Qeynos Hills for the night (morning, whatever). Upon logging in, I hopped down form the table I'd been sitting on and headed out of the lone Cottage in the Hills. I was committed to getting Talonmarc up to 4th level before I retired for the evening, and set out for some prey that would help me do just that. I was about a fifth of the way there when I started in on my first Gnoll pup. I also had the occasion to use Lay Hands effectively for the first time--on a failing Wizard named Dormant. From there I just went through the normal stock of monsters in the Hills--killing my first Gray Wolf on my own in the process--until I met up with a Human Ranger named Delphis, who turned out to be Delphaeus, one of the new researchers here at the EQSS. He bid me greetings and informed me that this was a new character that he'd just started, and was almost up to level 2. We decided to group together and head deeper into the hills, with Delphis in the lead, using his Tracking skill. 
<p>
The skill soon came in handy, as we were soon engaged in combat with a variety of creatures,including a Giant Bat and a Giant Rat (both of which proved too difficult for us--I managed to kill the Giant Rat after Delphis had fled, but only after using my only Lay Hands for the day). We traveled back and forth, trying to stick to creatures that wouldn't slaughter us, Delphis dying two or three times in the process. The first death of his was kind of odd... we'd been walking along near the border between North Qeynos and its Hills, when an NPC Necromancer named Tovax Vmar ran from behind a tree and ambushed Delphis. I could only watch in horror as green blobs of energy began engulfing my companion (for some reason the Necromancer did not attack me). One the second of these deadly occasions, I'd just finished slaughtering a Gray Wolf when Delphis returned to retrieve his belongings from the still warm corpse lying nearby. Not thinking, I asked if he'd like to go hunt for some Gray Wolves and Brown Bears, which I thought would be great for a party comprised of a 3rd level Paladin and now 2nd level Ranger.
<p>
Delphis looked into my eyes (remember now that I'm standing over a bloody wolf corpse) and stated quite seriously, "I do not hunt wolves. They are my friends." Whoops, hehe. :) I dropped the subject and we left the scene of the murder. Along the way, we slew a variety of Gnolls (pups and Scouts), along with Fire Beetles (which Delphis used the eyes of in order to cast Night Sight), assorted vermin, and lower animals (it was during this time that I truly realized how different monsters of the same type can be--sometimes I was able to take Gnoll Scouts solo, at others they proved too much for both Delphis and I combined). We agreed that I would keep the loot from the humanoid corpses, and Delphis would keep the body parts that we'd find on the beasts that we'd slain. Eventually we parted ways and I headed back into North Qeynos.
<p>
During this time with Delphis I discovered that Taunt really does have a good use. During combat, I would--not always successfully--attempt to Taunt the creatures into focusing on the beefier Talonmarc as opposed to Delphis. If my skill in Taunting had been greater, I'm sure that I could've saved his life a few times.
<p>
Back in the fields near Qeynos, I ran into another of the EQSS researchers, an important, yet until then out-of-game staff member named Biodine. He was playing a Human Necromancer named Bethos and was accompanied by yet another Human necromancer (they looked like twins) named Taram. They were levels 2 and 4, respectively, and were being followed by two meandering pet Skeletons, the names of which I forget. (Pets within EQ are extremely effective, and these Skeletons helped us greatly in our coming battles.) We quickly agreed to join up and hunt in the Hills.
<p>
These guys didn't have any qualms about hunting Bears and Wolves, so we dug right in. I knew that there was an NPC Druid wandering named Holly Windfield wandering around the Hills, killing those who would do harm to the creatures she was protecting. However, it wouldn't be Holly that would get us--a Ranger friend of hers named Cros Treewind would be the one to do me in. We'd just finished slaying a Gray Wolf when Bethos attacked a big Brown Bear. One of the first Bears we'd taken on had slain Taram, and by now we were no longer being accompanied by a Skeleton entourage. To top it off, I was still healing up from a nasty fight with a wolf a few minutes before, and was sitting down and regaining my HP. Bethos soon began losing the battle and started off towards the Cottage, the bear in hot pursuit. I stood up and started running after the bear, hoping that I could Taunt it into coming after me instead. I don't know if it was the Gray Wolf that I'd slaughtered about ten minutes before or the bear that Bethos had attacked (I had yet to target it, but Bethos <i>was</i> a member of my group), but Cros took that moment to kill me with an "intense gust of wind".
<p>
After retrieving my things and selling off some loot at the Cottage, I met Bethos at its front door and waited for  him to re-memorize his spells (currently, upon each death magic users must re-meorize all of the spells that they have in their spellbooks). At this point--for what I reason I know not--Gray Wolves just kept attacking Bethos. I'd say he died at least 5 or 6 times in a row (many times on his way back to loot hi own corpse). Apparently a Necromancer with no spells truly is a "Master of the Dead". :)
<p>
After night fell for the second time this play session, Bethos bid me farewell. I decided to venture back into Qeynos and fully explore the city. Qeynos is extremely large when you first enter the game, but tones down in size a tad after you've been playing for a while. I wandered around South Qeynos for about an hour, in the process taking the Barbarian Krandall's advice and learning how to fish. I headed to the docks and bought a fishing pole and bait from the harbormaster. The fishing pole cost me couple of silver and the bait 3 copper apiece. Fishing was a slow process, yielding a fresh fish only every 5 casts or so. Most of the time, your bait remains intact even after catching nothing, but occasionally it does get lost after falling off of your line. I returned to the harbormaster and sold the 3 fresh fish and the one fish scales (don't ask) that I'd cost. He offered 2 silver for each fish and 8 copper per scales. as you can see, the profit was there, but was far too measly and boring to come by. I decided that fishing was only good for something to do while waiting for a ship.
<p>
This I did. I waited on the long pier out of South Qeynos for the ferry to show, casting my line a few times in the process (the game informed me that I'd spilled my beer while bringing in my line a few times, but I didn't mind :). The ship arrived after about 10 minutes and I boarded for Erud's Crossing (the straight of ocean that separates the isle of Erudin from the main continent).
<p>
I decided to get off at the cat island that lay between Erudin and Qeynos, thinking that I could, now that my level had been upped a couple of times, take some of the monsters that were sure to spawn there. Turns out the only monster I could take was the Kerra Isle Beetle (so that's the name o that island), a diminutive cousin of the mainland Fire Beetle. I circled the Isle, avoiding flocks of Giant Bats and solitary Drown Zombies and exploring the sunken ship just off of shore. I then headed back to the cat-people village to wait for the ferry once more.
<p>
I soon arrived in Erudin, and boarded the floating stone pier that would take me to the city. So far my opinion of Erudin was low--the people there were haughty and, after the initial spectacle of its marble walls wears off, the city is really quite boring (or so I thought). I explored the city a bit more fully than the last time, using the blue teleporters to warp form place to place. I even climbed the exterior of the mountain upon which Erudin Palace site--hopping form ledge to ledge--but was unable find an exterior entrance to the huge, cylindrical structure. I eventually did find my way in, however, using the teleporters inside of the city.
<p>
This place seemed as boring as the rest of the city... all I could find were jewelry shops, stairways leading to NPC-filled rooms, a green art-deco statue that I almost got trapped in (it's composed of a tangle of stone shafts), and a cluster of jail cells containing a Gnomish Rogue NPC begging for me to let him out, and gaggles of guards ("Erudin Sentries", I should say) boasting about how crime-free their city was.
<p>
At the top of one of the aforementioned staircases, I encountered another player named Eudan. Thinking that there <i>had</i> to be something interesting around Erudin, I asked the Erudite as much. The level 7 Enchanter told me that a forest lay outside of the city and agreed to guide me there.
<p>
We reached the hidden glade through a series of caverns beneath the Palace. The woods were filled with huge trees that stretched into the sky and almost unbreakable mists. Gazing out over the forest, Eudan informed me that many of the creatures here yielded fabulous loot, and that the Kobolds were particularly fruitful to hunt. I bid Eudin thanks and farewell, and ventured off of the marble entranceway to the caverns, and into Toxxulia Forest.
<p>
Within that darkened valley I encountered many new monsters, including Moss and Thicket Snakes; Skunks--one of which covered me with its rank musk--Infected Rats, which, sho' nuff, infected me with Lesser Plague Rat Disease (I'd been diseased before, which is no biggie, as these infections wear off after about five minutes real time); Widow Hatchling, which were quite a challenge, due to their Poisonous bite; Spider hatchlings, which looked like wolf spiders; Decaying Skeletons (one of which was called "JiberJaber"); and Kobold runts. The Runts were by far the most plentiful, and there were more than enough to go around among the 8 or so players there in the Forest. They were along the same line of difficulty as the Gnoll pups in Qeynos, but yielded up to 2 silver apiece.
<p>
At one point, as I was killing my first and only Skunk, an NPC named Poacher Hill ran up to me and started attacking both the Skunk and me (apparently I'd gone after his game). The NPC wasn't ultra-powerful, but I didn't want to have to use my only Lay Hands in  battle with an opponent that the /consider command informed was "quite a gamble". I ran back into the caverns in order to recuperate a bit and made a run for the border (went out and got some Taco Bell :) before heading out and hunting for about an hour or so more.
<p>
I was soon nearly to level 4, and gaining XP at a fairly constant rate. The process was still slow-going, and level 4 was always a few steps out of reach. I was insanely curious about what was on the other side of the bridge, so made an unsuccessful offer to group with a similarly-leveled Erudite named Shonuf, who was at first jabbering at me in Ancient Erudin (the native tongue of the Erud people). I knew that whatever lie beyond would be too much to handle alone, and, besides, I hadn't even found the damn thing yet. :) My prayers were soon answered when I was contacted by a Half Elven Ranger named Laoldar. He was also on his way to level 4, and being a perfect match, we decided to meet up and cross the bridge.
<p>
Laoldar tracked me to my location--not far from a circular group of Stonhenge-esque trilithons (standing stones; two vertical and one horizontal)--and led me to the bridge, which was constructed of marble and supported by huge, angular struts. I'd heard that NPC Necromancers, full-fledged Kobold villages, and creatures named Watchers awaited us on the opposite side of the stone causeway, and I braced myself for the challenge. I was so close to level 4 that I could feel the taste of it burning in my mouth... I was sure that one or two more creatures and the goal would be mine.
<p>
After crossing the bridge we came across a cluster of huts built form wood and animal skins: a Kobold camp. We soon encountered our first Kobold Scout after cresting the hill upon which the ramshackle shelters had been erected. I swung back my arm to strike and... Laoldar blinked out of existence. I looked down at the packet-loss reading on my lag meter: <i>54%... 56%... 60%...</i> Crap. I soon lost connection with the server, at which point the client froze up on me. I rebooted and attempted to login. I did so successfully, but was hit by the downward spiral of increasing packet-loss immediately upon entering Norrath. The Scout was gone and all of my equipment was still on my body. I quickly sat Talonmarc down and camped, which would log him out after 30 seconds. I later found out from Laoldar later informed me that he'd continued to play fine (he'd read about Talonmarc in this Journal, so knew who I was), so I'm not sure of exactly what caused my unwanted time-out.
<p>
After abandoning hope (this was around 11:00 AM an I'd been up all night), I decided to get some Z's and log back in tonight, which I'll do after some more updates to the EQSS. After hitting 4, I hope to make another attempt at crossing through Highpass and making my way into Freeport. Gorthaur tells me that the Froglocs (whatever the hell those are :), which lie beyond the Oasis of Marr, are great for some good coin. I'm also supposed to meet up with Tassader soon and adventure around Qeynos... maybe we can join up with a nice fellow named Asgeir, who e-mailed me this morning with news of dangerous caves beyond Surefall Glade and a quest involving Gnoll teeth. I've also been hearing a lot about Blackburrow--a land supposedly filled with Gnolls and their camps. I smell adventure!
