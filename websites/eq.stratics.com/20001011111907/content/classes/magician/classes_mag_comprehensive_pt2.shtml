                    the Playing Field With our combat roles established, we now 
                    have the building blocks (or tactics) to develop our hunting 
                    strategies. Our strategies, however, will be situation specific 
                    so we need to start by understanding the parameters we will 
                    use to define our specific situations. Most all combat situations 
                    in EverQuest can be defined by three parameters: </font> </p>

                    This is the primary set of parameters that will define our 
                    situations and can be expressed by three factors:</font> </p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Your 
                    level in the game</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                    factor will determine how limited you are in approaching a 
                    situation. Early in the game (up through level 12) you can 
                    effectively tank and deal damage to a mob. You hit hard enough 
                    and often enough to do significant damage and can still absorb 
                    the damage a mob can dish out. In effect, you can still have 
                    melee (magi warrior) as a legitimate role to play. The loss 
                    of melee ability in later levels, though, is made up by your 
                    receiving more powerful spells. At mid levels you are able 
                    to cast direct damage spells in excess of 150 hit points damage. 
                    You will trade your melee for spell damage (and your roles 
                    must adjust).</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Your 
                    level relative to the mob</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                    factor is routinely determined by what color the text is in 
                    response to your considering the mob. There are four results 
                    we will work with for our strategies: green, blue, black/yellow, 
                    and red. This factor affects your ability to deal damage to 
                    the mob at your current level. As you move up from green to 
                    red, you will miss the mob more, your spells will be resisted 
                    more, the mob will hit you more, and the mob will hit you 
                    harder. This makes situations involving black and yellow mobs 
                    significantly more dangerous than ones involving blue (or 
                    green) mobs. This factor will play a primary role in our strategies.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Your 
                    pet's level relative to the level of his spell</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    While you increase in level and your power relative to a specific 
                    mob changes (you get relatively more powerful since the mob's 
                    level stays the same), your pet will always be within two 
                    levels of the spell used to cast it. So with a level 12 pet 
                    spell the pet can be 10 to 14. We should think about pets 
                    relative to where they are in the four level cycle between 
                    new pet spells. So at the first level of a new pet spell (i.e., 
                    12, 16, 20, etc.) pets are very powerful and can con yellow 
                    or black to you (the likelihood of this happening decreases 
                    as you progress to higher levels. At level 16 I still got 
                    yellow pets and at level 20 I still could get black pets). 
                    At the second level of a pet spell (i.e., 13, 17, etc.) you 
                    have progressed and your pet is still casting around his spell 
                    level so those yellow pets at level I are now black to you 
                    at level II. This effect continues up to level IV right before 
                    you get your new spells (which I'll refer to as hell level).</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                    factor is the primary determinant on your ability to take 
                    on mobs that are yellow or black to you. It is amazing to 
                    watch a yellow pet rip into a blue mob. The mob cannot hit 
                    the pet and the pet deals damage at an amazing rate. As soon 
                    as you turn it around, however, a yellow mob will knock your 
                    blue pet around in short order if you are not using the right 
                    tactics. The higher your absolute level, the more important 
                    you pet becomes and the more this factor defines a specific 
                    situation. </font> </p>

                    ability of the specific mob</font></b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not 
                    all mobs are created equal. When mobs are conning blue to 
                    you these special abilities really are less important. When 
                    a mob cons black or yellow to you, however, the mob's special 
                    abilities become a factor in determining the situation. A 
                    mob's special abilities can be broken down into three categories: 
                    </font> </p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ability 
                    to inflict extra damage</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    This ability usually comes out in non-direct damage. Snakes 
                    can poison you. The poison from a yellow Asp can be very deadly 
                    to you. Some mobs can give you diseases. So even if you kill 
                    it, the disease may still kill you. Other mobs can stun you 
                    and allow them to hit you for extra rounds. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ability 
                    to resist your attacks</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Some mobs are very resistant to your attacks. Mobs such as 
                    ghouls that are very resistant to magic can nullify your big 
                    direct damage spells. Some mobs require you to use a magic 
                    weapon to damage them. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ability 
                    to take large amounts of damage (toughness)</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Not all mobs are created equally tough even if they con the 
                    same color. Some are just inherently tougher than others. 
                    Mobs you fight in your mid levels tend to fall into four very 
                    broad categories: </font> </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Casters</b> 
                      When taken alone these are the weakest of the mobs. There 
                      strength, like yours, is in their spells and in their ability 
                      to thrive in a group. I was able to defeat many yellow casters 
                      even in my hell level (albeit at the cost of most all of 
                      my mana). The key will be playing to their weakness. You 
                      must avoid getting close enough to let them root you (they 
                      do still hit very hard) or use other spells on you. Maintaining 
                      your mobility around them is important. </font></li>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Animals</b> 
                      These are the next toughness group. Animals tend to be defined 
                      as things you might actually see on a nature program (but 
                      not always): elephants, gators, snakes, bears, wolves, mammoths, 
                      spiders, bats, rats, etc. These mobs tend to lack on the 
                      intelligence side and are not that hard to defeat. They 
                      can, however, dish out and take a lot of punishment relative 
                      to their level. </font></li>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Warriors</b> 
                      These come in a variety of types, many with the label warrior 
                      attached to them. They tend to hit very hard relative to 
                      their level and can take a lot of damage. My most common 
                      problem with yellow warriors later in the spell cycle was 
                      just running out of mana before I could bring them down. 
                      My pet would soon follow the mana down and I would be stuck 
                      trying to zone. Most intelligent races have warriors (orcs, 
                      aviaks, centaurs, gnolls, lizard men, etc.) </font></li>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Undead</b> 
                      These guys are a special case. They combine many of the 
                      characteristics of the other groups. Many can cast (dry 
                      bones skeleton), they tend to resist spells (ghouls, dry 
                      bones skeleton), they can dish out damage, take it like 
                      a warrior, and can also disease you for extra damage. They 
                      likely fall between animals and warriors in toughness (decaying 
                      skeleton excepted). </font>

                    Fighting one mob versus two or three will involve different 
                    tactics. The risk of your losing the engagement goes up dramatically 
                    as more mobs enter the combat. As mentioned earlier, you have 
                    no real crowd control spells. You must rely on your pet and 
                    some artillery type direct damage to control the situation.

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    We can now put these parameters together to define what we 
                    mean by a combat situation. We will use the level of the mob 
                    relative to your level (i.e., green, blue, etc.) and the four 
                    level cycle around your pet's spells as our primary parameters. 
                    Using these two factors quickly cuts down the number of situations 
                    we should address and provide an easy framework for identifying 
                    what situation you are working in. You can always con a mob 
                    to see its level and using the four level cycle we do not 
                    have to develop strategies at each individual level. So a 
                    situation example may be, a blue mob when you are in the first 
                    level of your spell cycle (level 8, 12, 16, 20, etc.). </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next 
                    we can layer in the other parameters. The specific abilities 
                    of the Mobs should limit how deep into the cycle we apply 
                    one of our strategies. So we will be able to define a strategy 
                    for attacking yellows in level I of the cycle that applies 
                    to all mobs; but the same strategy should be limited to less 
                    tough Mobs as you move to level II, III, and IV of the cycle. 
                    We will also develop a specific strategy for attacking mobs 
                    that are highly resistant to attack and lay out which situations 
                    the strategy can be used in. There is also a specific strategy 
                    for dealing with multiple mobs, and we will limit which situations 
                    we should use it in. Lastly, your level in the game will determine 
                    how long you can use Magi Warrior as a specific role or tactic.

                    We now have all the elements to build our hunting strategies. 
                    Our goal is to understand where we are in the spell cycle 
                    and determine what we want to attack and develop a strategy 
                    to go get it. We do not want to be reactive and just take 
                    what attacks us. We want to proactively determine what we 
                    want kill and become the hunter. <br>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Description</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                    should be your primary hunting strategy at most levels. While 
                    yellows and blacks are good experience, they can be tough 
                    to find. There are many places to kill blues in abundance 
                    and taking down several quickly can build your experience 
                    faster than finding yellows and taking the downtime that comes 
                    after the battle. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    idea here is to kill a series of blues with minimal effort 
                    from the magician and very short downtime between the battles. 
                    You should be able be able to move from one blue to the next 
                    to get the maximum experience from this strategy. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Roles</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Your primary role here is as a pet cleric. The pet should 
                    tank and do most of the damage. Pull the Mob with a low level 
                    spell (little mana used) to draw it to a safe place. Your 
                    pet should be buffed and damage shielded to ensure it does 
                    the maximum damage. Once the battle starts sit down and meditate 
                    (you did chose a safe pull point, right?). Monitor the mob 
                    in the status bar and use pet report health (hot key it) to 
                    check on your pet. Let your pet go to about to 70% on his 
                    health and stand up and heal. Sit down and med. At 50% heal 
                    again. In general with a single blue mob in these levels that 
                    should be close to enough. If you get down to 40%, switch 
                    to wizard for the day and at 20% pet health switch to pet 
                    band-aid. <br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    key here is you can minimize downtime because you should rarely 
                    need more that one heal, and you recapture your mana during 
                    the fight. Your healing should also not draw the mob onto 
                    you and cause you to lose hit points. The spells you are casting 
                    are not resisted and if you keep up your alteration ability 
                    up, your heal spell doesn't fizzle much (no wasted mana). 
                    Your mana regenerates much faster than your hit points when 
                    you meditate so by avoiding direct melee contact with the 
                    mob you reduce overall downtime. Your pet can regenerate while 
                    you are looking for other Mobs, and you have very little downtime 
                    between engagements.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Levels 
                    </b> </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                    approach works great in the first three spell cycle levels. 
                    In the II level you may tend to use more than one heal and 
                    at level III you may have to shift to the wizard role. The 
                    type of mob here is less important. Fighting blues your pet 
                    does well and with a little help from you can easily win out.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Pet 
                    choice</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
                    this strategy the water pet works the best. It hits for good 
                    damage and its ice spell also does damage. These two in combination 
                    can bring a mob down fast. It regenerates very quickly so 
                    you spend little time while it heals and your heal spells 
                    only add to its quick regeneration. Its agility also means 
                    that it gets hit less so it will need fewer heals to stay 
                    in the battle. It has fewer hit points than the earth pet 
                    but should not need the hit points while fighting blues. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                    should, however, spend some reagent to cast a good pet. Early 
                    in the cycle a yellow or black pet will do and later in the 
                    cycle a black or high blue pet will do. I was getting yellow 
                    pets in the first cycle when I was a level 16, at 20 a black 
                    or blue was the best I could do. The difference in level really 
                    makes an impact in how quickly your pet can take the Mob down 
                    and how much downtime you or you pet needs to spend after 
                    the battle. You end up having to heal less and the pet takes 
                    fewer hits. </font> </p>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    The reality is that magician is one of the few classes that 
                    can consistently take on yellows solo and win. Yellows and 
                    blacks give great experience and you should not turn down 
                    an opportunity to take one on when it is appropriate. This 
                    power-nailing strategy should supplement your chain killing 
                    blues in the early part of your spell cycle. As you are hunting 
                    blues you should know which yellows and blacks are in the 
                    area and actively look for them between the blues. Do not 
                    use this as your primary strategy unless there is a very ready 
                    supply of appropriate yellows and blacks. It will take too 
                    long to hunt them when there are plenty of blues around to 
                    challenge you.</font></p>
                  <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roles 
                    </font></b></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pulling 
                    is significantly more important when dealing with yellows 
                    and blacks. With the blues an unwelcome additional blue is 
                    not normally a major issue. You really cannot, however, handle 
                    more than one yellow/black at a time. So choosing a safe pull 
                    spot is very important. Find a place off the main track and 
                    only pull when your target is not going to run across several 
                    of his buddies to get to you. Mobs that are high aggro types 
                    (aviaks, centaurs, orcs, goblins, etc) require careful attention 
                    to allow you to pull only one at a time. <br>
                    There are two primary strategies here based on the type of 
                    pet you like to play: cleric heavy and wizard heavy. Both 
                    work fine and are really more a matter of your own style of 
                    play. Both require you to make sure your pet is buffed with 
                    both burnout and damage shield spells and you should have 
                    on your phantom armor. </font> </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cleric 
                      heavy</b> This is the strategy to use if you are using a 
                      water pet. You want to control the Mobs tendency to aggro 
                      on you. The yellows and blacks usually hit hard relative 
                      to you and can bring down your hit points quickly. The cleric-heavy 
                      strategy makes use of the pet cleric role to minimize the 
                      aggro factor. 
                      <p>Ensure you have only pulled one mob. Then put your pet's 
                        health in the status bar. The yellows can hit hard enough 
                        that you want to monitor your pet's health. When your 
                        pet gets to 80% health, start your first heal. You need 
                        to start soon because of the delay in casting the heal 
                        spell. Cast your second heal when your pet is around 70% 
                        and your third at 60%. This method will usually result 
                        in your casting three heals pretty quickly. Do not fall 
                        behind in the damage but adjust your casting based on 
                        how fast your pet is losing his health. The water pet's 
                        quick regeneration and agility will really help out here 
                        and since it cast a damage spell the mob will start to 
                        lose hit points quickly. 
                      <p>At 50% to 60% pet health, hit the F8 key and look at 
                        the mob's health. If your pet is well ahead of the mob 
                        keep healing. If you are even or behind, you should switch 
                        to the Wizard role. The positive is that your pet has 
                        done all the damage up to this point so you can cast several 
                        damage spells before the mob will want you. Stand back 
                        and hit the mob with your best damage spell several times. 
                        You should keep the mob in the status window and use pet 
                        report health to check your progress. No matter how things 
                        are going you should switch to the wizard role when your 
                        pet's health hits 40% (there is no objective to reduce 
                        downtime here, use all the mana you need to survive). 
                      <p>At 20% you should jump in and switch to pet band-aid. 
                        You need to take some hits to give your pet time to do 
                        more damage. Do not lose your pet. Once your health gets 
                        to two bubbles back away and let your pet step back in. 
                        If the mob has more than a sliver of health left, then 
                        you should run. Get some distance between you and the 
                        mob. If you can zone, fine; otherwise, stop a safe distance 
                        away and gate.

                      heavy</b> This is the strategy to use if you like using 
                      the earth pet. We are not as concerned about the mob aggro 
                      factor since the earth pet will constantly cast root to 
                      keep it away from you. So start with the wizard role. As 
                      soon as the pet roots, start blasting with your best direct 
                      damage spell. Even with your blasting the earth pet is still 
                      going to get hit a lot as it taunts (make sure the damage 
                      shield is on and the mob will pay). Keep the mob in the 
                      status window and do pet report health (hot keyed) after 
                      every second cast. Judge how your pet is doing versus the 
                      mob. 
                      <p>At 20% pet health you should jump in and switch roles 
                        to pet band-aid and stay there until you are at two bubbles 
                        of health. At two bubbles take the same action as above.

                    of mob and level will make a big difference here. It is at 
                    the yellow and black levels that the differences in the mobs 
                    start to really show up. In the level I spell cycle you can 
                    handle most yellows of all types. This is not always true, 
                    so ensure that you are ready to run the first time you engage 
                    a new mob. In the level II spell cycle yellow warriors become 
                    more difficult and should be avoided or approached cautiously. 
                    In the level III cycle you can likely handle casters and potentially 
                    animals; the undead are questionable. In level IV cycle, casters 
                    are really all you can handle at yellow. You should bring 
                    them down quickly. Use the wizard heavy style with a water 
                    pet instead of earth. The danger in attacking casters is not 
                    the hits, but the spells. Water pets will take them down faster 
                    (damage spell) and hit more frequently to interrupt the casting.</font></p>

                    One of the bigger balancing issues is that magi do not have 
                    real crowd control spells. We have no harmony, lull, root, 
                    snare, clinging darkness, or fear. Our crowd control is our 
                    direct damage spells. We take down a single mob fast so that 
                    he does not have time to get to a buddy or help out a friend. 
                    That said, we can take on more than one mob at a time. I find 
                    that in the right situation, two blues are very well within 
                    our capabilities. </font></p>

                    ten and happened to be away from the keyboard when it they 
                    did it. I believe you and I think that was fabulous. My experience 
                    and comfort level is that two blues in a controlled situation 
                    is enough of a challenge. I have taken down three blues before 
                    myself, but I had a clear escape route to the zone right next 
                    to me so I could hang in to the end. So adjust the number 
                    to your risk tolerance, but I will write this for two blues.

                    need to understand the idea of a controlled situation. This 
                    is a situation where you chose from the beginning to engage 
                    multiple mobs and plan around it. Often an uninvited mob will 
                    show up while you are taking on a single blue and you must 
                    decide if you can take down the first one fast enough to engage

                    that you can visit and several non-campsites that have a couple 
                    of mobs together you can handle. Since these sites usually 
                    spawn very regularly, they can provide a steady stream of 
                    blues for you to chain kill. The mobs that hang out in camp 
                    situations also tend to be social and help each other. </font></p>

                    is tough in this situation. Most camps are at least three 
                    so you need to stagger the spawn. You want to kill one or 
                    two of the mobs at a time where you can engage the remaining 
                    mob after you have healed. The spawn will then move to a group 
                    of two then one or three singles (the ideal). Here are some 
                    situations you can look for that will let you pull safely:

                      blues and a green</b> Often the green will not come for

                      blues on you, which you should be able to handle. If the 
                      green comes also you can wait a second and see how you are 
                      doing, then gate or run if you have to. </font></li>

                      is off by itself. Pull the one and start with him. Wait 
                      and heal and take on the next two. You then get the stagger.

                      read this article, and tried to take on all three. He got 
                      one and then died. The bottom line is that there are only 
                      two and you can handle that. Pull them, but get far enough 
                      away that if the other one respawns you will not have him 
                      join. </font></li>

                    other situations you will likely need help. Ask a druid for 
                    Harmony help or find someone that wants to help break the 
                    spawn. If you are desperate and bound close by, pull all three 
                    and let your pet take out one, gate and return for the other 
                    two. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
                    only two mobs pulled, start as a pet cleric. You do not want 
                    to aggro the mobs too soon. Stay at max distance and the pet 
                    can usually taunt and keep the mobs attention. Make sure you 
                    put the fire shield on, as your pet will be hit a lot. Heal 
                    to keep up as best you can. When your pet gets down to around 
                    50% health, target a mob and cast column of fire. It is one 
                    of the best area spells in the game. It has a tight radius 
                    and does not tend to haul in other uninvited mobs like a rain 
                    spell does. I know that targeting the mob is not conventional 
                    wisdom (you should target the pet). The problem is that column 
                    of fire is so tight that if you cast it on your pet many times 
                    you will not hit either of the mobs or just one of them. The 
                    mobs, however, tend to group on top of each other when they 
                    attack and if you target one of them you usually hit both 
                    of them. You want to hit both, and one of them is going to 
                    jump on you no matter what you do, so make sure the column 
                    hits for maximum damage. Use the assist key to see which one 
                    your pet is targeting and shift to wizard. You want to hit 
                    the pet's target with one or two damage spells to hasten its 
                    demise and free your pet to help you. You can time the spells 
                    with the mob hitting you just like it was single combat. If 
                    you cannot kill the mob on those two casts run right at your 
                    pet and see if your mob will stick to the pet. If so, wizard 
                    your pet's mob one more time, then shift to pet band-aid and 
                    take it on the chin until your pet can free up to help you. 
                    You can usually do some damage to a blue at these levels if 
                    you have kept up your melee skills. At this point you are 
                    committed. It is hard to escape with a mob beating you. Let 
                    your pet finish his prey and take your mob back from you. 
                    If you have mana left, shift to wizard and try to burn it 
                    down. Otherwise get in there and alternate beats with your 
                    pet. </font> </p>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    This strategy works on blues in the first two spell cycles. 
                    By the third level your pet has a much harder time keeping 
                    up with blues. You can do it but you need the best pet possible. 
                    Casters present a special problem. They can stand back and 
                    heal the warrior mob or cast spells on you. You need to take 
                    the caster down first. </font></p>

                    The earth pet works best here. Its root spell can hold one 
                    of the mobs in place and let you only deal with one mob personally. 
                    The fire shield on the pet causes damage to both mobs as they 
                    initially hit him. The hit points of the earth pet give you 
                    some time to work with. The higher the pet's level, the more 
                    effective this strategy is for the player. A yellow pet on 
                    a blue mob will make short work on the mob (it may be able 
                    to engage both before you have to switch out of cleric role). 
                    As you move up in the spell cycle the high level pet is more 
                    important. When you are only tossing a blue "kind of dangerous" 
                    pet against multiple blue mobs, you are pushing the limits.

                    on some greens and get revenge for when they use to kick your

                    cleared the level. I was able to take on the cloverleaf room

                    go for several PP on the open market and more than a PP to

                    on four or five greens at a time at these levels.</font></p>

                    clear a room. The other greens in the area will not usually 
                    bother you unless they are in close proximity. There is much 
                    less of a chance that you will attract a group. You can usually 
                    cleric a green without having to even do a heal. With a damage 
                    shield on the pet and Burnout going the pet will cut down 
                    the mobs. You can heal the pet when he starts to get down 
                    around 50% or so between the engagements. It will take many 
                    greens (when done one at a time) to get your pet that far

                    you do have to take on more that one green, you should stick 
                    with the cleric role as long as possible. Sooner or later 
                    one of the mobs will slip by the pet and come to you (no crowd 
                    control remember). Switch to magi warrior (you can tank a 
                    green) and engage the mob. Do not let him run. Keep an eye 
                    on your pet (pet report health) but handle your mob. If you 
                    start to draw a crowd, move closer to your pet and use assist 
                    to quickly bring down his mob and move the two of you to the 
                    next one. If a caster shows up, it is your responsibility 
                    to go get it. If you are doing this right, there will be few 
                    if any blues in the area. So you should be able to use your 
                    melee skills to full advantage. The problem arises once the 
                    greens start hitting you. It is hard to get a spell off. It 
                    also does not pay to start off as a wizard. You will just 
                    draw the mobs to you too soon. Once engaged, the magi warrior 
                    role allows you to use spells as best you can.</font></p>

                    This strategy works best with an earth pet. The earth pet's 
                    root spell lets you engage the greens one at a time and prevents 
                    them from running. Its high hit points allow it to defend 
                    you if a rare blue or black shows up. Its lack of agility 
                    lets you maximize the effect of the damage shield against 
                    multiple greens. The fire pet can also work because of its 
                    high damage and built in fire shield. The fire pet, however, 
                    can only stop a runner with a kill from its damage spell and 
                    its low hit points will not help you against a blue or black 
                    in the area. Also against multiple greens the fire pet's damage 
                    may not hold up as well, leaving you stranded with several 
                    greens to take on. A good blue pet is fine here. Yellow or 
                    black is great but not needed (save the malachite). </font>

                    two equals in downing the mob. Any of the above strategies

                    You can switch roles to wizard and wait for your pet to get 
                    down to 45% and open up with direct damage spells. If your

                    you should gate. Obviously this is a judgment call. If the

                    can use it on yellows but they hit hard and your difference

                    I prefer the water pet because of his ice spell. He is casting 
                    damage while I am hitting. No need to root here, so the earth

                    We discussed in the previous section that many mobs have special 
                    abilities. The most common is high resistance to magic, magic 
                    creature (need magic weapon to hit) or poison. These are areas 
                    we need to address with a specific strategy. These types of 
                    mobs are perfect for a magician. Other characters will usually 
                    stay away from them and they are in abundance in many places. 
                    Asps, for instance, have strong poison and will take a normal 
                    character down. Ghouls have a high resistance to magic that 
                    makes casting on them less effective. <br>
                    When the mob is blue to you the effect is not as noticeable 
                    (unless you have to have a magic weapon to hit it). At yellow 
                    and black they deserve a special look to ensure you do not 
                    run out of mana before you even scratch them. So let's look 
                    at what we can do to take on these mobs. </font></p>

                    These situations usually require us to be a pet cleric starting 
                    out. The pet cleric cannot be resisted. With a good damage 
                    shield and his magic attack, our pet can take on these mobs. 
                    Your pet's attack is considered magic when your pet is beyond 
                    level 10. So he can go after mobs that others need magic weapons 
                    for. Remember that your summoned weapons count as magic, so 
                    you can also get hits. Heal your pet until he is down to 50% 
                    or so. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drop 
                    in a direct damage spell or two. They will hit for less than 
                    they should but still add some damage. At 40% jump in and 
                    change to pet band-aid. You have a magic weapon so you can 
                    do some damage. Your pet will need some extra time here to 
                    kill the mob so your jumping in at 40% is needed versus the 
                    later time we use in other strategies. Trade beats until you 
                    are at your two bubbles and back away. Evaluate the mob's 
                    status versus you and your pet and determine if you need to 
                    run to a safe distance to zone or gate. <br>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                    normally want to keep your distance from these Mobs if they 
                    can cause disease or have poison. In those cases, do not jump 
                    in to be the pet band-aid until your pet is at 20% or so. 
                    You need to minimize your exposure to the extra damage from 
                    the mob. Try to avoid the Mob that got your pet to 20% until 
                    it is black or blue to you. <br>

                    Mobs are a special case. Their special ability is a resistance 
                    to fire spells and being a magic creature (need a magic weapon 
                    to hit). You, however, get ward summoned at a low level and 
                    can cast magic weapons. You can apply the tactics above. When 
                    you drop in your damage spells use ward summoned to hit the 
                    elementals. </font></p>

                    without the special resistance. </font></p>

                    The water pet works well here. It is the only pet immune to 
                    poison, and it seems to handle disease well. It can get in 
                    and mix it up. The ice spell is additional damage and since 
                    you are not really going to add damage with your spells, the 
                    earth pet's root is not as useful as in other situations. 
                    You need to cast a good pet here. You are relying on the pet's 
                    melee skills to carry the day and those are best when there

                    attacks on yellows and blacks very risky. Even the blue mobs 
                    can be tough. You really cannot chain kill because your downtime

                    to resist most of your direct damage spells. You cannot, then, 
                    expect to attack a deep red and win. The deep red is one that 
                    is many levels above you. You want light or shallow reds.

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Roles</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
                    mobs will resist most of your direct damage spells so save 
                    the mana. Start out as a pet cleric and immediately start 
                    healing. The pet cleric also is the role that cannot be resisted. 
                    The fire shield hits for non-melee damage each time the pet 
                    is hit and the heal spells cannot be resisted. You are not 
                    casting on the mob so there is less of a chance for him to 
                    aggro on you. Keep the healing up as fast as you can until 
                    your pet gets to 50%. At that point you have to make a decision. 
                    If you are ahead of the mob, keep it up and make a check at 
                    30%. If you are way behind, run, put some distance between 
                    you and the mob, and gate or zone. If your are somewhat behind 
                    at 50% get ready to chain cast a pet. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    In chain casting pets we will have a new pet up and running 
                    just at the old one dies. Have your pet spell memorized before 
                    you start (put it in one of the old direct damage slots). 
                    At 50% have" /pet get lost" typed into the dialog box but 
                    do not hit return. At 30% start casting your new pet. As the 
                    new pet is about 10% from being born hit return and kill the 
                    old pet. The new one will appear and tell it to attack the 
                    mob. Cast fire shield and heal it (not sure burnout is worth 
                    it for the short time the pet is around). You must watch your 
                    mana. You may be able to squeeze out three pets. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    When you have cast your last pet, step in and take some beats, 
                    pet band-aid, to try to extend the pet's life. At two bubbles 
                    of your hit points left, run. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Level</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    This really only works at level I in the spell cycle. Others 
                    may have had success later in the cycle, but level I is my 
                    risk tolerance. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Pet</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    You absolutely need the best pet possible at the beginning 
                    of the engagement. Up to level 16 it should be a yellow pet. 
                    I would also recommend a water pet. Hit points are not as 
                    high as the earth but they are high enough. The water pet's 
                    agility will make up for the difference and the water pet 
                    will last as long or better. The high regeneration is needed 
                    to assist in the heal spells and the ice spell at least has 
                    a chance of hitting with a yellow pet. </font> </p>

                    The key here is to define the situation you are in and determine 
                    your strategy prior to starting to hunt. Then do not get locked 
                    into using one strategy for all situations, vary your strategy 
                    based on the situation. If you combine this approach with 
                    an understanding of how to manage your risk, your young magi 
                    can level quickly and easily solo into the middle twenties.
