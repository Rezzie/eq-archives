                <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2>
                        Question:  What's the only class that cannot:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Make a pet
                        <li>Heal another player <br>
                        or
                        <li>Do significant melee dmg
                        </ul>
                        <p>The answer, of course, is the wizard.  And while the above question does not give the whole picture of a wizard's abilities in EQ, it touches upon the root of what makes succeeding as a wizard very difficult.
                        <p>On paper, the wizard class sounds great.  Essentially, the wizard is really good at a couple of things, at the expense of foresaking all other abilities.  The wizard can teleport himself and his party -- this is IMMENSELY useful in EQ for shortening travel times, helping his party escape impossible odds, and getting his party to places they could not reach at all without him (eg. The Planes of Air and Hate).  The wizard has the most and best direct damage (DD) spells of any class in the game, doing more damage, at the best efficiency, with the fastest casting times, and widest variety of "flavors" (ie. Magic, Fire, and Cold).  In addition to this, a recent change made DD (direct damage) spells less resistable for wizards over level 35.  The wizard has the most area of effect (AOE) damage spells out of all the classes that come in a variety of delivery styles:  Rains , narrow Columns, point-blank (PB) blasts that damage all creatures near the caster, and the Al'Kabor series which has a very large area of effect.  They also have very good self-only defensive buffing spells, such as the skin series which creates a magical skin that absorbs a certain amount of melee dmg without harming the wizard herself.

                <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2>
                        The problem is:  The way that typical EQ player strategies have evolved, mosts of the strengths of the wizard class are not that strong in group play.  And wizards are a very poor solo class (one could make an argument that they are soloable with Journeyman Boots as equipment, but that is a very rare piece of equipment which is only obtainable post lvl-40).  Thus, wizards are dependent upon groups -- they cannot fight effectively without one, yet are in the Catch-22 of not offering a lot to the groups they might potentially join.  I'll elaborate.

                <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2>
                        The typical EQ group strategy is based-upon maximizing efficiency.  (Read the <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/group.shtml">grouping articles</a> for a good description of group play, if you're new to EQ or have been mainly playing a solable class).  A "tank" (ie. heavily-armored, high-hitpoint type) fetches a bunch of mobs (a "mob" is a gaming term for monster or creature) and the rest of the party uses the /assist command to concentrate their energies at taking down one mob at time, until there're none.  The means for this is predominantly melee damage, with healers healing the tanks as they take damage and "burners" (ie. characters who excel at DD -- such as the wizard) accelerating the death of each mob, in turn.
                        <p>So, put yourself in the position of the leader of a group inside a dungeon (where the vast majority of lvl 20+ group play occurs).  You've managed to find a good section of dungeon that has mobs that are appropriate for your level range -- the fights are going to be tough, but with a good group, you'll pull through.  You only have six slots, including yourself, to fill out the party.

                        <b>Group Composition</b><br>
                </font>
                <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2>
                        The first thing you're going to need is a tank.   Ideally, a warrior, since they have the highest AC/HP for their level (assuming they're equipped well).  Rangers, Paladins, or Shadow Knights will do, as well, since they can tank nearly as well and have useful spells and abilities.  In a pinch, you could go for a monk, bard, or rogue here, but they're really better off as "secondary tanks" (ie. damage-dealers who only get hit part-time) due to their low hitpoints (and lack of evasive skills, in the bards' case).  Lets say you get a nice fat ogre warrior to fill this spot, for this example.
                        <p>The next thing you need is a healer.  Ideally, a cleric, especially at higher levels.  A druid or shaman could do decently here, especially if you manage to score an enchanter for crowd control.  Lets say that you yourself are a cleric, so consider this spot filled.
                        <p>Now that you have a tank and a healer, what next?  Well, most experienced players would go for an enchanter, if possible -- and I'd be the last to argue.  Clarity for the group's casters, the best speed buffs for the tanks, and most importantly:  crowd control in the form of the mesmerize series.  Crowd control makes big pulls much easier and often makes the impossible possible.  You could make an argument that bards and necromancers have the ability to do crowd control (Lullaby and Screaming Terror), but they really don't compare to what an enchanter can bring.  So, you get an enchanter for your third member.
                        <p>Now what?  Three more spots left to fill and lots of classes to choose from.   *This* is the heart of the issue at hand.  Groups want efficiency.  They *need* efficiency.  Why?  If all is going smoothly, efficiency means the difference between everyone getting one bubble of experience and perhaps two or three bubbles of experience in a night.  If things start to get rough (eg. an extraordinarily difficult pull, an untimely respawn, or a train slamming into the party in the middle of a fight), then efficiency often means the difference between the party surviving or spending the next hour and a half doing a dreaded mass corpse recovery.
                        <p>What's the most efficient way to do damage in EQ?  Melee.  Unresistable melee, backed with unresistable heals and unresistable damageshields.   Using melee, short fights mean little or no downtime due to mana use (eg. healing or burning).  And for long fights, nothing compares to melee due to the fact that the only mana cost required is that of healing.    Healing is hugely efficient in the form of Greater, Superior, and Complete Heal.  A Superior Heal costs 250 mana to cast, but can keep a well-equipped tank alive to do well over 1000 damage (and that's not counting the mana-free damage from the secondary tanks and pets who're pounding away at the same time).  There's no DD that even comes close to this kind of efficiency.  Experienced players know this -- and with this in mind, lets examine our choices to round out the group.
                        <ul>
                        <li><b>Warrior/Ranger/SK/Paladin</b> -- excellent choices.  More mana-free melee damage, and the ability to tank in a pinch, if our big fat ogre warrior disconnects or has to go AFK.
                        <li><b>Monk/Rogue</b> -- The near-ideal choices for secondary tanks.  Mana-free damage being delivered at a rate that's even faster than that of the classes above coupled with the ability to manage the "hate list" of the mob's artificial intelligence (AI) with the Evade and Feign Death abilities.  Monks also make great pullers by using Feign Death to possibly shake-off excess mobs on a pull to make it more manageable.
                        <li><b>Bard</b> -- Another great choice.  Their clarity song stacks with enchanter clarity.  Their healing song eliminates the need for post-battle healing  mana-use.  They deliver decent melee damage.  And they have dozens of party-friendly songs that buff and debuff.
                        <li><b>Cleric/Druid/Shaman</b> -- Another healer is almost a requirement at times.  If your primary healer (you, in this example) gets attacked, who will heal him?   Also, in extremely bad fights, many party members may be taking damage before the enchanter gains control -- the primary healer can only really heal one player at a time (for example, Complete Heal takes 10 seconds to cast; Superior Heal takes almost 5 seconds).  Another healer comes in handy for making sure no one dies.  When not healing, they can make use of their DoTs, stuns, buffs, debuffs, pet, and damage shields (depending on class).  And if DD is needed, they have spells that average about 75% of the damage of wizard DD -- not bad, as "gravy" on top of all their other abilities.
                        <li><b>Enchanter</b> -- Another good choice.  A second enchanter can help get large pulls under control much quicker.  They can chain-cast their AOE Stuns (which they'd have 2-3 of, depending on level).  They can debuff hard-hitting mobs to make them attack much slower.  They can use charm or use their pet to add *extremely* mana efficient damage.  They even have DD at some levels that's comparable in damage to wizards (compare at 24, 34, 44) in that it's about 80% of the damage a wizard can do at greater than 80% the efficiency -- as well as the near-unresistable Tashan line to lower the target's magic resistance.  (Not that I'd recommend using DD often as an enchanter, because they have so many better ways to spend their mana) 
                        <li><b>Necro/Magician</b> -- Can't go wrong here.  Firstly, they have a pet that does nearly as much damage as a similarly leveled warrior.  And that's without using a drop of mana, after the pet is cast once.  They can buff the pet to increase it's damage by 30-50% for a minimal amount of mana.  And they have the ability to do spell damage that's much more efficient than DD in the form of (unresistable, mage) damage shields on the tanks and (the necros') poison-based DoTs (for example 540 dmg over 40 seconds for 160 mana at lvl 34).  They have resistance debuffs to help their party get spells through when needed.  And on top of all the efficient damage, they also have DDs, if needed, that at certain levels are nearly-equal in efficiency in damage/efficiency to wizard DD.  (Compare Magician at 24, 34, and 44; Necro at 24 and 44).
                        <li><b>Wizard</b> -- Direct damage.  But, as previously mentioned, this has very poor efficiency compared to melee.  Sure, it's the best DD that's out there -- but it simply is not needed.  The only time DD is actually needed is when fighting caster mobs that need to be killed as quickly as possible -- but even then, there are ways around needing a wizard.  You can have clerics, bards, enchanters, and paladins stun the mob every time it tries to cast.  And every casting class can fill-in with their DD at only a 5-30% damage/efficiency penalty.  Are you going to choose a wizard because they excel in those situations when any of those other casting classes can do nearly as well a job AND offer party-friendly efficiency in the form of buffs, pets, heals, damage shields, etc?

                <font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2>
                        Wizards have three basic skills:
                        <ul>
                        <li>DD
                        <li>AOE
                        <li>Evac
                        </ul>
                        <p>Wizard DD is very fast-casting.  But that's to no advantage in the typical group fight.  The wizard has to wait for the tanks to "build up hate" (ie. to ensure the DD does not cause the mob to attack the wizard), so what's the advantage of casting a spell in 2 seconds when she has to sit there waiting 20 seconds between casts?
                        <p>How about the wizard's AOE spells?  They are certainly more efficient than DD -- or are they?  The answer is: yes and no.  Certain lines, notably the Rain and Al'Kabor line have problems with resistance rates (Rain), limited number of targets (Rain), and poor efficiency for numbers of targets less than 4 (Rain/Al'Kabor).   The column series and PB series *can* be very efficient with multiple targets.  If used wisely, the column can even be cast in ways that don't "aggro" the mobs onto the caster.  I've yet to see a useful strategy for PB AOEs that didn't exploit a game bug (ie. safe spots) or require a gutsy enchanter or two to chain-stun with their color series as well as presenting considerable risk to the party; risk which wouldn't be there if the enchanter was used in a conventional strategy instead.  In addition to this, if you have an enchanter mesmerizing the extra mobs, *any* AOE damage fouls all that up.  To sum it up, most groups with an enchanter will NOT want a wizard casting AOEs, because they prefer the much-safer mesmerize-based strategy.  And in groups without an enchanter, only the column AOEs (of which the post lvl 20 wizard has only ones at 24 and 34) are of any use.  (Here's a <a href="http://perso.wanadoo.fr/nicolbolas/wizae.html">link</a> for readers interested in more details of wizard AOE damage.)
                        <p>Finally, there're teleports.  The evac line can be very helpful to a group that is about to suffer several deaths.  However, if your group is fighting close to a zoneline or already has a druid with evac, a wizard is not needed solely for this purpose.
                        <p>What an experienced group leader does is look to fill those last three spots with classes that fit into a melee-centered strategy.  And that means any class will do, except the wizard.
                        <p>I'm not saying that wizards can't find groups.  They won't get turned-down by friends or guildmates.  Also, many pick-up groups aren't aware of the advantages of melee efficiency.  But the truth of the matter is, as expertise builds within the playerbase, more and more pick-up groups who need to round out their party will be /shouting for group members who fit into a melee-centric strategy.  How many of us have already noticed the ratio of "Group seeking warrior/healer/enchanter/pet-caster" over "Group seeking burner" shouts?  I know I have.
                        <p>I'm also not saying that the wizard class is broken.  I simply think that the class needs a change or two before pick-up groups will embrace them.

                        I wouldn't blame Verant for the current status of the wizard class.  When they set the level of wizard spell damage back in beta, the game was very different.  There was no high-AC class armor better than the relatively-rare Rubicite.  The warrior/paladin/SK hitpoint totals had not yet been increased.  Players did not know the advantages of a high AC approach to equipment (ie. they valued stats like Str and Agi much higher).  The enchanter class was close to unplayed, due to it not being complete -- few people understood the value of crowd control.  Pets had big pathing problems and dungeon groups frowned upon their use.  Verant didn't know that DD would fall out of favor with efficiency-minded groups or that players would ask casters not to use AOE damage spells.  Nor could they have foreseen that crowding would get to the point that a group that had a good location could be very selective about how they filled a vacancy.   Back then, wizard kill-stealing was more rampant due to an unenforcable policy and the fact that experience was determined by the *individual* (not group) that did the most damage.  And there was one thing that fast-casting DD was perfect for: kill-stealing.

                        As for how Verant could make the wizard class more group-friendly, I think there are a few possible approaches, among them:
                        <ol>
                        <li>Give them utility/indirect damage spells that offer something besides their DD to groups.  An example of a spell like this would be the enchanter damageshield Feedback.  Or perhaps the ability to cast their skin spells on party members.
                        <li>Give them a line of DD spells thats more group-friendly in that its much more efficient and damaging than similarly leveled DD, but has drawbacks (eg. long casting delays, long re-cast delays) that prevent it from being chain-casted and used as a too-powerful soloing/KSing tool.
                        <li>An across-the-board decrease in mana costs for their DD to increase their efficiency.
                        </ol>

                        Until Verant recognizes that the playerbase has evolved to the point where wizards are considered a poor choice for efficiency, the class will likely experience frustrating times getting into pick-up groups.  My recommendation for wizards is to make friends or maybe join a guild and weather the storm until changes are made.  And I urge non-wizards to invite them into groups even though they may not be the most efficient choice; after all, it's a game and everyone deserves a chance to have fun.
