                    are healing incarnate. While a Cleric is around (and has mana)
                    your chances of dying are greatly decreased. This makes Clerics
                    one of the most 'in demand' classes in all of Norrath (especially
                    by fighters of all kinds). Many groups will not even attempt
                    certain enemies or areas without a Cleric, and for good reason.
                    Clerics save lives. It's just that simple. </font>

                      while the main job of a Cleric, isn't all that a Cleric 
                      can do. In fact, this class is extraordinarily versatile.
                      Buffs, heavy armor, and a bit of melee make Clerics all around
                      useful. About the only thing they can't do is do it all on
                      their own. Clerics are designed to work in a group. But even
                      in a group there are things to learn: Healing is a good start.
                      You are a mediocre cleric if you can heal well (including
                      the right people at the right times). A truly great Cleric
                      knows how to use all of a cleric's abilities in concert to
                      achieve astonishing results. </font></p>

                      half a bubble to one bubble. Only a great cleric can drag
                      a group through that sort of hellish furnace without panicking
                      and losing a few party members. And when you do have that

                      is such a key ability. It is the primary determinant in 
                      any fight, both survival and recovery. If you can heal during
                      a fight and your opponent cannot, you should almost always
                      be victorious. Healing also increases the effective level 
                      of party by almost 1-2 full levels. A group of level 10 characters
                      with a good Cleric can easily function as a group of level
                      12 characters with respect to the individual difficulty and
                      group difficulty of enemies. This increase in 'effective
                      level' tremendously increases the amount of experience and
                      loot that a group can acquire.</font></p>

                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clerics 
                      break Undead like twigs. Almost all of their primary offensive
                      armament is designed to wipe undead opponents across a rough
                      surface at very high velocities. Ward Undead, Expulse Undead, and
                      later versions are at least as efficient as Wizard burn 
                      with respect to mana/damage ratio against the walking ick.
                      When fighting Undead, which would you rather have? Frail
                      Wizard? Or a partial tank that can also save your life while
                      reducing Undead to char?  Right. So bring a Cleric or two
                      with if you expect to find some corpses walking around.</font></p>

                      general, Clerics have huge problems dealing damage in combat. 
                      At early levels, they can solo rather effectively. Middle
                      levels it begins to get rough, because Clerics just don't
                      have the health to take the damage that blue or white enemies
                      will dish out. At middle-high to high levels, you are almost
                      impotent solo. You just can't do enough melee damage without
                      double attack or dual wield to keep up with enemies that
                      are striking you for 40-50 damage twice around. Even with 
                      healing. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
                      fighting undead, your damage output increases rather tremendously,
                      however you basically become a Undead-only Wizard (in full
                      plate). You burn your enemy down and then have to meditate
                      for long periods. And may your God help you if more than
                      one enemy simultaneously decides you're lunch. At least you
                      can go invulnerable and zone before they finish the meal.

                      Clerics can't solo. Wow can they group! Even if the world 
                      were populated with 25% clerics, there would still be an
                      effective shortage. Clerics are that amazing in a group.
                      Even multiple clerics do not get in each other's way - they
                      simply keep adding to the group. </font></p>

                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
                      not able to put the hurting on an enemy that a normal fighter types
                      can, they still have a melee attack which can add up the 
                      damage in a long fight. The real damage output of a cleric
                      is their spells. Start to think of Healing as indirect burn.
                      The AI thinks this is true and so should you! If you keep
                      a fighter fighting, they're going to do MUCH more damage
                      than you would with those 80 points of mana used as burn.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      Cleric's offensive magicks are not as powerful as any pure 
                      caster, but Clerics have some unique advantages when casting
                      burn. When a Wizard or Magician casts burn (especially area
                      affect burn), it had best be from maximum range or you can
                      expect a very bloody mage body to hit the floor in the near
                      future. Clerics, on the other hand can burn with near impunity
                      because of the tremendous protection their armor affords
                      them. </font></p>

                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
                      are as much or even more important than healing. Clerics 
                      can layer spells on friendly party members like bandages
                      on a mummy, and should. If you do not buff your party, they
                      take more damage. If they take more damage, they are in more
                      danger, if they are in more danger, you must expend much
                      more mana trying to heal them. This is a vicious cycle. Your
                      defensive buffs make your healing spells about 20-50% more
                      efficient. Use them on almost everyone who will get into
                      combat (pure casters like buffs, but don't really need them if
                      they play well). </font></p>

                      can tank for a group, but only for a limited amount of time. 
                      When the group is engaged in multiple enemy combat, a Cleric
                      can safely take some heat off of the primary tanks while
                      they finish the first enemy. When the first enemy is slain
                      they can pull the next one from the cleric (who can survive
                      for quite a while) and finish that one with much less danger
                      for the tank. Try not to get two enemies on your primary
                      tanks. Spread the damage around, it's more effective, and
                      less dangerous to any individual.</font></p>

                      have a bevy of utility spells that can make a combat situation
                      (and non-combat situation) a heck of a lot less complex.  We'll
                      cover them later in detail, but remember: Lull before combat, Fear
                      at the start of combat, Root near the end of combat. Basically, 
                      these spells allow you to divide and conquer enemies similar

                      race choice has some effect of the 'type' of cleric you play.

                      come in basically two types: Support caster and Combat caster,
                      though a good Cleric can adapt to fit either role as demand requires.

                      casters are usually Dark Elf, High Elf, or Erudite. These races
                      have lower physical statistics (Str, Agil, Stam) and generally can
                      achieve slightly higher wisdom (and thus more mana). Most 
                      often Support casters provide combat overview, act as coordinators,
                      while castings spells to maximize combat effectiveness. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Combat 
                      casters are much more of a 'get in, get dirty player. They stand
                      in the middle of a fight directing things, dealing damage, healing,
                      and tanking for the group. This is a true test for a Cleric.
                      The ability to perform all the duties required while in melee
                      range with an enemy or two can stress test even the most battle
                      hardened player. The natural Combat casters are halflings and
                      dwarves, because they have tremendous physical attributes 
                      (Str,Agil, Stam). </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other 
                      races have more balanced statistics and thus have parts 
                      of the Combat Caster and the Support Caster in them. The
                      Humans are best at this considering their balance. The Gnomes
                      do a little of both, but are somewhat
                      lacking in Strength and Stamina. This reduces access to bigger
                      armor and drops combat survivability. <i>Note: Small armor
                      weighs less. Thus, races that can wear small armor (Dark
                      Elf, High Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Gnome) have a large advantage
                      in Strength because full plate will weigh 5-10 pounds less.</i></font></p>

                      Statistics: Stamina, Strength, Wisdom</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strength: 
                      On the obvious side this is the statistic that determines your
                      damage cap and adds a little to your chance to hit. More important
                      is that Strength determines your maximum carrying capacity.
                      As a cleric, you are going to run short every time. You can
                      wear plate at 75 Strength but you would pretty much have 
                      to pass on looting and summon your food and water in small
                      amounts. All of a Cleric's equipment is heavy. Their armor
                      is heavy, their shields are heavy, and their weapons are
                      very heavy. You can never really go wrong with extra points
                      in Strength, even if you don't plan on doing much melee.
                      The carrying capacity is key. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stamina: 
                      This determines your hit points as well as the rate at which
                      you tire. Some warn against putting points into Stamina, 
                      but with heavy plate armor, each point of health gained 
                      from Stamina is much more effective because of the additional
                      protection the armor provides. Other classes do not have
                      this advantage. It is also important because of the weight
                      of the weapons that clerics are usually swinging around -
                      they will tire you quickly if you neglect Stamina. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wisdom: 
                      This one is a bit obvious. Wisdom determines mana gained per
                      level. It also provides better resistance to spells and 
                      is checked on a failed skill roll. This is the last statistic
                      you should put points into, and only after you decide what
                      type of cleric you are going to play. Having a large pool
                      of mana is not the end all be all of effectiveness. It really
                      only helps in emergencies and to some degree at high levels.
                      If you have 25 points put into Wisdom, and you're playing
                      well enough that you do not drop below one bubble, you may
                      have made the wrong choice on statistics. I (a Combat Caster)
                      personally put only as much as I feel is absolutely necessary
                      because I feel that the points better serve main combat
                      survivability rather than providing me with extra mana that
                      I rarely use. Support casters should probably go maximum wisdom.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Recommendations:</i></font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      you're planning on playing a Support caster, recommendations 
                      are for high Wisdom (more mana), and a bit into strength,
                      so you can get some decent armor layered on. Armor is more
                      important than agility now. A Cleric in Chain with 95 Agility
                      will not last as long as a Cleric in Plate with 85 Agility.
                      If you can, go for the Strength to wear Plate. We calculate
                      that you'll need about 90 Strength for full Plate. However,
                      you can go partial Plate and Chain for probably 75-80 Strength.
                      Keep it in mind. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      you're playing a Combat caster (with a Dwarf, Halfing, or something
                      else), we recommend that you diversify point allocation. 
                      Combat Clerics need strength for Plate, good Stamina for 
                      combative ability, and Wisdom for spell-casting. Dwarven Clerics
                      might consider adding a bit to Agility, but that's not a
                      requirement, because of their enhanced Stamina. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      most important statistic for a Combat Cleric is Dexterity.
                      This is the statistic that determines your ability to join
                      the melee without ending up with dead party members. Dexterity affects
                      your ability at Channeling. With a high dexterity, Channeling
                      allows you to cast faster and occasionally through attacks
                      by an enemy that is actively attacking the Cleric. Do not ignore
                      this statistic.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, 
                      Stamina is now a very important statistic. You will see a
                      return on investments into this statistic that are comparable to
                      Agility. This depends also on your choice of Cleric 'type'.</font>

                      Group for those two levels, then go back to soloing. It 
                      gets bad again around 12-14 because Healing is no longer
                      effective against the amount of damage you're getting hit

                      Cleric Dodge caps out at Good, and thus it functions more
                      as an augmentation to Channeling. It increases your chance

                        tanks, adding an effective 2-3 levels of health. This,
                        combined with decent healing (Duh, you have a Cleric) makes
                        this spell a big help for dungeon hunting. Your tanks just
                        have that 50 extra damage that can easily sneak up on 
                        you in a dungeon. It is circumstantial, but can be funded
                        easily with the rusty weapons your group would otherwise
                        toss away (medium levels).</font></p>

                        It's nice for finishing runners. It is also good for when
                        something needs to be finished immediately. Clerics deliver

                        in dungeons. (See strategy section for more details.)</font></p>

                        nearly 50% of the time and even when not resisted only
                        about 60% time is it going to hold them in their position

                        are your fear line of spells. This is your second line 
                        of defense against overwhelming odds. When cast, these spells
                        cause the targeted creature to run away from you until
                        the spell effect ends. What this does for you is turn, 
                        for example, a 3 on 3 fight into a 2 on 3 fight for a limited
                        amount of time. Putting your group at an advantage for
                        this time should allow you to finish one of the creatures
                        who has stayed without the added damage and interruptions that
                        the third mob would have caused. Fear spells should never be
                        used in dungeons except under controlled situations.
                        The fleeing mob will make anything it runs by immediately
                        go aggressive on the caster of the fear. This quickly turns
                        a bad situation into a frenzied run to zone, leaving dead
                        bodies in its wake. </font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                    you want a good shot of how boring EQ can get, soloing a cleric is
                    your gig. Clerics are a group class almost exclusively. Just like
                    every other class they can solo to level 13 without too much problem
                    but after that point, you begin to see exactly how little damage
                    you are doing to the creature. As the enemy's health and damage increase,
                    fight duration increases as does recovery time. Basically it
                    gets to the point where you have two choices. You can either melee
                    the creature for a long period of time and heal during and after
                    the fight. This allows a somewhat shorter recovery but fights take
                    sooooo long that I am often AFK while fighting from boredom. 
                    The second option is using your burn with melee. This finishes 
                    the mob somewhat faster and is my preferred method but makes
                    for long recovery times because of the mana inefficiency of
                    the damage. Once you get past level 12 these methods become
                    so time inefficient that all but the most anti-social will realize
                    that Clerics are a group character. </font>

                      may suggest that Clerics should solo undead after this point. 
                      This would be a great idea, if it worked. You can solo undead 
                      that will give you decent experience, but you will be running
                      back for your corpse often. 95% of all the undead at your
                      level will be in dungeons (or outdoor micro-dungeons and
                      ruins). This invariably means you are going to be fighting
                      multiple enemies which is a losing situation, regardless
                      of whether you win, or die. Even if you win, the recovery
                      time will make this method of gaining experience inefficient.
                      And dying... well, that's never good. Usually, if you manage
                      to find a location with a single undead opponent of the correct
                      level, you still have to deal with little green annoying stuff
                      (we call it chafe or trash) that will attack you while meditating.
                      Once you hit that meditate button, you will have every piece
                      of green chafe within two rooms all over you. You don't 
                      get much recovery done when you have to fight a rat down
                      to half and then chase it down as it runs at full speed around
                      corners and through doors that you can't burn through. No
                      fun.</font>

                      first thing you must learn is when to heal and when not 
                      to heal. If a Cleric runs out of mana, combat becomes 2-3 
                      times as dangerous as it was. Clerics must conserve mana
                      to keep your options open as combat progresses.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Healing 
                      most often is a 60% health twitch response. However, a 60% twitch
                      heal may be premature. The enemy can be naturally drawn 
                      off it's initial target by a more dangerous foe (Monks draw
                      enemies off fighters almost 100% of the time after 5-10 rounds).
                      If you twitch heal the primary target, then you're wasting
                      that mana on a target that is no longer in danger unless
                      they can manage to draw the enemy back onto themselves.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      sort of healing intuition depends to a great degree on your party
                      composition, and as a Cleric becomes comfortable in a party, 
                      he knows how combat is likely to progress and who will be
                      in the most danger as the fight goes on. Healing in most
                      situations is a judgment call, and panicking and responding
                      to somewhat low health will only be more likely to hurt 
                      the party than help it.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, 
                      a good Cleric becomes amazing if the group knows how to distribute
                      damage by 'taunting' with different effects (Burn, special
                      attacks, skills, etc). Please read Grouping 101 and 201 
                      formore information.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes, 
                      a good group in a tough fight will often let people ride down
                      to about 40-50%. This may seem risky and dangerous, but 
                      it effectively makes Healing a dual effect. Cleric healing
                      can be used as a taunt to pull an almost frenzied monster
                      back off a Tank (which is not attacking now) and onto the
                      Cleric. Then another tank steps in and takes the enemy off
                      the Cleric. Remember, if you're going to do this, everyone
                      had better know this is going on, otherwise your group may
                      panic and bug out.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone 
                      who is somewhat familiar with Clerics might say that only bad
                      Clerics use Direct Damage. They should instead be saving 
                      mana for healing. This is over simplifying the role of a Cleric,
                      and is a discredit to the class.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simple 
                      fact: Burn can be as much of a life saver as your healing.
                      If an enemy is going to dish out more damage in a slightly 
                      extended combat sequence than you can easily or safely heal,
                      it's time for the group to 'light up the enemy'. Basically,
                      all the casters go into nuke mode, chain casting burn at
                      the enemy trying to reduce it to slag before it does the
                      same to a party member. In many situations, this will include
                      the Cleric! If this is a part of a multiple enemy engagement,
                      the Cleric must be a bit more careful as there still will
                      be a need for Healing later in the sequence. Lighting up 
                      an enemy can become very addictive for groups. This is a
                      very inefficient method of combat, as it incurs a severe
                      recovery time, and thus should only be used when the party 
                      is in extreme danger.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      most common usage of Cleric burn is as a taunt. Light application
                      of burn can turn enemies off of one player and on to you.
                      This is a form of healing in itself, as you prevent further damage
                      to a party member. This works the best on intelligent opponents
                      (greater undead, and most demi-humans) as they are most likely
                      to notice the cause of the 'ouchie'. Burn should be used sparingly
                      but it is not without its place.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aside 
                      from their very effective anti-undead arsenal, Clerics have amazing
                      point blank area affect damage in their Word of Pain series. 
                      These PBAOE spells don't do a lot of damage (about 3 damage 
                      per level of caster on average) they have one very important
                      effect. Area affect spells draw enemies onto the caster 
                      like flies to raw meat (think about it, it's very apt). For
                      a normal caster, that's deadly, but as mentioned above Clerics
                      can take the added heat because of their armor.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
                      the group is rushed by a few targets, the enemies will all 
                      lock onto the first one that strikes the group. If this is
                      a tank, the rest of the party has a little while to get their
                      act in gear and pull a few of the enemies off. If this is
                      a pure caster, the party has only a few rounds to get the
                      enemies off before they frenzy and kill the character. In
                      either situation, the Cleric has the advantage in being able
                      to launch WoP (or later versions), which will pull any enemy
                      not already being attacked onto the Cleric. This can be 
                      a life saver. No one character can survive being attacked
                      by many many opponents simultaneously for very long, but those
                      in heavy armor will obviously last the longest.</font></p>

                      this point, the Cleric has the option of just tanking the enemy(ies)
                      until the party has dealt with the previously engaged enemies,
                      or having another tank pull the enemy off of the cleric. 
                      The latter is the safest, as it gives the Cleric free reign 
                      to cast other spells (like healing!).</font></p>

                      are more than just health reserves. Their enchanter spells make
                      them able to control the pace and difficulty of combat. 
                      These are the lull and fear spells that clerics have available.

                      party in a fight. The soothe type spells are for situations 
                      when there are more mobs in an area than you care to try
                      at once. By soothing some you can effectively divide and
                      conquer your enemies. The fear and spook the dead series
                      are the cleric's second line of defense against overwhelming

                      30 to 45 seconds for the first versions. This will save your

                      It effectively neutralizes them for several rounds of combat.

                      by miners to detect gas pockets (and thus death). The Cleric
                      is likely the best judge of how well a combat situation is
                      going (or not going). Good clerics are likely to know very
                      early how much longer the party can sustain the abuse that
                      it is currently receiving. If your Cleric calls "RUN!", your
                      party had best be heading towards the nearest zone border in
                      a hurry.</font></p>

                      each must be careful to take into consideration the other
                      Cleric when analyzing the situation. Mana reports during combat
                      become vital to maintain awareness of 'heal status'.</font></p>

                      better to call RUN early and have everyone live, than later 
                      and have some of the party limping to zone (or walking back
                      from their bind point).</font>

                      are one of the few classes (others being Bards, Fighters, and
                      Paladins) that can wear plate armor. This armor is just
                      truly amazing, providing immense AC as well as the best damage
                      absorption in the game. Upgrade your armor to the best you
                      can find, steal, or purchase as often as possible. It is
                      more important than some of your spells. Even if you are
                      playing in a Support Cleric, the fact that you can stand
                      up to damage if an enemy turns on you is extremely important.
                      Your group needs you in combat and healing, regardless of
                      the number of enemies on you. You are not a Magician, Wizard,
                      or Enchanter which needs serious protection during combat.
                      A Cleric that begs like a caster for protection is going 
                      to get his group killed. A Cleric that refuses to cast while
                      engaged in melee is even worse.</font></p>

                      you're a Cleric, you're broke, that's life. The combined 
                      costs of armor, weapons, and spells can seem overwhelming.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Don't 
                      expect to ever really have more than you can spend hand 
                      to mouth until very high levels. Many times you will find
                      yourself borrowing money for armor and spells. You can reduce
                      the amount you spend somewhat in a supporting role by skimping
                      a little on armor but still you will feel the pinch when
                      you need to buy that next circle of spells. The only way
                      you can really keep up in the lower levels, if you do not
                      have a group to support you, is to sell your services. There
                      are always warriors willing to shell out little money for
                      some healing or others willing to pay for their disease 
                      to be gone. It won't get you fortune or glory but most of
                      the time it's a lot less boring than fishing for 3.5 hours
                      for one low circle spell.</font>

                    (Druid or Shaman) will not be enough as you go up in levels. 
                    Their healing spells are very helpful and a welcome addition, 
                    but lack the potency at medium to high levels to keep a group

                      They do, though, allow a party to fight well beyond their 
                      normal limitations. They provide pulse racing fights and
