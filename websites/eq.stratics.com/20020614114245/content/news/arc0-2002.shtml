        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yes that's right, there's more information about The Ring of Fire.  Here's the details:<br><blockquote><B><U>Megumi_ wrote:</U><br>Hiya,<br><br>Whats bothering most people about this is the fact that the mobs are no longer stunnable. We would have to clear 22-30 mobs at once during certain points of the ring trigger. During the 5th-6th wave. (Normally losing a handful of people in the process) This is no longer obtainable by even the highest Guilds on EVERY server. I am in the highest guild on my server, which is probably in the top 10 most powerful guilds in game. If the highest people in game cant get to the 6th boss anymore because of this nerf, then how does sony expect the average guild to come in and make attempts at this?<br><br>Atleast b4 you made the adds unstunnable, a normal-average guild could come in and get to the 4th boss.. sometimes even the 5th. NOW, only the 2 best guilds on my server even have a chance at making it to number 5. And at 5 we're normally wiped out. <br><br>This was a great idea to create something like this... However I really think you need to rethink the recent patch and possibly remove the resist these mobs have against enchanters stun.. If we have to bring in an additional 20-30 melee to tank adds we will. But this will only cause us to send in /bug reports saying the zone doesnt have the capacity for this little obsticle sony has created....<br><br>Please rethink what youve done, RoF used to be fun.. now it just sucks <br></B><br><SUP>Quote:</SUP><br><hr width="95%"><br>The level of the mobs at this stage does make them very difficult to manage. This was intentional. I have personally participated as a player in the event both before and after the bug fix. It is still very possible for a good force of players to get to the fifth boss of the encounter, and as players become more powerful through alternate advancement abilities and equipment they may indeed make it farther. <br><br>As for smaller raid forces, there are some rewards for making it to the fourth boss that veteran players would be happy with. <br><br>The encounter is now as difficult as it was designed to be after the fourth boss. The treasure available past that point is commensurate with the difficulty, and the ability for players to obtain it very frequently makes it necessary to require a solid force of players.<br><br>If time permits, I may place a few waves in between these stages to make the progression more granular. This would have the side effect of taking longer to get to the toughest encounters. <br><br>As always, I am open to ideas. Feel free to email me any well thought out suggestions. <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Steve Burke<br>Lead Designer, EverQuest Content<br>Sony Online Entertainment, Inc<br>sburke@soe.sony.com<br><hr width="95%"><br><br>And since Steve is brave enough to offer up his email address, I urge you to please keep your comments concise and clear. And if you're not sure that your comment is something for Steve specifically, please send it to the Dev Corner and I'll see that the right person gets it.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It seems more and more questions about Magicians kept popping up.  <b><i>Absor</b></i> kindly answers them, saying this:<br><blockquote><br><B><br>I think the mages in this game have waited long enough. And now the quotes from the Fan Faire are even more disturbing.<br>Explain your passion for hating mages?</B><br><br>I can't explain it because we don't hate mages. I can't even imagine how you could think such things. There is no reason nor point to any one here 'hating' any class. We don't.<br><B><br>First off - why are so many zones non-Call of the Hero compatible? <br></B><br>Because the use of Call of the Hero in those zones allows characters to skip content that we do not wish to be skipped.<br><B><br>Grodin is quoted as saying he wished they never made the spell. Well that makes us mages hopeful for anything doesn't it? You made it. Now use it.</B><br><br>Well, based on the fact that Magicians don't like it when we disable the use of the spell in a few zones, and the fact that allowing the spell to work in those zones invalidates the whole risk/reward concept in the zone, I can certainly understand how the existence of this spell could be seen as troublesome.<br><br>However, we are not prepared to allow this one spell to prevent us from implementing interesting content. As I've said before, we'd rather disable one spell in a few zones than never explore content that that spell would invalidate.<br><B><br>It's not like we do much else. We have basically 2 nukes - fire/magic (some places those are useless), pet pathing is no good almost everywhere (no one wants you to use them thanks to that.)<br></B><br>Indeed, some NPCs are practically immune to either fire or magic. Very rarely, however, are both of those magic types highly resisted. And pet pathing isn't perfect, but it certainly isn't as bad as you make it sound.<br><B><br>t leaves us two things. Mod rods and CoH.<br>Mod Rods - well thats nice. Use my mana (which I can't use on nukes/pets anyway) for someone else. Effective yet boring.</B><br><br>Use your nukes and your pets. As I said, there are very few places where you can't use them.<br><br>CoH - better. I can get members into the battle who could not log in earlier due to good reasons. Effective, perfect etc.<br><br>This was the desired use of this spell, to let members of your raid join late. Sadly, that isn't the only use for the spell.<br><B><br>Secondly - You increase the drop rate on Magi P`Tasa in hate.  Wonderful!! BUt now let's look at something else said. We don't want many mage epics floating around. But other classes you do? If they are epic make them somewhat equal.</B><br><br>Are you asking us to reduce the power of your epic?<br><br>The mage epic is hard, that's true. But it is hard because it's an excellent epic.<br><B><br>You told us to try things out before asking you about them. Well we have. We are upset, you are making mages a pointless class to play. And we have been asking - just give us a reason.</B><br><br>Havneq - 57 mage Tribunal<br><br>Mages are not a pointless class at all.<br><br>We'll certainly review them when we look at all the caster issues in the near future. And I'm absolutely willing to hear about your concerns. I would like to urge you all, however, to try to avoid exaggeration. Focus on specifics and solutions.<br><br><B><br>Fixes for the current mage problems, please consider.<br><br>First let me start off by saying this, when you increased the Melee of all of classes, rogue, monk, sk/pal, warriors, Bards you forgot the one class that relies on a pet as their main form of damage. Please seriously consider changing them(mage pets) to another table of damage. not making them hit for more damage, but hitting more than 50% of the time. <br><br>Next let me give a few suggestions for alternate class skills. The first i would like to adress is Mass Group Buff, This skill was given to a class that has 1 line of buffs in the entire game. In place of mass group buff: How about pet casting mastery? this would be a great opposite in place of spell casting fury mastery that wizards recieve. Pet will spawn with 3/11/20 more % of hp, ac, str, dex, instead of the normal pet template? maybe at level 3 the pet will have a chance to Crit like normal melee? <br><br>Another Skill that needs to be looked into is Frenzied burnout.. Suggestions: Increase the buff duration to 32 minutes. The current buff duration is 36 seconds and a recast of 72 minutes, chances to flurry and rampage, and with no explosion of damage at the end as is described in the advanced skills explanation. In its current form This skill is not completly worthless, but if you'll compare what its supposed to do with other class effects like enchanter dire charm, and the necro undead charm it falls way way short.<br><br>Thanks <br>Parsalin D'ayl <br></B><br><br>Let me start by responding to you last point first.<br><br>Frenzied Burnout is bugged. The explosion isn't working properly. We're trying to fix that.<br><br>Admittedly, Mass Group Buff isn't as useful to Mages as others. I'm not sure we can do something like you described as Pet Casting Mastery. I'm not sure that we can add power to pets like that. Even the focus pets don't really work that way. But I'll pass it on.<br><br>We didnt really forget pets when we did the melee balancing. Pets have to be evaluated in conjunction with the caster and his spells. Evaluating pets will go hand in hand with the caster balancing that we're undertaking.<br><br><B><U><br>Pirotes wrote:</U><br><br><b><i>Absor</b></i>,<br>I've been playing Everquest before Kunark came out at a time when you had to raid to camp the Sol B Efreeti. Recently I have been wondering what happened to class balance. As a Mage I am horrified by Dire Charm. I worked hard to get my epic and it's effect is outdone by some guy who exp farmed for less time than I camped Quillmane for. I could have sworn that it was a mage's ability to have the best pets and now a class with better mana regen, stuns and messes also has a higher damage output than me. I have seen enchanters charm mobs that hit for 120+ with far more hp than mine, who can buff their pets just as well as I do and slow mobs to boot.<br>I'm not calling for a nerf of dire charm, but I think mages deserve to have the best pets. If enchanters are going to be able to charm mobs, we should be able to make pets which can outdo their damage.<br></B><br>I would love to have some specific examples of NPCs that can be charmed using Dire Charm that are as powerful as you claim. I need specifics in order to be able to research what you claim.<br><br><br><B>Thanks for finally responding to Mages <b><i>Absor</b></i>.<br>Needless to say Mages have been a little on the heated side since some of the comments were released from the Fan Faire.<br><br>I don't know if you've followed the thread on the Mage board at all, but the issue that sparked this latest round of "disgust with <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a>" was a the comment from <b><i>Abashi</b></i> that he still saw mages as overbalanced when it comes to soloing.<br><br>Needless to say this got us going, because post 50 mages are not good soloers when compared to other classes, Monks with average gear are much better than we are, and I would not consider Monks as good as Druid, Shamen, Necros, Wizzards or Enchanters. To watch a monk lvl 58 be able to farm the entire Lava Duct Crawlers area in SOLB by himself is amazing, spawn after spawn. We are great for farming greens and light blues (better than any other class imo), but not xp soloing. I could go into detail about mages not being able to divert enough damage, but I'm sure you understand the game mechanics better than I do post 50. <br><br>My point is post 50, mages are middle of the road soloers, and for <b><i>Abashi</b></i> to make a comment like that really got mages questioning if <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> really knows what?s happening in the end game when it comes to mages.<br><br>Please don't read this as an endorsement for more high end soloing abilities, because I hate soloing. <br><br>I would really appreciate it if you could comment on this issue because I think it?s why many mages think that <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> has it "out for them" as of late.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Nandail<br></B><br><br>Well, let me start by apologizing for sounding rough. It's just that I get frustrated when I get a bunch of commentary that is vague and angry. Obviously there are issues that folks want to talk about, but I can't address unspecific anger.<br><br>As for Mages and their solo ability, they are indeed one of the best solo classes. Up until 50 they can be considered among the top 3. After 50 perhaps they fall more toward the middle of the pack.<br><br>If you look at the life of the class, this places them pretty much third or fourth in over all solo ability, by my estimation. I know that it's tempting to only look at the end game, especially when you're playing it. But the life of the character is more than that. <br><br>And if I seem like I'm rattling your cages a bit, maybe I am.<br><br>I really need you folks to be more precise and less emotional when sending in comments. It makes it much easier for me to present your ideas to the team.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Thanks Alan!  So, what do you think of <b><i>Absor</b></i>'s responses?  Comment Below!<br>

When the first Star Gate was discovered on the fringes of Sol we had no idea that it was one of the countless Gates that linked the oldest and most distant of the galaxy's planets. The scientist-monks of the Jenquai had tried to keep their discovery of the Star Gate a secret, fearing the other two factions incapable of grasping the significance of their discovery. But the Terrans, watching from the boardrooms of their star-spanning corporations, had spies everywhere. Seeking to prevent a Jenquai monopoly of this discovery that allows near instantaneous travel across vast distances of space, the Terrans forged an alliance with the aggressive Progen, an ordered and warlike clone culture.<br><br>So it came to pass - the Gate War. Humankind fell upon each other in an epic war, fought for the same reasons wars were fought since the beginning of civilization - territory. With the weapons of mass destruction that technology has wrought, we almost destroyed ourselves completely this time.<br><br>That was well over a century ago. Now, with the 23rd century nearing its end, a tenuous state of Cold War exists between the Three Factions of humankind. Each of the factions has claimed a portion of the Human Sphere as its own, linked now by the same Star Gates that broke them apart.<br><br>The Peace is maintained - only just - by fragile treaties and the creation of neutral peacekeepers, a byproduct of the War that nearly plunged the human race into extinction. But the Universe is large. Danger stalks the darkness between the stars. There exists countless worlds, countless discoveries, all drifting through the cold vacuum that spreads outward from Earth and Beyond.</blockquote>This new sci-fi MMOG is nearing release and now Westwood needs your help in refining the game through a limited opportunity to play test the Earth and Beyond Beta.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It seems more and more questions are arising about AA Titles.  <b><i>Absor</b></i> took it upon himself to answer some of these questions.  Here's what he covered:<br><blockquote><br><B><U>Evenshadow wrote:</U><br>I have a concern, regarding the titles recieved with the new AAxp. Namely: I really don't want one. I am pretty sure I am far from alone in this  After going 60 levels as a character with a single name, its become somewhat of a trademark. I would like to keep my single name. Call it a roleplaying thing if you will. <br>While your chosen titles may sound good with some names, sadly, others they make into a laughingstock (please see a recent thread on the safehouse regarding "Master" Bahter):P I'm sure you can understand that a name in EQ is a very personal thing: almost the only thing that makes a character truly unique. To have this changed arbitrarily is very frustrating.<br><br>Would it be possible to have a command implemented wherein one could turn off AAxp titles? Is there possibly one coming down the pipe? A very large number of your players would like to know I'm sure. <br><br>While the titles are a neat idea, and work well for some, for others of us, they are an unwelcome change to our characters. A /titleoff command would be a wonderful thing.</B><br><br>Our Technical Director, Scott Hartsman, posted about this on a public board. It's been picked up by a few fan sites already, but I figured I'd post it here for you all to read and comment on. It is taken out of context, so it might read a little funny:<br><br><SUP>quote:</SUP><br><HR width="90%"><br>Before this one gets too far out of hand, I wanted to mention something:<br><br>After seeing this thread lastnight, I talked to the GM in question as well as one of the Lead GMs.<br><br>We all agree that this isn't Sir Bahter's fault, and that the "more correct" solution is to add a switch that allows GMs to turn titles on and off. Any name changes due to this, until that point, are only temporary.<br><br>(This is a feature that we would really like to add in for players as well, but the two gentlemen who'd be doing that are both handling engine/zoning/memory optimizations and drops to desktop at this point, which have to take priority. Unfortunately, it's a more involved change than one might think.)<br><br>Please don't be too hard on the GMs - They're doing their jobs, and quite well at that. If anything, it's a failing on our side that the need for a switch like this wasn't forseen when we started adding things in front of people's names.<br><br>I'm definitely not comfortable with any change we make that forces a need for a person to lose, even temporarily, an identity he's had for quite some time. That's just not fair. We'll find a way get the switch added in the next couple weeks.<br><br>Best,<br><br>- Scott Hartsman<br>Technical Director, EverQuest<br><hr width="90%"><br><br>I talked to Scott a bit about this over email in an attempt to anticipate your questions.<br><br>Scott is talking about a switch that the GMs can use to correct issues like the one that Bahter has. He's not talking about a switch that would allow players to turn off their titles. Those are two different issues. In this case we need the GM switch to correct this naming issue (though I suspect it only affects a single or a very small number of players), so that such players are not inconvenienced by the introduction of these titles. Allowing players to turn off their titles doesn't solve the problem, it actually would make it worse. This would allow a player (and I'm certainly not saying that Bahter would do this) to toggle on and off the combination, which allows that combination to exist against the naming policy. We need to be assured that the name can't exist.<br><br>That means that even if we had both a player and a GM toggle for titles, the GM toggle would overwrite the player one. A GM could toggle off Bahter's title (Master) and the player would not be able to turn it back on.<br><br>So, with all of the other stuff we're working on right now, the GM one would have to come first.<br><br>I hope that made sense.<br><br><B><U>Kenwood wrote:</U><br>did I miss something? maybe I was dreaming but I could have sworn I saw in a patch message or something that there is a command now to allow us to set what parts of the character names show. On a global basis of course, not just for an individual character, but I don't see that the poster was concerned about other people's titles showing.<br></B><br>Yes and no.<br><br>There are some switches now available for those that want to customize how other people's names appear.<br><br>The problem for Bahter is that his title needs to not display to anyone, regardless of their setting. It can't be dependent on how others set their names, but on how his name looks to everyone. So it has to be set for his character, regardless who sees him.<br><br><B><U>Kenwood also wrote:</U><br>This was a command mentioned in one of the patch messages:<br><br>- /shownames now works with the following parameters:<br>no parameter = display the current setting.<br>off = don't show player names over their heads<br>1 = show only first names of players<br>2 = show First and Last Name<br>3 = show First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br>4 = show Title (if any), First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br><br>Wouldn't this be exactly what the original post was requesting? It doesn't allow a player to toggle his own title on/off but it does give him to ability to turn off titles globally<br></B><br>This works on what you see, not what you show to others. A subtle but important difference.<br><br><B><U>DaxD wrote:</U><br>So does this mean we can petition in game for the GM to turn our titles off?</B><br><br>Absolutely not. When this feature is added for the GMs, it will only be used for the rare instance of the character with a name that violates the naming policy when combined with a title. It's not a very efficient use of our GMs time to run around turning off titles.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Thanks Alan!  What do you think about this topic?  Comment Below!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There was a small bit of a debate on the forums about company names and where some of them had come from.  There were also a few questions about the inner workings of these companies along with some speculation.  Brad McQuaid (Aradune) thankfully stopped by and was able to clear up the questions and illusions that had been presented for us.   <br><br><blockquote>Hi all, <br><br>Here's the scoop on all the names/companies/etc: <br><br>Steve Clover and I were hired by a company called Sony Interactive Studios in March, 1996 by John Smedley (who was then a Director of Devlopment for that company). And Milo (a good friend of ours, who helped us on a previous project years before) was indeed already employed there and working on sports titles. Steve and I quickly started work on the game and wrote the original design document.<br><br>SISA was focussed mostly on Playstation games, but Smedley wanted to do online PC games, so we ended up forming a department within SISA devoted to online games. In fact, he'd already started an online game before EQ called Tanarus (the EQ engine and client-server code was originally based on Tanarus'). <br><br>I became Producer on EQ soon after joining and the team began to grow as we needed more resources. The hiring process began in earnest, and we were lucky enough to be able to hire people like Bill Trost and Kevin Burns who had also worked with us on previous projects. And eventually Milo was able to join the EQ team as well. <br><br>Sony Interactive Studios then later changed their name to 989 Studios (which was indeed based on their Foster City address). And then in mid-late 1998, with the Playstation 2 on the horizon, decided to completely focus on console games and so gave Smedley the opportunity to spin the online PC department off into its own company. So Smedley approached me, invited me to be his partner, and <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> was formed (although we did briefly call it RedEye, but there was a name conflict).<br><br>989 agreed to keep funding EQ, but we needed a partner for the other games we'd begun (Planetside, Sovereign, and the game that turned eventually into SW:G). So we found a completely seperate Sony entity called Sony Online Entertainment who was focusing mostly on ad-revenue based games like Wheel of Fortune, Jeoprady, etc. They were interested in exploring subscription revenue based games like EQ, and so agreed to be <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a>'s publisher and funder. <br><br>When EQ launched, it turned out to be a much bigger success than even the most optimistic of us ever imagined. So not long afterwards, Sony Online and its parent companies began to show interest in acquiring <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a>, and that is eventually what happened. So, at this time, <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> and SOE are really the same company, for all intents and purposes. <br><br>989 is now pretty much devoted to sports games, with their other titles being part of their parent company, SCEA (Sony Computer Entertainment, America). Yeah, Sony has as LOT of divisions. <br><br>It is also interesting to note that Kelly Flock was CEO of 989 and then also eventually became CEO of SOE, and was very instrumental in the success of EQ & <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> (as, of course, was John Smedley, without whom there would be no EQ). <br><br>-Brad</blockquote>You can read the full thread <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/eq/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=eqwestwood&Number=689825&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=&fpart=1&vc=1">HERE!</a><br><br>Thanks for stopping by and clearing that all up!  Knowing the truth is always better than guessing at it.

Considering the "Scars of Velious", the huge areas that many creatures call home, are from her claws ripping into the ground, as she marked Norrath as her property. <br>Veeshan herself is so large, that the continent of Velious is about the same size of her claw. <br>There are many quests out there that can take a very long time to complete. Questing for Veeshan, except for maybe a few bards who still worship her, would be against the will of any of the other gods in Norrath. <br>Lady Daegarmo<br></blockquote><br>You can find the details of this Quest, along with Lady Ds response, <A HREF= <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum6/HTML/000748.html" target=_blank> here </A><br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Abosr answers some more questions about Necromancers.  Here's what he says:<br><blockquote><br><B<><U>Elindel wrote:</U><br><b><i>Absor</b></i> said "That's how snare components work. Nothing new about the way this spell works. Multi-effect spells do tend to break earlier."<br>Just a correction, that's not how snare components work. Snare spells have a set duration, they don't have a resist check each tick like root lines. The druid and wizard snare lines both work this way, as does the necro darkness line and druid and necro epics. <br><br>The only one that checks each tick is Tangling Weeds, and that is to balance the near instant cast. (Of course it's worthless now with the 7 second recast due to how often it is resisted, but that is another subject).<br></B><br><br>Sorry about the confusion. Here's how it works.<br><br>Multi-component spells (even Snare spells) check to see if they break at regular intervals. Most spells with a Snare component have been specially coded to bypass that check. Some have noted that, for example, the Necromancer epic weapon effect worked the same way until it was given special coding to change that.<br><br>Whether or not Insidious Retrogression should be changed, I don't know. I've certainly passed your concerns to the team.<br><br><B><U>Betagen wrote:</U><br>Chill/Ignite Bones - the illusion effect of these two spells are blocking the Dragon/Gaint Bane line of the Wizard class.<br><br>That makes sense, considering that they change bodies when you use those spells. Giant and Dragon bane spells won't work on creatures that are not Giants or Dragons at the time. Not much to do about that except get the other spells, which you mention below.<br><br>*********<br><br>Since the mobs are now in skeletal form, why dont our undead nukes work?  <br><br>If they are dragons why not use the undead dragon model. That way both skills work (not that IB is ever allowed while riading)  <br><br>Also mayny times when IB is cast the skeleton is teribly small and jumps around making it hard for people to target. Would there be anyway to make the skeleton scale to the size of the mob.<br></B><br><br>I'm trying to figure that one out myself. Right now I can only guess. I'll try to have a more solid answer for you later (later would be after Fan Faire). But I can see why it would be a bad idea to allow Necromancers to turn any creature into an undead, an undead that would be affected by all of the Necromancer specialty undead spells.<br><br>As for turning the target into an undead dragon, there are two reasons not to. First, that undead dragon model isn't available globally. Secondly, and more importantly, you won't only be targeting dragons with those spells. So having the spell always turn the target into an undead dragon wouldn't work. And having it change the target based on body type and all of that maybe it could be done, at the expense of a lot of resources. And anything that this spell could turn something into would have to be made available globally. We've talked about this a few times and there are no reasonable solutions that work to make the spell work the way you want it to.<br><br>Alan<br>

I already have my epic, but I'm very happy that future clerics do not have to endure the painful and dreaded Ragefire camp.<br>I only see one problem with the change, and that is on most servers Kunark dragons are usually killed very quickly after spawning. If Ragefire indeed spawns and remains with his previous loot table, he will be "farmed" for Cloak of Flames and other great loot, making the quest even less attainable for clerics not in first tier guilds.<br><br>The way around this, I believe:<br><br>a) Keep Ragefire's dragon form as is (like Nagafen) and not Talendor (I hope I have the right dragon)<br><br>b) The loot is removed completely from him except the container<br><br>c) The container is NO DROP/NO RENT until combined with the pearl, when it becomes NO DROP only<br><br>This will clear up most issues with the changes and would certainly accomplish what you are trying to acheive!<br></B><br><br>a) I don't know really how the appearance of the NPC is a factor. And, well, I don't actually know what he'll look like.<br><br>b) We'll keep our eyes on that. Right now the loot hasn't changed, but this is something we'll keep our eyes on. Remember, it works both ways. If there is no good loot for your friends to gain for helping you with your epic, then they might be less willing to help.<br><br>c) The container is indeed no-drop. I don't know about the no-rent thing. That seems like a bad idea to me. How unpleasant would it be to have your cleric go link-dead during the battle?<br><br>In any case, we'll see how this goes.<br><br><br><B><U>Rizpah wrote:</U><br>Thanks for the efforts! Can you consider making it necessary to give the swirling pearl to the merchant in Skyfire for him to spawn the killable version and then the pearl returned (much like the Faydedar trigger is now)? This would ensure a cleric would have to be ready for this step to get the heart and would avoid the dragon being farmed for loot and twink clerics who may one day do the quest. It would also avoid grief players killing the trigger and gating or killing the dragon even out of spite.<br></B><br>This is one of the things we were trying to prevent. There is a real problem with the whole triggered Ragefire thing. It becomes a problem when character A hands in the trigger item and group B kills the NPC. Not only is character A out of luck for getting his item, he's also lost the item he needed to trigger the NPC in the first place.<br><br>For most epic quests this hasn't really been a problem. But for this one it has. The tremendous demand for this one item has caused people to do things like jumping other's triggered spawns and all sorts of other nasty things. Short of removing the item from the game, there really isn't any way to prevent that behavior short of paying someone full-time to watch people at this one encounter.<br><br>There probably isn't a perfect solution here. Let's see how this one works out.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>So now what do you think of the changes?<br><br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Absor</b></i> comments about the changes to the "/who all guild" command.  Here's what he says:<br><blockquote><br><B><U>Arbaon wrote:</U><br>Not included in the patch message was the change to /who. No longer can you list a guild with "/who all g20", instead, you must type out the entire name in quotes such as "/who all 'Ring of the Eight Virtues'" for example. I liked being able to list my guild without having to type nearly as mucn. Can this be put back in?<br>Also about the Velious Scion, I think it's great! But it's confusing the way it works, and if you want to go to odus for example now, you can't just run up to the portals and go grab a beer or whatever until they fire off. Are there any plans to patch the Nexus zone to add another spire room? The zone file is smaller than the eqgame.exe file that is downloaded every patch, so the download size would not be a problem.<br></B><br><br>Sorry about that.<br><br>This is probably a side effect of some code that we needed to change. There was a conflict with the / all g and the petition system. Too much coder stuff to translate<br><br>You can still use the command, but you need to type out the 'guild' part in full.<br><br>So in your example you can use:<br><br>/who all guild20<br><br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Sounds like you're going to have to remeber some names.... what do you think?

The game shattered all multiplayer game records after its release in 1999, exceeding all industry expectations and inspiring three top-selling expansion packs.<br><br>McQuaid is President and CEO of Sigil, and Butler has assumed the role of Vice President."</blockquote>Thanks to <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/">http://www.gamespydaily.com/</a> for letting us know about this. <br><br>This sure makes me wonder what they may have in store for the future.

Please see the Developer's Corner on our web site for more details<br>- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest armor<br>- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated quest<br>- Grimling Blood should now be dropping<br>- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item to the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct NPC to hand the item to<br>- In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you complete the task that he asks of you<br>- Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders<br>- Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth<br>- Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping<br>- Quest of Nobility should now be working properly<br>- Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold<br><br><br>** Items **<br><br>- Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral Plains. Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the classes. The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others. In all instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised. Several items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded<br>- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes on the chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the plate equipment list. This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use. Our Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent<br>- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop<br>- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used from inventory)<br>- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces<br>- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces<br>- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races<br>- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable<br>- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic<br>- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown<br>- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate<br>- Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now<br>- Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged. The "range" value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing them<br>- Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other pieces<br>- Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate<br>- Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>- Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>- Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash when inventory is opened<br>- Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights<br>- Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves<br>- Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item<br>- Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races<br>- Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore<br>- Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus<br>- Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues <br>- Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect<br>- Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their effects. Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item. The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely informational<br>- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had been erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These were primarily items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value<br><br><br>** Zones **<br><br>- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead<br>- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus<br>- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level Luclin encounters<br><br><br>** Horses **<br><br>- Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands who will buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in the Bazaar<br>- Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when stunned was causing warping and other bad things<br>- Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect people on horses properly<br>- Horses now levitate when their rider should.<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person you are following is on a horse<br><br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with the spell level<br>- Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc' generated by Instrument of Nife<br>- Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed and now work in the planes <br>- Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain skill in an instrument when they are not using one.<br>- Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing weapons<br>- Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced<br>- Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable<br><br><br>** Visual Issues **<br><br>- Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small<br>- Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear off<br>- Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at all) when a player zoned in<br>- Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races) should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was wearing<br>- Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell was cast on them<br>- May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game<br>- Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope)<br><br><br>** Performance Issues **<br><br>- More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones<br>- "Hitch" created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now<br>- Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money<br>- Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills<br><br><br>** New Features **<br><br>- Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will reduce the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this does nothing. Normal click increases the resolution as it always has and still wraps back to 640 after the highest resolution your machine supports.<br>- Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and getting the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all EverQuest players (these features were restricted only to Velious owners) <br><br><br>** PvP **<br><br>- It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team on Sullon Zek<br><br><br>** Alternate Advancement Abilities **<br><br>- Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 minutes<br>- Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target<br>- Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning<br>- Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just those cast on yourself<br>- The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when using Chaotic Stab<br>- LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted<br>- Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted<br>- Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described<br>- Leech Touch should refresh properly now<br>- Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second<br><br>*** Do you want to join us? ***<br><br>So you got your Epic weapon... and now spend your free time holding weekly sight seeing tours to the Temple Veeshan, along with nightly Luclin lunar dinners.

Here's what he wrights:<br><blockquote><br><B><U>MegaDuck wrote:</U><br>WOW nice. I hope the changes in the epic makes the clerics and mages happy.<br>I always did think the warders should have been bigger. A warder smaller then a rat was not very thretening to me.<br>I tested the zoninging and upgrade in shar vhal and for me it works wonders. The city is not NEARLY as jerky as it was when it first came out. STill jerker then the other zones but not unplayably so. Loading times are MUCH better to i like it.<br></B><br>Thanks.

In all instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised. Several items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded<br>::/quote::<br><br>I must confess that myself and any number of other people are not best pleased about this change. As a lvl 54 druid I was looking forward to trying to get some of the Elysian armor soon for it's fabulous AC. The rest of the stats on it were certainly nice but they were a far secondary concern. <br><br>I've never quite understood why there seems to be this anathema to allowing some classes to get decent AC. I'm well aware that druids are far from being tanks, but I hope to get 1000 AC some day. With access to no drop items like what the elysian armor was it was a remote possibility to do so without signing away my soul to buy the uber uber gear or trying to get into a superguild. Most druids I know where drooling over this stuff for the AC alone and no other reason. I'm not going to accuse it of suddenly becoming crap, because it's far from it, but for me anyway it's far less desirable than it was. I would like to ask that you at least consider moving the AC back up a little bit anyway, not all the way as I can understand your reasoning for lowering it even if I don't agree, but I really think you lowered it too much (and I'm not just saying this about the druid gear in particular, the other umbral armor was great stuff as well and I'm sure you are already being flooded with irate complaints on this subject.)<br></B><br><br>Well, a lot of the basic design of the classes is based on the kind of armor class they will be able to achieve. Using Druids as an example, their lack of AC is a part of the balancing factor that allows them to have such great spells. A Druid with better AC needs to have lesser spells in order to even things out. Take that far enough and, basically, you get a Ranger.<br><br>And, well, you're the first one to send in an email about not liking the changes to the armor. But I suppose it's still early yet <br><br>We changed the armor to be in-line with class design. A lot of it got better rather than worse. While I can always understand that people will be upset at any reduction to the power or usefulness of gear that they have or hoped to have, all of the changes made make sense if you look at the way that equipment meshes with the rest of the game world.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Hope every one enjoys their game :)

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Absor</b></i> was kind enough to post some in-depth Changes in the upcoming Cleric Epic Quest.  Here's the info:<br><blockquote><br>Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather close detail. But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<br>With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people to help in the process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests. So Clerics tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among players.<br><br>So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest. To reduce confusion and to help people understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These changes will go Live with the patch tonight.<br><br>For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:<br><br><br>First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different location in SoldungB. He will appear once each day (except after a server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days). The appearance of this NPC will no longer require the absence of Lord Nagafen.<br><br>The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to the Cleric and disappear.<br><br>At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him. A killable version of Zordak will appear independent of the pearl turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will appear a little faster). Killing Zordak will transform him into dragon form, and the Cleric (with help) must kill him immediately.<br><br>The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to create the Heart that is turned in to Omat.<br><br>The rest of the quest remains the same.<br><br><br>The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the bottleneck that existed before. They will not remove that bottleneck, but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn with so many people willing to be rude to each other.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Thanks <b><i>Absor</b></i>!  <br>What do you think of the changes?

Here's what he wrote:<br><blockquote><br><B>Insidious Retrogression - our 49th lvl DD/Snare/Debuff appears to be allowing mobs to attempt a resist each tic.</B><br><br>That's how snare components work. Nothing new about the way this spell works. Multi-effect spells do tend to break earlier.<br><br><B>Chill/Ignite Bones - the illusion effect of these two spells are blocking the Dragon/Gaint Bane line of the Wizard class.</B><br><br>That makes sense, considering that they change bodies when you use those spells. Giant and Dragon bane spells won't work on creatures that are not Giants or Dragons at the time. Not much to do about that except get the other spells, which you mention below.<br><br><B>Incinerate Bones - is our 44th lvl non illusion verison of Ignite Bones. This spell drops off a named mob deep in Chardok, a 50th+ lvl zone. Is it me or does a 44th lvl spell dropping in a 50th+ lvl zone seem wrong?<br><br>Conglaciation of Bone - is our 55th lvl non illusion verison of Chill Bones. This spell drops off the Royals and some Dragons in NToV, all of which are 60th+ lvl. Why is a 55th lvl spell dropping off mobs 5+ lvls above the spell?</B><br><br>These are reward spells, variants of old spells created for those that want the variety. Making them harder to get is part of the plan. And soon enough these spells will saturate the higher levels and become available for purchase by those unable or unwilling to gain them personally.<br><br><B>Boht of those spells where meant to deal with the raiding problems of Ignite/Chill Bones but they where implemented in a terrible way to keep them out of our hands.</B><br><br>Actually, they were meant to be special variant spells that a character could earn. The fact that they are considered 'better' spells should also explain why they are harder to earn.<br><B><br>Quivering Veil of Xarn - please remove the illusion effect of this spell, then it would stack with our lich line and not conflict with illusion effects we might have up. It is not much of an emergency spell if I have to check to see if anything is going to block it. Until the illusion is removed it will never be as usefull as our 20th lvl Harm Shield.<br></B><br>Illusion spells cannot be overwritten, which is why Veil of Xarn will not overwrite Lich form spells. While I understand the desire to make it simple to use this spell, in the long run it's those that can use their spells the best that make the best casters.<br><B><br>Defoliation - Why is it that the Shroom mobs in the lower levels of Old Sebilis and The Deep are considered Plants but the ones in Fungus Grove and pretty much every other zone are not? Can we please finally have this spell work upon plant mobs.<br></B><br>I'll mention this to the team.<br><B><br>Horses - it appears that their are several stacking issues with horses. We can no use any of our Lich line spells that have an illusion effect nor can we cast Ignite/Chill Bones while upon a horse. <br></B><br>You can only change into one of the given PC forms on a horse. You can't turn into a spectre or any other undead on a horse. This is due to the way horses work. You'll just have to get off the horse to cast those spells.<br><B><br>Shissar Deathspeaker Staff - This staff come from Veeshan's Peak and has the right click effect of Soul Well. Soul Well is an HP drain over time but unlike our other HP drain over time spells it does not stack with any Lich line spell nor Envenomed Bolt.<br></B><br>That is probably as intended, but I'll mention it to the team.<br><B><br>Pet Life Tap procs - have been broken for months now and really needs to be fixed. When you consider how few HPs our expansion pets have these are often needed to keep our pets alive during fights.<br></B><br>Looking into this one again right now.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Wow, that's alot of Questions.

Here's what <b><i>Absor</b></i> would comment with:<br><blockquote><br>I couldn't wait to get a horse. Wow, was I shocked when I saw the price tag on said horses. The price scale seems a bit off the mark. Especially when you consider that you can purchase much more valuable weapons and armor at a fraction of the cost. This pricing scheme doesn't seem to be warranted.<br>Yes, I have heard arguments that only the rich could afford horses and that the game should mimic this fact. I would be perfectly fine with that if not for the fact that we don't follow suit with magical items, armor, and weapons. Certainly only the richest of the rich would be able to afford such rare items. I know that my ranting about this here will not change the pricing scheme, but I did want to address it.<br><br>On a side note, if they are going to cost so much, then I should have the right to sell or trade them if I deem it necessary. The NO DROP tag needs to be removed. If you can purchase something from a vendor, then you should also be able to sell it.<br></B><br><br>Horses are a status symbol. Regardless of what the relative cost of a horse to a magic sword would be in our world, on Norrath (Luclin, actually), horses are a rare and expensive item. They are a luxury item that only the rich and semi-rich can afford, but that only the very rich would buy. Yes, most people would rather purchase a powerful magic sword or some armor to turn someone else's magical sword. And that's the reason that horses are so expensive, because they are very rare, and because they are a status symbol that the very rich are willing to pay for.<br><br>As for reselling horses, we are looking into that. The current plan is to allow them to be sold back at a slight loss.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>I want a horse... what about you?<br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In an article by David Becker on CNET News.com is the following article:<br><br><blockquote>Gateway has found a new ally in its quest to convince consumers to upgrade their PCs: a half-man, half-tiger beast that wields a mean sword. <br><br>The struggling PC maker announced Tuesday a partnership with Sony Online Entertainment and chipmaker Intel to sell PCs optimized for the Sony online game "EverQuest." <br><br>Under the promotion, customers who buy a Gateway PC with an Intel Pentium 4 processor and one of two versions of packaged "EverQuest" software will receive several months of free access to the game's online service. "EverQuest" players pay monthly subscription fees of about $10 to access the game's online world.<br><br>The promotion makes more than marketing sense, as the newest version of the fantasy role-playing game is one of the most resource-intensive pieces of commercial software yet released. </blockquote><br><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-820195.html?legacy=cnet&tag=pt.msnbc.feed..ne_8563710" target="_blank">Read the entire news article on CNET</a>.

        [ 3:32 PM PST ] -</b></font><font color="ff0000" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Looking for an interesting event on the Fironia Vie server?<br><br><blockquote>The GUILDWARS of the Gods, is based loosely off of the recent writings of "The Codex of War" which contains various precepts of Norrathian History, located at www.1stfistoflight.com off of the Forums link, under "The War of the Gods". <br><br>The GUILDWARS of the Gods will be taking place only on the Firiona Vie Role Play Server. It is a running storyline that started between two guilds and their allies; the 1st Fist of Light and the Fist of Hate. They are nemesis guilds created for the intent of fighting one another in an evolving storyline through the use of creative guildwars that will have predefined rules and set conditions that will apply to them. <br><br>Examples of such rules will be: <br><br>Death rules, when your dead your dead and you do not re enter a fight. To help add to a sense of realism. This also includes no attacking dead people who are dragging corpses to a designated Graveyard (See Below). <br><br>Rules of area engagement, I.E. fights will be set per area. If you flee the area you are out of the battle and cannot re enter the combat area until its resolved. <br><br>Graveyards, where the dead can be drug to and looted so that they may then flee the combat area. When you loot and are dead in a Graveyard you must then flee the zone. <br><br>These are just a few examples of some of the rules that may be implied during the course of an engagement. Of course you also may not know when there will be an engagement. After all, that trip to go save someone might end up with Guildwar being thrown in secret beforehand and you just never know what exactly is going to be happening. <br><br>The entire scope of this evolving multi-guild server wide guildwar shall be engineered in a fashion similiar to that of a Dungeons and Dragons type game. The storyline will unfold based around character backgrounds and histories as they become relevant and exposed through the course of gameplay and interactions upon "The GUILDWARS of the Gods" forums located at www.1stfistoflight.com <br><br>This will be a war that spans across the Firiona Vie server, with multiple battles, that all take place, nestled within the shadows of the Prophecy of Trakanon and the end times of Norrath. All those interested whom are interested and currently not in a guild or involved in an allied guild should "sign up" for "enlistment" at the forums under "Recruiters Hall" and specify which side you are interested in fighting for. Those guilds that wich to particpate and not allied yet should also post within the "Recruiters Hall" as well. <br><br>The first battle which shall to tie into the storyline shall be "The Battle for Takish-Hiz". A small sample of what is to come, and yes folks it is a guildwar fought INSIDE a dungeon. All events involved with the war as they transpire shall be maintained upon "The Sages Scrolls", found upon the war forums. May the heavens shake with thunder, and ground tremble, for the fate of the world lies to the dogs of war. <br><br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>www.1stfistoflight.com <br>Firiona Vie</blockquote><br><br>It looks like it will an interesting time.  Check it out!

May also reduce the "hitch" when other players zone in, though it probably won't remove it completely<br><br>- May reduce the cases where some players experience a performance reduction after being in a zone for a while<br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing some portions of spell effects and the "bolts" in bolts spells to not show up.<br><br>- Generally improve stability.<br><br>How these changes affect individuals will vary, but we hope that this will improve game performance a bit over all.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></bockquote><br>

Is the Spirit level buff spell intended to be used as a complete heal spell for the warder? I ask becasue I am sure you already know it can be used as such. Post level 30 it is no more mana efficient to use the spirit buff over the rejuvanation spells, especially when you add in the mana cost of re-applkying other buffs. But Prior to level 30, usign the Spirit level buff as a complete heal is a very powerfullk technique that allows the Beaslord to handle many red conning MoBs by simply meditating while watching the Warders health get down near zero and then spirit buffing them bakc to full and re-applying the proc spell (after level 15). If this an intended side effect of the spell or is it considered a bug or an exploit that will be "fixed" in an upcoming patch?<br></B><br><br>This is indeed a bug. Buffs like that are not supposed to double as healing spells. We will be fixing it soon.<br><br>An another note, we will also be reviewing the AC on Beastlord armor, and may make some changes in the future. I'm not sure when or exactly what we'll be doing, so keep your eyes on the patch messages.<br><br>Alan<br></bockquote><br>Thanks Alan!<br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Giwat Nafoi let us know about the following GM event that took place on Innoruuk.. read on:<br><br><blockquote>A shout went up in the Lake of Ill Omen: a person named Hinarn McFiny was seeking a coin he had lost in his travels. Everyone else was arguing about Clarity or some nonsense, so I took him up on his offer. He replied that a terrible horned beast had snatched it away from him somewhere in the zone. Finally, a few more players shouted they would help retrieve the coin, so McFiny asked us to group at the mouth of the creek near the FV zone. <br><br>By the time I got there, at least 2 dozen people had banded together and began searching. Shortly thereafter, I was joined by my halfling companion Bytto and we got to work. The "Sea Monster" came ashore a short ways away from the creek, and the nuking began. When it hit about half health, it fled into the lake followed by angry players everywhere. For a time, the beast seemed lost, and McFiny was losing hope of retrieving his coin. I offered Enduring Breath to any brave soul that would hunt the monster, as track was not working on it, and an intrepid Barbarian named Schal took me up on that offer. She dived into the water and the hunt continued. The monster conned blue to Bytto (level 39) and very red to me at 22 (although I was able to land all my spells on him, so his resistance seemed weak). McFiny was enjoying a little fishing in the meantime. <br><br>Finally, some were shouting that the beast was dead...but what of the coin? No one fessed up to having it at first, so I shouted and immediatly received a tell from a Halfling named Dennun, a druid who had the coin and wanted to return it but needed a guide to McFiny's campsite. So I led him there and McFiny was overjoyed at the discovery. Dennun received Gator Sleeves and I got a Harpoon of the Depths. A few more rewards were handed out when the brave injured warriors returned after the beast's defeat. He then bade us farewell and went on his way. <br><br>Other notable players I don't want to leave out include Taedar, Fattbury, Jalon, Schal's good friend whose name eludes me, and anyone else whom I've forgotten (but you know who you are).</blockquote>Thanks Giwat!

As most of you are aware, we had a frustrating four-week period of sporadic outages due to hardware related problems with a new server we'd received. Yesterday, that server was completely replaced with a new server. Rather than trying to swap out various components any further to track the problem down, we decided to simply replace the entire thing just to make absolutely certain the matter is resolved once and for all. This is now done and everything seems to be moving along very nicely.<br><br>From all of us here at Stratics, thank you for your patience and understanding during this very difficult period. During the next two weeks you will begin to see a series of web site redesigns, which will kick-start many new services and features that will be found throughout the network. Not only will our sites become cleaner, faster and easier than ever to navigate, but you will also find new features being added to the web sites as well. More interactive and dynamic elements will begin to appear on our sites and we believe you'll really enjoy visiting our sites more than ever. We're very excited about all of this and now that the hardware related matters are behind us, we can focus on rolling this stuff out the door!<br><br>So once again, thank you for your patience and understanding. We hope you will enjoy the changes as they begin to appear. As always please feel free to contact me anytime if you have any questions and/or concerns about the Stratics Network.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Community Development<br><a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a><br>The Massively Multiplayer Network</blockquote>Thanks for the heads up!

I have recently compiled everything that I know into one Compendium of Lore called the "Codex of War". It details every GM Event of historical signifigance as well details the storyline to the game which involves the Prophecy of Trakanon, which in turn deals with the death of the Sleeper. <br><br>I wrote the compendium in a fashion so that it tells a story as you read it, that is in depth as well as informative. It is my hope that what is found within will also help those new to role playing or those that do not understand to come to understand or learn what role playing is about. <br><br>This Compendium was made to help all, regardless of your level or how long you have been playing. I most certainly hope that it does such, and bid you welcome to the War of the Gods. For in the end, the Truthbringer comes for all...<br><br>The Codex of War, can be found at <A HREF="http://www.1stistoflight.com" target="_blank">www.1stistoflight.com</A>,under "The War of the Gods" area off of the Forum's link.<br></blockquote><br>Enjoy!

Here is where we stand. Today or tomorrow, we will be receiving an entirely new server. Not a single component (i.e. SCSI controller, hard drive, etc.). We are getting an entirely new system with 100% of the components being new. <br><br>Rather than playing the hardware shuffle any longer, it was decided to simply replace the entire box and leave nothing more to chance. The server will be down during the course of the day today (01/15/02) and possibly tomorrow as well depending on how things go in the data center. We should then be back online and everything should be good to go from that point on. <br><br>I feel I must address the rumors that people like to start about Stratics dropping off the map and how we had a good run as if were packing our bags and closing shop. Nothing could be further from the truth. Weve simply had a very difficult situation with new hardware and a much less than responsive host with regard to support and turn-around times. Trust me when I say that wed not be remaining with this host if it were not in our best interest at this time. <br><br>This recent bout of hardware issues with our new server does not mean were going away or closing the network. On the contrary, we have a lot of exciting new plans for 2002 and were not going anywhere except forward. So when you see a post on some site stating that were closing our doors... keep in mind that they never came to us to find out the facts of the situation. No one posting such comments have. <br><br>I want to once again apologize to everyone for the inconvenience our downtime may have caused you, but we will be fully up to speed again shortly. This server replacement should address everything. By the way, while the main web server is being replaced, please do visit our forums. Maybe people have not even realized that even when the primary web server was down, our other servers have been online and running great. Our forums are available: <a href="http://boards.stratics.com.">http://boards.stratics.com.</a> We all understand it may take a couple weeks of being back before some are fully convinced, but thats okay. Well be here. ;) <br><br>Regards, <br><br>Jhariden <br>Community Development <br><br>Stratics <br><a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a> <br>The Massively Multiplayer Network</blockquote><br><br>Thanks for the heads up!<br><br>

It will indeed affect the game if you add this line to your eqclient.ini file (under the [Defaults] section). It, basically, disables Umbra functionality. <br>Let me try to explain when it might be useful to set add this line to your eqclient.ini file. <br>Turning off Umbra can have a big impact on the performance you see indoor Luclin zones. If you frequent such zones, adding this line and setting it False will probably be a bad thing. <br>If you don't have Luclin installed, then adding the line and setting it to false might be of some use to you, at least for a while (*I'll explain that later). <br>But for most situations it's not really possible for me to guess how it will affect you, since so much of performance is based on hardware and drivers. But you can certainly experiment with this switch if you'd like. For most people you will be better off not messing with it at all. <br>*(This is later)  We currently have some .dlls on the Test server that enhance the functionality of Umbra. For the most part setting this to False disables tools that improve your performance. With the fix we have on Test many of the issues that people are seeing seem to be corrected (hitches when people zone in and poor framerates). It is also very likely that some day soon we will be setting that UseUmbra switch programmatically and ignoring any setting in the eqclient.ini file so that you can get the best performance based on the zone you are in. <br>So please feel free to use this setting if you think it helps your system. But be aware that setting it False will probably harm your performance with indoor Luclin zones. <br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Thanks <b><i>Absor</b></i>.  What are your thoughts on this issue?

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here's some Q & A from <b><i>Absor</b></i> about Beastlord AC and weight limit.<br><blockquote><br><B><U>Silverlynx wrote:</U><br>In interviews with <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> employees before the release of Luclin it was stated multiple times that the beastlord would benefit from a monk-like AC bonus when fighting unarmed. The community assumed that this would bring with it a weight limit. The high end (kunark, planes, etc.) armors for the beastlords seem to bear this out. They, like the monk armors, are very low weight and very low armor class. Thus far there is no AC bonus for the beastlord (unarmed or not) and there is also no weight limit.<br><br>Will this be changing? <br></B><br><br>Beastlords do get a native armor class bonus. This bonus is not affected by the weight the Beastlord carries like the Monk's is, but it isn't as good as the one that Monks get either.<br><br><br><B><U>Sslaughter wrote:</U><br>You should really say something about the Kunark armor for Beastlord's then. I know you don't want to get into that much detail but it was the extremely low weight on these drops, along with unspeakably low AC, that lead people to the assumption that there would be a weight restriction and a very large AC bonus.<br>I bought some Rhino Hide Armor in Cabilis for my newbie Beastlord (Iksar equivalent of leather) and the AC on this is not very much lower than on the armor dropping in Karnor's/Sebilis.<br><br>I guess the basic question is: Is this a bug/oversight, or as intended? If it's as intended, could you guys share some of the rationale behind it?</B><br><br>The Beastlord is restricted to 'leather' armor. So AC on Beastlord armor is going to be lower than most classes. Armor for Beastlords is indeed rather similar than that of Monks. In exchange for Monkish armor and a resultant lesser AC in general (because Monks have that higher bonus), Beastlords get a bunch of other things, like pets, spells and such. The low weight on these items is pretty much just a bonus, and isn't meant to indicate that the Beastlord needs to carry less weight. The items are just lighter.<br><br>You can't judge parts of the class against other parts of another class without also including all the other things the class can do.<br><br>Alan<br><br>

The as-of-yet-unnamed company is currently seeking additional funding as they broker the publishing rights to their first independent title. <br><br>"Ever since I played my first MUD, my passion has been to create strong massively multiplayer communities," said Brad McQuaid, president of the new company. "With this venture, I can continue the terrific working relationship I have enjoyed with Jeff Butler while we realize our MMORPG ambitions. We believe we have just begun to explore the possibilities of this genre." <br><br>McQuaid and Butler are both creators of the massively multiplayer runaway hit "EverQuest," developed by <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> Interactive. The game shattered all multiplayer game records after its release in 1999, exceeding all industry expectations and inspiring three top-selling expansion packs. McQuaid is President and CEO of the new company, and Butler has assumed the role of Vice President.<br></blockquote><br>You can find Gamespy's interview with the Jeff and Brad <A HREF="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/fullstory.asp?id=2755" target="_blank"> Here </A>.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here's what <b><i>Absor</b></i> has to tell us about the updates:<br><blockquote><br>I apologize for the length of time since the last update. We've been trying to get a good grip on these problems, but some of them are elusive and have evaded our efforts thus far. We have made good progress on several of them, and expect to have some good results for you soon. Please note the italicized comments next to some of the entries.<br>We appreciate your patience as we work these few remaining issues out.<br><br>---<br><br>We're still working on some issues and we've fixed others. Keep in mind that we have a bunch of people working on things, so most of these items are on the top of someone's list. <br><br>While some of these issues only affect a tiny portion of our customers, we want to give a full and complete rundown of issues we are aware of. We will be keeping you updated as things change. Also, check the patch messages for more information. <br><br>Stuff in the works, some of these will be fixed with the next patch (in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them): <br><br>- Reducing loading and zoning times (Note: we have a possible improvement for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)<br>- There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone (Note: we have a possible fix for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)<br>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<br>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<br>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<br>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<br>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<br>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<br>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<br>- New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working/displaying properly (all fixed at this time except for Mind Wrack)<br>- A few players are being disconnected at random<br>- Partial transparencied NPCs are still showing up half invisible/behind things they're supposed to be in front of.<br>- Wizard pet buff spells do not appear to be functioning properly<br>- Druid pets, either charmed or 55 castable, cannot be buffed<br>- Familiars die when the wizard cast invisibility. When this happens no harm comes to the wizard, but the plan it to have them remain when the caster is invisible<br>- Luclin ports trying to take people that don't have Luclin (or the Luclin portal stone fragment) and dumping them at the 'safe point' in the zone<br>- Spell Reinforcement: Only the person who has the AA has their buffs last longer. There is no change in the most practical case: A person with the AA buffing another person. The other person does not get the added time<br>- Slow framerate on some fast computers*<br><br>*Every bug has its story. This one begins as an incompatibility between EverQuest, AMD processors and Umbra (a technology that, ironically, speeds up framerates). There is a known problem in the Umbra engine that was causing the crashes that some AMD users were originally seeing in Shadowhaven. In our desire to make sure that both Intel and AMD users could enter the game, we introduced another condition that unfortunately slowed down framerates in certain circumstances. We have one person working on nothing but this at the moment and he's made significant progress. We expect this problem to go away soon.<br><br><br>Fixed since release (in no particular order either): <br><br>- Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)<br>- Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die<br>- Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent<br>- Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.<br>- /follow bug that caused folks to crash<br>- Transparency issues with i810 display adapters<br>- Crash bug related to root and gate<br>- Various item and content fixes<br>- Crash problems in certain zones<br>- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. Shadowhaven is one of those zones.<br>- A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.<br>- Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans<br>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<br>- Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor<br>- A few people that dont have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing "Entering Luclin" when logging in and then crashing<br>- A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game. <br>- Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users<br>- New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely<br><br><br>Note: The inability to adjust gamma setting with some cards is an issue with cards that just don't support that ability. It's not really something we can fix in code. We are investigating to see if there are any possible workarounds out there for these older cards that are no longer supported by the manufacturer. <br><br><br>Tech Tip<br>- Pauses with Win 98/ME ONLY: A possible solution for those with a fair amount of RAM (technically, anyone with 128 megs or more) who are seeing pauses while the hard drive runs a bit, might benefit from this simple change (it's also easy to undo). It might also improve load and zone times. <br><br>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file: ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 <br><br>For best results, change only this setting (don't change a bunch of other stuff at the same time) and see how it performs. And if it isn't better or seems worse you can just erase that line from your System.ini file. I should tell you that this change might make EverQuest better and it might also cost you some performance with your system overall, though this does not seem to be the case for most people. Keep that in mind if you decide to use this tip. <br><br><br>Thank you all for your patience. We are working hard to get these issues straightened out as soon as possible. <br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>He then later replies to some questions<br><blockquote><br><B><U>Kluz wrote:</U><br>Hey <b><i>Absor</b></i>. Honestly, I was telling my brother this just last week...."Ya know..The Luclin Launch was comparable to Anarchy Online, but they did an incredible job cleaning up quickly". So, from me to the team, Good work. You've got at least one patient person here. I've still got minor issues, but...its Everquest, you guys are on the prowl.<br>Also wanted to say that I totally understand the priority of bugs over say...implementations and features. But..I gotta be honest...I'm getting very scared that the new interface and the /trader command are going to go the way of the Guild Halls (See Original everquest manual...i.e. "You can even buy your own guild hall) These two ideas are a long time coming, and...personally, having written a letter a week to <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> for over a year about the whole /trader command idea, I was very excited when the idea was confirmed. <br><br>Anyhow, not asking you to hurry, just wouldnt mind some mind candy in the form of an ETA or progress report. THanks<br></B><br><br>I just don't have an ETA on those items for you. I'm not listing them on the Luclin Update thing because, as you noted, they are features we want to add, not bugs that we need to fix. As such, they fall into a different category.<br><br>However, you will see those features. A lot of the work has been done already on both of them. I had a chance to try out the /trader stuff even before Luclin shipped, and with the exception of some details it's close to done.<br><br>But I can't really estimate when you'll see either the bazaar functionality or the new interface simply because there are other things taking precedence right now, and those are things that I don't have an estimate for completion on either. All I can say is that we'll get to them as soon as we can. I know that's not really what you want to hear, but it's the best we can do right now.<br><br><B><U>Tenbil En`Haldar wrote:</U><br>With regards to the translucent NPC problem, it's not just NPCs. My offhand sword has a translucent blade, and it disappears behind a portion of the screen (if you were to divide my screen into sections vertically, like a stack, it would disappear behind the middle section) when I see it swing in front of my character's face in first person mode. It's probably the same problem as translucent NPCs (or anything else translucent), but on the off chance it's not, I thought I'd point it out ... <br></B><br><br>That is probably the same thing. But the real issue is that when NPCs disappear they effectively become invincible, and that's a bad thing. <br> <br><B><U>Sinban wrote:</U><br><br>I know <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> has acknowledged that some of the new Luclin Bard songs are not working as intended.<br><br>Could you please include these in the "Luclin Updates" in the future, or comment on them now? If you read the update, the impression is that there are currently no outstanding bard issues.<br><br>The main one I have actually tested is Katta's. The proc seems to still cause complete song lock-up in some circumstances.<br><br>The others are well discussed in the support forum.<br><br>(At the least, can you tell us which ARE working as intended.....there is much depate on the forums on "Amplification" and the "Sustenance" ones for example.)<br></B><br><br>I did indeed forget to list the bard songs, and even after I talked to a bunch of people about them sorry.<br><br>It does seem that Katta's Song of Sword is causing the problem you described. We are also taking a look into Amplification to see if the effect is actually working, and we are aware that there is an issue with Battlecry of the Vah Shir. I'll add them to the next update.<br><br><B><U>Ompa wrote:</U><br><br>under the things fixed section you have:<br><br>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<br><br>Please move this to the being worked on, unless your not going to fix it(in which case please let us know as well), because last I checked something isn't fixed if your 'working on getting' it fixed...<br></B><br>Will do. I thought it was fixed, but it seems that for some of these races it is not.<br><br><B><U>Underling wrote:</U><br><br>That's nice and all, but can someone tell me when my Troll beastlord will have class graphic? It seems like something that would have been put in before the game shipped. I've sent comments before, but the only response I received was the canned reply about luclin problems.<br></B><br>I'm not going to add it to the list, but we'll certainly get the class icon put in when we get a chance.<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Wow! Thanks for that update :)

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Once again, <b><i>Absor</b></i> discusses some facts about the changes appearing and being made in game.  Here's the answers to some of the questions being asked:<br><blockquote><br><B><U>Glinlor wrote:</U><br>I know of the binding NPC's intresting though I had to pay for the spell and level my self up to get it. Shouldent it cost something? Would it not be to unfair for the binding npc to ask for 5gold or something?<br><br>And though the nexxus ports take a while, and ports are sposted to be class defineing(Ie Wizard) but where are my Clarity NPC's or Sow NPC's<br><br>To me I think in the changing of the game the NPC's that bind are ballanceing considering each caster of 12th level can bind. <br><br>Can we ballance this a bit more or are you tottaly happy with what you see.<br><br>(Btw- I like the kind of responces being showen, this is a good topic)<br></B><br>Yes, you did have to level up a bit and pay a few gold to earn the spell as a caster. But for you the spell is far more versatile than the soulbinders, easily justifying the effort and cost. While we certainly could have charged for the service from an NPC, we decided just to make it free. So far it seems as though this was the right decision.<br><br>The Nexus portals have similar restrictions. They take time and only take you to limited locations. Spell casters that can port have a much broader selection and can do so without delay.<br><br>For now I wouldn't be looking for any other spell-casting NPCs. Obviously nothing is out of consideration (never say never), but we're not planning any new changes along these lines right now.<br><br>I think we're pretty happy with the soulbinders as they are, so I don't think you'll see any changes to them.<br><br>I like these topics too. It's always interesting to share our perspective with all of you and to hear yours.<br><br><br><B>Short Version:<br><br>I agree with the player that said I'ts better to give the players the TOOLS to make solutions than to solve the problems for them.<br><br>-W</B><br><br>I only disagree with that idea when the issue that needs to be addressed is one where the availability of the players to solve the problem is part of the problem.<br><br><br><B><U>Oualawouzou wrote:</U><br>quote:<br>----------------------------------<br>but if you want to hang a picture it's probably better to just put the nail where you want it than just shooting at the wall with a nail gun until you hit the right spot <br>----------------------------------<br><br>Aren't you neglecting the fun factor here?<br></B><br>I might be. But then someone has to act like an adult around this place<br><br><B><U>Zephaus Rootwine wrote:</U><br>You saidL "And it's [tradeskill fixes] not a bad idea, really. But, well, you'd probably still have exactly the same problem if you play off-peak hours. Instead of finding a bind you have to find a tinker or alchemist with the skill to make the item you need. While this might not be a problem, it still leaves a large potential that the same people that can't find a player to bind them before would still be stuck."<br><br>However, once the bazaar is up and running as it was originally intended (that is still the plan, right?) then this will cease to be a problem, correct? Tinkerer's and Alchemists will be setting up shop to sell their wares. Viola.<br></B><br><br>Well, viola for those that have Luclin (of course, everyone should go out and buy Luclin right away), but not for those that don't.<br><br><br><B><U>Mulamasi_KotWR wrote:</U><br><br>Whats wrong with shooting at a wall with a nail gun? <br></B><br>Probably nothing for those that own their homes. For us renters, however, there might be legal issues<br><br><br><B><U>Tabril Wrote:</U><br>> The idea of a trade skill item was one that<br>> we thought about. In fact, I remember a<br>> discussion with a player about that very<br>> thing on the message boards a while ago.<br><br>> And it's not a bad idea, really. But, well,<br>> you'd probably still have exactly the same <br>> problem if you play off-peak hours. Instead<br>> of finding a bind you have to find a tinker<br>> or alchemist with the skill to make the item<br>> you need. While this might not be a problem,<br>> it still leaves a large potential that the<br>> same people that can't find a player to bind<br>> them before would still be stuck.<br><br>Why? Not at all actually. It just requires some forward planning. No different than buying food before heading deep into a dungeon. If I'm a character that can't bind, then I best work on that solution while I can. Which is when people are on. Save up a couple auto-bind trinkets and BAM! bound when I need it. Busy time or not. When I've used up almost my supply... would I go looking for more when nobody is on, or take care of it, while there's people on. Tuck them away for when I need them and nobody is around...<br><br>I think that it's a perfect solution, and as the other player pointed out... requires us to work on the solution not have it handed to us.<br></B><br><br>Actually, it would be very different than stocking up on food. You can buy that food at any time from a vendor. Some people have a hard time getting a chance to play at 'peak' times, and seeking a player made item for a bind would really be a problem.<br><br>But like I said, the trade skill idea isn't a bad one, it's just that the potential for an incomplete solution exists. In fact, it seems likely since the source of the problem is player character availability at off hours.<br><br><B><br>Hey!<br><br>I enjoy shooting nail guns at just about anything.<br>I suppose a wall is as good a target as say...elves, just not as much fun.<br><br>-violing<br></B><br>Or dwarves. Often they don't even notice it, and you can try drawing designs on their backs<br><br><B><U>Cantatus wrote:</U><br>>>The Nexus portals have similar restrictions. They take time and only take you to limited locations. Spell casters that can port have a much broader selection and can do so without delay.<br><br>You can't teleport to Luclin without the use of the Nexus, so regardless you still have the delay and can't find a caster to speed up the process.<br></B><br>That's not what I was talking about. Using the Nexus a character can 'port' himself from Antonica to Kunark without the help of a player character. But they are restricted in this ability by time and location, where a character that can cast teleportation spells has a much greater range of places he can go to and he can go in the blink of an eye.<br><br>Alan<br><br>

Here's a snip of the review: <br><blockquote><br>But overall, the gameplay seems no better or worse than what was delivered in ROK. It just feels like you're playing with kitties instead of lizards.

Well here is Stratics official stance on the matter:<br><blockquote><br>Stratics does not directly control the content of the advertising we're currently running because the ads are managed through a third party. We do not currently have the ability to screen all advertisements before they appear on our pages. We are working on a means to manage all such ads in the future, but at the present time, we can only react, right along with the rest of our viewers, when such offensive advertising appears on our pages. <br><br>We have repeatedly asked for such ads to be screened from our rotation but our advertising host has not been fully attentive to these requests. They do tend to act quickly when we approach them about particular ads and the current ad that has so many people in an uproar is being removed.<br></blockquote><br>Rest assured, we are doing our best to eliminate this popup, along with any other inappropriate ones.<br>

Here's what he says in responce to some more Q and A:<br><blockquote><br><U>Lenkyl Greatstorm</U> Wrote:<br><B>ok, so let me get this straight... you're saying that you're careful about changes because you might make people mad. with the same paragraph you also imply that the only reason you commit to a change is when it will make the least players mad. all the while saying that you're weighing what's best for the game. so you're telling me that if a change needed to happen in the game it might actually be held up because of a player majority that didn't like it and was vocal about not liking it?? i understand you guys are in business to make money, but ****** that kind of thinking is dangerous. i just hope that verant will have the courage to make a change in the face of player outcry. i remember what happened with TLC. i am against the version that was implemented then removed. i would most likely have quit because of it. i do, however, like the things i see coming from the umbral plains. the step-up approach seems to me to be a great way to look at the problem. just, please, don't bail on standards. don't let the playerbase ruin the game by demanding and stomping their feet. always do what's best for the game. the playerbase may shift, but it will be there and when the game is better, it will be stronger.</B><br><br>Well, I think we've shown that we have the "courage to make a change in the face of player outcry". I can still remember the Fan Faire that I had to go to right after we changed the effect on the Donal's Chestplate  Though I had expected to be beaten by clerics, instead I met a bunch of cleric players that said that even though they didn't like the change, they understood it. Some of them even bought us drinks. <br><br>I suppose what I wrote might have sounded confusing because, well, the process is complicated. Yes, we are in business to make money. That means that we need to listen to what our customers say they want. But we also have to make sure that giving some players what they want won't upset more people than it pleases. And on top of all of that we also have to remember that in the long run it's the quality and integrity of the game that really makes people happy, and that doing something that lessens either of those is a very bad thing.<br><br><U>Xev</U> wrote:<br><B>You have mentioned that some of the dev team fear a negative repercussion to player interaction. <br><br>First, the soulbinders are scattered enough and located in some non-optimal spots so player binds remain in demand.

It's very hard to judge the reactions of our entire customer base from the reactions of a few players. And it is human nature to try to affect change when you are not happy and to be content (and quiet) when you are. That's why I think it's important for us to keep our eyes on the overall good of the game as well as customer feedback and suggestions.<br><br><U>Lanceor</U> wrote:<br><B>Soulbinders - A good idea on the surface, but a bad idea in practice.<br><br>Alternative #1 - Shaman created Potions of Binding. Cost to construct, roughly 4pp. Typical selling price? 5-8pp each and can be combined into a stack of 10. Will only work for the user in a location they can normally bind in (i.e. sorry warriors, cities only).<br><br>Alternative #2 - Encephalographic Magnetic Location Instigator. A 10-pound box, size giant, with 1 charge of Bind Affinity. Created using tinkering skill. Construction cost, roughly 35-50pp. Typical selling price? 65-75pp. Allows non-caster types to bind in zones and locations that typically only casters can bind in (hey, there better be a benefit to carrying something that large, that expensive, and that also won't fit into most containers).<br><br>Pros: <br>1. Just like soulbinders, players do not need someone else around when they want to get a bind.<br>2. Increased use and demand for trade skills.<br>3. Increased participation in the "player-driven" economy.<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Still some times when off-peak hours will see issues with getting a bind, albeit, less so.<br>2. Monetary cost imposed.<br><br>The key point is to introduce the ability for players to solve their own problems. Creating NPCs to solve issues is like asking our government to solve our problems for us. In most cases, we don't want you/<a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> to solve the problem, but at least give us the ability to solve it ourselves.<br><br>In total honesty, many problems like this can be solved by creating a tradeskill constructed item of some kind. The web pages for tinkering are filled with astoundingly good ideas from some seriously creative people. To be sure, some items would create balance problems, but I think you would be surprised at what restrictions people are willing to accept when you place that "burden of balance" on their shoulders<br></B><br><br>The idea of a trade skill item was one that we thought about. In fact, I remember a discussion with a player about that very thing on the message boards a while ago.<br><br>And it's not a bad idea, really. But, well, you'd probably still have exactly the same problem if you play off-peak hours. Instead of finding a bind you have to find a tinker or alchemist with the skill to make the item you need. While this might not be a problem, it still leaves a large potential that the same people that can't find a player to bind them before would still be stuck.<br><br>This idea will probably bubble around in my head, at least, for a while yet. But in the end the soulbinders are a much more solid and controllable solution for us. With the soulbinders we know we are fixing the issue in the places and situations we want to address. Freedom is all well and great, but if you want to hang a picture it's probably better to just put the nail where you want it than just shooting at the wall with a nail gun until you hit the right spot. <br><br>I love my bad analogies. <br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Thanks for that added info!<br><br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A poster on <B>The Station</B> boards asked if there are any new changes occurring, and if so, why?  <b><i>Absor</b></i> had this to say in response to the inquiry:<br><blockquote>Well, there really are two considerations involved here: team dynamics and the health of the game itself.<br><br>Probably the most important thing is the team dynamic. We are just like any other group of people. One day we can all agree that the sky is blue. But over time we can be convinced, as individuals or as a group, that the sky is in fact yellow. As the team changes, as the game expands, and as the game itself changes, so do we. Especially when you're talking about the soulbinder thing. I think it's fair to say that we've been on the fence about it as a group for a long time. There really are reasonable arguments for and against doing it. We have debated this issue in several forms since I started here.<br><br>Very few changes that we make are sudden. But for those that aren't here, in meetings and sitting around the lunch table, I can see how it might seem like a sudden switch.<br><br>I think it's also important to understand that once we add something like this, it's fair to say that we really can't take it back. So when we're on the fence, when arguments on both sides are equal and the net result is hard to determine beforehand, it is probably always better to make the mistake that is reversible.<br><br>Focusing on the soulbinders as an example, we don't know how these NPCs will affect the interaction between players. We don't know how it will affect the economy for lower level PCs, who can often make a good living being helpful to others by binding them. On the other hand, adding these NPCs reduces the frustration level for some players that play at off-peak times when finding a bind can be a problem.<br><br>You also talked about how these changes are being applied gradually. We never really want to introduce a ton of changes at one time. Despite the seemingly popular desire for soulbinders, I'm already getting plenty of mail from people that don't like it (those are the people that made money selling binds). And I, for one, am convinced that this is one change will affect the social dynamics of the game, perhaps in a negative way. Before making any other changes that might affect the social nature of the game, it seems like a wise idea to examine the effects of any similar changes made previously.<br><br>So we make changes one at a time when we can. It makes it easier to judge the overall effect on the game world.<br><br>I read plenty of message boards. I think I'm fairly well aware of the desires of those that post about EverQuest (though I am also aware that there are many people that just play the game and never come to message boards at all, either to post or read, and we have to try to be aware of those people too). There have been a few times since I took this job that we've implemented a change based on what seemed like the desire of the majority of players, only to receive an overwhelming amount of email from people that didn't like the change. It is very hard to claim that any suggestion has the near unanimous support of the player base. So we try to be careful making changes. EverQuest is a great game right now. It's hard to say what changes might make it better and what changes might only seem to make it better. We have to use our judgement on these things as best we can.<br><br>Anyway, those are my thoughts on the issue. :)<br><br>Alan<br></blockquote><br>Well now you know!<br>The full thread can be found <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000443.html" target="_blank"> Here </A>.<br>
