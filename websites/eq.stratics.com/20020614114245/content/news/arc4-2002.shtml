        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Those who attended the E3 conference and expo this year were treated with the vision of what the world of Norrath is to turn into.  We were shown the first glimpses of EverQuest 2 in action, one of the first in-depth looks at EverQuest: Adventures, and then plans for the future of the classic EverQuest 1.  All I can say about all three is that they are amazing in their own right.  EverQuest is being taken to new heights and both EverQuest 2 and EverQuest: Adventures are making ground breaking entrances into the gaming world of MMORPGs.<br><br>Ill concentrate with the two games that Stratics covers in this article however, and treat you to what was learned about the games and my personal impressions of them.  (EverQuest and EverQuest 2)<br><br>While I dont have much experience in the plane raid aspect of EverQuest, I do know that the Planes of Power expansion is doing some really awesome things to that aspect of EverQuest.  The new planes look spectacular, and the epic battles involved with it look like they are going to be tremendous.  There were also some very interesting facts we learned about how the expansion is going to be set up.  Unlike many of the previous expansions, there is going to be a good deal of content added for existing lower level characters so that they may fully enjoy the experiences of the expansion.  There are also plans to ship this new expansion with copies of Everquest Classic so that new players joining the game will be able to delve right into the new content without purchasing a separate box for it.  I think this is a great idea, it allows people to hop right into the expansion action as soon as they receive the game.  Im personally looking forward very much to being at the level where I can go and test out some of these new mega-mobs.  <br><br>One extra tidbit that we learned about the latest EverQuest expansion is that high level advancement is going to be beefed up big time.  We asked if they would be raising the level limit, and while they wouldnt give us a yes or no it sounded like that is the most obvious choice to me.  But, that is only me guessing and nothing is definite yet at all from SOE regarding what they will actually put into the game regarding new high level advancement opportunities.<br><br>After the Planes of Power expansion demo we made our way over to the EverQuest 2 station all I can say is WOW.  EQ2 took the cake in the graphics department for any MMOG at the show in my opinion.  The level of detail that is etched on armor and walls while also being spread throughout entire towns is truly amazing.  We saw a few monsters in action whose movements and graphics were incredible.  There was also this one frog that they were showing off to viewers, who in all honestly looked more real than a real frog!  Well, maybe it looked a lot like one of those tropical frogs but it was still beyond belief in what they are managing to pull off with this game.  <br><br>Unfortunately they were not able to release much game info at this time, but from what they were able to show us the game is going to be great.  (If they are able to keep along with the same level of work that weve seen so far from them)<br><br>The one thing that we were able to solidly gather from the demonstration was that EQ2 was going to be a whole new game from the original EverQuest.  Features like decay of items, no XP loss upon death, and a whole new story line set it apart from its predecessor.  <br><br>The story takes place during a new era of Norrathian history a good number of years after the original EQ.  We were told that there will be enough time between the two to dramatically change the landscape of the world of Norrath, but still a short enough period of time so that we will see some familiar NPCs scattered throughout the world.  <br><br>All in all I was very impressed by both of the games, and think they will add whole new dimensions to the world of EverQuest; both as we know it today and in the future.  I cant wait to see what comes next in this line of award winning games from SOE.  <br>

It is clocking in at 23 minutes and a total of 17 MB's. At this point, I'm only using Windows Media Player, so it is in WMV format, which should allow for both streaming and download options. <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/interviews/richardontr.WMV">Click Here For The Interview</a> Again, just a reminder about my post a couple days ago, this is an interview with the Stratics Staff and Richard Garriott, discussing NCSoft's game-in-development, <b>Tabula Rasa</b><br><br>Joshua Rowan.</blockquote><br><br>It was great fun, and for those of you coming from UO or any of the NCSoft games it might be a special read for you.

E3 was a fantastic show, and nothing could describe the feeling that one feels from being there.<br><br>I wish I could upload the pictures and write a few articles right now, but my eyes are about to fall out of my head I'm so tired. <br><br>Stay tuned for articles, pictures, and interviews tomorrow and throughout the rest of the week. We'll all do our best to replicate the feeling of being at the expo for all of you who were not able to make it this year. <br><br>But I really do have to say it, EQ looked FANTASTIC at the show and I can't even desribe how great the game looks.  It really truly is beyond imagination right now.  So stay tuned for featured articles in the next few days, you won't be dissapointed.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Five of us from Stratics had the very fortunate opportunity to visit the SOE booth today at E3.  All that I can personally say about it is that the presentations from the Sony teams were fantastic.  I&#8217;ve seen things today that will bring Everquest to new heights that it&#8217;s never seen before, bringing new content, ingenuity and spark to the three year old classic.  I&#8217;ve got to say that the people who put together the SOE booth and presentations created a first rate showing, impressing me almost as much as the games itself with their truly sense of class towards everyone who saw what they had to show. <br><br>It&#8217;s been three 18 hour days of some great experiences and an in-depth look at the latest upcoming games, but also happened to be very tiring at the same time.  We&#8217;ve got some great articles, screenshots, movies and other in-depth coverage of the convention coming your way starting tonight and all through next week.  I&#8217;ll personally start as soon as I get some sleep and hope to have them up by tomorrow night at the latest.  Tune in to see a plethora of articles from the rest of the Stratics team along with some exclusive screenshots and movies.  <br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One poster asked why certain races got Physical Enhancements, and others did not.  <b><i>Absor</b></i> answers with:<br><blockquote><B>""This ability adds an additional 2% to the Natural Durability, Combat Agility and Combat Stability archetypes.<br>There is no pre-requisite that these archetypes be trained in, however the greatest effectiveness is achieved from doing so. It is believed that you need at least 1 point in an archetype to get the 2% increase in it (i.e. you would get no benefit in Natural Durability if you only had points in Combat Agility and Stability).""<br><br>Most every melee type has this skill under Archtype, Paladin, Ranger, Shadowknight, even Beastlord. But seems Warrior, Rogue and Monk are missing it, or were left out specifically. What was the reasoning behind this?<br><br>Renaan Hellfire<br>Tarew Marr</b><br><br>This ability came out of beta testing for Luclin.<br><br>Originally there were just the basic archetype abilities.<br><br>But there was some discussion among the testers about the usefulness of those abilities for hybrids. The logic went something like this.<br><br>Lets assume that a theoretical hybrid was 75% as effective as a warrior in each of those melee aspects (the warrior being the base at 100%).<br><br>If we boost the warriors ability by 5% (of the 100) he gains 5%.<br>If we boost the hypothetical hybrid by 5% (of the 75) he gains (gets out a calculator) 3.75%.<br><br>So the warrior with one level of the skill is 105% and the hybrid is 78.75%.<br><br>So rather than the hybrid being 25% less than the warrior, hes 26.25% less<br><br>As you add the levels of these bonuses up, you end up increasing the gap between the hypothetical hybrids melee skills and those of the warrior.<br><br>Now there was indeed much discussion about this, because if you look at it the other way, the hybrid is still 75% of the warrior (105 x .75 = 78.75). But in the end we decided to allow the hybrids to purchase a little more effectiveness.<br><br>Thats why its only available to the hybrids.<br><br>And, no, I dont really want to debate the numbers. My head already hurts. <br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks, Alan!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As most people know, E3 is going on right now.  A ew posters had asked how <b><i>Absor</b></i> was doing at E3, and he responds with:<br><blockquote><B>Hey Alan, how's E3 going anyways, I've made it in the past (99 was my last one I think) but life doesn't allow me much travel these days. (I used to the Siggraph, e3, comdex, nab et al circuit)<br>Anyways, just sitting here thinking about my favorite game, had a few comments come to mind:<br><br>About the balacing, bazaar, interface, and such "issues"... what I'm seeing a rather small company (<a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> is still a small company, even with the backing of Sony) trying to do too many things at once. I think you'd have a better chance at getting thigs out on time if you'd make less "promises" and just started working on one project or 2 at a time. I understand research and developement must go on for future projects, but I personally don't care if the bazaar and new interface come out late, but as yet they haven't come out at all. If you really have 2 full teams, one working on each project, why not merge the 2, bust out ONE project, then focus on the next?<br><br>I thought of this as a distraction to cleaning my apartment, and thinking "why do I waste all my time trying to clean 4 rooms at once, when I should just clean one to completion, then hit the next?"<br><br>Consider it. I'm sure you all have a lot more business training than I do, but I've run a quite sucessful company on my own for over 5 years now and I cannot understand the logic of spreading your resources (programmers) so thin. <br><br>/cheer and good luck at E3, looks like Sony is about to murder the Xbox, and I'm sure <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> is putting up quite a show as well =)<br><br>my 2?<br>-Doug</b><br><br>Im not going to E3 this year. They didnt need me for the booth so I figured Id stay here.<br><br>As for resources, theres a reason we cant just drop everyone on one project at a time. A lot of it has to do with job skills. You dont really want our designers doing PoP art, and our programmers dont do class balancing (though they do have their opinions). So we just cant toss everyone at each project.<br><br>And, using your example, it wouldnt be all the useful to have 20 people cleaning your kitchen. With any project theres a point where more people dont add to the speed the work gets done, and more than that often slow things down. Heh, just picture a gaggle of artists (thats the official term for a bunch of artists, I think) trying to model the same character <br><br>And a lot of project timing is out of our hands. We just cant ask them to hold off E3 for a month or two while we do other things.<br><br>I cant wait to hear the feedback from E3. I think well impress at least a few people.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Can't wait to get some more info from E3!

One poster asked where the 'expected' changes had gone, as they had been stated to be implemented over a month ago.  Here's what <b><i>Absor</b></i> says:<br><blockquote><B>"In the coming weeks, we'll be adding more focus items to the game as quest rewards, trade skill items, and as loot off of monsters. There is a high chance that we'll be upgrading many existing caster items to include focus effects, to keep casters from needing to start from scratch with their gear selections."<br>That was posted upon 3/21/02, it is now 5/22/02. The question that begs to be asked is where are these 'other' focus items? To date the only non summoned focus item found is the 8th Shawl quest.<br><br>You started off strong with caster balancing but lately...<br><br>Bril</B><br><br>Sorry about that. Its no excuse, but the reality is that we have a lot going on here, E3 not the least of them. Its one rather complicated balancing act.<br><br>But I assure you that the work on balancing continues, as does the work on the new interface and the bazaar. Im not going to be able to give you any solid dates, but hopefully well have more for you on all these items soon.<br><br>I have heard that the next steps in caster balance will be to finish up with pets, then probably move on to the priest classes for a bit.<br><br>Our desire is to do it properly, and for that well just need more time. All I can do is ask for your understanding and sympathize with your frustration. We all want this to be done so we can move on to the next thing, and the team is working very hard to make that happen.</blockquote>Hope you can get through all your work fast :)

        [ 11:24 AM PDT ] -</b></font><font color="ff0000" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <a href="mailto:eqnews@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Abombpk</a></font>
        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here it is, From <a href="http://www.verant.com" target="_blank">Verant</a> to all you Stormhammer players out there:<br><blockquote>New Target Reservation System Announced <br><br>Dear Legends Subscribers, <br><br>Through the course of Stormhammer's history, we have come to better understand the situation of guild competition for encounters. While such competition is an undeniable part of the "end game" of EverQuest, it can lead to considerable ill will between competing members, which in turn can lead to a negativity of the game in general. The large numbers of high level characters on Stormhammer exasperates this situation, leading to many spawn disputes that overall detract from the level of service we can offer to all of our customers. To address this and help build a positive community, we are offering a Calendar Reservation System for select encounters. <br><br>While we understand the feelings against a reservation system, we think what we have devised allows room for both friendly competition as well as the much desired ability to conduct raids at a leisurely pace without competitors at your heels. Obviously, this system will require your support, involvement and feedback to make it a success. <br><br>We have set up a new e-mail address for feedback and correspondence for the Reservation System, LegendsRS@soe.sony.com. I encourage you to visit the Developer Corner area where the Instructions, FAQ and Targets are listed and write us with your thoughts. Once we have the monsters patched into the Arena to be able to start the Trial of Heroes we will set up as many guild trials as possible to get everyone interested assigned into Tiers. This should happen in the early part of this coming week. We will let you know when we are ready to schedule Trials. <br><br>We thank everyone for their continued patronage of Legends that allows us to offer such a system. <br><br>Respectfully, <br><br><br>Alex von Minden <br><br>Lead Game Master Bordael <br>Legends Service <br><br><br><br><br><br>05/18/2002 8:00 pm Lead GM Bordael - Calendar Reservation System FAQ <br><br>EverQuest Legends Target Reservation System <br><br>FAQ <br><br>What is the EverQuest Legends Target Reservation System? <br><br>It's a service provided with your Legends subscription to allow fair play and planning for higher end content of EverQuest. <br><br><br>What does a guild need to do to be part of the reservation system? <br><br>The ability to be part of the reservation system will involve passing the appropriate Trial of Heroes for the Tier your guild wishes to be part of and sending in the required reservations requests and weekly reports. <br><br><br>What days can you reserve a target on the system? <br><br>The reservation system will begin on Wednesday when the server comes live (or 12 Noon Pacific, whichever is applicable) and will end on Saturday evening at 11 PM Pacific. <br><br><br>What happens on days not recognized by the reservation system? <br><br>From Saturday after 11 PM Pacific until Wednesday at 12 Noon Pacific, all listed targets will be viewed as "free for all". Any spawn disputes during these times will be handled in accordance with the Play Nice Policies as normal. <br><br><br>What will happen if a guild ignores the reservation and kills something my guild has reserved? <br><br>The Legends staff will strictly enforce violations of the reservation system. In the unfortunate event someone chooses to ignore the system it will be treated like any other breech of Terms of Service.. <br><br><br>What happens if we reserve a target and it does not spawn during the allotted time? <br><br>A reservation of an encounter does not guarantee it will be up for engagement. However the target is yours until your guild has slain said target during the reservation days or the reservation time is over. Scheduled maintenance and emergency downtime will advance the rotation should the target come up, be slain and come back up again in the days of enforcement. <br><br><br>Once my guild has been accepted to the reservation system how do we make a reservation for the four-day block? <br><br>All reservations will be made via email to LegendsRS@soe.sony.com beginning Saturday at 2 PM Pacific Time and closing Monday at 10 PM Pacific Time. Only the guild leader or a designated officer may submit the guild's requests. Each guild will be restricted to having one person in charge of sending this email. <br><br><br>How many encounters can be reserved? <br><br>A guild can request reservation of any of the Targets from the Tier they are registered for and down. A guild that is registered for Tier 8 may request reservation for any of the targets in the system. <br><br><br>What is to keep a guild from recruiting and making it to a high tier standing and then falling apart but still taking spawns in the rotation? <br><br>Any guild that fails to slay any of their reserved targets in two consecutive weeks, for whatever reason, will be moved down a Tier. <br><br><br>What is to keep a guild from "temp" guilding members in order to pass a Trial in order to be able to reserve additional targets? <br><br>EverQuest servers log guild movement activities. Any significant guild movement can lead to an investigation into whether a guild is engaging in such activity. Based on the results of our investigation and our sole discretion to uphold the intent and spirit of the Target Reservation System, such activity could lead to disciplinary action on the involved accounts. <br><br><br>What will happen if two guilds request the same target during a week? <br><br>Rotation of targets over as many weeks as there are applicants will be set in the Bazaar via /random by a GM. Once the first guild has been set randomly, it will proceed through the other guilds that requested the target in alphabetical order until all guilds have had one reservation for the target. Then, the target will come open again for reservation. <br><br><br>What about encounters not listed on the target list? <br><br>Any target not listed is deemed "free for all" and can be engaged by any group during the calendar week, as things were prior to this system. Please be advised that the list of targets for the Reservation System is subject to change. <br><br><br>What if a guild asks to reserve a target they cannot kill? <br><br>Target reservation will be done through a tier system. Guilds can only reserve targets that are in their tier or below. Guilds must pass a Trial of Heroes to be admitted into a tier. <br><br><br>Can you still do joint raids? <br><br>Guilds can join to take down larger opponents. However, parties wishing to run a joint raid on a target above their own tier level must pass a trial for the tier with the guild or guilds who will be assisting them. Trials may be restricted in the number of people who may participate. <br><br>For example: Guild A and Guild B cannot take down Tunare by themselves. Guild A and Guild B schedule a trial and together pass the trial for the tier Tunare is on. Now Guild A and B can ask for reservation of Tunare but the two guilds would share one slot on that tier's rotation. <br><br><br>What about the Planes, Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox? Why are they not on the rotation list? <br><br>The planes of Hate, Fear, Air and Growth are not on enforced rotation. We will list them as well as the old world dragons for informational purposes only. Any group who wishes to list their intent to adventure in these areas or go after Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox may make their intention known on the weekly Reservation System Post. However, this will not insure that the group making the listing will have exclusive rights to these areas or targets. The listing is to help facilitate others in planning their activities and foster communication between groups who wish to do the same thing at the same time. <br><br><br><br><br>05/18/2002 8:00 pm Lead GM Bordael - Calendar System Tiers, Targets and Trial of Heroes <br><br>List of Tiers and Targets <br><br>Tier 1 <br>Venril Sathir <br>Trakanon <br><br>Tier 2 <br>Velketor the Sorceror <br>Rhag`Mozdeth <br>Temple Veeshan "Halls of Testing" <br>Veeshan's Peak <br>Innoruuk <br>Marauders Mire <br><br>Tier 3 <br>The Itraer Vius <br>Zlandicar <br>Klandicar <br>Rhag`Zhezum <br>Dain Frostreaver IV <br>Eashen of the Sky <br>Ikatiar the Envenomed <br>Temple Veeshan "West" <br>Lenindara the Keeper <br><br>Tier 4 <br>Thought Horror Overfiend <br>King Tormax <br>Cazic Thule <br>Statue of Rallos Zek <br><br>Tier 5 <br>Grieg Venificus <br>Glyphed Serpent <br>Vyzh`Dra the Exiled <br><br>Tier 6 <br>Temple Veeshan "North" <br>Lord Yelinak <br>Xerkizh the Creator <br><br>Tier 7 <br>Burrower Parasite <br>Shei Vinitras <br>Tunare <br>Avatar of War <br><br>Tier 8 <br>Arch Lich Rhag`Zhadune <br>High Priest of Ssraeshza <br><br>Please be advised that the list of encounters are subject to change. <br><br><br>Trial of Heroes <br><br>Trials will expect your guild to conquer foes of difficulty equivalent to those that you wish to reserve. Your guild's contact person will schedule a time for your guild to undergo their trial. Initially, we will schedule Trials with the guild on an as needed basis. Once all interested guilds are ranked, we will have open Trial times every other weekend. Any one guild may only attempt a Trial once in a two week period. <br><br>Once in the Arena, the Guild will be expected to be buffed and ready for their Trial at the time it is scheduled. This will necessitate that the guild arrives beforehand and be ready to go at their appointed time. We will spawn the Monster and close the door to the Arena. Players will not be allowed to bind in the area inside the door to bind rush nor will additional people be allowed to join once the Trial is underway. <br><br>The different Monsters in the Trial are based off the real NPCs as listed below, so plan your tactics accordingly. They will not look the same, there will not be any loot on these monsters nor will any faction be gained or lost in killing them. <br><br>Tier 1 - Venril Sathir <br><br>Tier 2 - Velketor the Sorceror <br><br>Tier 3 - Ikatiar the Envenomed <br><br>Tier 4 - King Tormax <br><br>Tier 5 - Statue of Rallos Zek <br><br>Tier 6 - Lord Yelinak <br><br>Tier 7 - Tunare <br><br>Tier 8 - Avatar of War</blockquote><br>Enjoy :)

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hello Folks,<br><br>Recently we have been accused of being the senders of virus infected emails to visitors of our site. Viruses seem to have been sent from various addresses in the stratics.com domain. Let me assure you that we are not sending out virus infected emails at all. <br><br>Closer inspection shows that although our address shows in the 'From' line of the email, the email was not sent from here. In all cases the evidence pointed out that an internet worm 'Klez' was responsible for this. Here is how it works: Suppose that John Doe is an online gamer who once emailed us a comment, and has some of our web pages copied to his local disk. When a Klez worm somehow has infected John's machine, it will scan the local disk for email addresses and send itself to a random found email address and stick another random found email address in the 'From' line of the email. John's friend could be receiving such an infected email from John's PC with as sender forumhelp@stratics.com or any other Stratics email address that was found on John's PC. <br><br>In fact, we are receiving more and more of those emails ourselves, which tells us that the Klez worm is still spreading. Needless to say, we'd like this to stop. Not only is this causing an annoyance for us and for the people that think we are sending them a virus, there is also a potential danger of files being erased or damaged on infected machines. On the 6th of every odd numbered month (except January or July), the worm attempts to overwrite with zeroes files that have the extensions .txt, .htm, .html, .wab, .doc, .xls, .jpg, .cpp, .c, .pas, .mpg, .mpeg, .bak, or .mp3. If the month is January or July, this payload attempts to overwrite all files with zeroes, not just those with the aforementioned extensions. Also, Klez tries to disable several virus scanners, leaving your PC wide open for other virus attacks. You can read more about what Klez can do <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e@mm.html" target="_blank">here</a>. <br><br>So, whatever you are going to do today, <B>please check your PC for the presence of this Klez worm</B>. There is a free tool available that will detect and remove the Klez worm at the Symantec web site <a href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.removal.tool.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Even if you think you are not infected, do yourself and others a favor by making sure your system has not been infected with Klez. <br><br><br>Thank you all for your cooperation.

In an attempt to keep the login flooding to a minimum, Im not going to announce the exact time that it will open.<br><br>Also, were going to make this a non-split server.<br><br>Some of you are going to be very happy about that decision, others not so much so. We understand the desires of folks on either side of this discussion, but we feel that a fresh server is more appropriate. Antonious Bayle was a split server and that went well. But we heard some concerns that it isnt really a server built in Europe, that because characters moved to the server it doesnt have the same feel that a server might have if characters were built from opening day in the community. So were going to open Kane Bayle a fresh server.<br><br>Thanks for being patient while we worked on this, and thanks to those that are helping out by playing on the server during its time as a Test server.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>thanks, <b><i>Absor</b></i> :)

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With patches, come questions.  Here are some of the questions that players have asked, which <b><i>Absor</b></i> has commented on:<br><blockquote><B><U>Geneze wrote:</u><br>I've read the patch message, and don't see anything about /q not accepting any parameters. According to <b><i>Absor</b></i>, that would be in the next patch. <br><br>Was the fix missed, or did it just get missed in the message?</b><br><br>Just missed it in the patch message. Its in the game.<br><br>Also, a few folks have noticed that we removed the hate reduction stuff for slow spells (the reductions that we added recently to counter the affects of the added poison counters to those spells). Well, thats because we fixed the hate increase that those counters created.<br><br>Basically, the spells dont need the hate reduction because they shouldnt be causing any more hate than before they were changed.<br><br>We even managed to sneak in a drum for bards to use. Never say never <br><br>I also wanted to clear up a question that has come up about this:<br><br>- A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible. Character must turn visible before starting the trade<br><br>This is, essentially, a bug fix. Being able to initiate a trade with an NPC when invisible would occasionally cause the game to eat items and leave people in a pseudo-invis client/server mismatched state. Now we are just requiring that the character be visible when they start the trade rather than having the game make them visible.<br><br><B><U>Samuel-Belarios wrote:</U><br>The patch message said that charmed mobs would still accept weapons in the zones where NPCs would no longer accept items. This is not the case. Charmed mobs no longer accept weapons in several zones where they used to.<br><br>Please fix this to work as intended.</b><br><br>This was one of the items that couldnt be patched because it was a code item. You should be able to hand items to charmed pets now as well.</blockquote>He then returns to add the following:<br><blockquote>I also wanted to make a comment about this:<br><br><SUP>quote:</suP><br><hr width="90%" align="center"><br>** Guilds **<br><br>- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.<br><hr width="90%" align="center"><br><br>This <B>does not</b> mean that GMs will be suddenly changing guild names on a whim (or at the whim of the guild leader). Just like character names, we want you to put thought into the name when you first come up with it and we expect that the reputation earned by a guild to stay with that guild, be it good or bad.<br><br>Though if your guild was created with spaces in front of the name in order to avoid the 15 character problem, they can fix that. But were not going to be changing guild names for any other reason.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks, Alan!  Got any questions about the recent patches that have been completed?

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It seems an issue with the Shawl quest occurred yesterday.  Here's what happened, and what's changed:<br><blockquote>Im just the messenger. <br><br><sup>quote:</sup><br><hr width="90%" align="center"><br><br>Greetings friends of the Coldain,<br><br>I would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused yesterday with Dain Frostreaver IV giving a not enough faction response when handing in the 7th Coldain Prayers Shawl. It was intended that anyone that could get to this point in the shawl series could hand the Dain the shawl with no worry. Unfortunately there was an issue with factions with the patch yesterday. The Dain was perma-killed to protect people from losing their shawls until last nights patch. He is now working as intended, and should be a lot more friendly to anyone trying to assist in his cause.<br><br>Additionally I wanted to give a warning. When you give Loremaster Borannin your shawl he gives you back the same shawl and tells you to talk to the Dain. When you give your shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf or the Dain (if he happens to be up) they will return a NEW shawl. This is an exact copy of the 7th shawl, but will prevent multiple spawnings of the Dain. Please do not go back and give this shawl to Loremaster Borannin, he will not return it. <br><br>- Frizznik<br><hr width="90%" align="center"><br><br>Thanks Frizznik!<br><br>Alan</blockquote>And thank you, <b><i>Absor</b></i> :)

The conflict between the Dismal Rage and the law-abiding citizens of Freeport has reached a boiling point. New heroes have been called on to aid both sides in the constant power struggle of this city. Numerous guildmasters have advanced the training that is given to all those brave enough to rise from Freeport, either for good or for evil. The Commonlands have also started to see strange new individuals and even stranger creatures. There is also word that the Deathfist Orcs have begun to stockpile supplies for an unknown reason. Citizens knowing the nature of the Deathfist Orcs are preparing themselves for anything. <br><br><br>** Late arriving news from Ak'Anon **<br><br>It has not been long since two wayward gnomes returned to their home city of Ak'Anon, one empowered with gifts of a Paladin of Brell and the other wielding the dark knowledge of a Shadowknight of Bertoxxulous. Already pupils have flocked to the chapel of the Deep Muses and the mines of the Dark Reflection to learn the secrets and skills these opposing masters possess. Led by their new champions of Brell, the Deep Muses, Gem Cutters, and Eldritch Collective have begun a campaign to exterminate the Dark Reflection from the mines of Ak'Anon and their cherished homeland, the Steamfont Mountains.<br><br>May 8th, 2002. 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Items **<br><br>- We've made some changes that will cause a few proccing items to be out of charges after the patch. Players with such items will need to petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one<br>- Focus items using the "Naki's Pernicity" effects should now be working as intended<br>- Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>- It should be impossible to equip an item that will reduce your hit points by more than your maximum hit points. Also, hit point reduction items should not lower hit points below 1<br>- Tinkered Compass now adds the appropriate bonus to the sense heading skill<br>- Hit point bonuses on food items should be working<br><br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- Higher level familiars should once again survive when their masters go invisible, Abscond or Evac<br>- Fixed a bug that was preventing the Lesser Familiar mana regeneration component from working<br>- Familiars no longer cause damage to their master upon death<br>- Familiar buff remains after the caster uses the /pet get lost command to remove the visual representation<br>- Torrent of Fatigue should be working properly now<br>- Allure of the Wild has had its level cap raised to make it a useful upgrade <br>- Umbra has been improved to give a slightly higher AC benefit <br>- A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible.

This is also the case for Mass Group Buff<br>- Gating and porting while in tree form should no longer cause crashes<br>- Removed all "Begins to cast X spell" text from procs<br>- Resurrection request box will now reset if you open another window while it is up, preventing a problem where a character is unable to be resurrected if he has the res box up and he loots a mob or opens a trade window<br>- Fixed a bug with lifetaps that would cause people around a lifetap to see, "You feel drained..." instead of "Fippy feels drained..."<br>- Issues with Healing seeming to be delayed have been fixed (see Spell Filters)<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing "soandso's song ends" to show up as "he's song ends" if the bard was targeted, "it's song ends" if not targeted <br>- Divine Glory received a small upgrade to make it more in line with the spell series<br><br><br>** Spell Filters **<br><br>- Issues with healing seeming to be delayed should be fixed. The problem was with filters that allowed players to ignore spells that were hitting them. The following changes were needed to fix this issue<br>- Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells they cast<br>- Players with the Group option set for PC spells will see the start spell casting messages for people in their group and they will also see when member of their group are hit with spells<br>- Players with the ALL option will still see all PC spells and spell hits<br><br><br>** Spell Stacking **<br><br>General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which should not have. <br><br>For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed. Here are some of the details:<br><br>- Vision abilities (natural or spell-granted) should no longer cause spells to fail to take hold<br>- Bard songs should in general overwrite fewer spells<br><br>- Harness of Spirit no longer stacks with spells that grant Strength or Dexterity boosts.

The text should correctly say that there is only one level for this ability<br>- Improved Reclaim Energy now works with the epic pet<br>- Fixed a crash bug caused by Call Corpse<br>- Alternate Advancement abilities that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>- Quick Summon should now work for Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements<br>- Quick Summon also changed to match the benefits presented by the in-game help<br><br><br>** Skills **<br><br>- Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill. This may slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill<br>- Poison should no longer be interrupted<br>- Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out<br>- A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is looting a corpse<br>- Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee<br><br><br>** Zones **<br><br>- The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules<br>- Petrified humerus should now be available<br>- Zones where mounts cannot be summoned will now remove mounts when they enter the zone<br>- High level NPCs can now be taunted in Cazic Thule<br>- Random frame lag in Guktop and Oasis should be fixed<br>- Fixed a pathing problem in Tenebrous Mountains<br>- Fixed a pathing bug in Paludal Caverns<br>- Fixed pathing exploits in Chardok<br>- Fixed a pathing exploit in Cazic Thule<br>- Fixed a pathing exploit in Acrylia<br>- Fixed a pathing bug in the Tower of Frozen Shadow<br>- Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove<br>- Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea<br>- Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line<br>- Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru<br>-Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various incarnations more accessible<br>-Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness in the zone<br><br><br>** Quests **<br><br>- Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest<br>- High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now<br><br><br>** Tradeskills **<br><br>- Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <br>- Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant<br>- Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin<br><br><br>** Guilds **<br><br>- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.<br><br><br>** Pets **<br><br>- A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time<br>- /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting tool. Asking pets to attack targets outside the range will generate a "not a legal target" message<br>- Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its master a /tell<br>- Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets<br><br><br>** Chat Channels **<br><br>- Players can specify a chat channel as their default channel using the /channel commands (e.g. /channel chat mychannel)<br>- The 'old' method for setting the default channel is also now saved in the INI file<br>- Kick and Invite should be working for chat channels<br><br><br>** Horses **<br><br>- Potions now work while on a horse<br>- Skeletons can now ride horses (meaning: PCs should be able to mount and ride horses while changed into a skeleton)<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing the AFK flag to sometimes not be visible to players entering a zone after it was turned on<br>- Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)<br>- No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving resources. We've also increased the rate that position updates are made by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but making movement a bit smoother<br>- Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon<br>- NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed<br>- Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons and Lavastorm<br>- Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the "your spell is interrupted" or the NPCs spell interruption message<br>- Fixed the issue with boats depositing players at the safe point of the zone after zoning<br>- Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air after zoning)<br>- /cry is now working<br>- /consent %t should allow the consented character to drag your corpse<br>- Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.<br><br><br>** Sullon Zek Rules Change **<br><br>We have increased the number of character that can be created on an account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team<br><br><br>** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **<br><br>Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly. <br><br>We will be keeping the following rules intact: <br><br>* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended. <br>* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue. <br>* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on the server. <br>* The one character per account restriction will remain.<br><br>However, we will be removing the following restrictions:<br><br>* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable gameplay. <br>* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way. <br>* /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. <br>* Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.<br><br>Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play the game. <br><br>April 30th, 2002<br>------------------------------<br><br>- Corrected a couple of graphic corruptions in Vex Thal<br><br>April 25th, 2002. 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** EverQuest Pricing Increase **<br><br>Due to the increased costs of running EverQuest, effective April 25, 2002, the new monthly subscription rate is $12.95/month. <br><br>We will continue to offer discounts on multi-month subscriptions. The price for a 3-month subscription is now $35.85 and a 6-month subscription is now $65.70.<br><br>You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires.<br><br><br>However, for a limited time, you may extend your current subscription for an additional 12 or 24 months by signing up for the new 12 or 24 month extension - and reap great savings off of the new rates:<br><br>* Extending for 12 months for $119.95 US brings EverQuest to you for approximately $10.00/month, a 23% discount off of the monthly rate.<br><br>* Extending for 24 months for $199.95 US brings EverQuest to you for approximately $8.33/month, a 35% discount off of the monthly rate.<br><br>Now is the time to lock in these rates--don't miss out!<br><br>For more information, please visit www.everquest.com/rates</blockquote>Hope the patch went well for every one.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here it is:<br><blockquote>May 8th, 2002. 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br>** Items **<br><br>- We've made some changes that will cause a few proccing items to be out of charges after the patch. Players with such items will need to petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one<br>- Focus items using the "Naki's Pernicity" effects should now be working as intended<br>- Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>- It should be impossible to equip an item that will reduce your hit points by more than your maximum hit points. Also, hit point reduction items should not lower hit points below 1<br>- Tinkered Compass now adds the appropriate bonus to the sense heading skill<br>- Hit point bonuses on food items should be working<br><br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- Higher level familiars should once again survive when their masters go invisible, Abscond or Evac<br>- Fixed a bug that was preventing the Lesser Familiar mana regeneration component from working<br>- Familiars no longer cause damage to their master upon death<br>- Familiar buff remains after the caster uses the /pet get lost command to remove the visual representation<br>- Torrent of Fatigue should be working properly now<br>- Allure of the Wild has had its level cap raised to make it a useful upgrade <br>- Umbra has been improved to give a slightly higher AC benefit <br>- A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible. Character must turn visible before starting the trade<br>- Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't cast due to deity restrictions<br>- Invisibility should now remain after a link death<br>- Theft of Thought will no longer give mana when cast on PC classes that do not have mana (in PvP or in a duel)<br>- Drain/Share spells can no longer be cast on players on blue servers, and can no longer be cast on group members on PvP servers. Spells Affected: Succession of Shadows, Crippling Claudication, Mind Wrack, Degeneration, Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae, Torrent of Hate, Torrent of Fatigue, Torrent of Pain<br>- Spirit Armor scroll no longer lists Shadowknights as a class that can use it (they couldn't anyway)<br>- Bard AE songs now have vertical limit of 50 feet. This is also the case for Mass Group Buff<br>- Gating and porting while in tree form should no longer cause crashes<br>- Removed all "Begins to cast X spell" text from procs<br>- Resurrection request box will now reset if you open another window while it is up, preventing a problem where a character is unable to be resurrected if he has the res box up and he loots a mob or opens a trade window<br>- Fixed a bug with lifetaps that would cause people around a lifetap to see, "You feel drained..." instead of "Fippy feels drained..."<br>- Issues with Healing seeming to be delayed have been fixed (see Spell Filters)<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing "soandso's song ends" to show up as "he's song ends" if the bard was targeted, "it's song ends" if not targeted <br>- Divine Glory received a small upgrade to make it more in line with the spell series<br><br><br>** Spell Filters **<br><br>- Issues with healing seeming to be delayed should be fixed. The problem was with filters that allowed players to ignore spells that were hitting them. The following changes were needed to fix this issue<br>- Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells they cast<br>- Players with the Group option set for PC spells will see the start spell casting messages for people in their group and they will also see when member of their group are hit with spells<br>- Players with the ALL option will still see all PC spells and spell hits<br><br><br>** Spell Stacking **<br><br>General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which should not have. <br><br>For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed. Here are some of the details:<br><br>- Vision abilities (natural or spell-granted) should no longer cause spells to fail to take hold<br>- Bard songs should in general overwrite fewer spells<br><br>- Harness of Spirit no longer stacks with spells that grant Strength or Dexterity boosts. It was never intended to do so<br>- Harness of Spirit and Avatar should now stack properly<br>- Call of the Predator and Warder's Protection should no longer stack<br>- Arch Lich should no longer overwrite innate racial vision abilities<br>- Levitate and Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict<br>- Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict with any vision abilities (natural or spell granted)<br>- Spirit of Eagle should no longer cancel Levitation/Levitate spells<br>- Fixed a stacking exploit with Armor of Protection and Armor of the Risen<br>- Focus of Spirit should no longer overwrite Visions of Grandeur<br>- Focus of Spirit should now stack with the Whistling Fists effect<br>- "Circle of" Druid spells should no longer stack with their Resist counterparts. <br>- Shroud of Spirits and the Cloak of the Akheva should stack properly now<br>- Cantata of Soothing should no longer overwrite Clarity spells<br>- Cantata and Chorus of Replenishment should no longer overwrite Acumen<br>- Bladecoat no longer overwrites Clarity II<br>- Lower level druid group buffs should now be less likely to overwrite higher level buffs<br>- Avatar and Force of Nature will no longer stack<br>- Ancient Feral Avatar should now stack properly<br><br><br>** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>- Improved Familiar should now be better than Greater Familiar<br>- Fixed a bug with Permanent Illusion that was causing the caster to see his illusions drop when zoning, even if others continued to see the illusion<br>- Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities<br>- The Archetype skill Casting Deftness will no longer supercede the Class specific Quick Buff casting time reducing skill. Note that at this time there is a maximum benefit to casting time bonuses of a 50% reduction<br>- Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)<br>- Turn Summoned should now work on all summoned creatures, not just pets. The text should correctly say that there is only one level for this ability<br>- Improved Reclaim Energy now works with the epic pet<br>- Fixed a crash bug caused by Call Corpse<br>- Alternate Advancement abilities that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>- Quick Summon should now work for Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements<br>- Quick Summon also changed to match the benefits presented by the in-game help<br><br><br>** Skills **<br><br>- Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill. This may slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill<br>- Poison should no longer be interrupted<br>- Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out<br>- A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is looting a corpse<br>- Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee<br><br><br>** Zones **<br><br>- The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules<br>- Petrified humerus should now be available<br>- Zones where mounts cannot be summoned will now remove mounts when they enter the zone<br>- High level NPCs can now be taunted in Cazic Thule<br>- Random frame lag in Guktop and Oasis should be fixed<br>- Fixed a pathing problem in Tenebrous Mountains<br>- Fixed a pathing bug in Paludal Caverns<br>- Fixed pathing exploits in Chardok<br>- Fixed a pathing exploit in Cazic Thule<br>- Fixed a pathing exploit in Acrylia<br>- Fixed a pathing bug in the Tower of Frozen Shadow<br>- Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove<br>- Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea<br>- Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line<br>- Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru<br>-Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various incarnations more accessible<br>-Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness in the zone<br><br><br>** Quests **<br><br>- Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest<br>- High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now<br><br><br>** Tradeskills **<br><br>- Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <br>- Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant<br>- Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin<br><br><br>** Guilds **<br><br>- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.<br><br><br>** Pets **<br><br>- A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time<br>- /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting tool. Asking pets to attack targets outside the range will generate a "not a legal target" message<br>- Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its master a /tell<br>- Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets<br><br><br>** Chat Channels **<br><br>- Players can specify a chat channel as their default channel using the /channel commands (e.g. /channel chat mychannel)<br>- The 'old' method for setting the default channel is also now saved in the INI file<br>- Kick and Invite should be working for chat channels<br><br><br>** Horses **<br><br>- Potions now work while on a horse<br>- Skeletons can now ride horses (meaning: PCs should be able to mount and ride horses while changed into a skeleton)<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing the AFK flag to sometimes not be visible to players entering a zone after it was turned on<br>- Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)<br>- No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving resources. We've also increased the rate that position updates are made by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but making movement a bit smoother<br>- Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon<br>- NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed<br>- Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons and Lavastorm<br>- Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the "your spell is interrupted" or the NPCs spell interruption message<br>- Fixed the issue with boats depositing players at the safe point of the zone after zoning<br>- Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air after zoning)<br>- /cry is now working<br>- /consent %t should allow the consented character to drag your corpse<br>- Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.<br><br><br>** Sullon Zek Rules Change **<br><br>We have increased the number of character that can be created on an account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team<br><br><br>** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **<br><br>Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly. <br><br>We will be keeping the following rules intact: <br><br>* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended. <br>* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue. <br>* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on the server. <br>* The one character per account restriction will remain.<br><br>However, we will be removing the following restrictions:<br><br>* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable gameplay. <br>* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way. <br>* /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. <br>* Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.<br><br>Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play the game.</blockquote>So, what do you think about the patch?

There is a fix for this in on Test, and has been for awhile. However, due to the smaller Test population, it is hard to definitively say it is fixed. I can say that we have been totally unable to reproduce the bug on Test, so that is a good sign. This code will be in the next major code patch.<br>2) Stacking issues with Shadow Sight and Dead Man Floating. This is known and currently being worked on. <br>3) Torrent of Fatigue. Yes this was broken last spell patch, it is being worked on.<br>4) Rogue poisons being interupted. No, this is not by design and should all be fixed on test. Those of you that play rogues on test please feel free to let us know what poisons are still being interupted. These fixes will go live in the next code patch.</blockquote>Thanks, <B><I>Datharius</I></b> :)

Here's the details:<br><blockquote><B>Hello, I was wondering if you guys have ever considered (or would consider) creating a "Classic EQ" server on which players would be restricted to the original continents and the level 50 limit?<br>I think this would be a great way for people who are newer to EQ to experience the original EQ gameplay, and for "old school" players to re-experience it.<br><br>Drendar Goblinslayer<br>Vazaelle</B><br><br>This is certainly an interesting idea. But we just dont plan to do it.<br><br>A restricted server like that would require separate code, and a lot more programming time that you might think. It would, basically, be a different game with different code, and thats the sort of thing that we try to avoid. Also, well, I suspect it wouldnt appeal to all that many people.<br><br>Honestly, why would we want to make a server whos main feature is, well, fewer features?<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Would you like to see such a server?

Here's a snip of the interview:<br><blockquote><B>GS</b>: We're guessing that EverQuest II still takes place in the world of Norrath. How will the world be different? What are some of the old factions that will still populate the world, and what are some of the new ones? How much bigger (or smaller) will this new Norrath be compared with the existing one? <br><br><B>BT</b>: EverQuest II takes place on Norrath during the Age of Destiny, which follows the Age of Turmoil that the current EverQuest is set in. To give too much away at this point might spoil some cool events we are planning for EverQuest, but it is fair to say that most of the major political players of Norrath will still be around, making players' lives more interesting in some fun and surprising ways. At this point, it appears that the EverQuest II reinterpretation of Norrath is going to be significantly larger than the Norrath of the current EverQuest, but we are not done with it yet</blockquote>You can find the interview <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2863471,00.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Due to the nature of these updates, we do anticipate additional downtime to occur. Most likely, the servers will be coming back down briefly after they are brought live for all players. Therefore, the initial downtime we anticipate is 8 hours. Once the servers are up, the next 4-6 hours could see several smaller patches applied which would require the downing of all world servers.<br>- The EverQuest Operations Team</blockquote><br>Feel free to stop by the forums and IRC to talk and chat with the community during the downtime!

        <a href="mailto:eqnews@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Abombpk</a></font>
        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>Absor</b></i> posted the changes made to Firiona Vie and Sullon Zek on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=DeveloperAPOs+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_blank">EQ Developers Corner</a> today.  Here's what he lists as the changes made:<br><blockquote>Firiona Vie was designed in an effort to create a roleplaying ruleset on an EverQuest server. It was a valiant experiment, but it seems to have fallen short of expectations. Unfortunately the restrictions to both grouping and communication on this server have prevented the population from reaching the mass required to be a self-sustaining environment. With the tremendous size of the EverQuest game world, too small of a population on server is just as devastating to the health of that server as too large of a population.<br>So we've decided to change some of the rules on Firiona Vie in an attempt to bring more players to the server. The focus for the server is still roleplaying, that won't change. But we're going to remove some of the rules that make playing on the server inconvenient and restrict roleplaying. We will, however, be keeping the following rules in tact:<br><br>* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended.<br><br>* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue.<br><br>* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on the server.<br><br><br>However, we will be removing the following restrictions:<br><br>* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on characters is causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable gameplay.<br><br>* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that dont want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way.<br><br>* /shout and /auction will return to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them enabled is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended.<br><br>* Alignment restrictions will be removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.<br><br>* We will be raising the number of characters available to each account to three. We've added a new race, class and a few race/class combinations since Firiona Vie was launched and it only seems fair to give folks on that server a chance to play them.<br><br><br>Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, need to be removed to allow people to actually play the game.<br><br>We will also be increasing the number of characters that can be created on Sullon Zek to three per account to allow players on that server to create new characters of the new class and races made available since the server was introduced.<br><br>All of these changes will occur with the next patch on Wednesday, May 8th, 2002.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks, Alan!

Here's what he says this time:<br><blockquote><B>I sent in a message while you were gone for fan faire about the current hitsmode implementation so I don't know if you got it.<br>Basically, with the feature turned on now, half the combat spam goes to the hitsmode window and the other half still clutters the main chat window. Also, your hits and you being hit being in different windows makes it harder to tell how fast you are getting hit. I would recommend putting in the option to put all the combat related spam (you being hit, you hitting, others hits, damage shields, spells, critical hits, critical hits, etc, etc) all in one hitsmode window and leaving all the chat related text in the other. <br><br>Faelagund Silvanfather<br>Guildmaster, Silvan Rangers<br>Fennin Ro</b><br><br>Im afraid Im going to have to ask you to wait on this one until after the new interface is done.

Sincerely appreciated.<br><br>Was wondering if you can say anything about the status of fixing Thunder of Karana back to something useful (as the change to a 100 pt mana drain for was touted as a temp fix for the balance problems created with the original silence spell). <br><br>Also, Divine Stun was changed to a clickable AA ability with a 30 second reuse (rather than being passive being on all the time); and one of the developers/designers had come on a Paladin board and implied that this too more of a temporary change while something better could be come up with.<br><br>Any update, status, anything on either or both of these issues would be greatly appreciated by myself and all of the Paladin community. <br><br>Thanks in advance!<br><br>Pankrat<br>Crusader of Tarew Marr</b><br><br>For now I wouldnt expect any changes to hybrid spells or abilities that arent directly related to pure caster spells or abilities (or bug fixes). The team is concentrating on caster balance right now. When thats complete well decide if a pass over hybrids is needed (considering that many changes to casters will likely affect hybrids as well). Fiddling with hybrids and casters at the same time is just not a wise idea.<br><br>Alan</blockquote><br>Thanks, Alan!
