                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Warriors 
                    are made for combat, period. They are made to be able to wade 
                    into the thick of battle and withstand more punishment than 
                    any other class. As far as physical offense or defense they 
                    have no equal. As far as solo hunting they have the easiest 
                    time until around 20th level. 20th level is when things start 
                    getting very hard for the soloing warrior. The creatures you 
                    fight have a lot more health and are in much more dangerous 
                    areas (usually dungeons). The fights take longer. Dungeons 
                    can become a deathtrap very fast for the older soloing warrior 
                    who takes too long in a fight or has to run down a fleeing 
                    Mob whos running for backup. Healing up between fights take 
                    a very long time. Sure you have a ton of hit points; you need 
                    a ton of time to get them back too. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mages 
                      do much more instant damage at those higher levels. They 
                      can finish creatures faster thus equaling shorter fights. 
                      Problem with mages is they usually come out of a battle 
                      with full health or none at all. Older mobs will tear a 
                      mage to shreds if it gets in close enough for melee. So 
                      what do we know? Mages have better offense later in life 
                      whereas warriors have better defense and can actually survive 
                      after 60 seconds of melee combat. Everquest is definitely 
                      group oriented. Mages need tanks to keep the mobs off them 
                      so they can destroy the mob, while warriors need mages to 
                      keep the fights quick and to finish off fleeing mobs. This 
                      means that a warriors strongpoint later in life (in a group) 
                      is defense. Whats important to defense? AC, agility, stamina, 
                      and defensive skills. We will get more into these later.</font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Halflings 
                    are about half the size of a human thus the name. Many people 
                    wont play halflings because they dont look as "imposing" 
                    or "cool" as many other races. Also, a lot of people have 
                    a short complex. There are a lot of advantages going with 
                    a halfling. They are extremely agile and dexterous. They naturally 
                    have the ability to hide, which can keep you out of a lot 
                    of hurting. Hide is excellent when you need to sit down and 
                    heal up or are in a dangerous area and need a minute to get 
                    your wits about you. Halflings also get the innate ability 
                    to sneak. Basically being able to move while hidden without 
                    becoming visible. Another excellent skill for getting out 
                    of potentially bad situations. Lets say you are deep in a 
                    zone and get cut off from your party. You are too weak or 
                    injured to solo in this area but you can sneak your way out 
                    of the zone or to where you think your party is. Another plus 
                    to halflings is that they have infravision. Infravision helps 
                    you immensely at night. From being safer running around to 
                    finding stuff to hunt, it always helps if you can see whats 
                    in front of you. Halflings wear small armor, which is cheaper 
                    and lighter. Finally, the last really good thing is their 
                    starting city, Rivervale. Ill cover Rivervale later. </font>

                  are they? You dont see many about. You see a lot of barbarian 
                  warriors. Ive read about five different warrior guides and 
                  have never seen they words "halfling warrior" mentioned once 
                  (at least not in a positive light) I see ogre, troll, and barbarian 
                  mentioned in almost every guide. I guess because they have the 
                  highest strength, and stamina. Plus they look real tough and 
                  powerful. </font></font> 
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                    my OPINION halflings make the best warriors, and Ill tell 
                    you why. The reason is defense. Higher defense means getting 
                    hit less and when you do, taking less damage. That means, 
                    if you have a healer in your group they dont need to spend 
                    as much mana on you as they do on the clumsy barbarians, ogres, 
                    or trolls who seem like they have a big bullseye on their 
                    chest. More mana usually equates to more buff spells for the 
                    party, more mana to heal other members, and more mana for 
                    offensive spells. All that equals less chance of someone or 
                    a whole party ending up dead. Survival or Victory. Whatever 
                    you want to call it. Usually around now someones screaming, 
                    "yeah but I have a lot more hit points then a halfling". Yep 
                    sure do. When you get older and mobs start whacking you for 
                    over 100 points a shot every other swing because you cant 
                    get out of the way, and they have a ton of health, and the 
                    party cant take the mob down as fast because they need to 
                    heal your damage receiving arse, who cares if you have more 
                    hit points. Id rather not get hit in the first place, or 
                    when I do not for much. If the tank dies the party usually 
                    follows if you are fighting formidable foes. The next argument 
                    I hear is yeah but I hit for more damage than halflings at 
                    older levels". Yep sure do. And the mages do a lot more damage 
                    than you do. You will not be able to take mobs down as fast 
                    as a mage at older levels. If you want to deal out the most 
                    damage in the group than be a mage. Why try to be the offensive 
                    hero when you cant compare to the mage standing behind you? 
                    The main reason why halflings have such great defense is agility. 
                    If you maximize your agility it will be 125. Another nice 
                    thing about having a high agility is finishing ability. You 
                    notice that when you are down to your last bar of health your 
                    agility starts dropping like a rock? I notice I usually lose 
                    around 30 points of agility before Im actually out of hit 
                    points. So it drops to about 95. 95 agility isnt too bad. 
                    I cant imagine what its like to have a low agility to start 
                    with and then lose 30 points on top of that. Doesnt give 
                    you much hope of survival. Also when Im almost dead I still 
                    run at a pretty decent speed. Taking this into account I can 
                    usually stick it out in a fight a little longer before Im 
                    forced to run or back out, and if I do run I usually have 
                    a better chance of escape.</font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    most important stats for warriors are strength, stamina, agility, 
                    and under rated intelligence. Strength for being able to hit 
                    hard and carry loot and armor. Stamina for hit points. Agility 
                    for defense. Intelligence for speed of learning and skill. 
                    I say stick everything towards agility for the reasons I covered 
                    in the above paragraphs. Your strength can be buffed pretty 
                    easy by group members and is high enough as it is to comfortably 
                    wear plate mail. Stamina is a waste if you have the mindset 
                    of not being hit in the first place and you will have plenty 
                    of hit points with your starting stamina as it is. Warriors 
                    often overlook intelligence. You know how your skills rise 
                    as you use them? They rise faster if your intelligence is 
                    higher. You will probably cap out on most of your skills at 
                    the lower levels but skills get harder to push at later stages 
                    in the game. (On a side rant, this is the main advantage of 
                    the also underestimated gnome and dark elf warriors who are 
                    pretty agile and extremely smart (for a warrior). This is 
                    also the main downfall of ogre and troll warriors. Ogres and 
                    trolls have such a low starting intelligence they are really 
                    hurt because later in the game they are not as skilled in 
                    offense, defense, and other warrior skills like other warrior 
                    races. Even with their low starting Intelligence I bet most 
                    ogres and trolls still boost their strength, stamina, and 
                    agility stats, leaving their Intelligence in a pitiful state. 
                    So you want to play a Troll or Ogre and want to hit hard, 
                    you can still dump those points into Strength, but at least 
                    put the rest into Int. Or better yet put them all in Int. 
                    Youll find out later in life you are more effective in combat 
                    than other ogres and trolls because your skills will be higher.) 
                    Anyway, Ill get into how to keep your skills maxed out even 
                    with a lower Intelligence when I discuss training points.

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                    cringe every time I read a guide that tells you at level 1 
                    to go put training points in skills that go up on their own. 
                    If you spend any points on a weapon skill you use before level 
                    10 then you are throwing away those points. Usually even before 
                    20 is a waste. In my OPINION there are 3 ways to use training 
                    points. First way is to develop a trade skill, which would 
                    be expensive to develop otherwise. Second way is to learn 
                    the basics of a skill (by spending 1 point ONLY on it) you 
                    do not have such as a language your trainer offers you or 
                    a skill you obtain once you reach a certain level (such as 
                    dodge at 6). Third way is to keep your skills maxed once they 
                    start having a problem maxing out every level. When using 
                    this third way later in life, it is best to attempt to spend 
                    points on basic skills right before you make your next level. 
                    Once you hit 10 start visiting the trainer when you have less 
                    than a quarter of a bubble of experience to go to make your 
                    next level. Try to train your important skills higher. This 
                    way if a skill hasnt maxed out by the end of your level then 
                    youll know its having a hard time keeping up and you can 
                    force it to rise from the trainer since your own intelligence 
                    isnt making it rise fast enough. Once again, if you spend 
                    training points on skills that would max out anyway for your 
                    level then you are wasting points and possible silver. </font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                    probably want to decide at an early age if you want to use 
                    two handers, two weapons at once, or a weapon and a shield. 
                    Most warriors will go the two-handed or two-weapon route for 
                    the obvious offensive advantage. Personally Im sticking with 
                    a shield for the ac. If you look at a level 40 halfling warrior 
                    with a 125 agility, good taunting skill, platemail, and a 
                    shield and compare him to a level 40 barbarian warrior without 
                    a shield, lower ac, and lower agility, in a group setting 
                    (which is probably where a 40th warrior will be) the halfling 
                    would be a much higher asset to the group for the reasons 
                    I talked about above. If you dont want to go the shield route 
                    thats fine (maybe youll have a halfling warrior with a shield 
                    in the group who can tank for you so you wont get hit), youll 
                    need to decide between using a two hander or dual wield. Personally 
                    I prefer dual wield because when combined with double strike 
                    itll hit 4 times a round rather than 2 with the two-hander, 
                    and also lets you break out a shield when you need it without 
                    having to train in two different weapon types. Now dont get 
                    me wrong, I love having two handers in the group with me. 
                    I try to tank and let them dish out the damage when mages 
                    arent around. </font>

                    start out in Rivervale, which has one of the best hunting 
                    areas in the world for levels 1-10. Rivervale is a one zone, 
                    easy to get around in town. Rivervale is probably the most 
                    central location in the world that you could start in. If 
                    you want to go hunt in runnyeye, beholder, befallen, or paw 
                    they are all close. Rivervale also has one of the best lower 
                    level quests for warriors, the squad ring quest. Im not going 
                    to spoil it so youll have to figure it out. Its definitely 
                    worth doing. Thats all Im going to say about Rivervale. 
                    There are good city guides out there if you want more info.

                    thing I wanted to mention but didnt want to do a whole section 
                    on was etiquette. If someone helps you out, try to give him 
                    or her a tip. Most people wont take tips but its the thought 
                    that counts. You want a faction increase between you and your 
                    fellow players? Thats one way to earn it. I didnt go into 
                    group strategy, hunting areas, or a lot of other things that 
                    warrior guides usually cover because there are plenty of resources 
                    out there for that stuff. There was a gap in the warrior guides 
                    concerning Halflings (gnomes too). The average person thinking 
                    about playing a warrior who reads one of them guides may think 
                    I need to decide between a barbarian, troll, or ogre. I wanted 
                    to make sure halflings get their fare shake. The people who 
                    designed this game arent stupid. Many come from a long time 
                    mudding background. They know what works and what doesnt. 
                    They understand balance. They didnt make any bad race/class 
                    combos. I think they did a great job (especially with balance 
                    and the economy). </font>
