Wizards have few options in combat. Basically there are just a few things that you need to know. When to burn, when to root, when to evac and when to use area effect spells.<p>

To burn safely you need to wait until tanks or someone else who can take a beating has gotten the mob down a fair bit. This will vary over levels, usually becoming longer and longer as you get higher. Id estimate it ranges from about a 5th of the hp at level 16 to about half at the highest levels, in case you are using your biggest nuke.<p>

You do your part of the damage, keep stunning the targets, and nuke runners. If you are playing with other casters, try to look out for them. Our nukes work very well as a taunt, and if you can take a few rounds of damage, taking out something going for other casters in the party may be a good idea depending on the situation.<p>

Another option is rooting the target, which is a good idea if you cant take the heat and casters or healers are getting hit. That will usually buy the tanks enough time to taunt it while the other caster moves out of the way. Root, enstill, and the rest of the series is what wizards can use as rudimentary crowd control, in lack of bards or enchanters. In dungeons you often wont have enough space to stop people from getting hit, but at least it opens up the options for who is getting hit. Enstill and higher will last longer, but as with all root spells, dont plan on it holding the mob if you nuke it. Better let the tanks deal with it rather than heroically going down as you realize that you couldnt solo that.<p>

Then, of course, you have evac. This is the best reason why you shouldnt overnuke. Overnuking will get you killed, but when you cant evac you may be getting your entire party killed. Good times to evac is when your crowd controllers and healers are either oom or cant handle it anymore. Make it a habit to ask for evac preferences in the party, and try to get the likely situations down beforehand. Sometimes it will be clear that you need to cast it, while sometimes you have the time to consult the rest of the party when it starts looking bad.<p>

Finally, Area Effect spells, which is one of the most disputed tactics of wizards. It is very clear that if you can proficiently use them, there is no other class that gets even close to the damage dealing capacity of the wizard.<p>

Of course, the effect of Area Effect spells done wrong is a very pretty slow motion video of the wizard freezing everyones screens as he goes out in a suicidal blaze of glory. So you have to avoid that. With the target based AE spells you can fairly reliably avoid drawing mobs onto you by waiting about as long as you would when nuking. That will give you a very nice damage per mana ratio.<p> 

But the best way is if you are teaming up with an enchanter. By discussing the use of area effect spells before combat, you can decide to use them in a coordinated fashion. Either the enchanter AE stuns the targets, or AE mezzes them, timed to hit right after your spell hits. They will then just stand there getting annihilated. This works best with blue targets, since mobs resisting mez will kill you quickly. But when you do get it down right, and use caster radiating spells with unlimited number of targets, you can wipe out a train of blues for not much more mana than it would take to wipe out one, and without getting killed. Needless to say, practice this first. A lot. Or you will do the blazing glory thing.<p>

1) If you melee, you are a fool.<br>
2) If you blast two consecutive direct damage spells in a row, on a mob, that is higher then you and at full life, you are a dead fool.(unless it is being alter-stunned, meaning you, a paladin, an enchanter, or cleric are timing your stuns to keep the mob just standing there)<p>

Alright. With those two rules memorized, lets move on.<p>

Evacs:<p>

There may not be time to ask when Evac is a must, so its good to stamp out with the group soon after you join, under what conditions you will evacuate. I always have time to tell the group with a simple /g evacing that we are heading out. I have not had one evaced party be upset at me, most times they are very happy to be alive. Just make sure you aren't one of those wizards Ive heard about evacing a party when they could have handled it. You will use them but don't get crazy when you hit 29. Its kind of a "Know when to hold, know when to fold." thing.<p>

Stun:<p>

This is so very important that it needs its own paragraph. If I remember correctly, we get our first stun at level 20. I have had mine memed ever since. At level 20 it will not be very effective to use unless on casters and at a very high resist rate. But in the 30s on up, it saves the tanks about 200-300 damage very well. Thus saving the cleric(or gods forbid a paladin) some mana. And do not stun and just stand there waiting for it again. Sun, med, stun, med, blast is a good way to keep yourself busy, mobs under control, and not waste presious mana.<p>

Crowd Control:<p>

This is not our department at all. Our roots and stun are all we have to work with and at this time in your life, the mobs should not be on you. If they are on you are doing something wrong and endangering your group. They should be where they are supposed to, on the tanks.<p>

Direct Damage:<p>

Ahh yes... The warrior his axe, the wizard his spells. I hear people complaining all the time that our spells are too weak, that we get resisted all the time, blah blah blah. Our spells are the most mana effecient, fastest casting, and best damage dealing then any other class. Sure I have my resists but nothing like before 35. For every 40 or so casts I may have a partial while fighting yellows to reds.(36 stuns in a row is a record for me that Im trying to break, it gets boring camping) Some classes DO do more damage then we do, but the key is.. not as fast. To make you feel better, a mage and necro pet is nothing more then a DoT spell. Sure they look neat, but if the mob is running the necro or mage may stand there with their hands spread while their pets chase it and cause a train. Wizard on the other hand can stop that running monter in its tracks by either a well timed blast or a stun. I have seen too many wizard out of mana, and I find myself asking why? Its because they don't let the tanks do their job and thus slow the group down, not up. If you are a wizard and you cast more then 7 times on a single monster, either you are fighting something way over your head or you like to look like a big shot. This DOES NOT impress the tanks, all that does is make the group have to wait longer. A good wizard will never drop below 60% mana on continuous pulls of 2-3 mobs. We stand at "inc," stun, med, stun, med, blast. Maybe even throw in another stun and maybe a lower level spells on the 40+ mobs. If you live by that you will be very happy with the mana you have when there are 6 things and the enchanter is running out of mana.<p>

<a name="partthree"><td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>PvP and hunting with a wizard by Mythal</font></b><div>

To start with hunting:<br>
1) Stun/Disrupt: As Lavlin mentioned, our Stun series is one of the most useful spell series we have. Even though they do not do a lot of damage--the first ones anyway--they can save the tanks a lot of pain. However, even with these spells be careful of your timing. They can aggro a mob on you really fast.<br>
As a side note to this: If you're fighting mainly casters, consider using one of the low-level lightning based spells. Any lightning spell will disrupt casting, and the low-level ones actually have rather fast casting times (Shock of Lightning with 2.1 vs. Tishan's Clash with 2.5 for example). They will not stun, unfortunatelly.<p>

2) Area Effect spells: These can mean life, or they can mean death, depending how you use them. Our Column line of spells can be extremely effective (I've seen 8 mobs take damage from a single cast --that brought it's mana/damage efficiency up to 12-15 I believe) if used properly. I have found that targetting a tank/pet, or the mob that is the tank's target will make the other mobs harder to aggro on you. (No, chain casting will still get you killed very fast. But a single AE followed by a stun, or DD on the main target will do a whole lot of damage and most often leave you ignored by the mobs).<p>

Rain spells are a different matter. Personally, I find them a little unreliable, as most mobs will not sit still to be hit by all 3 waves. Also, there is the limit to how many mobs a Rain spell will hit. (When casting on 3 mobs, for example, 3 will be hit on the first wave, 2 on the second, and 1 on the third... All 3 will 'feel' like they're hit on all 3 waves though and they will aggro on you).<br>
My best use for Rain spells is against a group of casters. Use a Lightning or Force based rain on a group of casters and you have spell-disruptions for about 6-8 seconds (their spells are disrupted for every wave of the Rain). --Side note: Why do spell casting mobs get to hit so hard in melee?? I want to be able to punch for 80 damage too, damnit!<p>

Note: It can be VERY frustrating trying to use AE spells and finding that your shaman/enchanter group member has charmed a couple. Makes for a waste of mana. Just have them /g when they charm something, and your life will be a lot easier.<p>

Note 2: I have yet to find a good use for the Al'Kabor series of spells. They are the most mana-inefficient line of spells I have heard of. Al'Kabor must have had a Hell of a PR team to become so famous, because if he was as good as his spells are...*grumbles silently and decides not to pursue this*.<p>

I believe that our DD spells were very well covered in the previous posts, so nothing for me to say about them. Moving on to PvP with a wizard.<p>

1) Shadow Step and Yonder: If you're fighting a tank, these two spells memmed can save your life, as you can chain-cast them and gain some distance from them. In other situations, you may prefer to have only one of those spells memmed--fighting a hybrid/caster for example. Don't forget that especially in open areas (Karanas for example) these spells can get you out of spell range and save your behind.<p>

2) This may sound like common sense, but I've seen too many people not do it: Use spells that will work easier on your opponent. For example, if you're fighting a monk don't use so many Fire-based spells, or when fighting a warrior avoid the Magic-based ones. It's bad enough having 60% damage done from spell. With the innate resistances these classes get, you can waste a lot of mana real fast.<p>

3) USE the Hot-Buttons: Not just for speed-casting (Isn't it a pain trying to move your mouse fast enough when getting hit 4 times per round?), but also excellent for fighting against casters.<br>
So, a cleric, or an enchanter decides to Blind you. If you're only playing using the mouse, you're completely helpless while your screen is black. However, if you have your spells hot-keyed, you can still press '1', for example, and cast your spell--aspecially since our most effective spells don't require line-of-sight.<p>

4) Do not underestimate the use of Invisibility in PvP. Especially considering that you regain mana faster than a tank regains health (with the exception of Trolls).<p>

5) Do not hesitate to use lower-level spells. Ice Comet is great, but with a 6 sec casting time, you could be dead before it goes off. Lower level spells are --sometimes-- faster to cast, less likely to fizzle, and less likely to be resisted.
