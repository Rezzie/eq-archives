                    The Human Necromancer is one of the most over-looked race/class 
                    combinations in all Everquest. Most people will simply laugh 
                    at the idea of a Human Necro. From my personal experiences, 
                    balance wise, a Human Necromancer is the best around! Now 
                    you won't have the power of a Dark Elf, nor the vision, but 
                    you certainly are much more welcome in a lot more places, 
                    saving you needless corpse recoveries. Start off by putting 
                    as much as you can into Intelligence (I believe it maxes at 
                    110) and then put the other 5 into Agility or Dexterity, you'll 
                    need it, especially early on. Note that while your intelligence 
                    is a little low, you can take a little more beating at a lower 
                    level thanks to your more balanced stats, and this is a big 
                    help to get to those later levels.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also, this guide is going to be based heavily upon you choosing 
                    to follow Innoruuk which starts you off in Freeport. While 
                    this guide is still usable starting in Qeynos, you'll have 
                    a very difficult time getting to the areas it deals with. 
                    Also note that this is certainly not an easy path to follow, 
                    but can be a very rewarding one!<br>

                    Like I said above, a good choice is Innoruuk, and is what 
                    I personally have chosen. Once you get in, scribe/memorize 
                    your spells, equip your dagger and candle, and head off to 
                    your guild. As far as I can see, you're not KOS anywhere in 
                    your home town of Freeport, though i may be wrong. Head on 
                    over to the docks, and go under the wharf, there's a door 
                    to the right if you're facing the ocean. Go through there 
                    and make your way through to your guild leader. I'll leave 
                    the rest to you, the exploring'll do ya some good! Once you 
                    do find your leader, give her the letter, put on your guild 
                    robe, and throw those 5 practice points into Piercing. </font>

                    That's right! We're leaving Antonica! Some people might think 
                    I'm crazy when they read this, but hey, ya gotta be a little 
                    nuts to be a Human Necromancer. Hop on that boat and head 
                    on over to Butcherblock. I advise staying on the boat, and 
                    near the center the whole time, I had a close call with falling 
                    off once, though it was only lag, in any case, be careful. 
                    When you zone into ButcherBlock, the tricky part happens. 
                    When you see yourself approaching The Wall and docks, you'll 
                    see a hill before The Wall off to the left. Jump off here 
                    and swim to shore. Don't worry about the Dwarf along the edge, 
                    he's okay with you, but all of the guards in Butcherblock 
                    are certainly not, which is why you had to jump ship.<br>
                    <br>
                    Welcome to Faydwer! Carefully pick your way through ButcherBlock 
                    towards Greater Faydark (highly suggest getting a map if you 
                    do not know the area well, you can pick one up at www.eqmaps.com) 
                    While you're heading that way, make sure to shout/ooc for 
                    anybody who can give you a bind at the BB/GFay line. You certainly 
                    don't want to start back at Freeport should you encounter 
                    any mishaps!<br>
                    Now you're in Greater Faydark, and hopefully bound. If not 
                    continue to call out for a bind here, there's usually someone 
                    around, this being a rather heavily populated area. Make your 
                    way along the path to Felwithe. Note that you are not KOS 
                    in Felwithe or Kelethin (but be careful around Kelethin, if 
                    you step into the Rangers guild you sometimes are murdered!). 
                    Find a man named Tacar Tissleplay and talk to him about delivering 
                    mail. Once you have the letter head for Kelethin. Another 
                    Note: You should get bound in Kelethin, this will be your 
                    main hunting area for a while. <br>
                    Now deliver the letter to Jakum Webdancer in the Bards Guild 
                    (I'll leave that to you). Congratulations, you got some faction, 
                    exp, and money. Now the fun begins!<br>

                    you can continue to deliver mail through to level 3, or you 
                    can just go hunting. I suggest delivering mail until 3 only 
                    because you get some good money (1 to 3 gold for ever letter), 
                    which you'll need for spells later. If you don't decide to 
                    deliver mail (which can be a bit tedious), head out to the 
                    ruins near Kelethin. If you don't know where it is, there's 
                    plenty of people around to point you in the right direction.<br>
                    <br>
                    Start off by killing bats, giant wasp drones, wolves, and 
                    decaying skeletons (save those bone chips!) You can do this 
                    on your own through 3rd or 4th. Then start looking for Orc 
                    Pawns and Pixie Tricksters, plus the occasional widow hatchling 
                    (be careful for the poison though). You can do this until 
                    5th. Always keep your Minor Shielding up, and with lifetap 
                    and your dagger you can easily kill most of these creatures. 
                    If you want to get your low level spells now, in comes the 
                    tricky part. You're probably thinking, "But Isn't the Necro 
                    guild back on Antonica?" Yes and No. While your guild was 
                    there, there is another here on Faydwer, in Ak'Anon. Make 
                    your way back past Felwithe and into Lesser Faydark, again 
                    highly suggest getting maps, and make your way to Steamfont 
                    mountains. Once in Steamfont move along the path towards Ak'Anon 
                    keeping your eyes peeled for Pumas, Skeletons, and Kobolds, 
                    which arne't too fond of you and will eat you for breakfast 
                    at these levels. Also, IMPORTANT! Avoid the guards! They will 
                    kill you! Once you see the entrance to Ak'Anon, go left towards 
                    the entrance, keeping a safe distance from the guards, and 
                    climb up the wall as far as you can. Then make your way over 
                    to the tunnel; the guards can't see you yet. Drop down into 
                    the tunnel and run towards the zone, they shouldn't be able 
                    to catch you. Now the reason I say don't do this until 4th 
                    or 5th, is because using the Gate spell is a crucial part 
                    of getting out of here. Any younger and I can't help you. 
                    Head down to the Necro guild, they will deal with you here. 
                    Good place to sell loot if you can't get someone to do it 
                    in Kelethin (make friends! They are your source of food and 
                    loot selling!). Buy up all the important spells (pet spell, 
                    gate, clinging darkness, lifetap spells, poison bolt, disease 
                    cloud, etc.) You should be level 5 by this point like I said, 
                    so Gate back to Faydwer and its on to new things.<br>

                    word: Group. Group like your life depended on it (and trust 
                    me, it does). You will be heading up to Orc Hill now. Make 
                    sure you get a good pet (cons white or better, at least at 
                    levels 5 and 6). Try to find a group, this is very important. 
                    You won't last too long on your own, and people are always 
                    looking for group members, so you shouldn't have that much 
                    trouble. Always send your pet in, cast Clinging Darkness and 
                    let them do the rest. Even as a Human, you are NOT a tank! 
                    This should be your strategy until at least level 7, then 
                    you can move on.<br>
                    <br>
                    Now at level 7, with great caution, you can go into Crushbone. 
                    Once in Crushbone head out of the tunnel, and to the left, 
                    there's a bridge, cross the bridge. This is your hunting area. 
                    Do not go over the hill to the left unless to pull a centurion 
                    off the hill (con it first!). Most of the orc centurions in 
                    this section of CrushBone will be white/black or blue to you. 
                    Yes fighting these does lower your faction with a certain 
                    part of Neriak, but it shouldn't affect it too bad, and you'll 
                    be able to get it up later if needed. Summon your pet, pull 
                    with Clinging Darkness, then Poison Bolt, send in pet, cast 
                    a lifetap if needed with occasional melee. Collect all the 
                    belts you can get. You can do 2 things with these belts. You 
                    can sell them for money (good for buying your spells) or turn 
                    them in to Canloe in Kaladim. Now, after killing this many 
                    orcs you may not be KOS in Butcherblock/Kaladim anymore, but 
                    remember to con from a distance to see. You can turn these 
                    in for good exp, faction, a little money, and a piece of small 
                    patchwork (which you can sell).<br>
                    Do this until 8th. </font>

                    you reach 8th, you should have enough money for a few spells, 
                    which cost around 4 plat apiece, with a few exceptions. Go 
                    back to Ak'Anon and buy at LEAST these 4 spells: Gather Shadows, 
                    Bone Walk, Ward Undead, and Lesser Shielding. With these you 
                    can start fighting the skeletons here in Steamfont. They will 
                    con yellow to you, and are VERY dangerous. Head out of Ak'Anon 
                    and head right over to the Skeletal Dragon formation. There 
                    are 4 spawn points here. Spawning either a decaying skeleton 
                    (not the newbie ones you're used to though), skeletons, or 
                    sometimes decaying gnomes, or gnome skeletons (weaklings, 
                    about as strong as newbie decaying skeletons in GFay). Pull 
                    these one at a time, and only one at a time, with clinging 
                    darkness. Then send your pet in and chain cast Ward Undead 
                    until you're out of mana, or its sure your pet will win. If 
                    you have to tank for your pet for only a few hits, then let 
                    him do the rest. Note that Ward Undead will fizzle alot as 
                    it is your first Evocation spell, you may want to put a few 
                    practice points into this before you go out and fight. <br>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So 
                    you're level 9, you've been beating on skeletons in Steamfont 
                    for a little bit now, and should have a general feel for the 
                    place. Good. Because you're gonna be here for a while. This 
                    is the best place I've found until you hit level 12. Here 
                    you get more bone chips than you could ever want, and some 
                    decent loot. Its relatively safe if you're careful, but beware, 
                    the guards most likely don't like you(though inside town you're 
                    fine). So no running to the guards here, I suggest getting 
                    a bind inside. When in trouble throw your pet into the fray 
                    then gate to safety. Anyways, you can try Numb the Dead to 
                    break up the big groups, but be warned: this spell seems to 
                    be resisted about 30% of the time, and when that happens you're 
                    in trouble, for the skeletons will instantly start running 
                    for you, so don't heavily rely on this. This gives insanely 
                    good experience at first, slowly winding down to where its 
                    a little bit of a chore at 12th, but this is the best place 
                    for you right now. Once you get to 12th grab your new spells 
                    (engulfing darkness, heat blood, new pet, bind (woohoo!) are 
                    must haves, they will make the road ahead much easier) and 
                    head for Freeport, back home!<br>

                      low because, well, you're making tons of cash. Head to West 
                      Freeport and find the Hogcallers inn. You'll see a Monk 
                      in front of the counter, and a merchant behind, they shouldn't 
                      bother you. Take a left and head through the little winding 
                      passage towards the next room. Be careful for Lady Shae, 
                      she is a High Elf Paladin that will attack you on sight, 
                      and she's around level 13, but she can still be pretty dangerous 
                      if you're not ready. She spawns and comes downstairs once 
                      every 20 minutes, so you can time this. Nobody else here 
                      will help Lady Shae. When you kill her you get negative 
                      faction with Felwithe guards and a few silver. You'll notice 
                      Trissa Whistlesong standing near the far corner. She will 
                      not help Lady Shae, but Lady Shae will help her. Now before 
                      you begin, its faction warning time! Killing Trissa will 
                      give you negative faction with Knights of Truth (paladins, 
                      unfortunately the guys who patrol North Freeport, the area 
                      with the bank, so you may want to kick some deathfist orc 
                      butt before you go in, to raise your faction. Currently 
                      at level 16 I'm just above dubious due to not upping my 
                      faction earlier, so becareful), also negative faction with 
                      Qeynos Guards and Antonica Bards (so no more mail runs). 
                      This gives you positive faction with Ring of Scale and Mayong 
                      Mistmoore.<br>

                      Now for the good parts. First of all this gives you insane 
                      experience, even with your pet (which you'll need). You'll 
                      go through these levels very fast. Also everytime Trissa 
                      dies she drops at least one mandolin, which you can sell 
                      to the merchant behind the counter (she conned indifferent 
                      to me) for about 1.3plat. Trissa also drops between 10 copper 
                      and 4 gold, as well as the occasional extra instrument, 
                      pages for enchanter research, runes for wizard research, 
                      and Words for Necro research! I did this pretty successfully 
                      only dying once when I wasn't being careful and Lady Shae 
                      walked in while I was killing Trissa and proceeded to beat 
                      me to a pulp. Trissa usually spawns 6 minutes after you 
                      kill her, usually giving you time to med up before she reappears. 
                      Also later you can time this so you kill Trissa 3 times, 
                      wait for Shae, kill her, then repeat. With the money I earned 
                      I was able to buy multiple pieces of jewelry, all my spells 
                      for 16th, many other spells I had wanted to get earlier 
                      but did not have the money for, as well as a Stein of Moggok 
                      (definitely get one of these, well worth the money you need 
                      to purchase one). Other benefits are the occasional young 
                      Monk or other traveler wandering in and watching you in 
                      awe. For some reason they think you are godlike for being 
                      able to kill Trissa, very amusing, get for roleplaying purposes. 
                      Also other Necros, Dark Elves, Erudites, even other Humans 
                      will wander in occasionally. General rule is if someone 
                      is already there, you ask permission to camp with them, 
                      or just simply accept the fact they got their first, and 
                      ask the person to send a tell to you when you're done. Through 
                      this I have made a few Necromancer friends, and only once 
                      got into an arguement with a guy, who, after thinking he 
                      was being tricky by attacking Trissa while I was medding, 
                      was instead killed by her and learned his lesson. Happy 
                      hunting and I'll continue this guide to 20 when I get there 
                      myself!<br>

                    how much do you like Trissa? Whatcha think of her music now? 
                    What, you hate her? Good, you'll be killing her for a few 
                    more levels. With your new found level 16 pet Trissa will 
                    become very very easy, usually I'd just throw one or two DoTs 
                    on and send in my pet, which could easily take care of her. 
                    Once you hit level 17, you can most likely take Trissa without 
                    your pet, providing a little more experience per kill. Also 
                    if you're not KOS with Trissa yet, stand in the corner near 
                    her, Lady Shae won't see you there. Also Lady Shae will not 
                    in fact help Trissa, Shae will only attack you if you get 
                    to close to her. Best tactic is pull with engulfing, leech, 
                    heat blood, then heart flutter, and melee her to death (the 
                    skills come in handy to boost your offense and defense, which 
                    helps you survive that one or two extra hits at higher levels). 
                    This can easily be done until 20th. At 19 the experience is 
                    much slower, but just remember, you're earning loads of cash 
                    in the meantime. Save up for those INT boosting items, and 
                    grab yourself a FBR while you're at it, us Humans look great 
                    in them! Happy Bard Killing! <br>
