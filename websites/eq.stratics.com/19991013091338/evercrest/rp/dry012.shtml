The wizard sat quietly in his cell. The trial had been a farce. His
guilty plea in exchange to save Vinalrii and the unborn child had been
ignored. Despite the best effort of his guildsister, Saraiah, who stepped
forward and tried to defend the dark elf from those who accused her, their
"justice" had been done, and both were sentenced to die at the guillotine.
Even further, it had been ordered that there be no basket to catch
Vinalrii's head, dishonoring her even after her death.
<br><br>
His head rose as he heard the lock on his cell being opened. Two armored
guards greeted his glance. "Drysart, the time has come."   He stood and
the guards escorted him away.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Just before the sun rose that morning, the square was empty. The two
guillotines, standing like two dark pedestals, laid ready for their horrid
task. A sole guard stood watch over them, to assure the devices would not
be tampered with, so the day's event would proceed as planned.
<br><br>
Barishi, the halfling, a guildbrother of Drysart, looked at the death
machines from a shadow across the square.  He saw the two of them, and he
saw, as ordered, one had a basket, the other did not. A scowl crossed his
face.
<br><br>
"Honorable high elves, indeed."
<br><br>
In his hand was a small green pouch. He had just returned from Rivervale
with it, taken from Drysart's room there, as per the note that the wizard
had subtly handed off as the sentences were being announced. According to
the note, the pouch contained a powder, a powerful and rare clerical spell,
one the wizard had acquired long ago, that would enchant a blade to keep
it from piercing flesh.
<br><br>
There was only enough for one use, and Barishi knew what the wizard had
wanted done with it: save the woman and their child.
<br><br>
He walked to the guillotines, and while the guard was distracted by
fellow guildbrother Malimn, who had happened to show up, tossed the powder
across the blade of the guillotine without the basket. Malimn saw, but
did not say anything. Somehow, he understood what was going on.
<br><br>
Barishi then left the city. He would not stay to watch Drysart die. He
would wait outside the city for Vinalrii, who he prayed would survive the
execution.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
The square was filled with a crowd by the time of the execution. Almost
every high elf in Felwithe packed the square. All had read by the
announcements posted around the city of the (exaggerated) crimes that
Drysart and Vinalrii had committed. All anxiously awaited for justice to
be served that day.
<br><br>
Also among the crowd were many of Drysart's guildmates, who had shown to
protest the execution, and to show support for the wizard and the dark elf.
<br><br>
The crowd erupted into cheers as the door to the prison opened and Vinalrii
and Drysart were led into the square. Rotten fruits and vegetables thrown
by the crowd struck them as they were led through the crowd to the
guillotines in the center.
<br><br>
Malimn hated dark elves, but he had tolerated the past months because he
knew that Drysart cared for her. But this..... he would not let his
guildbrother die because of her. He pushed his way up to the platform on
which the guillotines were readied. Through the cheering crowd, he
yelled to the guard.
<br><br>
"Hey you up there! Guard!"
<br><br>
The guard looked down at Malimn, "What do you want, human?"
<br><br>
Malimn pointed to the guillotine with the basket. "The dark elf should be
in this one."
<br><br>
"Why is that?"
<br><br>
"Look at how they are set up. Her head will roll much further from this one,
maybe even into the crowd!"
<br><br>
The guard looked over the guillotines as the prisoners were brought closer
to them. He shrugged slightly and moved the basket from the guillotine it
had been sitting at to the other one. "Perhaps human, it makes little
difference."
<br><br>
Malimn smiled slightly and disappeared back into the crowd. No one else
in the crowd knew what he had just done... that the enchanted blade would
come down on the wizard instead of the woman.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Drysart and Vinalrii stepped onto the platform in the center of the square.
The crowd surrounding them cheered louder as the rotten vegetables continued
to fly.
<br><br>
Tarker Blazetoss and a shrouded executioner also stepped onto the platform.
Tarker raised his hand into the air and the crowd fell into silence.
<br><br>
"People of Felwithe, these two criminals have been sentenced to die before
your eyes. Today, we will carry out that sentence."  Tarker turned to
Drysart and Vinalrii, then to the guards holding them, "Put them into the
guillotines."
<br><br>
The crowd began cheering again as the guards pushed Drysart into the
guillotine, face down. Vinalrii was pushed into the other guillotine. Her
pregnancy prevented her from being set in place normally, as she was loaded
into the guillotine face up instead. The top piece of the headrest was
locked into place on each of their guillotines.
<br><br>
The rotten fruits and vegetables flew onto the platform, many hitting the
now defenseless prisoners in the head, some of them straying off course and
hitting the guillotine itself, or missing completely and falling back into
the crowd, only to be thrown again.
<br><br>
Again, Tarker raised his hand, and again, the crowds fell silent. The
executioner took his place at the release handle and awaited the order.
<br><br>
Drysart glanced at Vinalrii out of the corner of his eye, then closed his
eyes to await his death.
<br><br>
"Drysart Pennoble and Vinalrii N'Ariqi, it is on behalf of the great city of
Felwithe and her people that I administer your sentence. May the gods have
mercy on your souls."  Tarker nodded to the executioner, who then pulled
the release handle to send the blades on their journey down the guillotines.
<br><br>
The crowd erupted into cheers. But a silence slowly overtook the crowd.
Starting at the front of the crowd and slowly working its way to the back,
until the entire crowd was silent.
<br><br>
The blade on Drysart's guillotine had fallen, but the wizard was not
beheaded. In fact, he didn't even seem to be injured. The blade on
Vinalrii's guillotine had not fallen at all. Despite the release handle
being pulled, the blade seemed to ignore the call of gravity and sat at
the top of the death machine.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Drysart and Vinalrii were pushed back into the prison building by three
guards, who followed them in and shut the door behind them. The angry
crowd outside wanted to see an execution and probably would have accomplished
it themselves had the guards not quickly ushered the pair back to the
prison.
<br><br>
"I don't know what you did to those guillotines, wizard, or how you managed
to do it," one of the guards growled, "but don't believe that you are just
going to walk away from this."
<br><br>
Drysart smiled slightly, "I do believe the law is quite clear. If an
execution is stopped by the hands of the gods, then the accused should be
cast and exiled unharmed from the city."
<br><br>
"The gods had no part in this. It was sabotage."
<br><br>
"My blade fell and didn't hurt me, her blade didn't even fall. I know
quite a bit about magic, but I can't explain how I would have been able to
do that, considering I've been stripped of my mana."  Drysart was actually
rather confused as to what had happened himself. He knew why the blade had
not killed him, but he knew not why it was on his blade, and he knew not
why her blade failed to fall. For all he knew, it was the gods' work.
<br><br>
The guard sneered at Drysart. Technically, the wizard was correct. Felwithe
law clearly stated that a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention,
and the accused should not be killed, instead exiled; but the guard was
not thinking of the law. The guard was acting as if he had been personally
wronged by the wizard. Most of the high elves felt the same. Bearing a
child with a dark elf? It was a collective slap in the face of every
citizen of Felwithe.
<br><br>
No, the wizard nor the woman would walk away from this, the guard would
believe. He turned to the cabinet he stood next to, containing the personal
items of the prisoners incarcerated at the prison. After a second of
rummaging, he pulled out an ornate dagger. The one with the ruby set in
the blade.  The very same dagger they took from Drysart when they brought
him there.
<br><br>
"Your actions are an affront to everything I stand for. I will see that
justice is done."  The guard approached Drysart and raised the dagger to
strike.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Under the cover of night, two figures crept out of Felwithe. Keeping to
the shadows, their departure went unnoticed.
<br><br>
The taller figure scouted ahead, and returned to lead the shorter, pregnant
figure out of the city.
<br><br>
They disappeared into Greater Faydark. The next morning, as three slain
guards were discovered, a team of the Felwithe Guard Elite were dispatched
to track them down. Their lead was none other than the guildmaster of the
Keepers of the Art himself, Tarker Blazetoss.
