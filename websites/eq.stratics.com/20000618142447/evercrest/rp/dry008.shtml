The pixies emerged from behind every tree, darting out of every overgrowth.
Rubicant was caught unprepared for their onslaught.  He dropped the dagger
he was holding and stepped back to cover his face. They relentlessly
swarmed about him, pushing him away from Saraiah, who was so entranced in
her meditation that she was unaware of what was happening around her.
<br><br>
Rubicant swatted his arms at the pixies fruitlessly. They forced him back
further. He pulled his hood up over his head and turned to run into the
forest. A group of the pixies pursued him, driving him from the forest. The
rest remained with Saraiah, still fluttering around her in the air as she
awoke from her meditation.
<br><br>
She delighted in their presence.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Vinalrii was very nervous talking to Drysart. She told him she had an
imporant matter to discuss, but she couldn't quite get to the point. She
was afraid how he would react.
<br><br>
The wizard noticed her shifting on her feet and looking around uneasily.
"Talk with me while we walk," Drysart told Vinalrii. He took her hand as
they started walking in the direction he figured Saraiah was in.
<br><br>
"Where are we going?" Vinalrii asked, hoping some small talk would ease
her nerves enough to bring up the topic at hand.
<br><br>
"I'm following a guildsister of mine," Drysart started. "I want to make
sure she's safe."
<br><br>
Vinalrii was quiet for a moment. She looked up at the canopy of the forest,
noticing how it blocked the sky, none of the night stars were visible
through it. She was reminded of the Nektulos forest.
<br><br>
The wizard gazed off into the distance, looking for movement. He waited
for Vinalrii to speak, but she would not.  He felt she was nervous, so
he continued speaking, to calm her. "I think I've lost her."
<br><br>
Vinalrii looked up at Drysart. His words fell on her ears with a different
meaning. Perhaps because her mind was already filled with thoughts of her
own, she interpreted what he said different than what he had meant. "Drysart,
do you love her?"
<br><br>
"What?"  Drysart stopped and looked at her.  "What do you mean?"  The
unexpectedness and audacity of her question shocked him.  As he looked at
her, expecting an answer, it suddenly dawned on him that he was walking
through Greater Faydark with a dark elf.  In a defensive reflex, he let go
of her hand and took a half-step back. "What if I do?"
<br><br>
She knew she'd hit a nerve with him. She noticed the look on his face, and
how he stepped away from her. "I... I..." she stammered for something to
say, "Nevermind Drysart," she reached for his hand, "Please, I meant
nothing by it."
<br><br>
Drysart looked into her eyes. He was afraid. There was something she wanted
to talk to him about, and he felt they had just stumbled close to it.
"Vinalrii, go home," he pulled her hood over her head and turned her
around. "It's too dangerous for you to be here."  He gave her a slight
push on her way.
<br><br>
She walked a few steps, and turned to look at Drysart. He was watching her.
Tears began to form in her eyes as she turned away and disappeared into
the forest.
<br><br>
The orcs watching secretly from nearby quietly scattered off.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Drysart entered a small clearing in the forest as the sun began to rise
over the forest.  He had been searching for
Saraiah for several hours before he found a trail. He followed the trail
to the clearing.  He had hoped that he would find her there, but there
was no one there, except the pixie who appeared to be flying randomly
nearby.
<br><br>
A glint of light on the ground caught his eye as he walked into the clearing.
He went to the light and was surprised to find what was there: an ornate,
jeweled dagger, with a ruby set in the blade; the one he had seen in his
dream.
<br><br>
He felt the blade.  This was the blade that would have killed Saraiah.
This was the blade that killed his parents. He could almost hear the dagger
laughing at him, as if the ruby set in it was looking back at him. He
closed his hand around the blade, squeezing it.  The sharpened edges
pierced into his hand.
<br><br>
Saraiah danced into the clearing. Her night in the forest had lightened her
spirits, she had just been on her way back to the Vale when she ran across
Drysart.  She saw him holding the dagger, and she saw how he had cut his
hand on the blade.
<br><br>
"You need to be more careful with that, silly! It's sharp!"  She grabbed
his hand and pulled him off, "come on, let's go home. It's time to stop
playing with sharp objects."  She smiled at him.
<br><br>
They arrived in Rivervale just before the next nightfall.
