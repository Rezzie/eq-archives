Simplest thing I've found, is that when ya train, it's better to work on skills like Jewlery, Smithing, Tailoring, or even Baking. the reason being, is yer weapon skill's gonna keep going up as you have to fight more and more. That will get you Xp's. But, with higher ranks in the craft skills, you tend to be able to get money. Such as with Tailoring. Initially, it's gonna cost you a platinum or two to buy the sewing Kit (Large is the best idea as it's gonna be needed eventually anyhow, and it does the same as the small one), so ya might as well locate one and go ahead and save and buy it. Then, go to a tailor shop and purchase some Patterns. Patterns will usually cost about 5 silver and some copper. Patterns are used up when you try to make something, so buy more than one of each type. It's best to wait till yer skills are at like level 10, bout when ya have to start spending money to do it. The optimal time is around 20, but start off small. Expect to waist money one it at first as you build yer skill with actually doing the skill. All this time, yer fighting skills with keep going up as yer having to fight to get the goods to sell to buy patterns. As you kill Wolves and Liones and Puma's and bears etc, you can then combine them with the patterns and if yer lucky you'll make some armor. And yer skill with gradually go up. Now, when you sell the armor, you can usually sell for at least 1 gp and some silver and coppers. With 1 armor piece sold to a shop keeper, yer gonna be able to buy 1 or 2 patterns, depending on yer charisma. As yer skill goes up in the trade skill, you'll have less and less failures, and will eventually make more and more profits. All the while yer fighting skills will go up and up do to having to earn yer materials from the animals prone to wanting to keep it. The skill you want to work on is yer choice though, tailoring is one of the easier, and less complex one (until much later), so I use that as an example. Also, people tend to Auction the patchwork armor for roughly 2gp per piece, a couple platinum for a full set. eq.stratics has a much more detailed description of the skill, and all the other crafts. Just remember, the more ya use a skill, the more it goes up. So, if yer a Paladin, and yer fighting a lot, yer fightings naturally gonna go up and up.  Get an Idea of what you want YOUR character to do, and go with that.
