In Reply to: <a href="92351721024707.shtml">The controversy over maps and the /loc command.</a> posted by Anatel on April 07, 1999 at 4:33:30 PM CDT:<p>
Ok, I have some thoughts on the subject too.  Bear with me though, because I'm not sure how this will all fit together.<p>Anatel, seems to be complaining that, because he has to work and go to school, he doesn't have the time to devote to "exploration" and therefore wants to use maps.  Ok.  Go ahead.  I don't care.  No skin off my nose.  I have a full time job and, with the commute, I am away from home about 11-12 hours a day.  In the morning I have four little kids to get ready for school and daycare.  Same four little kids when I get home in the evening.  If I am lucky, I get to play for 2 hours while I am doing laundry, etc.  Do I use maps?  Nope.  Do I use spoilers.  Again, Nope.  You want to -- go ahead.  I don't care.  You are playing YOUR game and I'm playing mine.  <p>Perhaps I am dense.  Maybe just too stupid to figure it out.  But I've not been able to have /loc make anything easier for me.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.  What do I do?  If I'm in danger of dying, I RUN and make sure that I die in a place that I recognize.  I make it a practice to spend a lot of time in an area.  Enough so that I am familiar with a lot of the people and with the landmarks.  I work at building relationships with the people (even tho I'm only on for a couple of hours).  I play a cleric and I ENDEAR myself to people.  I gather FAVORS.  So that when I need help, I usually can find it.  I've only had to ask for a Bard's assistance a couple of times and, because I had healed them a time or two, got help immediately.  My advice?  Don't die in places where you can't find your way back.  If you want to use the /loc command.  Ok.  Go for it.  You are smarter than I if you can figure out how it works.  <p>I just don't understand what the comotion is all about.  WHO CARES if you use maps?  I sure don't.  WHO CARES if you use /loc?  I don't.  WHO CARES if you know all the spoilers?  Again, I don't.  It just doesn't matter, because I CHOOSE to play my own game and I CHOOSE to allow you to play yours.
