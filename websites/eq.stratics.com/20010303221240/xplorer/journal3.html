<p>Bleh...

<p>Failed my driving test, so my mood for writing haven't been what I'd wanted it to be. Instead I've been playing Everquest, escaping to the lands of Norrath like it would be my sanctuary for the time of being.

<p>How I failed? Err... well, this guy wanted me to hit the breaks. So I did... it's not my fault that he hit his head on the instrumentual board and suffered a concussion and 3 stitches...

<p>No, seriously... I was so nervous I could die, and when you're nervous you tend to make mistakes, and if you make severe mistakes (as In my case) you get flunked. Thus I was :).

<p>Enough about that... let's see what I've done the last couple of weeks, starting with the Wednesday, now two weeks ago:

<p>Upon connection I found both Xaanin and Soma online. Teron had decided to drop Dresca and was now going to go for Xaanin... sigh :). Soma had come home from his vacation and he was not pleased to see me at the same level as him, having both bone armor and teleportation spells :).

<p>Anyway, with nothing better to do, I decided to stick with griffawn hunting, as it was safe and fast way to earn both money and experience.

<p>I must say however, that kiting a griffawn in East Karana can make some people frustrated, not to talk about kiting two of them! :P. It seems that I do have enough mana at this level to kite two of these beasts, but it's an awfully close call :).

<p>The East Karanas ran out of griffawns at some point though *whistles innocently* and I decided to try the griffawns in North Karana. While NK has a lot more griffawns, and would thus be a better hunting ground for me, it is also packed with Hill Giants, Griffennes and -ons, which can end my life at a very fast pace.

<p>NK is also frigheningly unsafe when it comes to meding near the bridge. Even though there are three or four guards outposted there, there is no guarantee that they'll take down whatever a 40+ player decides to bring in. At one time I was utterly surpriced when a gnome came running along with three big nasty griffons. I didn't even have the time to stand up before all of them were beating the crap out of me. Luckily I made it to the zone with two bubs of life remaining.

<p>Btw, one of the griffons kicked me. Now how do a griffon kick, having the legs of an eagle? I've never seen an eagle being able to hover in mid air while kicking it's prey, have you? :)

<p>Also found Aiin online later this evening. It seems that luck had shine on him and he'd gotten his second Chipped Bone Bracelet without much camping. I'm happy for Aiin, but on a side note, my best possibilty for getting those Bone Leggings just went byebye.

<p>That didn't bring me down too much though, so I kept on with my griffawn hunting, determined to greet level 20, which would grant me two more "abilities"; Tracking and a Surname Possession.

<p>I didn't take advantage of the latter (at this time) but the Tracking was always a nice addition to my set of skills.

<p>It's far from being that of a Ranger's. While Rangers pick up a target half a zone away, we Druids are restricted to be able to track as far as we can see, if not shorter. People would wonder what tracking is for then, but I found some very good uses to it.

<p>First... while a Ranger can pick up a prey half a zone away, they don't know how far away their prey really is. This could be a bad thing, especially in the Karanas, where there are nasty mobs waiting to crush the feeble adventurers moving aimlessly through the forest. With Druids' tracking, you know that the thing you've picked up (unless it's someone you are grouped with (which you can track all over the zone)) will be relatively close to your current location.

<p>This proves to be very good, especially to mobs that happen to go invis on you, because of the latency handler on the server. It's known to happen that the griffawn you saw at the horizon just decides to disappear for a while. You think you got it in range and DOT it, just to see it appearing again 2 feet away from you!

<p>With Druids Tracking I don't get more than one griffawn "on radar" and I know that this is the one that I am hunting. All I now have to do is to run towards it and usually the server kicks it up for you again, thinking it would be a vital piece to have on your screen, as you are tracking it.

<p>By using tracking I can also, in this case, home in on griffawns that I would normally not be able to see, due to the same reason.

<p>Needless to say, tracking improved my griffawn hunting a lot. But at level 20, griffawns aren't the best things to hunt. I didn't have much more time to play though, so I continued to hunt these beasts till the end of the evening.

<p>Also, with the Bone Leggings out of my head, and thus no purchase of a pair, I realized I had some spare money in my bank. And with the 69pp I had collected so far I was able to purchase both a Foremans Tunic and Kobold-hide Boots from Aiin!

<p>I didn't really plan on buying the Foremans Tunic, as it has an ac of 10 (compared to the 12 given by the LJ Tunic). But the 3wis and 3str given by it convinced me that it was of better use than that of the LJ tunic. The weight of 0 stones was also pretty nice :).

<p>The Kobold-hide Boots had an ac of 5, +10hp and +3agi. I've also been told that these are one of the better boots that show up as Leather. There are some better boots than these for druids, but they turn out as chain (except for the Journeyman Boots).. and chain boots on a wood elf doesn't really look nice at all.

<p>Aiin had also gotten himself two mithril bracers this day (talk about luck :)) and had dropped his "old" Chipped ones. I wasn't able to buy one of them though. First of all they are a very good trade item (grr.. trade...) and second of all, they can sell for over 500pp, a piece! Wow! I guess Atherion better stand saving up those pps :).

<p>Anyway, without a way of getting myself a pair of Bone Leggings, I checked if Nexxis would be able to toss up a party to go bashing on the Ogres ourselves. I was only in it for the Bone Leggings and the rest would be evenly split up with the others who would join us. She liked the idea, and told me to stay in touch.

<p>Back later at home I decided to continue my EQing. There was a carneval in town at the being, but with a somewhat cold weather I decided to play some EQ for the money I would others had used up for snacks, food and attractions.

<p>While I was buffing up and preparing for whatever I was heading for I met up with a Human Warrior, named Scrum. He knew about me from this journal (*waves to Scrum*) and we started to talk a bit. During our convesation, a gnome, named Pognip, was auctioning out a Turtleshell Helm, for the mere price of 15pp (I dunno if that's the standard price). Now the thing that is so special with these Turtle Shell Helmets are that they turn out as chain, and Soma was in need of such an item.

<p>Problem was though that I was flatbroke after my tradings with Aiin. I talked the situation over with Scrum, and before I knew it this Human I'd never seen before put 15 of those platinum coins in my hand, thanks!

<p>It turned out that I was even able to barter the price down with 3pp by throwing in a SoW and a Skin Like Rock. I don't really know, but I think that 12pp for a Turtleshell Helm was a really good deal.

<p>I was curious how Atherion really would look like with a chain looking helmet, and to my surprice, it wasn't all that bad, quite the opposite. I've never liked my ranger and warrior cousins for having those gawdawful bulky thingies taking up 50% of their head parts. It seems though that with having a Leather looking tunic you can still see the neck and chin, which looked a lot more better. I do have a mixed feeling about it though. While it does look nice, it's not very druidic like, and that goes with all chain I guess. If I get the bone armor I'm planning to get, I'll look more like a tank than a protector of nature. Oh well... I guess there are highly specialized druids out there who've learned the basics of heavy fighting :).

<p>Anyway, I arranged with Soma to meet him in West Commonlands and off I went. A bug had to get to me though, something similar to the loot-inspect bug and without any other way of resolving it I was forced to do a /quit. Back after 5 minutes Soma was standing at the dervish camp and I was able to give the helm to him for the 15pp I had borrowed from Scrum.

<p>Knowing that I was flatbroke I decided I'd try selling my Lockjaw tunic. Knowing that it originates from Lockjaw himself (really :)) I decided to give Feydwer a go for a nice profit.

<p>Once at the ruins I was able to direct myself to the road and I set out plans to sell it in Faydark, as that place is pretty crowded, as we all know at this time :).

<p>I did get a reply from an intersted Halfling, named Extremo, in Butcherblock though, and we decided to meet outside the gates of Kaladim. He didn't really have much money, so he was more interested in making a trade. I was offered anything ranging from a Blackened Iron Medallion to a Bronze Helmet. While I was actually in need of money, rather than another item to sell, I finally agreed on trading the LJ vest for a Grotesque Mask (7dex -9cha). I'd heard that these items went for good money in South Karana, and with my teleporting abilities, it was something to take advantage of :).

<p>He and his friend was also interested in purchasing my Bearskin Boots, and offered me 3pp for them. At first I thought it was a good deal, but thinking about it, it was not. First of all I'd spent 1pp for the Medium Quality Bear Skin and then another 15gp just to make them. That landed me of a total cost of 2.5pp, and considering the time spent on faction raises and time spent on hunting bears I was not going to give it up for 5gp :). I knew I'd made a good deal with the LJ tunic though and traded the boots for another pp.

<p>With my LJ tunic "sold" I decided to go back to good old Rivervale (I'm addicted to that music) before I called it a night.

<p>Upon connection on Thursday I decided to make it to South Karana. Xaanin was level 20 now, so I thought I'd be able to group with him for a while and at the same time, selling off my grotesque mask.

<p>On my way there I talked with Aiin about the Ogre Camp in West Karana. It seems that the shamans are about 28-29 in level, while Chief Goonda himself is around level 34. Hmm... we better assemble quite the party then.

<p>Once in South Karana I was able to sell off the Grotesque mask pretty fast. A fellow Swede, by the name of Shadwell (same guild as Xaanin), bought it for 45pp.

<p>Grouping up with Xaanin we mostly took on the rooks that spawned in the area. They were yellow at the time, and we felt pretty bold after a couple of kills. So, we decided to try out an Aviak Harrier. I thought I'd be too low to kite it, but the DOT stuck and we were able to take it down after some kiting. And the experience was great, I now had my level 20 buffered up and I was ready to explore once again.

<p>Xaanin wanted to continue soloing and I decided to make an expedition to Mistmoore, were Soma was currently enjoying himself, avoiding train after train :).

<p>I did a quick gate back to Rivervale, deposited the money I'd made and then I gated to Butcherblock.

<p>It took an awfully long time getting to Mistmoore tough, and Lesser Faydark turned out to be larger than I had thought. Being the catious person I am, I stuck with the wall, but pressing the track button I came up with a lot of emerald drakes and the likes. I even laid eyes on a Fae Drake, and it turned out to be one of those colorful butterflies :).

<p>With Soma's directions I was finally at the foot to Mistmoore and I decided to bind just outside, just in case (not fun to start over in Rivervale :)). I buffed up, took a deep breath, and entered a zone which I knew would be over my level.

<p>The first thing I noticed was the corpses spreaded across the area near the zone border. I was determined not to end up as them and quickly located Soma's group. Luck wasn't with me though, as once I was invited, I couldn't group up. It seems that I had just stumbled across yet another bug and I was forced to /quit.

<p>Now my question is: Why are there so many bugs in this game? I've yet to see one in Ultima Online (though I know they had quite the bug explosion during beta and some time after that). Even if I might have come across a bug in UO I've never been forced to shut it down.

<p>I'm ranting here, but I got a license to do so, so hear me out.

<p>Most of the bugs in EQ have to do with the gawdawful layout and coding of the interface. The graphic engine is awesome (though I would like to see more objects such as bushes and grass (instead of that boring faded out green mess we call the ground)), but why did they have to do such a stupid interface?

<p>The thing that aggravates me the most with the interface is that there are loading times between looting or going into inventory. Heck, the looting phase can be so lagged up that it's more dangerous that it should be to recover your corpse! During this time where you enter a loot screen or inventory your screen goes black. For me it takes about 2-3 seconds before the screen comes up again, and it's during this period that bugs such as the loot-inspect bugs occur. Why is it like this?

<p>There is also a lack of logic with the designers of Verant. Why in god's name have they placed the spell memorization slots to the left, when 80% of us playing EQ are right-handers (no offense left-handers). A lot of people, including me, move around in EQ using the "Quake keys", ie. A S D W for movement, while doing other actions using the mouse with our right hand (mostly clicking on spells and the hotkey buttons). Logic suggests that you would like to have the spell slots to the right, and the life meters and all that to the left!

<p>Now this might seem weird for some of you, but do like this... Take a screenshot in either windowed or half-interface mode. Open your favourite picture editor and make a mirror of the image. 

<p>See how nice it looks and how nice it feels for your right hand? That's my point... Well, one of many :).

<p>Anyway, once I'd reconnected I was able to join up with the group and before I knew it, pledge and initiate familiars were swarming in. The familiars aren't what you are led to believe though. Instead of fighting what would be a mage's pet, we fought what resembled to be Teir Dals. I found it all too confusing, and I wonder if I've lost a definition on familiars that are not shared between Swedish and English.

<p>We had some very close fights, but overall we were doing just well. People had to log after a while though, and soon there was just me, Soma and another guy. Playing with a group of three in Mistmoore would be suicide and soon, both Soma and I, decided to leave Mistmoore for now. We both had the teleportation spell to North Karana, and we agreed on meeting up there.

<p>With both of us being in North Karana we came up with the incredible idea to leave the powergaming for now and do some explorations, this time in Lake Rathetear.

<p>I'd only been to Lake Rathetear on one earlier occation and Soma hadn't been there at all, so we'd most definetly have some new encounters, both good and bad.

<p>We made it through the overcamped undead and gnoll camp and decided to take one of those small boats. I right clicked on the boat and I was given the control of it. Making sure Soma was standing right beside me we ventured out into the unknown.

<p>It didn't take long though before a bug struck us. I had paddled out just a couple of yards when I could no longer see or grouptalk to Soma. The /tell command worked though and it seemed that Soma had decided to sink right through the boat. He managed to get to the middle island though and I decided to pick him up for another try.

<p>Soma appeared at the island and I told him to jump in. Then it was my turn to sink right through the boat and I paniced, ending up beneath the surface. I was able to resurface though and made it to the island shore.

<p>We left the boat for a while to explore this small island we had set foot upon. There was a mountain wall to the.. err.. right (west I would believe) and a huge staircase to the left, ascending to the sky. There was a small platform at the end of the staircase, with a strange green fire burning on top of markings and runes. Three Aviak Guards were also posted here, two of them coning blue and one being white. These things looked nasty, and especially, big. So we decided it was time to move on to another island.

<p>Jumping into the god forsaken boat again we were able to get it to move again. I couldn't see Soma much though, as he was fading in and out of the screen. He told me he was still on the boat though and that it was moving, and that was all that mattered.

<p>Paddling around aimlessly we finally found another encampment of some sort. We touched land and we saw ourselves in a barbarian fishing village. I didn't know how they would react with a Teir Dal entering their village, and when I turned around to check on Soma I saw a remarkable sight.

<p>I laughed out loud (or LOL for short :)) as I saw Soma, upside down, spinning around in a breakdancing style. It was obviously a bug, a cousin to the one where you see your groupmembers swimming around on dry land.

<p>All of the suddenly Soma vanished and was nowhere to be seen. I threw up my tracking window, but it just showed me the way to the boat, and Soma was definetly not in the boat.

<p>In some way, which is still a mystery, Soma had ended up near the entrance to Rathe Mountains, while I had stumbled across this barbarian fishing village! I don't know if he came to the barbarian village and then later swam to Rathe or if there was a really nasty bug sending Soma to one place and me to somewhere else, while still being on the same boat!

<p>Anyway, Rathe Mountains sounded a lot more interesting than this village so I dove back into the boat and used the loc command to track him down, as my tracking persisted to tell me that Soma was still in the boat :). It was quite a paddle, but after a good 5-10 minutes I saw Soma at another dock, waving at me as I approached.

<p>There seemed to be an identical camp here, with gnolls and undeads... and lots of players. We hit the zone border soon towards Rathe and my computer began to chew.

<p>Once the loading time was done we bound ourselves near the zone border and decided to proceed with caution, as a lot of nasties were running around here, anything ranging from a Giant Skeleton to those pesky cyclops.

<p>It was indeed a very dangerous place, and definetly not a place for low 20ies to spend a vacation in. A cluster of cyclops forced us to turn back towards the zone border and I decided to call it a night, while I still knew were I was :).

<p>I must say that the Rathe Mountains is an impressive zone. It varies a lot in the topography and there are several mobs which are great to kite at the high twenties, I will definetly go back here once I get my Ring of Feerot.

<p>While I'm guilty of not been playing any Everquest on Friday (at least I do not have any memories, nor screenshots from this day), I have been playing something. And that something is called Asheron's Call.

<p>Yep, I'm proud to announce that I was approved to enter "phase 2" of the Asheron's Beta, and my feelings are mixed, and disatisfied as for now.

<p>[Note: I guess there is some kind of NDA with playing the Beta of Asherons, but the things I'm going to state here has already been written about on various other sites (I hope :))].

<p>I won't go into the actual installments and downloads of AC, instead I will directly jump over to character creation and the actual gameplay.

<p>The menu system in Asheron's is pretty sweet, and it's by far better than that of Everquest, and it's huge grey buttons :).

<p>What ticked me off though was the actual character creation, and this will probably be one of the major reasons why I will not continue to play Asheron's during final. The graphics are a mess, and it makes UO and it's undetailed faces (not counting paperdolls here) to be the major graphics achievement of the year. Sure, you can make a unique look with all the nose, eye and mouth pieces that are applicable, but they all look bad IMO :\, it's on the break of being cartoonish, and I don't like it at all.

<p>The actual world and the atmosphere around it peaks over what Everquest has achieved. The first thing that hit my eye... er.. ears when logging in was the bird song. This one of many features that I miss in Everquest. Sure there are some sounds during the night (those little grasshopper thingies), but when the sun is up I don't recall hearing a single bird.

<p>Some of you might have been playing Settlers, and you know exaclty what I mean. That game has atmosphere, not only because of good graphics (well, the sequels had decent graphics :)), but because of all the sounds! You could hear the birds, you could hear the saw mill, you could hear the activity in your little community you created, but in Everquest - there is static.

<p>I truly hope that this will be one of the things that Verant takes into consideration when making the expansion. It might just be me, but I feel that birdsong, sounds of the wind breezing through the canopy are things that are a must to make some kind of atmosphere in the world we call Norrath.

<p>As it is now, it's pure luck that you might get to hear the sparkling sound of the Miller's bonfire, if there is any sound at all that is. And isn't it strange, that a place such as Kaladim, with all their mines and forges, is dead silent, like there was no activity at all?

<p>What is also much better with Asheron is the world layout, I think :). From the screenshots I've seen and the little time I've been playing, the world is built in a more logical way. I'm not talking about zones here, but more the fact that there are actually small clusters of houses spreaded across the roads of Dereth (as the world is called in AC, I think), as well as castles placed on mountainsides, surrounded by a thick cluster of trees (you might just call it a forest :)). 

<p>I dunno, this might just be wishthinking, but I hope it's just not only that. While Everquest have done a wonderfull thing with their graphic engine (despite their interface coding), I hope that Asheron's will be as ground breaking with making a world that actually feels like a world, bustling with activity, than some zone mongering world where you go to that zone there and there just to camp that and that place without taking a note on the things that around you, object-wise (not counting monsters :)).

<p>Oh well, I better stop before I loose my right to beta test this game. Who knows? It might get to be quite the success, but with Microsoft... I'm not sure.

<p>Back on Saturday, being in the deadly Rathe Mountains, I decided it was time for me to go. Soma had made it out safetly and was now in East Karana. As I was bound here in Rathe I decided to travel back to Rivervale, to rebind me for future adventures.

<p>By teleporting to WC I quickly made my way to Rivervale. Once I was bound I did a ring to North Karana, thinking it was griffawn hunting again. It was pretty empty of griffawns though, and my feet brought me to East Karana.

<p>Nexxis was standing near the bridge and we started to discuss our camping expedition. She'd talked to her friends and they'd agreed on camping the Ogres. We were all in the range from 20 to 36, so while we would still encounter a lot of problems, it could probably be done.

<p>The consistant problem with what we call the internet though is, what we call it, the time-zone syndrome - You just can't seem to get five or six persons to be online at the same time :). We did agree on going there as soon as everyone would be online though, but that would probably be a week or two before that happened ;).

<p>I said farewell to Nexxis for now and started to, yet again, hunt the griffawns scattered across the Karanas. Most of them were still blue to me at this level, but there were some higher greens around. I still got the experience for slaying them, but it wasn't as good as it had been a level ago.

<p>Xaanin was online, and somehow, we both ended up in Lake Rathetear. I was first planning on grouping up with Thalandin, who was fighting aviak guards in a group, being level 18 (!). They did have low level player with them though, so I couldn't group up with them.

<p>While Xaanin and I were initially set on trying out the guards as well, we met up with heavy resistance at the gnoll/undead camp, and the experience was flushing in. The drybones, who now conned high yellow to us, were beatable, and they gave awesome experience.

<p>Day came though, and the undeads were replaced by low level guards. We decided to try out one of those guards Thalandin was fighting. It was camped at the middle island though, as well as the aviak encampment near the entrance to the Arena (I have to visit that place sometime). Thalandin and his group let us fight one of the avis over at their place though.

<p>It was pretty weird though. While the aviak guards stand five times taller than their cousins in South Karana, it was never able to score a single hit on me! It conned high blue, but it kept missing me, and I was homefree to make some heavy hits with my trusted Glowing Wooden Crook ;).

<p>The loot was 3gp each, and I would guess they drop the same amounts as a dervish thug or a griffawn.

<p>Thalandin and his group resumed their camping and I and Xaanin decided to try out the gnoll/undead camp as night was closing in again.

<p>The gnoll spawn was still there, and all of the suddenly we saw ourselves engaged with a Gnoll Embalmer. I'd never fought these before, but we got it down with ease. The loot surpriced me, including both a Quartz Crystal (+5hp) and a Skull of Jhen'Tra!

<p>I've seen these skulls going on auction before, but I've never taken great attention to them. They are quite good though, offering me an additional 20mana and 3sv vs magic when worn. I guess I'll be going Scimitar and Skull now in mana draining situations, I still prefer wielding my Crook though.

<p>While fighting a dry bone skeleton, we saw a Gnoll High Shaman. We got them both down, but when I was about to loot one of the corpses I was struck by that gawdawful loot-inspect bug again. I told Xaanin to run away so that the inspection would go away, and indeed, the bug problem was solved.

<p>I did have quite the ping time after this though (I don't think it was caused by the bug) and I had to relog for a more stable connection.

<p>Xaanin was gone once I returned. I threw a /who all, but the Worldserver confirmed the fact that he was out of the game. Not knowing what to do I decided to return to the Aviak Village in South Karana.

<p>Before I got there I threw a petition about my problems, and three minutes later Guide Biktik responded.

<p>I told him about my problems the same way I had told the last GM I talked to. This time I wasn't greeted by a reply that would tell me to reinstall EQ. No, this time I was given the response that Verant was aware of these matters.

<p>Dunno what to say... but I think that GMs should have some source of information. I mean the GM I spoke earlier to didn't have a clue what I was talking about, and now, this guide told me that Verant knew about it? And I thought it was the game masters in a game that knew it all... apparently not. I'll address my petitions to guides in the future... I wonder if there's a switch for that? ;).

<p>Anyway, guide Biktik also informed me that a similar bug was caused if you throw a /loot command on your corpse while you are meditating (I gotta try that next time I die :)), and the only sollution for it as for now would be to /quit.

<p>I had a better sollution for the inspect bug though - just put the inspect action on a key instead of the right mouse button. That would solve a lot of problems, such as:

<ul>
	<li>There would no longer be any "accidental" inspections while fighting, using first person view. That would, logically, increase player survivability in dense fights, as well as decreasing player frustration.
	<li>Considering anonymous players would be easier, as you then would just get their colors, instead of getting the colors and the inspection (which often ends up with a "Sorry").
	<li>Chasecam. It would enhance chasecam usage by a great deal. I don't know how many times I've been trying to loot a corpse when I end up with inspecting myself (which could be very deadly as I then often tend to start running, and that's nasty when there's a red mob or a cliff somewhere).
</ul>

<p>Biktik liked the idea, and he told me he'd forward my ideas to the Verant staff themselves. He also told me I should do a /feedback, just to make sure they really got the picture.

<p>Well, this was an odd encounter. I've never played an online game before where guides or GMs have actually listened to ideas made by players. From now on, I know that my /feedbacks won't be of waste. And I truly hope that they make a seperate key for inspection. I don't care which, but I will definetly apply it to a key I rarely use ;).

<p>Anyway, I tried kiting some rooks, and it went pretty well. I don't like kiting stuff in South Karana though, it's so easy to get lost, and everytime you kite you put your life on line. It's a gamble, and I feel much more comfortably if I know that my chances of survivability is above 95% :). 

<p>I grouped up with some people, and their druid, named Ayngyl, had some items that caught my eye.

<p>Polished Bone Bracelets, 2ac 3wis 3int, looted from the Evil Eyes in Beholders. I haven't really sought after these items (except for that time when I couldn't find no one to camp for them), as I've always envisioned myself wearing those Chipped Bone Bracelets. But knowing now that I gotta take one step at a time, I think I'll go hunting for these myself in the near future.

<p>We took on some rooks and darters/egreets, but I felt that I wasn't getting enough experience for the time spent. Sure, the things we fought was anything between blue to high yellow, but as always with the Aviak Village it is heavily camped. Heavy camping means lesser mobs to hunt, and that means less action and experience.

<p>One place that was not short on action was Mistmoore, and while I knew it was dangerous I needed a kick to lighten up my evening.

<p>I bid my farewells, disbanded and gated to the Butcherblock Mountains.

<p>Too bad, no one was around my level in Mistmoore, all of them being around the 35ish range. The journey I had made there wasn't all of waste though, as this high level player gave me a Dwarven Axe. I didn't know what they were worth, but I guess they would at least be worth a plat or two.

<p>Leaving Mistmoore I wasn't ready to go back to the mainland, there were still some more zones to try out, such as Dagnor's. While running through Butcherblock again I was able to form a party with two more players. Rolladar (Human Warrior) and Raspberri (Wood Elf Bard) were their names, and we decided to try out the deepwater goblins in the Cauldron.

<p>While we were just about to walk down the path to Dagnor's I was met by a very strange sighting. There, down by my feet, a fellow Wood Elf was lying, slain. Now, I get to see slain wood elves all the time scattered across the world of Norrath, but this one was special. 

<p>Altherion was his name, and I have a vague memory of seeing him while helping Thalandin through his newbieishment (itaw) in the Faydark.

<p>It's amazing that two people can choose such similar names :). I'm sure of the fact that he didn't know about me while creating his character (I was level 11 when I saw him running around fighting bats in the Faydark), as we asked him if he knew about the place, and he said no. I'd forgotten about him until now, but his corpse revived my memories.

<p>I couldn't find him through a /who all command, but I have to tell him later that he has chosen a good name ;).

<p>Anyway, we couldn't find much to hunt in Dagnors. Everything, and I do mean everything, was camped (being Saturday and all... :)). Raspberri came to the idea of trying out Unrest. While I had avoided it the last time I was around these parts, I felt no fear of going in there now, being grouped and all.

<p>Going through the tunnel which led to Unrest we were greeted by an horrible sight. I would say 15 or more players were resting just outside of the zone border! We litterarely had to shove ourselves through the masses to get to the border. Once there we buffed up and braced ourselves for one hell of a fight, and it was a good thing we did just that.

<p>Once my loading was done I was already engaged fighting a Tormented Dead. A Lurking Mummy joined up and we saw ourselves soon being outmatched. We weren't going to flee without a decent fight, so I quickly sat down and memorized my Cascade Of Hail.

<p>*Casting sound*.
<br>[Insert screen going red here].
<br>You are pelted by hailstones.

<p>What the...???

<p>I had targeted the lurking mummy and I threw my Cascade over it, hoping it would stick on the tormented dead as well. What happens? Instead of the mobs covering their heads for the thousand hailstones that fall from the roof, I start loosing life!

<p>Of course, this brought the odds to the undead even more than they were before, and we were forced to run for the zone.

<p>Now, even though the fight was pretty confusing I am sure that the Cascade hurt me and not the undeads. I had my target on the lurking mummy, yet I was greeted by the "You are...". I dunno if that's normal for most AE spells (as you're standing in it, but then you are also "Protected"), but I'll keep my hands off the Cascade of Hail spell for a long time. I wonder if this is a one timer bug, but once I get the time I'll do some research on this gawdawful spell.

<p>We rested up from our encounter and braced ourselves for another rush into the arms of the undead. This time we made it through the small zone tunnel and came to the outskirts of the Mansion garden. There were people everywhere here, fighting anything between Death Beetles to Dark Terrors.

<p>The latter spooked me quite a bit. It looks like a wooden cone with several "tentacles" sticking out, killing anything at low level within seconds (low level would be my level and below I think :)).

<p>I didn't get to stay around much though for search of creatures. The slideshow, caused by all the lag, and the many trains (and confusion and chaos that practically ruled over the whole zone) brought me to leave. A corpse retrieval in this zone would be to the border of impossibility!

<p>Making sure the group was ok I threw a gate to Rivervale and called it a night.

<p>Yawn... damn weather changes, keeps me from enjoying my 9 hours of good sleep. Oh well, I guess I finally got the time to finish up on part II (and everything else that has happened to me this week for that matter :)).

<p>Back last Friday, standing in the plains of East Karana I noticed that Balkoff wasn't online. Without him I wouldn't be able to take on Crags, so I tried kiting some gorge hounds. They turned out to be quite the hazzle though (having too many of those hitpoints) and after a fight I was usually down to 0% in mana.

<p>I threw an ooc through the zone, asking if anyone wanted to join up with me to take on Crags or something. A Halfling, named Nort, replied with why I would wanna do that when I could level much quicker by just killing the reavers. Oh yeah, the reavers... I'd forgotten about those :).

<p>The tactic of snare, dot, run down to the water, damage shield yourself, throw an ignite or two and then whittle the rest down in melee proved to be quite efficient. I was killing reaver after reaver (who all conned blue, whether it would be a gnoll reaver or an undead reaver) and my downtime was of no compare of what it was when killing gorgies.

<p>Within less than an hour, I finally hit the level I'd been fighting (litterarely speaking :)) for.

<p><font color=yellow>You raise a level! Welcome to level 19!</font>

<p>Oh my god, I thought, thinking whether this was true or not. I couldn't beleive that I had come this far. Level 19... geez... I still can't help myself fainting when I think of those numbers :). Now, before the summer came I set up a goal that I would at least _try_ to get to level 14 before the summer was at an end, and now I'm 19 with 2 more weeks to go? :)

<p>Anyway, level 19 ment new spells, and new spells always ment a lot of fun. So with an empty experience meter (the first hour after you've just leveled is always the worst) and a fresh 19th Atherion I ran back to Rivervale.

<p>I felt invulnerable crossing the lush green hills of Misty, and I smiled at all the struggeling newbies, knowing that I did exactly the things they were doing now 10 levels ago :). Ah... that was life, wacking goblin after goblin after goblin after goblin after goblin after goblin after goblin.... ok, you get the picture :).

<p>Once I had withdrawn my amazing 163pp (!) from the bank I bound myself near the bank and made it to the West Commonlands. There I was told I would buy my ring (teleportation) spells. There was just one problem though...

<p>At the druid ruins, there was no merchant around. I did however see a name sticking out of the middle stone. I couldn't target it whoever it was, and thinking it was not the person I was looking for, I headed out in the night to search for this merchant. Talking to some higher level players I found out that the merchant would have a name of "Whisper" something.

<p>I searched around the hills, I searched down at the beach, I searched the derv's camp, but alas, there was no Whisper something around.

<p>Then I got a call from Maven who told me that her toe might be sticking out of the stone (so it was her :)). Back at the druid ruins her toe was really sticking out... stupid :). Oh well.. I was able to target her and I was brought to the trade screen. The four rings I could use at this time all went for 10pp each. I had spent 40pp in just a matter of seconds... geez.

<p>Knowing that there were griffons around this place I quickly gated back to Rivervale and inscribed them there. It took a while, and once it was done I took my remaining 123pp and ringed (teleported :)) to North Karana, where I was told that the rest of my spells would be.

<p>There were griffons here too, and treants that scared the hell out of me (and they are still supposed to be allied with Karana and Tunare? s'yeah... right :)). I quickly bought all the rank 5 spells she had to offer me, and once again I gated back to Rivervale.

<p>The "ordinary" spells were a bit cheaper, and I found myself having money for the animal spells which was sold in the Druid's Farmstead. Finally with all the spells in my inventory (and being 139pp poorer :)) I sat down and began my one hour inscription... yawn.

<p>Let's take a look at all the spells I bought, and what use I could get from them.

<p>Barbcoat - This is a good buff. It adds about 10ac I think, as well as adding a 2dmg damage shield on yourself. The duration is very long, so I don't have to recast this one as much as I have to with the Skin Like Stone.

<p>Calm Animal - Supposedly to be an upgrade of the Charm Animal (or Lull Animal?). However I don't think I will be using this much, not until I hear someone telling me this one is better than the previous one.

<p>Cancel Magic - Great when I'm rooted or if I got a friend who is charmed I guess. Still, I have heard that you can break out of roots by SoWing yourself.

<p>Careless Lightning - Unbelivable spell. Once I tried this in the thicket it made an amazing 94dmg on mobs who didn't resist. Powerfull stuff. It also have the same spell animation as the cleric's strike spell (the red stars and then the globe looking blast). I like it!

<p>Dizzying Wind - Also a favourite of mine. If not resisted, it does an incredible 110dmg! Though it does cost 10 extra mana compared to Careless, and as it can be totally resisted, I think I'll stick with Careless.

<p>Endure Disease - Great when fighting undead stuff I guess :)

<p>Endure Poison - Same as above, but replace undead with spider :)

<p>Feral Spirit - Buffs your pet. Not sure I will use this one, as the duration for druid pets is very short. It would be nice though if you could throw this on a bear and send it over to whittle down a griffawn, but then again, bears don't attack griffawns even if you tell them to do so... sigh. (One tactic I will try later is to have a pet griffawn, spirit it up and send it on a griffenne. If I then panic the griffenne the griffawn will stick to it with no hp loss... and the griffawn would hit more than I would with my Glowing Crook.... more on this later).

<p>Healing - Ahh... I've been looking forward to this one. It heals 80hps and it sure makes a difference now when the tanks at our level got hundreds of hps.

<p>Ring of Butcher, Commons, Karana and Tox - Where do you want to go today? (tm) :). Actually, these are excellent when reducing my playtime. I'm now bound in Rivervale at all time (almost). If I would die I'll just be able to ring somewhat close to my corpse. I like it!

<p>Shield Of Barbs - I'm guilty of not checking the effects on this spell. But I've heard the duration is as bad as Shield Of Thistles at lvl 9, so I'm sticking with SoT until I get a little bit higher in level.

<p>Superior Camoflauge - Unlike Camoflauge, this can be cast indoors. Not a real biggie if you ask me.  The only indoor place I'm in is in Runneye, and I just throw a camoflauge before I enter Runnyeye and then it usually sticks on me until I've come to the wooden bridge in East Karana.

<p>Terrorize Animal - Hmmm... seems to be an upgrade to panic animal, but why? Panic is doing fine at the time. Longer duration? Dunno... Harder to resist? I'd doubt that.

<p>As for now, the only spells I got memorized from rank 5 are careless and healing :). So if you are a druid that just hit 19 with little money I'd just buy barbcoat, careless, healing and the rings to Commons and Karanas for now.

<p>Anyway, back to the story.

<p>After I had finally inscribed them all I decided to go and buffert up my level by adding a bub of experince. So off I went towards to Runnyeye, but as soon as I came near the zone border and was about to throw camo on myself I realized that I had Ring of Karana. Smiling I tried it out and within a second or two I started to zone.

<p>The treants scared me again (btw. A little tip to any new aspiring druids such as myself. Whenever you ring to karana or commons, start running once you're done loading. Could be a griffon nearby :)) and Atherion did a gesture up to the sky were Tunare was watching, telling her to get some less scary looking servants :).

<p>Using my sense heading I was able to direct myself south and thus ending up at the river. There I took a left and followed the river until I came to the bridge that would take me to East Karana.

<p>Back here in East Karana I took my chance and started to attack a griffawn. Now, I had tried kiting these earlier in North Karana (before I went to Lavastorm) and I must say they were _a lot_ easier now with a whopping 94dmg spell :). Starting with a snare, followed by a quick dot I dragged it down to the river. Then I just opened up with everything I got and after 4 or 5 carelesses it was down.

<p>My killing abilities when it came to griffawns had been upgraded from minutes to a mere 20 seconds! Of course, I was down to one bub of mana. I guess I could do it with less if I solely kited it with dots... but then it would take as much time just killing it as it would take me to med up my lost mana I'd been wasting on carelesses. Besides, tactic number one is ten times more exciting too, so I'm sticking with that one.

<p>It was so fun being able to kill griffawns like they were little imps, so I continued doing it during the remainder of the time I had in school.

<p>Being Friday night I had 2 hours to use up at home as well, so once I got home I yet again logged into EQ.

<p>This time I tried out the scythe beetles in North Karana, and even they turned out to be pretty easy. They seemed to resist my careless more though, so I went back to the griffawns and the occational reaver (who were still blue btw).

<p>After an hour or so I also grouped up with a halfling warrior, named Hyppon. He was a cocky little bastard (fighting wise :)) and didn't care whether he brought home three or four reavers for us to fight :).

<p>Two of them tagged on to me by mistake (I hate it when tanks run towards you when you are throwing a damage shield on them, thus getting all the mobs on you and the effects of the shield are gone :)).

<p>I couldn't shake them off of me, and Hyppon had one or two to fight himself so I snared both who followed me and sent them on a merry chase. Once I had doted both I used most of my remaining mana to finish one of them off with carelesses. Then I increased my distance to the one who was left and threw a damage shield on myself. With that I was able to finish it off in melee, but my mana had gone byebye a long time ago :).

<p>Oh... patch update. It is now possible to make smileys without having to use a space between the colon and the ) thing (bracket?). I guess we won't see anymore of these messages in the future then: 'you are too funny )'.... :).

<p>Anyway, it was time to log off at this time, so I threw a gate to Rivervale and camped on the table of Marshal Ghobber, as I always do.

<p>Back on Saturday night my time, with over 1,000 people online on Tarrew (happens only on Saturdays and Sundays :)), I didn't really know what to do. Checking my friends list, which was filled with people this time, I got a call from Xaanin. He was killing aviaks in South Karana, being at 16th level now. I wanted to see this Aviak city which I had only seen from afar once. So we agreed to group up a little there to do some efficient druid necro kiting.

<p>I ringed to North Karana and proceeded towards the white stone bridge. Once in South Karana I threw on a camoflauge, renewed my SoW, and proceeded directly south, in search of the aviak city.

<p>Once at the city I was just in time to save Xaanin from a vicious elephant (peaceful in nature, but when a necromancer comes and starts shooting balls of hovering skulls, they get vicious :)), who was ripping him and his pet apart. A couple of blasts of my newly acquired careless did the trick, but it didn't feel roleplayish slaying an elephant as a druid, in favor of a Teir Dal (*waves to Nathanial*) Necro.

<p>There were an amazing 62 players in the zone, and I soon became aware of at least 40 of those were camping the aviaks... what a zoo :).

<p>This was also the first time that I just had to drop the music in Everquest. It was so lame and non fitting that I just had to. Why can't the programmers make more icky scary music? People would be more cautios then I think.

<p>Anyway, we took down an egreet and some other kind of aviak, but the experience was scarce. We did get to fetch a red rook though and we took it on a merry chase. I was a little bit too trigger happy though, and I wasted a lot of mana on carelesses which were only resisted anyway (it doesn't feel good throwing 70mana away for 14 in damage :)). Still, we got it down... after some minutes of running with an empty mana bar, slowly regenerating :).

<p>I wasn't too impressed of South Karana though, and I wanted to get out of there. Xaanin decided that he was going back to Neriak to get him some new spells, then he'd go directly to Unrest on Feydwehr. I wasn't certain if I wanted to go along with him, but I told him to tell me when he arrived in Butcherblock.

<p>Back in Rivervale I happened to stumble across Ekodas (who I grouped with in Runnyeye a while back ago). He was still in my level range (being "only" lvl 18), so I asked him what he was up to. He didn't know for sure, but he did think about killing gorge hounds and crag spiders in East Karana. It turned out that he was grouped with one of his guild mates, a female wood elf bard, named Kethra. They invited me in and we decided to hunt the karanas.

<p>Ekodas had just bought a new axe, a 2h dwarven axe, and I recognized it as the weapon Balkoff had been using, and when asking Ekodas whether it was or not - it was :).

<p>Kethra became the one to fetch, but I and Ekodas soon laid eyes on an Evil Eye. I conned it, and surprisingly as it was, it was blue to me! Kethra told us to draw it and I began DOTing the creature. I knew I'd die, but I had a buffert on my level now so it did not matter :).

<p>The Evil Eye and it's pet (damn guardian thing :)) came rushing towards us and Kethra and Ekodas started to whittle it down in melee. I began nuking from afar, doing my 94s at best. The Evil Eye was anything but pleased and answered by charming... me :\.

<p>Helpless was I when I uncontrollably began ripping Ekodas apart with my mighty Glowing Wooden Crook (I'll never wield a weapon again when fighting an Evil Eye :)). Kethra and Ekodas still had the pet to take care off, and I could do nothing but panic as my Atherion went charging in a berserker mode.

<p>I had gotten Ekodas down to less than 2 bubbles (it's really annoying that you are 10 times better at fighting when you are charmed :( and almost never miss what you are fighting). I tried typing sorry all the time, but it just didn't get through :). They, however, acted cool and Kethra just started to sing her healing song. That's when my Atherion decided to attack Kethra instead :).

<p>Kethra was a little bit harder to hit though, and this gave Ekodas some time to heal. I took away a bub from Kethra's life and I was tearing my hair off in despair, how would this end? They wouldn't start killing me, would they?

<p>Then finally, it broke off and I was able to tell everyone how sorry I was. I know one thing for sure, being charmed is not fun at all :).

<p>Everything was fine now, and we were able to loot the Eye. That's when that gawdawful bug hit me which had pestered me a lot in the past....

<p>Have you ever tried looting a corpse when the lag makes you (or a missclick for that matter) inspect another person instead? And what happens then? Uhuh... the whole thing freezes up. You can't loot, you can't cast any spells, you can't click on F10 to change interface mode, you can't press I for inventory, you can't do nothing! Oh yeah.. you can use your hotbuttons... and take away your buffs.

<p>When this happened earlier it eventually wore off, but now it wouldn't. I both petitioned and sent in a bug report and then I was forced to log out to get it to work again.

<p>Back in the game I was now totally operational again and we began hunting again. Soon we saw yet another eye, and I began doting. It went better this time (no one was charmed) and we got it down with little trouble. It was ok for me to loot it, but instead of finding any polished bracelets I found Evil Eye Eyestalk. I didn't know what it was for, but Kethra would give it to her high level druid who needed it in some kind of spell... whatever :).

<p>Then we finally found ourselves a crag. It was much easier taking one down now, doing 94 instead of 37 in damage. It felt pretty useless wacking a creature with 600+hp by doing ignites for 37 :)).

<p>We also brought a whole tribe of gnolls on us. There were a lot of named gnoll npcs who were pretty high in level, but with the help of a high level player we were able to take them all down. Phew... and what a fight it was!

<p>It was getting pretty boring though, and with my new ring spells I wanted to take the remaining time to check out Butcherblock and the zones of Feydwher. Xaanin was already in Unrest at this time (I was fighting evil eyes when he arrived with the boat, so I didn't go with him). I told Kethra and Ekodas goodbye and thanks for a good time.

<p>I'd only been at the druid ruins in Butcherblock once before, and that was when Kalo brought me there from the thicket a long time ago. I was all around lost, but with a bit of a luck and an urge to explore, I found myself on the right track. I came upon a little outpost with two guards, and doing an /ooc on my location with those guards in mind, two fellow players were able to pick me up and escort me to the Greater Faydark in exchange of a bind (thanks Ikarus and Erick).

<p>A note on Selos Accelerando and SoW. Playing Selos will cancel the effects of SoW. Even though the SoW icon is still there, you will travel in normal speed when you get out of reach with the Selos.

<p>Ah... Greater Faydark... ugh.. :). I always have hope in this zone and thinking it would be wonderful to play around here a bit, then as soon as I arrive the charm is gone. There is almost always 80+ players in this zone, with _constant_ discussions going through in both /ooc and /shout... sigh. It's pure luck if anyone see your /auction thing, whatever it may be.

<p>I must say that my newbieishness (itaw - if that's a word :)) has diminished at some extent. I don't think the Faydark, or other zones for that matter, are as big as they were when you were just a newbie :). Knowing that I can just gate away in safety to a zone nearby it's not the end of the world if you happen to drop out of the road and get lost.

<p>By following the road though, brought me to the gates of Felwithe. Once I saw the guards I wanted check them out, whether I'd be KOS or not. Coming up a little closer I was able to con them - amiably. Okay... maybe Sephy wasn't too liked by the guards? :).

<p>Continuing along the same road finally brought me to Kelethin. Here the guards also greeted me amiably, and I let out a sigh in relief. I guess the extent of the faction hit is probably as much as killing an orc pawn, but the other way around.

<p>Oh well... I felt a strange urge to find my old guildhouse and I just had to check it out. I took the lift up and followed the paths that I thought would take me to the bank and then later to the Soldiers of Tunare. Seemed that I couldn't find it, not even the bank. Then I came to realize that the path directions I knew had to be from the main lift with the priest of discord. I cursed as I walked back the way I came. Following the road a bit more on the ground took me to the right lift and from there I was able to get to the place where Atherion had once begun this journey of leveling in a galaxy far far... err.. nevermind :).

<p>Even though the Heartwood Master (druid leader of kelethin?) looked at me amiably, the druids did not. They looked at me apprehensively, and I didn't like that. So to raise my faction with them I thought about giving Crushbone a go, it was a while since I was last there :).

<p>The outside camps which were once filled with pesky deadly centurions only held some crippled orcs now which could be killed by just a swung or two with Atherion's mighty crook. Knowing that I'd died by one when I grouped with, Otharion (?), I nuked it with a lightning. It screamed out, and Atherion had gotten his revenge :).

<p>The trains of centurions inside of Crushbone didn't affect me now either, and I could freely walk around in the "dungeon" that Crushbone is. By doing one hit on all orcs who were already engaged in melee with other groups made my faction go up once they'd killed the orcs :). I didn't see no MerchantsOfKelethin in the faction adjustments though, but my attention was soon on something else.

<p>GM: I've received thy petition. How can I help thee?
<br>Atherion: Uh... what petition?
<br>Atherion: Oh yeah :)

<p>Oh well... better late than never eh? :). I explained my troubles which I had been experiencing when I tried looting the Evil Eye. She (think it was a she :)) hadn't heard of a problem like this, and suggested that I should try and reinstall Everquest.

<p>Heh... now I've been working with computers for a long time now, enough to know that it is not a fault that originates from my client or the world files that I have on my hard drive. My beleives are that it's a minor client crash. This has happened a lot to me, as I play through chasecam. And I can assure you, when you click on a corpse to loot it you often target yourself. Then when there's lag it doesn't know what you were actually clicking on, so it does both an inspection and a loot, and that's when it happens. I've solved this once by letting the person I inspected move away until I couldn't reach him for inspection anymore, and then the bug let off. But this has only happened once. I've had people moving across zones with no luck (haven't tried zoning yet).

<p>When I told her this she told me I'd probably give the tech support a call. Sure... that would only cost me about 10$ a minute... can I do a collect call? :). I guess there's an email addy somewhere too, but it's not something that only happens to me, so why should I talk to them in the first place?

<p>Anyway, I thanked her for the help she'd provided, if not much, but still. I was about to tell her goodbye when I saw an opportunity to finally get an answer on that faction hit with duels and the tin pie exploit.

<p>She didn't know the extent of the faction hits, nor would she tell me where it was printed where it said you would get faction hits by duelling. However, she did tell me that it had been removed during the recent patch... excelllent! Sephy! where are you? ;)

<p>Talking to her about the tinpie exploit all she could say was that the programmers were aware of the matter, but she didn't know what actions they would take. Now I read Oghma's post on Everquest Express and he mentioned people getting banned by GMs.

<p>What can I say? Verant knew that the people knew about the exploit but still they went along with the patching. Did they think they would be able to track everyone down and bann them (that would be a sight :)) and thus put an end to _their_ (Verant's) own mistake?

<p>Any other company with a general IQ over 5 (that excludes OSI btw :)) would have waited with the patch or, better, not mentioning anything at all about the changes of pottery to the test server. This is just stupid. People have been banned _because of_ Verant (it's like showing your dog that you are leaving a sandwitch on the table. Would it be able to resist it? No.), the economy has been screwed and people have less faith in Verant now. Not a patch in the world could have been more important than that.

<p>Anyway, back to the story :).

<p>Strolling around in crushbone during my discussion with this GM I met up with Talor (attitude boy :)) on the hill where the Orc Trainer spawns. He was about level 20 now and had gotten his lastname "Steals" :). I was just about to give him the address for this page when I notice the trainer spawning and all of the suddenly, Talor Steals is no longer around me :). 

<p>Soon the four other people who was camping the trainer are smearing out /oocs and /shouts that Talor Steals is a kill thief. No one really bothered, except for the other higher level players that had been experiencing the same thing when Talor came near them :). What can I say? Gotta love Talor :). He even told me that people hate him more here in Crushbone than in Misty Thicket... lol *shakes head* :).

<p>After I had finished talking to the GM I left Crushbone. I'd been running around here and there, and I hadn't found anything funny. And no, even though I would like my own Shiny Brass Shield, I wouldn't want to sit down for an hour or more camping for it, especially not with Talor around ;P.

<p>Back outside in the faydark I went to check out Felwithe, to see if it was really as nice as people had told me it was. The gates... err... the city wall... er... that cluster of marble towers outside is just awesome, but I don't like that light yellow color... looks sick in someway :\.

<p>Just inside there's two guards and a bridge leading towards the center of the city. I didn't really like the cluster of houses that appeared here and there though with the vineranks.. reminded me of Qyenos.. ugh. What I really did like though were the doors and that sound they make when you opened them, incredible :).

<p>I couldn't stay for too long though, so with having Felwithe somewhat explored I tried my other ring, this one going to Toxxulia Forest. Didn't get to explore it much though as it was way past midnight, and I needed to get some sleep.

<p>Once back in school on Monday I had set up the goals to explore Erudin (which I've kept forgetting to do so far) and to try selling off my Savant's Cap around these parts. Since it originates from Feydwer, I thought I would might be able to make myself a good deal by selling it a continent away.

<p>Turned out I couldn't login though. It seemed the account server had flipped and it was no longer recognizing peoples' accounts. Thankfully, they were able to fix the problem within an hour, so I never got restless :).

<p>Back in Toxxulia I found myself being the only one in the zone (only 280 players on Tarrew at this time). All alone in the forest I wandered aimlessly around in hope to find any signs of Erudin. It was pitch dark and I could barely see. Entering a hut I came across some heretics. I figured it was the necromancer's guild, as there were apprehensively, non talking, NPCs with pet skeletons everywhere.

<p>By speaking to Yilbiku I was told to follow one of the zone walls in the forest, and by that be able to find an entrance to Erudin. And after 3 minutes of running I came to a rocky part with a cave.

<p>Everything looked very cold inside, the stone walls, the marble floor... even the air looked cold. The tunnel turned and soon I was in a circular room, looking at a lone crystal, hovering in the air. I'd heard about these "teleporting gems" before, but before I stepped on it I wanted to know exactly where it would lead me, and if I would be able to travel the same way back.

<p>Then, out of nowhere, a fellow player by the name of Kavis appeared. After I had made sure that he wasn't an NPC I asked him about the gem. He said it'd take me to the heart of Erudin and told me to follow him. Then he ran up the small steps and onto the crystal, but instead of disappearing in a gust of smoke, I saw his character continuing to run past the crystal and then continuing running, even though his character hit the wall.

<p>Figuring it was one of those code glitch bugs, I too stepped upon the gem, and within a second (wasn't even a zone), I was brought to Erudin.

<p>I must say I'm quite impressed by the graphics in Erudin. There's marble everywhere and sometimes it became too much when I went inside a building, having my greater lightstone equipped. I was almost blinded - unbelivable.

<p>The buildings in their own were pretty amazing themselves. Heck, even the bars put the most beautifull buildings in any other city to shame (however, I must say that the temple of life (?) in Freeport is one of the nicest buildings I've seen so far).

<p>The palace of Erudin and it's rooms were awesome. Everything was crystal clear, with fountains the shade of emerald green (it's the emerald that is green, right? :)). It became too much for me on the second floor though, which kept several spellcasting NPCs which kept casting and casting and casting... The sound started to flutter really badly when all of them decided to put on their own version of their shield, so without knowing the way out I decided to gate "home" to Kelethin.

<p>As it had just been Kavis and I in Erudin, I still had my Savant's Cap lying around in my inventory, un-sold. It didn't sell in Kelethin either, so I decided to go back and hunt some griffawns in North Karana.

<p>Once again I was terrified by the cracking sounds of the Treants and I quickly made my way to the water. My mana bar was less than 60% from my travelling, and I decided to meditate up before I engaged any griffawns.

<p>Before I was able to sit down I met up with Hika Windsong again (the enchanter who threw the spell Clarity on me). We exchanged buffs and with her being an enchanter, I asked her if she had any jewelry to sell.

<p>Indeed she had, and she'd give me two Electrum Jasper Earrings (each +2wis) for the price of 16pp. That seemed a little bit much for just 4wis, but since everyone seem to have the same prices, I'd be better off just buying them now than running around for two more levels trying to get lucky and find an enchanter who would sell at a lower price.

<p>Hika had her gear in the bank so we had to go to Qyenos. This wasn't a biggie for me, as I then would be able to make that bear armor from the Millers again.

<p>Running through West Karana I spotted a brown bear. Being at full mana, and having clarity, I wanted to see what good my careless lightning made on these animals. It was better than I expected, because after just one careless it was slain! And it even looted one of those rare MQ bear pelts, talk about luck!

<p>When I'd bought the earrings I decided to up my faction with the Millers a bit, so I directly made it to the plains of West Karana. I'd been told to fight some stuff over at the Miller's farm. I was thinking about those Scarecrows, and with my new set of spells, I didn't expect too much of a hazzle.

<p>My morale went down the drain though, as lightning struck as soon as I took my _first_ step on the field. The rain started to pour down and it felt a bit spooky. Making sure that there were no GMs around who were trying to play any tricks on me (hey, you never know :)) I began my hunt on the scarecrows.

<p>They were a bit harder to spot now as I couldn't locate their lights in the dense fog that arose. Finally coming upon one I imediately conned it - blue. I thought that as long as they weren't spell casters (which they turned out to be :)) I'd be fine with the snare-dot-run-nuke tactic.

<p>I snared it successfully, and it came rushing (well, at least trying to) towards me in a very head bangy way... looked really eerie, with their lights being thrown here and there (their head is a pumpkin, not unlike the ones seen during Halloween).

<p>Once I had doted it and nuked it a couple of times I'd gotten it below half life. Being the curious wood elf Atherion is, I wanted to get a better look at their melee capabilities. Like everything else around this level, they scored for anything between 10 to 30 of damage, making melee a no no if I didn't want to sit down and heal for 20 minutes. I decided to stick with the nuking procedure, and 10 seconds later it was dead.

<p>It did affect me of a spell of some sort... I'm still not sure whether he actually casted this or if it was something that was given by touch. I'm guilty of not checking this while I was fighting.

<p>Anyway, it was slain, but I had not gotten any faction raises with KaranaResidents, nor did I get any good loot from them.

<p>I decided to check up on the Millers anyway though, so off I went to Qyenos Hills. It turned out that they did like me now, and I was able to make all three of the items they had to offer (belts, boots and cloaks). I guess my random killing of gnoll pups here and there had gotten them to talk nicely of me :). The only item that interested me for now were the bearskin boots, and for that I needed an MQ bear pelt (had two now) and 15gp.

<p>Going back to Qyenos I finally got an answer on my Savant's Cap auction. A player needed it for his other character, who was in South Karana, and he agreed on buying it for 32pp (all my travelling had finally payed off). I bound myself in the bank of Qyenos, to deal with the Millers later, and told the buyer that I would meet this other character at the bridge of South Karana in about 5 minutes.

<p>I ringed to North Karana and quickly made it to the bridge, and soon the buyer (forgot his name.. Kel... something) also appeared. We did the exchange and once again I was standing in the streets of Qyenos (god I love being a druid :)).

<p>When I finally came back to the bonfire where the Millers reside they were nowhere to be found. People told me they'd seen them near Blackburrow, but I couldn't find them their either. Later it turned out that a player had gotten restless and had decided to wack both of them... dooh. Not knowing the spawn rate of the Millers I decided to make a more thorough exploration of Surefall Glade.

<p>By going through a waterfall, I came upon the bear caves of Surefall. It was twisting and turning a lot though, and since there wouldn't be much in there that would do me any good (as you receive a nasty faction hit for killing surefall bears) I decided to check out the Millers again.

<p>Back they were, and I was finally able to make myself some bearhide boots for both me and Dresca. I think they had an AC of 5, and others than that they looked a lot better than my old Small Patchwork Boots :).

<p>My work was done here in Qyenos, for now, and I decided to return to good ol' Rivervale. I ringed to West Commonlands.

<p>While I was running to Rivervale I got a tell from Aiin that he was now camping the Ogres in West Karana (where you get the bone armor). He was trying to get himself another Chipped Bone Bracelet, and if he'd come around Bone Leggings, they would be mine to purchase (yay!).

<p>Knowing that I had a dept to pay him (still missing out on 10pp for the Lizzie Mantle) I withdraw the money, bound in Rivervale, and ringed to North Karana.

<p>Once I'd zoned to West Karana I was actually able to home in on the Ogres' Camp by doing the loc command. I must say I'm quite proud of myself :).

<p>I conned the Ogre Guards which were there from a distance, and strangely, they conned yellow... and indifferently. That ment they wouldn't attack me, great :). The Shamen, and Chief Goonda, were red and scowling though.

<p>When I gave Aiin his 10pp he gave me a belt in return (?). I didn't know the meaning of this, but he told me he didn't have any use in it for now that I might as well be able to have it. Checking it out it turned out to be a Giant Snakespine Belt (originating from Goonda himself). It wasn't as good as my bearskin belt, AC-wise, but the +5 on both agility and poison resist surely made up for that, and my AC was actually higher when using this belt (thanks Aiin!).

<p>Aiin had to leave soon though, but he did take out Goonda first when I was watching, and it was quite impressing I must say.

<p>With Aiin leaving I was not going to stay around all by myself so I made it to East Karana, to deal with some griffawns and reavers.

<p>I can't tell you enough how much fun it is to fight griffawns at this level. I rarely get a beating from these things (unless they stay persistent and resist my snare). With the aforementioned tactic of snare-dot-run-nuke I can kill them within seconds. It may not be good for my meleeing skills, but it sure helps that gooey orange experience stuff to start flushing in on my meter :). I think I stayed griff hunting all night until I had to log in Rivervale.

<p>Anyway, back on Tuesday I'd read about the Lupine Claw Gauntlets, and to get them you would have to acquire a werewolf claw, and obviously, these originated from the dead bodies of werewolves. So my plans for this day was to both explore Kithicor, to find Ged Twigborn and maybe a werewolf, as well as killing Griffawns in East Karana.

<p>Kithicor came first as I was already in Rivervale. I ran around a bit, but there were no signs of either Ged or a werewolf. I did get a general idea about the area though and I decided to return later when I had acquired a HQ bear pelt (for the Bearskin Gloves, I've given up on trying to get myself a HQ Lion Skin. First I want 100% reliable proof (aka screenshot) that they actually exist).

<p>Instead of going to East Karana I hunted the griffawns in North Karana. The zone is smaller, which is a plus, and it contains more griffawns. Problem is though that there are wandering Hill Giants, Griffennes and Griffons, which is a bad minus. It evens out though, and I was able to get some decent loot and experience.

<p>By talking to Dresca I found out that he had an extra HQ bear pelt lying around in his bank. As I'd recently given him a pair of Bearskin boots he would let it go to me for free. I gated back to Rivervale, picked up the pelt, and made it for Kithicor.

<p>It took an awfully long time to find this Ged figure though, and it was all thanks to Stann, a high level ranger, that I was able to pin point him doing the /loc command. The first thing that I noticed was that Ged was not a halfling that I had been led to beleive, but a human. I asked him about his garments and it soon turned out that my faction with KithicorResidents was too low to let him make me some Lionskin gloves. Baah.. who cares? The HQ doesn't exist anyway :). He would give me some Bearskin gloves for the price of a HQ bear pelt and 25gp.

<p>Dooh!!! I forgot to bring money :(.

<p>I told Ged to stay put and quickly made myself to the bank. I remembered the loc numbers and once I came to the grassy hill where he'd been 3 minutes ago, he was gone...

<p>Another 30 minutes was needed to find him, this time by sheer luck. During this time I'd run into two camps of undead, one containing about 15 to 20 zombies and one containing several lesser mummies.

<p>Ged took my pelt and money and within a flash I was given back some very neat Bearskin gloves with the ac of 5 (whereas my raw hide has an ac of 3, I think).

<p>With the bearskin gloves, and Ged being a history on my 2do-list (yes, I keep one on my desktop :)), I decided to go back and hunt the griffawns, this time in East Karana.

<p>After killing a couple of griffawns night came and the moon sent it's eerie gloom over the plains. Then out of nowhere, I saw something that looked like a gorilla jumping around, killing any animal it got near. I soon became aware of the fact that is was a werewolf! But just not any werewolf, but a named one!

<p>Felicity was it's name, it seemed weird for a werewolf, but that didn't stop me investigating the matter at a closer range. Soon I found out that it had a lastname too, and my thoughts about it being an NPC diminished.

<p>It was totally erased when it started to talk with me. I wondered whether this was some kind of a rare disease, much like the Lycantrophy in Daggerfall. She didn't want to discuss the matter much though, but told me she'd only seen 2 more infected on this server. Wow :).

<p>Then, all of the suddenly, the beast changed it's form. Out of nowhere, this eeriely beautifull high elven female appeared and gazed at me with her crystal clear elven eyes.

<p>We talked a bit, I trying to get as much information from her as possible :). She kept secretive though, and soon che changed form once again, howled, and disappeared in the night.

<p>I was a bit shocked by the whole event, but I soon gathered my thoughts and began hunting those griffawns again. It did became quite boring after a while though, and my lust for explorations grew more for each griffawn I killed. I decided to check up on some more areas on Feydwer.

<p>This time I was able to find the way around all by myself and soon I was standing at the gates of Kaladim. It struck me that I'd never been inside this city, so I decided I'd give it a go.

<p>Kaladim turned out be pretty nice. It was hard running around in chasecam, due to all the caves and shifting height to the roof, but others than that, it was good. Verant had made an excellent thing and put up this yellow-brown fog that lied all over the place, which really enhanced the atmosphere a lot. It vaguely reminded me of a dungeon me and my friends had experienced some years ago in a pen and paper game.

<p>It was pretty hard to navigate in this city though, so without getting too lost (and by that having to ring back to Butcherblock) I decided to go back to the surface.

<p>The next zone which was up for exploration was Dagnor's Cauldron. I'd never seen this zone before, but I had pictured myself a very harsh looking zone with stepping stones every where... I couldn't have been more wrong :).

<p>Sure, it was harsh, but it was creepy harsh :). At night it put Lavastorm to shame and I didn't hesitate to put on my camoflauge. The Aqua Goblins which resided in the area were told to be very dangerous, and I wasn't going to try them out, being bound in Rivervale and all :).

<p>While Dagnor's was creepy at night, it must have been the most beautifull zone during daylight. My god... I got a screenshot of off Atherion looking down at the water that made my inspiration skyrocket. I now have to make up a plot story for Atherion... something about his sister dying in the depths of Dagnors... Prexus... whatever :).

<p>I also located the entrance to Unrest (after falling for 3 bubs of life... damn rocks :)). There'd just been a train though, as 20 people were sitting outside resting, with people coming out with low life. Dresca informed me that it was a madhouse and with that I decided to pass it for now and returning at a higher level.

<p>Time was running out and I only had one more zone to explore; The Steamfont Mountains. Now, I'd love to check out the Ak'Anon, but unfortunately there is a clockwork thing in there which don't like followers of Tunare, and thus KOSing them as soon as you step into the zone (now that sucks :)).

<p>The steamfonts was pretty neat though, and I encountered some monsters which I'd never seen before. The clockwork gnomes, rats and spiders were awful and made a very creepy ticking sound (much like a bomb). The kobolds were awesome though, and I've always been a sucker for kobolds, I dunno why, but I am :). They looked cool, and I'm hoping that Verant will implent them as a choosable race in one of their expansion. They'd be great as rogues or archers :).

<p>While I didn't enter Ak'Anon, I did get to see the entrance though, with the green lava lamps or what they were :). Night was falling and I decided to gate home to Rivervale.

<p>Ahh... end of Part II.

<p>Afterwords...

<p>Level 19 is just plain awesome. I can't beleive that there is such a gap between level 18 and 19, but there is. Instead of getting a DD spell which does 60dmg at level 14 we get our DDs upgraded from doing 37dmg to 94 and 110dmg at 19, unbelivable. While druids were fighters at level 1 to 9, we became casters at 9 and until level 14, where we became something of a mix. And now at level 19, we are pure spellcasters again, being far more better in fighting than both a warrior or a wizard.

<p>Plus the ring spells are excellent. I never have to treck more than 3 zones now to get to a town or my corpse if I would die. The only areas that I'm bad at covering would be the south areas of Norrath, the lands near Halas and, I guess, all of Feydwer :).

<p>Oh btw... also got myself a 56k modem now. Zoning goes twice as fast now, and I no longer have the time to go make a sandwich and run 2 laps around my house, which is nice :). And now when I get a nasty PL and everything turns red I no longer get kicked out. It just freezes for a while, then the modem kicks up as a backup and I'm back again to play, really nice.

<p>I still got some more entries to do before I'm totally up to date. I still got to cover the things I've done from last Wednesday until today. I guess that'll come someday next week. Don't get your hopes up though. If everything goes as I have _not_ planned, three days will be taken to prepare myself for my last test drive, when I will show myself worthy of having my own driver license.

<p>Well that's it for now I guess.

<p><a name=1><b>Journal Entry - 990730 - 11:39am</b></a>

<p>Hi all.

<p>This journal entry was to come a week ago, but I've solely been concentrating on getting level 19, so you'll have to excuse me.

<p>[Note 990801: It seems I had more than I thought to write about, so I've divided this journal section into two. The latter will probably come tomorrow, 2nd of August]

<p>I'll skip the part when I was hunting in North Karana, as it's nothing to talk about, really. I kited a few griffawns and pincer/borer/scythe beetles, but the downtime, compared to the experience, was just too much, so last Friday, I finally found the courage and set sail... er... foot to Lavastorm.

<p>During my treck there I paged Saddith through the /who command. She was indeed in Lavastorm and was now level 18. I told her who I was and after a while she remembered me.

<p>Once in Lava she came and picked me up and escorted me to the Najena entrance. I recorded the way there so that I would be able to find my own way there in the future.

<p>I checked around a bit and found out that most rock dervishes conned blue to me now. The Fire Eles conned anywhere between green to yellow, so they were still a deceptive fight. The Lava Crawlers and Basilisks both conned blue or white to me, so my first target was just one of those basilisks.

<p>I soon became aware of their powers though, and I cursed myself when I was stunned by their Stone Breath spell. It's not fun just standing there (or even worse, spinning) while they snatch after your legs during a 30 seconds period. I got it down, but it was a pretty close call. I decided not to take anymore of these critters, at least not when soloing.

<p>Next up I tried a Lava Crawler. I did the same tactic as I would do fighting a Rock Dervish - sting, dmg shield self and melee the rest. They became much easier though when I found out that they had a weakness for the Expulse Summoned, which did a whopping 91dmg!

<p>I came to favor the fire eles though. They make wonders to my experience bar, and whenever I found an ele coning anything but green I would just dump my whole mana bar by doing expulses. With them being snared I could effectively take them down without getting a single scratch on myself.

<p>While the eles gave me the experience I wanted, the rock dervishes took care of my melee skills and my financial troubles. My 2h blunt raised quickly and when I'm writing this, I have 61 in it, not bad. They also drop about 2 to 4gp almost all the time, and a gemstone or two.

<p>Though, there is one other mob type that gives more money than the rock dervs - the fire imps. I never saw one of these guys the last time I was in Lavastorm, so they came as a nice surprice when I first spotted one. As with the Lava Crawlers, Expulse Summoned do some nasty damage on these critters. By just snaring them and doing expulses (and stepping away a step or two when they throw their AE flame lick spells :)) I could take them down as easily as the fire eles and lava crawlers. The loot is very good, I've been given anything up to 5gp. It may not sound much for a 40ish warrior (Gual comes in mind :)), but it's sure nice, compared to the fire beetle eyes I got from the nasty scythe beetles in North Karana.

<p>The crowd is nothing compared to that of North Karana either. The most people I've been seeing in Lavastorm at one time have been 22, it's usually around 7 or so though, so it's very nice. I've even been completely alone in the zone on some occations!

<p>Anyway, on the first day I got there I just kept on taking in whatever that spawned, except for the very high yellows and the basilisks. I also grouped up with two players, named Kailune and Golon. Even though we were three people I still gained noticable experience. Kailune had to split soon though, but Golon and I decided to stay grouped.

<p>Our strategies were pretty simple. If we fought anything that could be hurt with expulse summoned we'd just sick his pet (he was a magician btw :)) on the foe, giving me time to deplentish both the life of the foe and my mana meter :). If we, on the other hand, fought something were my expulse was useless I'd just trade hits with the pet, and Golon would be nuking from afar.

<p>We did pretty well, and before I had to leave that night, I hit level 17!

<p>The next day I went up early and logged in at about 10am my time. I'd made arrangements with Auriga to come meet him someplace, and when I logged in, he was online!

<p>He was level 16 and in misty when I paged him. Auriga was logging off soon, but we agreed we'd do a quick run to kithicor.

<p>I knew I didn't have much time, and I was sweating when those gawdawful 3 minutes 28.8 modem zoning times kicked in.

<p>Oh, btw... Teron's Derin character had been swiped (probably by his brother :)) and he was now playing a drow necromancer. He was currently in a powergaming state and had already made 10 levels in a day or two.

<p>When I finally arrived in Kithicor Auriga was rightfully there, waiting for me. I Hailed him, but instead of getting a Hail in response the little halfling started to spin around, like he was looking for me. I quickly realized that I had my camoflauge on (d'oh :)) and dispelled it.

<p>The first thing that caught his eye was my Glowing Wooden Crook... "wow, what a big, er, stick you have" "will impress all the women" :). I told him I'd keep my eyes open for another one for him. He then gave me an incredible 100pp!

<p>I told him I couldn't accept such a big sum, but he just waved it away, telling me that I helped him when he was a newbie (sh'yeah right.. all I gave him was a cracked staff and a patchwork cap :))

<p>He didn't want to discuss it further though, as he had to go back to Rivervale to meet up on some friends. Before he went I got a screenshot of him though, and he laughed as I crouched down to get a good angle :).

<p>Auriga disappeared in a puff of smoke, and I too decided to make it to Rivervale, to sell off some of my gemstones to the merchants who liked me.

<p>Once there I met up with Auriga again, but we couldn't stay and chit chat. We decided though that I would log in at the same time tomorrow, so we could perhaps make a treck to the Karanas or something.

<p>I also saw a FS Scimitar, going for the lousy price of 6pp... grrr... There went my so called profit I would make :), oh well, I guess I could just give it away to someone.

<p>Oh! Auriga also informed me that he'd found himself a HQ _LION_ skin! First I didn't beleive him, thinking it was one of those stupid cat pelts that everyone mix up with the lion skin. He did tell me though that it went for a lot of money at the merchants though, so I guess it really was the HQ one... sigh :).

<p>Anyway, had to log out at this point. The transaction was done and it had taken a whole hour to cross the east parts of antonica with my crappy modem. I thanked Auriga once again, and told him I'd keep an eye open for another crook.

<p>I logged in once again in the evening and prepared myself to go back to Lavastorm. As with all Saturday nights, there were more people online now, and I feared that Lavastorm would be a soup of trains and players. Once I'd buffed myself up I threw a gate and the loading kicked in.

<p>There are 14 players in Lavastorm.

<p>It seems that Lavastorm isn't all that popular mostly due to two reasons. First off, it's basically spellcasters only. Melee fighters will have a lot of trouble here, as most of the critters have spells or nasty fire shields. That makes Lavastorm a bad place for at least 50% of the players in Norrath. Secondly, it's "out of reach" (couldn't find the proper word :)) for most people. Just the fact that you have to treck through drow territory just to get there scares away some people from even trying to get there. All of these factors makes Lavastorm a pretty unpopulated zone.

<p>Anyway, I made it to Najena safetly and decided to bring in a lot of rock dervishes. At this level, the difference between the experience given from a blue fire ele and a blue rock dervish didn't differ that much, and quite frankly, there were just about 10 times more dervishes out there :).

<p>It didn't take long before I found someone who was willing to group with me though. Vanadar was his name, and we made a very efficient party.

<p>With him rooting most stuff I could solely concentrate on expulsing (or 91ing as we called it :)), without even have to move. We brought down nasty yellow eles and both of us made a lot of experience. Unfortunately I just had to die once :). It was pretty funny though.

<p>We'd just killed a fire ele with both of us at low mana. I'd stepped into melee, and too late I became aware that it shredded me to pieces pretty quickly. Soon I was down to half a bub of life, and I knew that it was useless to try to "huff huff" away to the Najena zone. So, I was persistent and kept on fighting. Soon I was down to just a pixel of life and I knew that if he hit me one more time I was toast. That's when that luck came shining upon me again.

<p>I dodged once and the next time he missed me, I aimed with my crook and waam! 22dmg.

<p>You have slain a fire elemental!

<p>We both cried out in relief, and when I checked my exact amount of hps in the inventory screen I read 8hp! Phew.... (or, "Hly cow", as Vanadar said :)).

<p>We quickly sat down and rested very close to the Najena zone. We were so shakey about our experiences that we forgot the logics, and thus forgot to place Vanadar as a scout if a train came running by.

<p>I was telling Xaanin (Teron :)) about my fierce battle when all the suddenly Vanadar cries out that he is hit. I hit enter to send the unfinished message away and soon I am broken out of my meditative trance. Once I get to my outside view I'm lying with my face in the floor...

<p>Ack, I was unconcious. Soon there was an imp coming by too. I saw Vanadar trying to attract them, but with no mana and a weapon that didn't bite on them (and a pet that was already dead) it was useless. I tried to tell him to go for zone, but soon realized that it's impossible to type while you're unconcious.

<p>Vanadar made it to the zone, with 2 or 3 players following him (hmph... and no one came for my rescue... cowards! Oh well... they probably thought I was already dead.. morons! :P (j/k)). It became quite hillarious though, as the imp and fire ele could just not hit me. They tried hitting me for a good 10 seconds before that damn imp scored a hit on me :).

<p>Btw, I was not able to dodge :)

<p>Once the loading kicked in I just thought of something that made me go mad. If you check up on the screenshot with the fire ele you'll see that I have assigned one of my hot keys for the squad ring (charged with an 80hp healing spell)... dooh!!!

<p>Oh well... back in newbie skin at the entrance to Lavastorm. I sat down and meditated, rememorizing all my spells. Vanadar zoned back and told me it was clear to retrieve my corpse. He'd also brought a cleric with him, named Sindayaelie. I quickly made it over there, but once I got there I was up for a shock. I couldn't find my corpse! It was just not there. The blood rushed through my head when I thought about the LJ tunic, the glowing wooden crook, the FS scimitar, the wis rings, the onyx earrings, the bone arms and the savant's cap.

<p>I was about to petition a gm, when I finally saw it... er... or should I say, when I saw Atherion's boots sticking out of the wall :). After I'd retrieved the corpse we continued our killing spree. Sindayaelie couldn't stay for long though, so it was just Vanadin and me again.

<p>At this time some high level characters started to drop in, probably preparing themselves for either Solusek's Eye or Najena. A gnome enchanter, named Hika, was kind enough to throw a Clarity spell on both me and Vanadin. In return I threw a SoW on her and the player she was with. Clarity is supposed to make your meditation a lot more efficient, and does it!? We were at full mana after just a minute of medding, heck... we even gained mana while we were fighting! I'm definetly sure now that Clarity is the 2nd best spell, after SoW :). Our killing pace skyrocketed and we had no problem taking down, even the yellow foes were no match for us.

<p>I also had a conversation going with Aiin during this time, and soon he sold me his spare Lizardscale Mantle (ac5 3wis 3int)  for 40pp. I tried bartering it down a bit, but considering all the nice trades I've made with him, it would be rude buying it for less. My wisdom and intelligence were at 128 (115 base) and 84 (75 base) respectively.

<p>I've also talked to some of my higher level friends on trying to get me some Polished Bone Bracelets which I would buy at a fair price. No one seems interested in camping Evil Eyes in Beholder's for hours though (Newf just got some herself, it took 100 Evil Eyes to get 2 Polished... eeew..), so I guess I'll just have to go thomping there myself when I'm a little bit higher.

<p>Anyway, I had to leave soon, and with my 28 modem, Newf was kind enough to gate me to West Commonlands, and that saved me about 30 minutes of travelling. From there I did a quick run to Rivervale, sold off my loot and logged off.

<p>Even though I had died once, I still hade made quite some experience. I was now halfway through level 17, and I could feel those level 19 spells :).

<p>It was finally Monday, and that ment School time, with EQ on the agenda :).

<p>When I logged in I found Xaanin online, he was currently in Oasis and he had already made it to level 15! Phew... talk about powergaming :). I also saw Newf online, and she had gotten herself a Staff of the Observers! It seems that her guild had helped her out, and she was now one staff richer.

<p>I sat down and buffed myself up for Lavastorm, when all of the suddenly, the server stopped responding. Starting another computer next to me, I made sure that the school network wasn't down, and it wasn't. So, I logged back in and after a while (very laggy) I got through. There were only 350 people on Tarrew at this time, so I thought it had affected a lot of people, just not me.

<p>Wrong... once I'd made a "/who all friends" that packet loss meter was doing loops, and once again, I was greeted by that gawdawful thing called "Server not responding".

<p>I was kicked back to the character screen. Thinking it was just a small glitch in the connection or something I promptly pressed Enter Norrath again. It started to load, but instead of standing up in Rivervale I was greeted by yet another sign, reading "You have been disconnected".

<p>Argh... I exited EQ and restarted the computer, thinking it was just my computer that had these problems, as the computer next to me was spitting out homepages upon ordering it to do so :).

<p>It didn't get better once I had restarted my computer though. Now it took ages to get to the server board, and once there it took about 3 minutes to actually see the servers on the list! I tried getting through to Tarrew, but it was of no use, once again I was "disconnected".

<p>I did a tracert to www.everquest.com and it lost connection at the 6th hoop. Doing a tracert to one of the Swedish ISPs, just to make sure it wasn't just everquest, I was once again seeing stars at the 6th hoop (for all of you who are not familiar with tracert I apologize for not explaining it in detail, I'm not that great at it either :)).

<p>So... there's something wrong with the 6th router that my connection goes through.. grr. What baffled me though was that I could anything BUT playing EQ. ICQ was working fine, mIRC was doing okay and the web browsers were booming with activity.

<p>Talking to the people in the stratics IRC chat I noticed that others were having trouble as well, but that was with Cerfnet and it's servers, and not Tarrew. Was it so that my connection goes through the Cerfnet and then through Tarrew? Or was it just the fact that the network technicians at my school had overloaded their own system by connecting their coffee machine to the local router? :)

<p>It still remains a mystery, and I reluctantly left school and drove back home.

<p>I wasn't going to let that ruin my day though, so in the evening I decided I'd log in for 2 hours at home.

<p>The problem was obiviously gone (I guess it was the coffee machine then :)) and I could move freely in Rivervale.

<p>A lot of my friends were online. Xaanin had made another level during the day, and was now 16. Thalandin was still in Steamfont (he has been there for quite some while now) and he was level 12.

<p>Finally back in Lavastorm I quickly made my way to the Najena Entrance. From there I pulled anything coning white or blue (and no, not the basilisks :)), and I soon found out that soloing in Lavastorm, that was the thing to do.

<p>My meter was moving very fast, and I could actually see the results. I estimated that I made about one _whole_ bubble in about 30 minutes, now that's how it's supposed to be :P.

<p>I also sold of the words I've been carrying around (I found one on a griffawn, the other one on a lava crawler) to a Gnome. Words usually go for 2pp (that's what I've heard) but this little person was ready to pay 10pp for my Words of Dissolution, and 5pp for the Words of Reviviscence. I guess money is no object for a little tinkering gnome, thanks though :).

<p>During my stay here in Lavastorm has also made me to drop the roleplaying colors. I figured I'd just be snaring and burning, no room for roleplaying, right? Wrong... :).

<p>A helpfull dwarf, named Occam, offered me his clerical abilities if I would ever get in trouble (which I constantly got myself into, damn those green, xp non-giving, eles who gang up on you :)). I thought he seemed like a nice fellow, so I started to fiddle a little on Atherion's quirk, disliking dwarves (in a modest way).

<p>For what reasons you ask? None, at the time :). I've only been vaguely drawing this in my head. It's more of an experiment actually, first I would like to know whether it works "in action" or not.

<p>We started a little conversation, and I asked him some questions, including the "Why is it that you and your kind refuses to trade with us Wood Elves?". I didn't really know whether this was true or not, as I've never tried trading with a dwarf merchant myself, but I've heard from good friends that we can not, so.. hehe... I'm on thin ice here... but anyway.

<p>Occam took it cherfully and told me a very good reason. It seems that our wooden furniture just can't keep up the weight of these stout fellas :).

<p>So, what can I say? Disliking races, or practising any race hatred at all, is just plain hard in EQ. While Everquest is traditional in almost every other aspect, this is where it varies the most. 99% of the players do not exercise any race hatred at all Through my observations: it's impossible. Even though this is a _roleplaying_ game, we do not hold it back to group up with the "evil" races or vice versa, nor do we ever say "no thank you" to a Troll Shaman, offering to heal you when you're running away from a Hill Giant with 1% remaining of your life.

<p>Ok, that was extreme, but it's true. Before I started to play Everquest I was shocked by the fact that Soma, who was then playing a good race, didn't have anything against grouping up with the evil races. I frowned at him, and told him I'd never ever group up with evil races, playing my Atherion. 

<p>Let's check on some things I've done the last couple of months:

<p>My first "wrong doing" was to camoflauge a drow elf near the Runnyeye entrance while I was around level 7-9. Then I even grouped up with one at a later level, still in misty. I've also payed another drow for escorting me to Lavastorm. So, despite all the evil things Innoruk did (torturing the first elven king and queen for 300 years or something and then made them to drow elves), Atherion does not show any hate towards the drow elven race, is this right?

<p>Let's check up on the Trolls. Do I despice Gual for being one? Heck no, he's been my friend for years now, and has offered me both an FS scimitar and Bone Arms, did I refuse those offers? No. But then again, I don't roleplay with him (as we mostly only talk through tells), so maybe he was a bad example.

<p>How about the trolls and ogres I met in the Oasis then? Did I go around targeting them and pressing d (as for duel) and by that hoping that I would be able to attack them as I would do in any other pen and paper game? No. Did I swallow my pride while being hunted by a crocodile and asking for aid to the troll group that was just meters away? Yes!

<p>The bottom line is, it's impossible to roleplay race grudges in EQ, at least on the non pvp servers. I'd say that all of us (ok, there may be one or two individuals out there who go through EQ with flying colors when it comes to roleplaying, I haven't seen one though) put experience and safety before doing the actual roleplaying (in this case, telling the group of trolls that they should disappear from the once golden lands of the Wood Elves and move somewhere else (I heard the Fear Plane is open :))).

<p>The only persons in the lands of Norrath who actually practises the evil vs good thing somewhat good would be the NPCs. But then again, they are just stupid, telling you that their Orc Pawn Scalp they just got in would be perfect for YOU :).

<p>Phew... I guess this turned out to a little rant, heh. Note though that I do not hold any grudges against any race, nor will I ever develop one (I'm dropping the dwarf thing). It's too impossible, and it doesn't help that there's a mixed population of blue and purple people.

<p>Anyway, let's get back to the story. With Occam's heals here and there I didn't have much downtime, and soon, I found myself just being a bub away from level 18!

<p>But I had to log out at that time :(.

<p>The next day, being Tuesday, I once again drag my computer down to school, hoping that the problem would be resolved.

<p>It is, and I'm once again in the Lavastorm Mountains. Problem was though that as soon as I logged in I got a tell from Tyrell, telling me the servers would go down in about 40 minutes.

<p>Sigh...

<p>Obviously they just had to put a patch update at around 3pm my time (ok, so we Europeans are a minority, I know... :)).

<p>With the knowledge that there's no such thing as a timewarp like in UO, I decided to make the best of my 40 minutes. Xaanin was also in Lavastorm at this time, and we helped each other out taking down mobs.

<p>I also got a tell from Newf, telling me she had a present for me. I tried persuading her to tell me what it was, but she kept quiet and gated to Lavastorm. Once there she hailed me and gave me the present.

<p>A Dragoon Dirk!

<p>Woohoo, the Leatherfoot Raider's Cap is mine! No longer do I have to stay capless due to the non showing Savant's Cap :). I thanked Newf with all of my heart and then she gated back whence she came from.

<p>Too bad I didn't have enough time to do the treck to Rivervale.

<p>*Insert hours of waiting here*

<p>Ok, so this patching was supposed to take "about" two hours, did it? Well... yes, and some more :). Some of the servers were coming up after two and a half hour but the problem was that once the login server got up it became flooded with people, so no one could log in after that. Xaanin had the greatest luck of all, and was able to get through to Tarrew. I wasn't.

<p>Even though all the servers hadn't come up, people still waited around, while being logged onto the login/chat server. So now there were about up to a thousand people waiting around, and at the same time, blocking the way for those players who would just get on to the servers who were already up, including myself.

<p>After five hours I could still not get in, so I gave up and called it a night.

<p>Finally back the next day, being Wednesday, I made sure that there were no coffee machines or patches around. There were none, and I could solely concentrate on hitting level 18.

<p>Teron hade made yet another character now, Dresca the Halfling Druid :). I guess all his powergaming in the Oasis had brought Xaanin to an abrupt end, for now.

<p>Strolling around bringing in whatever that coned blue to me I was once intercepted by a multiple numbers of green fire eles. I probably would be able to take at least one or two down without much trouble, but since they were green I decided to save my mana and head for the zone.

<p>This is where Lavastorm proves to be dangerous. Even if you have both a zone entrance to Najena and Nektulos close enough, they aren't always safe. In Nektulos you could be zoning right into another train, consisting of killer guards. Or, as I did now, zoninh right into a train of several Ogre Guards and Necromancers in Najena :).

<p>I must say it was a little bit rediculous though that the necromancer was able to hit me for 41dmg, barehanded. Man, if player necromancers had the ability to punch for those amounts of damage, I'd be one :).

<p>The same thing goes with the various merchants spreaded across the lands of Norrath. Some of them can hit for unbelivable amounts of damage, it's just silly. Sure, we all know why they've been coded like they have, no one want's to barter with a dead merchant. It would be much better though if they had a guard nearby, who would whoop your ass, that would be more realistic.

<p>Speaking of guards. Have you ever found it strange that when you kill a guard (I haven't done it personally, but still) bedeckted in full plate and all you get to loot is a bronze Long Sword? Sure, we all know why that happens, we don't want everyone running around in plate like UO. Sollution? Make those guards 55ish in level or whatever, and let players be able to take their platearmor. I mean, the NPCs aren't "twinking" each other, are they? :)

<p>Out of bounds here, returning to the story :).

<p>Once I was done zoning back to Lavastorm (no eles around) I found my name blinking, blue - pink - blue - pink... First I thought the game told me to get rid of the roleplaying colors because I wasn't roleplaying at the time, but then I realized that I didn't have my roleplaying colors on, and then I realized that there is not a script in heaven that is that intelligent :).

<p>No, the first traces of the patch was seen, and this was Verant's new implentation, which I simply call "Annoying Targetting Tool". What it does is that the name of whatever you have targetted starts to blink in a very annoying way. It's like "Hey, you want to get epileptic? Look at me!!!" :).

<p>A thing such as this is useless IMO. You don't really look at the name of the thing you are targetting, especially not in a very dense fight with spell effects all over your screen. And the fact that this is a real pain when you're travelling around in chasecam with yourself as a target :). I really hope there's a switch for this, if not, implent one, please!

<p>Anyway, I soon hit level 18! It was pretty funny though. I'd just brought in something of my own and killed it, when I saw a fellow druid hitting the dust outside of Najena. I conned the critter which had killed him, a blue imp, and threw a whirling wind.

<p>You have slain a fire imp!
<br><font color=yellow>You gain experience!!
<br>You raise a level Welcome to level 18!</font>

<p>It didn't seem fair, and it wasn't. Once he returned I did thank him though and gave him some tactics to use. Surpriced was I, when I found out that he had not yet purchased the spell Expulse Summoned! He shortly left, to try getting his hands on it in the Magician's guild in Freeport.

<p>I went back to my killing spree, and lucky was I to find out that 75% of the rock dervishes still conned blue to me. It was a little worse with the fire eles though, and I think I found one or two during the remainder of my session.

<p>I was also sent a tell from Yilbiku, who informed me about the patch exploit that had taken place, with Verant's knowledge, here's the scoop:

<p>Yilbiku sent me the following:

<p><blockquote>This is how it happened. Pie tin sketches used to cost about 12 copper. People used these sketches and the other ingredients for pie tins to make, of course, pie tins. They then sold these tins back to the vendor for a substantial profit. Verant thought it was too easy, and decided to nerf it. 

<p>So what they did, is made the pie tin sketches cost a LOT more. something like 1 plat. Well, being the ever insightful fools they are, they posted this to the test server. The testers noticed, and bought thousands of sketches, and stored them in thier banks, and on mule characters. After the patch went to the public servers...they sold the sketches (which they bought for 12 copper) back to the vendor (no work done, just bought it, then sold it back next day) for just over 4 gold each. Many players made 1000's of plat overnight with this. 

<p>The real problem I have, is this was posted on several message boards. I know for certain the EQE enchanters message board had many posts about it. Yet, Verant did not forsee this, even though it was clearly spelled out to them by the testers. They went and did the patch anyway, and in trying to stop players from gaining too much wealth, too rapidly, they let them get it all overnight.
 
<p>Thats the story.
 
<p>Yil</blockquote>

<p>And I thought character transfers upset the server economy? :). Seriously, this is a major mistake done by Verant. With 7,000pp (which you could get with just one account on a server) you'd be able to buy whatever you wanted. Baah... that Gigantic Zweihander which was being sold for 900pp in Everfrost just don't seem to be that much anymore. Consequences on this, as I see it, could be a _major_ overpricing on items when it comes to trading with other players. Talk about inflation. Soon we will be seeing Shiny Brass Shields going for a minimum of 500plat, how fun will that be? :). Or the fact that people will no longer sell or buy items anymore. There are too many plats compared to that of the amount of items, so the only workable trade would be to, just, trade.

<p>I'd hate to see the latter taking place, because I'm so against trading items :). It might just be me, but if I could decide, I'd want a homepage listing all items in the game and a pricetag attached to each and every one of them. Sure, that would take away a lot of fun when it comes to bartering and such, but at least then, I would know for sure how much money I would need for that and that item. And there wouldn't be any ripoffs, mistakes, feuds or whatever. But that's just me, your ideas may vary.

<p>Anyway, things were getting boring in Lavastorm and I decided to make my way to Rivervale, to get my hands on the Leatherfoot Raider's Cap, and call this another completed quest.

<p>Once there I hailed Marshal Anrey again. Obviously, his memory was kind of short, as he didn't remember me, or for the fact that I had already petitioned once. So he gave me that "Stand at attetion, grandma... blah blah... visitor.. blah" message again.

<p>I guess you just had to give him the dirk and that was it. The Dirk was pretty powerful by itself though, and I contemplated on whether to give it up or not (stats: 6dmg 23delay (better than a combined scimitar!!) 2dex 3magic). I found no use in it though, and I really wanted to get rid of my capless Savant's Cap.

<p>Marshal Anrey says 'Congratulations my yound deputy. Welcome into the brotherhood of the Leatherfoot Raiders. You have earned your skullcap. Wear it with pride. You are now one of the elite. Remember our motto 'Those who risk, prevail'.

<p>The cap was really nice though, an ac of 4 and that 10charisma thing, nice! But the best part was that it indeed showed up on the model, yay! :)

<p>I left Anrey and decided to take a break with all the powergaming. Instead of gating back to Lavastorm I headed for the thicket. There I fooled around a bit, charming a creature here, fighting a scarab there and so on. The funniest thing was to charm a large bat and send it in to a full goblin camp though :). They didn't care much about the large bat, so instead they all came swarming towards me, all four of them. Six levels ago, this would have been lethal, but not anymore :). They just couldn't hit me, and once they did, I dodged :P. Unfortunately I didn't have my Cascade of Hail memorized, so I had to take them down with ignites and my crook. I did well though, and soon they were all scattered across the zone.

<p>One thing that was weird though was that I was given experience for slaying a Scarab, it even showed up on the meter! Another mob which still gave me, though very little, experince was Mooto. Damn it felt good nuking him with all I had, I even got a totem :).

<p>I also found someone who would buy my old patchwork armor, and I sold it off for 5gp to a halfling named Cernan. Another halfling, named Dagner (I think I grouped with him a long time ago), wanted to buy my bone arms. I wondered why, but soon I saw that he was already bedeckted in bone leggings!

<p>Asking him where he'd gotten them he said he'd bought them for 40pp from a high level druid who didn't need them anymore. Dooh... why couldn't I be that lucky? :). After I had sworn with my whole heart that I would not steal his leggings, he let me try them out. Just go and look at that screenshot, I'll kill to get my hands on a pair :).

<p>Also found myself an enchanter who could make wisdom earrings at the bank. He charged a little bit too much for them though, 7pp a piece (for just 2wis). Thinking that I ought to save my money for the new spell rank, I turned his offer down. I sat down at the table in the bank and logged out.

<p>Back in school on Thursday I gated back to Lavastorm, trying to finish off my last level to a new set of spells. There were only about 5 other people there, as always, and things looked good.

<p>However, it soon turned out to be about 8 players there, me included. That doesn't seem much, but they were all, like me, hunting outside of Najena. The combination with the crowds, the green ele trains, and the lack of blue eles brought me to leave Lavastorm when I had only gained 2 bubbles. I guess while Lavastorm is _the_ place for druids with expulse summoned, it's not a good place for people at level 18. It's still a good place, but there are zones that can outdo the experience rate I was getting at 18.

<p>Back in Rivervale I found Aiin online. With Dagner's bone leggings in mind, I asked Aiin if those were indeed bone leggings that he had used when I spotted him for the second time in East Karana. Turns out they were, but he had sold them to someone. Sob... no..:(

<p>He didn't remember to whom, but when I mentioned Dagner (I knew it before I asked him :)) he confirmed it. Doh! :)

<p>I bound myself in Rivervale and decided to make the treck over to the karanas. I figured that I'd might be able to take down some crag spiders, and I've heard they are great for experience.

<p>Once through beholders I met up with a dwarf, named Balkoff, who would join up with me to take on crags. He was level 20 at the time, but I reckoned I would still get a lot of experience. We positioned ourselves at the "Gorge Town" (those houses near the entrance to beholders) and Balkoff started to fetch.

<p>The first one was yellow, but it didn't turn out to be much of a hazzle. Starting with a DOT followed by damage shielding Balkoff (who btw made 46dmg with his 2h dwarven axe :)) turned out to be the tactic we used, and it went fine.

<p>It did get close though when we brought home a really high yellow crag, on the border to red. It was hitting Balkoff hard, and I was poisoned. We took it down though, but the poison was untouchable. I must have tried nine times curing it, with no luck. I was forced to sit down and let it run it's course.

<p>We also got some gorge hounds ganging up on us, but with the cheesy tactic of panicing them right after a DOT they ran away until they died :).

<p>If my memory is correct, I think we brought down 13 crags during that night, leaving me at one bub to 19! The loot was great too, including two whole backpacks with spider silk and two of those spider venom sacs.

<p>Phew... half of my writings are complete :). Afterwords:

<p>Lavastorm must have been the most fruitful zone for me yet, gaining, as aforementioned, 1 bub every 30 minutes! And with the mix of being a creepy, dangerous, zone with eerie music has made me have interest in the zone longer then I would in, let's say, West Commonlands. The lava pools aren't so deadly as you are told to beleive though. There's a glitch in the coding, which makes the lava lethal only to those who are swimming in it. In other words, it is quite safe to stand in it knee deep without taking any damage at all. I have not tried this myself though, I just heard this being confirmed by several players. So if you feel lucky... give it a go :).

<p>To the only thing I might have that's bad about Lavastorm, then it's the weak Fire Drakes. They've stayed green to me from lvl 16 and up. If they'd been in the same level range as the griffawns, I would have leveled much quicker, and it would seem more realistic (after all... they are drakes).

<p>Now for the patch. I didn't cover all the things I wanted to mention, so here it goes. 

<p>First off, the increase of mana needed for the succor spells, just to make it _fair_ for the wizards (no offense ment to any wizards, this is to Verant). I've never seen a game where they've lowered a class's abilities just to make another class justice. And for the record, druids are to be the _masters_ of travelling, not wizards, yet we druids do not get the plane travelling spells, and now we don't even excel in the succor/evade spells?

<p>You might say I'm just whining, but we'll see how the clerics will react when Verant decides to double the mana for all the healing spells for clerics just to make justice with the Paladins. That's how I see it. Now, if they really really needed to make the druid vs wizard thing better I'd say to up the wizards a bit, just leave us druids alone!

<p>One thing I really liked with the patch though was the Earth Time feature. God, I'll never need to go look at the video again for the time (so, I don't have a watch, it broke years ago :)). It also helps a lot to see exactly how many bubbles I gain, and how long it took to treck through that zone and so on, very nice! All I'm looking for now is a timer that you can use so you know when to drop another DOT on the things you are kiting :P.

<p>Then we had that targetting feature, give us a switch for it. Period.

<p>As for the tin pie exploit... I'll cover that later.

<p>That's the end of part I.
