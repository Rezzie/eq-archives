Drysart sat on the edge of his bed. He watched the morning sun, shining in
through the window, lighting the air in a beam to the floor. He thought
about the parchment, now folded in his accessory bag, and wondered what
it might contain.  The thought was just one of many in his mind that
morning.
<br><br>
He looked at the bed. Its sheets were disorganized. His mind settled on
that for a few moments. He could still smell sweet purfume in the air. He
began to feel disgust creeping in...
<br><br>
He looked at his hands. They were still stained with blood. Or maybe they
weren't, but nonetheless, he could still see the blood, no amount of
washing would remove it from his mind.
<br><br>
He looked out the window again, wondering if today he would be invited
as a pledge into the guild he had moved to the Vale to join. Homesickness
bit him momentarily, before he swept it away.
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
THE PAGE
<br><br>
Drysart looked out into the fog covering the Kithicor forest. The trees
reminded him of the Faydark he left not long before. The sound was
different. Quiet.  He could not hear the wood elves that always filled
the Faydark. He could not hear the occasional dwarf running by. The
silence was eerie.
<br><br>
Unsettled by the silence, the wizard quickly recognized a sound, of
dead leaves crackling underfoot, in the distance.  He gave it little
thought until he realized the steps were drawing closer.
<br><br>
Another thought and he realized the steps were of someone running. Or...
were there two sets of footsteps?..... both running?
<br><br>
Through the fog he saw two figures; a small petite figure, being chased
by a larger, bulkier one.  They were not headed directly towards him,
but their path drew them nearer. As they became closer, he could make
out more detail in the figures, though still obscured by the fog. The
small figure had long hair, and appeared female. The large figure
had a shape suspiciously troll-like.
<br><br>
Trolls..... a shiver went down Drysart's spine. He liked trolls just
about as far as he could throw one.
<br><br>
Still, he could not sit by and watch as the smaller figure, he guessed
probably a fellow elf, was being threatened by the troll. He waved
his hand, triggering a bolt of flame to shoot from him at the troll.
<br><br>
The smaller figure disappeared into the fog, as the troll stopped. It
turned toward the wizard and drew closer. Drysart stood his ground in
an attempt to intimidate the troll. He knew that he didn't stand a
chance against it, and he had wandered far enough into the forest and
was unsure of the way out...
<br><br>
The troll appeared to sizing up Drysart as well, determining exactly
how powerful the wizard was, and whether his next meal was worth the
risk of taking on a powerful mage.
<br><br>
An arrow zipped through the air, past Drysart and into the troll's
chest, making it's consideration moot. The expertly fired arrow fell
the troll instantly.  Drysart turned to see from where the arrow
came, and saw the smaller, female figure emerge from the fog. She
was definately an elf.
<br><br>
The hair on the back of his neck stood on end as her blue skin
became visible as she approached, leaving the cloud of fog behind
her. &quot;Many thanks for thy help, m'lord,&quot; she stopped right in
front of Drysart, &quot;my name's Vinalrii.&quot;  She extended her hand
in a gesture of friendship.
<br><br>
A moment passed and she recognized the look that surely had
come across Drysart's face.  &quot;Please, lord, do not judge me as
a Drow. I have been exiled by my kind for failure to feel and
spread the hatred of Innoruuk.&quot;  She looked down.  &quot;I have come
here to deliver information.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;What information?&quot; Drysart asked, still keeping a suspicious
eye on Vinalrii.
<br><br>
She pulled a page of parchment from her pack.  &quot;I was trusted with
information about the past of Entonius Demonslayer. I believe his
son may be in this area, and it may be of interest to him.&quot;
<br><br>
Drysart's eyes widened a little at the mention of his father's
name.  He glanced at the page Vinalrii held in her hands. He
could not make out the words.  &quot;Entonius is my father.... what
do ye know of him?&quot;
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
THE BLOOD
<br><br>
&quot;Death to the dark one!&quot; was the cry as the wood elf charged
from the fog at Vinalrii, tackling her to the ground.  He
drew his dagger and struggled with her.
<br><br>
Drysart picked up the page that was dropped as Vinalrii was
shoved to the ground. He did not recognize the language.
<br><br>
He looked at the struggle on the ground beside him. The wood elf
had his dagger in hand and was attempting to bring it down upon
the dark elf.  She held the dagger away as best she could, but
it was apparent her strength was not equal to the wood elf's.
<br><br>
&quot;Stop,&quot; Drysart yelled as he tried in vain to pull the wood elf
off Vinalrii.
<br><br>
&quot;Leave us be, fool!&quot; the wood elf growled. &quot;Her kind do not
belong in these parts. She shall pay for the deeds of all the
followers of Innoruuk!&quot;  He pushed Drysart aside to the
ground.
<br><br>
Quickly standing, Drysart saw the wood elf bring his dagger
down. He heard the dark elf scream. 
<br><br>
Next thing he could remember, Drysart stood over the wood elf's
fresh corpse, a bloody dagger in his blood soaked hands. The
wood elf was stabbed several times.  Vinalrii was injured, but
not gravely. Her left arm had been cut and was bleeding.
<br><br>
Slowly coming back to his senses, Drysart realized what he
had done. The dagger fell from his hands to the ground beside
the body.
<br><br>
Vinalrii stood and led the stunned wizard away from the scene.
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
THE BED
<br><br>
Drysart applied another bandage to Vinalrii's arm as he continued
his questioning. &quot;Why would ye risk your life, just to bring this
to me?&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;Drysart, &quot; she looked around to at the inn room the wizard had
brought her to.  She briefly considered how luxurious it was
compared to accomodations in Neriak.  &quot;My kind has committed
many unforgivable acts on yours. I can not sleep at night with
that on my shoulders.&quot;
<br><br>
Drysart looked up from the bandage into her eyes, judging the
sincerity of her words.
<br><br>
&quot;I will do everything I can to help ease the pain we've caused,&quot;
she continued, &quot;I can only hope that something I can do proves
useful.&quot;
<br><br>
Drysart saw nothing in her demeanor that showed her words were
untrue. She seemed slightly nervous, understandable considering
that the wizard had snuck her into his room at the Inn in the
middle of Rivervale. &quot;What have ye brought?&quot; he asked.
<br><br>
&quot;I am not sure what it is. The language is like none I've
ever seen.  I am sure that thou shalt be able to find one who
can read it.&quot;
<br><br>
Drysart finished securing the last bandage on her arm and
walked to the window and peeked out it.  It was getting dark, he
would not risk trying to sneak her out until later. Even though
she was a dark elf, he was warmed by what she had done and he
insisted on getting her away safely.
<br><br>
&quot;Come sit down,&quot; Vinalrii patted the bed beside where she sat,
&quot;let us talk. I have much I am curious about your way of life.&quot;
<br><br>
Drysart sat beside her on the bed and looked at her.  His
life long hatred for her kind had slipped away, unnoticed...
