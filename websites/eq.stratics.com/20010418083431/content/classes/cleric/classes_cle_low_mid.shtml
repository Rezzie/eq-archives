                      Norrath. Listen well and heed my words faithful one, for
                      the journey is long and hard - but infinitely rewarding!
                      Clerics are one of the most exciting and playable classes 
                      in the land of Norrath, possessing healing and offensive
                      spells that make them a cornerstone of any well-balanced
                      group, as well as being able to wield blunt weapons and wear
                      almost any armor they please. These unique abilities allow
                      the Cleric to hit hard, take a beating, and live
                      on to fight another day. In addition, Clerics are granted 
                      abilities that allow them to take on undead foes at levels
                      that would have a fighter of the same level fleeing for his or her
                      life! Whether your style is group or solo play, the Cleric
                      is equipped to deal with the perils of Norrath like no other
                      class. </font> </p>

                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be honest, a Cleric is not as effective
                      at solo play as the heavier hitting pure fighter classes.
                      This is because round for round, a Cleric is going to have
                      a harder time dealing consistent damage to kill high level
                      monsters, as well as having fewer hit points to survive 
                      the vicious counter-attacks. Clerics can dish out a beating
                      with their spells, but their most powerful damage spells
                      take a while to cast which leaves them vulnerable to a well
                      placed hit from their foe while a large amount of mana is drained.
                      Take it from me, the one time you're guaranteed to need a
                      quick heal is right after draining all of your mana to blast your
                      opponent down within an inch of his life! Additionally, while
                      there are plenty of blunt weapons that do a fair amount of
                      damage, only the most powerfully enchanted mace is going
                      to keep up with a two-handed claymore in the hands of an
                      experienced barbarian warrior. The one caveat to this is
                      the fact that Clerics are able to wear all kinds of armor, 
                      including full plate. Find yourself a powerful set of armor
                      and wade into the fray well protected from harm. This is
                      an advantage none of the other spell casters can claim!
                    </font></p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                    <p>As with many other classes, Clerics come
                      into their own in a group. With just one fighter to distract
                      the monsters and keep your hands free for healing and support,
                      you'll find that your tank can live well 'nigh forever battling
                      against monsters far above your own levels.  Plus, your offensive
                      spells are potent enough to deal the decisive kill at the 
                      end of the battle. </p>
                    <p>One drawback to the Cleric is they have
                      to deal with the worst of any money situation be it from a fighter's
                      or spell caster's stand point. On the one hand, you need to save all the
                      gold and platinum you can to afford the spells you want in
                      the next rank. On the other, if you don't get some protection covering
                      those scrawny bones, your gonna be soup. So it's especially important
                      to keep a tight fist on your money supply, and never waste 
                      a single copper chip. Come level fourteen you're going to
                      want to spend 50 platinum to get all those great spells
                      and if you're not careful, you'll be as broke as a milk maid!

                      combination, if played smartly and creatively, can be successful.
                      Blame this on Verant, not the players as they have designed
                      a system that enhances character creation and allows you
                      to play what you want, instead of forcing you to pick the

                      Wisdom is the driving skill for Clerics,
                      as it determines the amount of mana you get. Strength is

                      crusading against evil with plate mail, tower shield, and
                      war hammer. You can't wear the armor if you can't carry 
                      it!  Otherwise, adjust your attributes as you see fit and

                    you've played one character under level four, you've pretty 
                    much played them all. Life for a newbie in Norrath is
                    usually the same no matter what class or race you've chosen.
                    For a while your existence will consist of killing everything
                    you can find in the newbie gardens (usually snakes, bats, rats,
                    and other unimpressive fare) and selling whatever loot you
                    can. You will start out with Strike and Light Healing spells
                    - scribe and memorize them immediately, and begin practicing 
                    your magical abilities. Use Strike to finish your opponents
                    off, which will give you the practice you need for timing your
                    spells between your opponent's attacks. Cast light healing
                    as necessary - you will find that with your healing abilities
                    you will last longer on the battlefield than your non-Cleric
                    friends! The five practice points you acquire for completing
                    your guild quest will be best spent in one-handed blunt, as that's
                    what you'll be using to do the majority of your damage for 
                    quite a while.
                    <p>When
                      you can afford it purchase Courage. When cast, this will 
                      boost your AC and HP which at low levels is a tremendous boon.
                      Unless you absolutely MUST have one of the other Rank 1 spells,
                      save your money until you get to level five as it has some
                      more powerful spells.
                    <p>Clerics
                      gain new spell rankings slower than Magicians and Wizards. 
                      This is to balance the Clerics' ability to use blunt weapons
                      and armor.  Therefore levels one to four are more of the same
                      stuff. For maximum experience you'll want to stay away from
                      parties until at least level three and depending on your
                      personal inclination even until level five.  At level five
                      you'll want to purchase Light Healing, Holy Armor, Gate, and
                      Ward Undead. Your prowess on the battlefield will have improved quite
                      a bit and these additional spells will help. But just because 
                      you have Light Healing, don't put that Minor Healing away!
                      Light Healing takes significantly longer to cast as well
                      as using quite a bit more mana than Minor Healing, so
                      you'll want to keep both of them memorized and available.
                    <p>Now
                      that you have Ward Undead, try teaming up with a fighter 
                      and go undead hunting. Let the fighter take the damage while
                      you crush the undead fiend with Ward. When you're comfortable,
                      try fighting the weaker undead creatures alone. Look for
                      parties to join and practice your group skills. Buy Lull
                      and start taking on goblin, orc, or gnoll camps one monster
                      at a time.

                    version of Lull). Root is handy to stop a fleeing foe from rounding
                    up his friends while you attack his back as well as keeping
                    a mummy in place while you pound it from a safe distance with
                    Ward Undead. Soothe works the same as Lull, just better, and
                    is well worth the upgrade.  Finally, Center is Courage part II -
                    a much improved version that no fighter in your party should be
                    without.  From nine to fourteen you'll be much more powerful and well equipped to explore more challenging (and rewarding!)
                    places. You and your party can try out Crushbone proper rather
                    than skulking about the camps at the entrance, and Black Burrow
                    trains won't mean an instant death anymore.  Soon you'll be
                    to level fourteen, which is the shining level for a Cleric.
                    You can now cast Healing and watch that HP bar climb climb climb,
                    while Smite is a sorely needed replacement for the now useless (except
                    for luring!) Strike. You'll also have access to Expulse Undead 
                    - and if you thought Ward Undead was incredible, you haven't
                    seen anything yet! Paired up with Expulse is Invisibility to
                    Undead - the perfect complement to an adventure in the undead
                    dungeons. Enjoy your new powers and abilities - you are well
                    on your way to becoming a master Cleric!

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Cleric can be one of the most rewarding
                    classes to play in a group.  When adventuring with your comrades
                    you are in charge of that most precious commodity - life. It
                    is your sworn duty to keep your compatriots alive at any cost
                    - lonely is the Cleric who can't master the ability of keeping
                    a close eye on the health of his fellows while following
                    the battle at hand. A well-played Cleric makes friends anywhere
                    she or he pleases, has no trouble finding a group, and is never without
                    a helping hand. The unsuccessful Cleric - well, he or she might as
                    well hang up their hat and swear off the holy path.
                    <p>One of the key skills you'll need to master
                      as a Cleric is the best use of your abilities to help the
                      group. For the Cleric there are three key roles for you to
                      play:
                    </font><blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Healing and Combat Support:</u> </font><br>
                      <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is what being a Cleric is all about, and is the reason 
                      many choose not to follow the healer's path. If you don't
                      see the excitement, value, and fun in being the person your
                      comrades depend on to keep them fighting a Cleric's life
                      is not for you. In addition to obviously healing, Cleric's
                      have several powerful "buff" spells that increase hit points
                      and armor class, provide resistance to certain types of 
                      attacks, and can cure ailments such as disease and blindness.
                      Combat support also includes using spells such as Lull or
                      Soothe to pinpoint the exact foes you will fight or allow
                      safe passage through a treacherous zone! Root will stop a
                      fleeing monster dead in its tracks and use Invigor to restore waning
                      stamina when the battle drags on too long. It's also
                      important to keep on eye on your surroundings and watch
                      for potential trouble during battle. Your name will go down
                      in your partners little black books if you are the one to
                      spot the King of the Minotaurs sneaking up on your fighters
                      during battle!
                      </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Spell Damage:</u></font><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes
                        the combat is going particularly well, or your fighters 
                        are dodging and ducking blows like ballet dancers (maybe
                        because of all those buff spells you've cast on them!).
                        This is the time to survey the situation and see what you
                        can do to help cause some damage. If you're fighting multiple
                        enemies, a well placed Word of Pain might be the ticket
                        to evening the odds, or perhaps you'd like to flex a little muscle
                        and take down that Mummy in a minute with Ward Undead. 
                        Remember, though, it's always wise to practice restraint
                        with combat spells before you know what it
                        feels like to have used all your mana to crush your foe and
                        not have anything left to heal your bruised weakened
                        fighters when a wandering monster attacks.
                      </font><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Melee Damage:</u></font><br> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At
                        low levels, the damage you can inflict on monsters with 
                        regular hand-to-hand combat is on par with the other fighter
                        levels, and therefore will make a difference in the battle.
                        As you progress up the experience ladder and begin facing
                        tougher more advanced battles this isn't the case.
                        So only step into the fray when there's absolutely nothing
                        better for you to do. There's nothing wrong with sitting 
                        down and meditating in the middle of battle - your friends
                        will appreciate your forethought in recovering a few bars
                        rather than lightly tapping a Crusader with your mace when
                        his friends show up and start swinging!

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally here's a list of some helpful pointers,
                    ideas, and concepts that will help you make your way in Norrath,
                    and become a Cleric that Bards will sing tales of long after
                    your passing!
                    <p>If you find yourself alone in Norrath, the
                      best things to fight are Undead. As a Cleric you have a natural
                      ability to best these fiends from the netherworld and there
                      are several Cleric-only spells in your arsenal such as Ward,
                      Expulse, Spook, and Sense Undead that you'll be able to
                      use with great effect. Soloing undead is also a good way
                      to earn money and XP - you'll be able to go face-to-face
                      with undead at levels a pure fighter type would shy away
                      from.
                    <p>Save your money! Your third rank spells
                      will cost on average five platinum each - a small fortune
                      in Norrath's depressed economy. Until you get to around twentieth
                      level, being able to afford both the spells and the weapons
                      and armor you want will be one of your greatest challenges.
                      After twenty, you can look forward to a little leeway, as you'll
                      be able to fight monsters that give much more money
                      and valuable loot while the price of your spells will not
                      keep up in relation to your money making ability.
                    <p>As a Cleric you've got the easiest way to
                      gain friends and allies in Norrath - use it! When you see
                      a hapless soul stumbling away from a monster, help that person
                      out. Heal him up and watch the tide of battle turn or offer
                      your assistance to fellow travelers when the world is swarming
                      with plague rats or other disease carrying vermin. When 
                      all is said and done you'll have made a valuable friend and
                      ally; in Norrath, you can never have too many friends.
                    <p>In battle, your eyes should be checking
                      your comrades HP more than your own. If everything is going
                      right, your fighters should be taking the damage while you're
                      on the sidelines playing support. In a long battle, remember
                      to Meditate between casting heals - at Level 11 you'll recover enough
                      mana to cast a Light Heal every 2-3 rounds and that makes
                      a huge difference.
                    <p>Just like any other spell caster, you'll
                      have a hard time working your craft if an Orc is belting
                      you. Also, some monsters take offense at your healing and
                      turn quickly to attack you. Make sure your party members realize
                      they need to keep you out of direct fire if they want to 
                      benefit from your healing - if they know it's a matter of
                      their life and death, they'll be sure to Taunt more effectively!
                    <p>In a party, keep your fighters in tip-top
                      shape between battles as well as during. When the fighting
                      is over, make sure all your fighters are at full or near
                      full health before recovering your own mana. Also be ready to
                      apply Center, Holy Armor, Courage, or whatever other buff 
                      spells you have available as soon as your team mate signals
                      readiness. It only takes one unexpected run in with a fierce
                      monster to learn this lesson of readiness well.
                    <p>Lull (or Soothe) and Strike is your friend!
                      At a monster camp, control the pace and frenzy of the battle
                      by selectively Soothing or Lulling certain linked monsters,
                      then Striking from a distance the remaining monster(s) you
                      want to tackle. Repeat as necessary until the camp is empty.
                      This evens the odds and allows even a party of just two 
                      (you and your fighter!) to handle dangerous areas.  Divine
                      Aura grants you 30 seconds of invulnerability when cast. 
                      You can move while invulnerable, but you cannot cast spells
                      or attack. Thirty seconds is a LONG time when you're being chased
                      down by a ravaging horde of ghouls or when you're providing
                      a getaway for your compatriots. Learn it and use it!
                    <p>Practice all of your spells you will be
                      using in combat, and have a good understanding of their casting
                      times, duration, and effect. When you're trying to get that
                      decisive Expluse Undead in on the bashing, crushing, and
                      slashing Greater Skeleton timing is everything!  Be sure to
                      practice both one-handed and two-handed blunt skills regularly
                      as you progress through the levels. Because you must hit creatures
                      that give you experience to raise a melee skill, it gets 
                      very difficult to raise skills once you've neglected them
                      for a few levels (try hitting that Level 20 Gnoll with a
                      two-handed blunt skill of 3!)  When you do find that Magical
                      Dwarven two-handed Warhammer you'll want to be able to use
                      it.</font>
