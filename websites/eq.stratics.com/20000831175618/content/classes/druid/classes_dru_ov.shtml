                    red, and brown leaves crack under his haired feet as he explores 
                    the Kithicor forest. As herounds a rather large oak he sees 
                    a leather clad halfling floating a few spans off the ground. 
                    The elder is deep in meditation. As he quietly and secretly 
                    (he thinks) observes the odd figure, a young kodiak brushes 
                    up against his leg sending the youth tumbling towards the

                    much experience with the masters of nature. Could ye enlighten

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                    druid is a very unique class that manipulates nature to do 
                    their bidding. If you had to fit them into the magician or 
                    cleric class, they would be more cleric like than mage. Most 
                    of their powers by sheer numbers are defensive (protective). 
                    They can heal almost as well as a cleric at lower levels, 
                    and can enhance strength, speed, and resistance to physical 
                    attacks. They do have a fair amount of offensive &#8216;spells&#8217;, 
                    but nothing close to a wizard of the same level. At level 
                    44 almost all other caster classes can out blast a druid. 
                    Just as the cleric is the sworn enemy of the undead, so is 
                    the druid enemy of unnatural(summoned type creatures, i.e. 
                    elementals, fire snakes, beings from other planes of existence). 
                    The druid can assume the shape of other beings at higher levels 
                    and manipulate the weather to inflict harm. They can also 
                    convince animals to aid them for brief periods of time. Recognizing 
                    the helpful nature of druids, animals will not usually attack 
                    them unless provoked first by direct attack, or by the druid&#8217;s 
                    poor reputation. They thrive in the open and actually lose 
                    many powers if indoors. They also do not have very good physical 
                    attacks. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Druids 
                    have earned a rather god like reputation that is quite undeserved. 
                    A druid&#8217;s weapon skills are very limited and comparable 
                    to that of a mage. The cleric and shaman classes heal better 
                    and fight with weapons much better in general because they 
                    normally have better weapon choices and higher strengths. 
                    They also can wear better armor. Druids are limited to magical 
                    or natural armor only at the higher levels and can not wear 
                    plate. The druid loses many of its spells indoors. They become 
                    uncastable. A druid&#8217;s offensive powers pale in comparison 
                    to that of a wizard or magician. While they do get similar 
                    type spells of the wizard and cleric, they tend to get them 
                    at later levels and even then they get watered down versions. 
                    Like all casters, a druid is only as good as his or her ability 
                    to cast. They get interrupted easily as any caster does. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                    are several advantages to the druid class. They do tend to 
                    have a very diverse range of spell types. This means that 
                    they can be effective against almost any opponent type. However, 
                    they are not effective against any type at all levels. For 
                    example, they do not have a decent cold or lightning based 
                    spell for several levels in the middle range. They also do 
                    not have to worry about being harried by unfriendly animals. 
                    At high levels they can travel to many lands by spells, though 
                    they are limited to only normal lands. They cannot teleport 
                    themselves or groups to planes, but they can group gate to 
                    areas near the major dungeons and lands. Since they have decent 
                    defensive and offensive powers, they can fit into most any 
                    group. Though they are more of a supplemental class that is 
                    passed over often when a 'true' healer or blaster is not already 
                    in the group. They also are very soloable. They also have 
                    a few unique spells not found in the other classes, that may 
                    not do much damage, but do make life easier. Wolf form, tree 
                    form, harmony, regeneration, summon food/water are all very 
                    handy. Druids also can track quite well, though not as well 
                    as a bard or ranger. Their ability to teleport themselves 
                    and others and track as well as deal out a substantial amount 
                    of damage quickly has made them masters of questing. No other 
                    class can get to areas and find what they need like a druid 
                    can. This is a great benefit to a group as well as solo play.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                    is very important to understand that as a druid you will go 
                    through many stages as you progress. You start out as a decent 
                    healer/melee/occasional blaster type. Then you move more to 
                    a blasting type, and then to a healing type. Level 39 to 49 
                    is a long road. During this period your DOT (damage over time) 
                    and snare are your best combination. Druids can grow very 
                    fast when played well. No other class can be grown so fast 
                    and collect so much loot and do so many quests all alone. 
                    As a second character class, druids are one of the most popular. 
                    You will be pestered often to SOW (spirit of wolf), bind (change 
                    homeland), and teleport others. Druids also come under fire 
                    for 'farming' items. Since you can out blast the other tracker 
                    classes, some druids are notorious kill stealers and camp 
                    jumpers. You have to accept that you will have some insults 
                    your way for your class. I personally think that the reputation 
                    is not valid. Druids are very comparable to all the other 
                    classes in strength, they are also equally limited. You will 
                    also have to adjust your play style as you grow and adjust 
                    to the different abilities you gain at different levels.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Starting 
                    a druid isn&#8217;t very different from most classes. Many 
                    players starting out make the mistake of thinking that they 
                    must look to the npc vendors for their primary income source. 
                    This is wrong. Norrath is full of adventurers of all levels 
                    and needs. Almost every creature has desirable loot to some 
                    other player. It may be weapons, skins, food, trophies, or 
                    jewelry. Check out the local market and try to sell to players 
                    whenever possible. You should try to deal with those of like 
                    class and race when you can, as they cannot only supply you 
                    with material goods, but also knowledge. A good example, kill 
                    bats and sell the wings to druids who need them to cast levitate. 
                    Skeletons have bone chips that necromancers can use. Trading 
                    5 silver worth of bat wings for a leather cape that would 
                    cost you 2 plat is always a good deal. Druids do start out 
                    weak, so grouping at very low levels can be helpful. This 
                    is not to say you can not solo to start. Many druids immediately 
                    start out snaring and 'kiting' foes at once. This is done 
                    by snaring a target then running just of range blasting and 
                    repeating. A druid can do this at lower levels as well as 
                    top levels, but it is a boring life and not always the most 
                    productive. Also, hail every npc you come across (especially 
                    in and around your class guild). They will often provide you 
                    with duties or quests that will help you progress very fast. 
                    Tailor your spells to your party needs. If you already have 
                    a cleric or 2 in the mix let them heal, if the group needs 
                    an offensive caster do that. Don&#8217;t even think about 
                    being a tank though, until you have the regen, and better 
                    thorn shields. At the mid 40s a druid can go toe to toe with 
                    a sand giant and come out on top. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    druid class is only available to a few races. Humans, halflings, 
                    woodelfs, and half elfs can all be druids. This limits druids 
                    to being a good type of race. This does not mean you can&#8217;t 
                    change this fairly quickly. In Norrath you are known by your 
                    reputation as well as your race, and the reputation is more 
                    important. Druids depend on wisdom for power, and the halfling 
                    starts out with a bit more than the others. Races are however 
                    more balanced in EverQuest than ANY other game I have ever 
                    seen, so pick the one you will be happy with. There is very 
                    little advantage to be had by any one particular race. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                    general here is a good guide for leveling and equipping your 
                    druid. I would pick the one hand blunt or one hand-slashing 
                    weapon. Blunt is best and will offer you more options later. 
                    Also, go with speed over damage to keep your skill level high. 
                    At higher levels a smart druid never needs a weapon. A 49 
                    druid with treeform, chlorplast, and buffed up with all the 
                    various shields can almost kill a giant without moving or 
                    healing. Put all your points into wisdom, then dexterity if 
                    you have any left over. Wisdom is the fuel to a druid's magical 
                    fire.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Level 
                    1 to 4: Spend this time killing bats, bugs, and little goblins 
                    and orcs. Misty Thicket is a great place to start out. All 
                    the races have excellent druid starting grounds. I would caution 
                    you not to kill animals of any kind if you can help it. This 
                    becomes more important as you grow and not having a bad reputation 
                    with the local kodiaks can limit your fur trade, it can also 
                    save your life. First get full mana, and put on skin like 
                    nature. Find a good blue or even target then snare, flame 
                    lick, run a little and burst of flame your target and repeat. 
                    When you are out of mana, your target should be nearly out 
                    of life. Save a little mana for healing, but at this level 
                    you will probably recover enough to heal yourself once while 
                    you were kiting. Your most important spells here are: heal, 
                    snare, burst of flame, skin like wood, and flame lick (which 
                    lowers acand does damge) in that order. You will use snare 
                    all the way to 60.</font></p>

                    gate, harmony, burst of fire, camouflage as soon as you can. 
                    You are now ready to start taking on the larger orcs, goblins, 
                    etc in groups. It is a good idea to group up here. You can 
                    harmony a group of enemies allowing you to pull one at a time 
                    and slowly pick off a whole group. Camouflage will allow you 
                    to go unseen in many areas and your gate will get you home 
                    quickly when you get lost or need to sell. Work on the local 
                    enemies, orcs, goblins, and bigger bugs. Don't forget to learn 
                    how to meditate. This is a skill you will really use a lot.

                    9 to 13: More of the same. You do need to update your spells

                    damage shield, and treeform. Once again you will want to get 
                    them all, but these will be the most important. Tree form 
                    is great for resting after fights, and you will have to start 
                    resting more now. Your new healing spell puts you back into 
                    close level with the cleric on heals and the mage or wizard 
                    on blasting. Though a little behind, you are not far off. 
                    If you failed to get that ward summon spell, go get it now 
                    and head to lavastorm home of the un-natural. This is the 
                    first of your directed direct damage against a specific type 
                    of creature. Lavastorm mountains is full of them. Elementals,

                    and will dramatically cut down your deaths), stinging swarm

                    no match for you so move into Najena for a change. You will 
                    want to start snaring, DOTing, and kiting some of the nasties 
                    more now too. You can still fit into any group and at this

                    at the local guild. Healing, careless lightning (in and outdoor 
                    DD), and superior camouflage (yay it works inside and outside) 
                    are of primary importance. Once again you are really close 
                    to the healing power of a cleric, and the blasting power of 
                    a caster. You can now start trying your hand at evil eyes, 
                    and you may want to venture into some of the easier dungeons. 
                    You are a huge asset to any group. The Karanas become the 
                    home of many druids at this range. Aviaks provide great money 
                    and experience. You can do about anything at this level. Go 
                    explore your world. You are the master of travel and all outdoors.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Level 
                    24 to 28: More of the same. You can do dungeons, outdoors 
                    and anything you want. Great new spells include being able 
                    to become that wolf and a new updated DOT, more teleports, 
                    root and other nifty items. You can move into the harder dungeons 
                    and hold your own. Start really updating that equipment. You 
                    also get a charm animal here that is very effective in making 
                    those grifs kill each other for your benefit. Enjoy the show, 
                    but beware the pet that turns on its master and be ready to 
                    run. Head to your local guild and West Commons to find your 
                    spells.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Level 
                    29 to 33: New spells include teleports, greater healing, combust 
                    and a new shield spell. Combust will be a very used spell 
                    for a long time and you can finally specialize. Evocation 
                    is the way to go. Toxullia and Steamfront have many of your 
                    latest spells. Don't bother to try ensnare. It takes longer 
                    to cast, breaks faster and is generally useless. Guards are 
                    great for moving through this level fast and the deeper dungeons 
                    have fine loot. You are not very good in some of the fire 
                    dungeons, but with greater healing and the dots, you can make 
                    a fine addition to anywhere. Be aware that to cast immolate 
                    you need one fire beetle eye in your inventory. It won't get 
                    used up. Immolate is not very effective, but on fast fights 
                    in a group lowering the target's ac and doing the damage over 
                    time is pretty nifty.</font></p>

                    34 to 38: Back to Toxullia and Steamfront for the latest spells. 
                    Your new DOT is awesome. More teleports, and regeneration 
                    keeps down time low. New DD to summoned types is useful in 
                    some very rare cases. You are now beginning to feel a little 
                    behind some of the other classes in group situations. Soloing 
                    may be the way to go for a while. Pairing up is also great 
                    to do Hill Giants and larger outdoor prey. Your snare, dot, 
                    run blast strategy is still making a fast plat and lots of 
                    experience. Guards are also still good.</font></p>

                    are once again the groups friend and outside group wolf form 
                    is any tanks dream. You can skin like diamond and have a great 
                    new damage shield spell. Solo is still great and you can kite 
                    some pretty big fellows, but you are still wonderful outside 
                    and decent inside. Hell 40 is tough and you will want to move 
                    through it fast. OOT and Rathe Mountains are great spots to 
                    kill the big boys. Finally that new fire based DD you been 
                    waiting for. You are blasting well again.</font></p>

                    new buffs. Nothing major here, but you are damn close to the 
                    best level of your life. Keep killing those giants and grouping

                    new direct damage spells. You can cast lightning area spells 
                    outside that rival any class. You can now use a fire or cold 
                    DD spell so you are excellent in any location. Your buffs 
                    take a back seat to no one and you are truely one of the best

                    buffing, DOTing, tracking, damage shielding, and teleporting. 
                    Hmmm no wonder the other classes are so jealous... Oh well 
                    you deserve a pat on the back and you are truly one of the

                    can even complete a few quests to get some nice items. Anything 
                    that adds wisdom is great. Try going to Surefall Glade and 
                    getting the Jagged Pine crook. It doesn't add wisdom but it 
                    is farily easy to get and magic. Outside of Surefall in Qeynos 
                    Hills are several quest items that are decent for low levels.

                    Evil eye bracelets, gatorskin legs, lockjaw hide tunic are 
                    not too hard to get. You can also look for a Foreman's tunic 
                    from Sol a. You will want to focus on getting your wisdom 
                    up even at the cost of AC in this area. Look for plus wisdom 
                    holdables too. Blackened iron necklace is a great neck item 
                    from Runny Eye. Screaming mace, and several plus wis weapons 
                    are within your reach. Look for the Runed Circlet and Mammoth 
                    Hide cloak in Permafrost. The brownies in Fay have a nice 
                    pair of shoulders for you, though the current owner will need 
                    to die to get them from him. The lizard scale mantle is also 
                    still a fine set of shoulders. You can look for those split 
                    paw hide gloves for some extra wisdom and decent AC. If you 
                    haven't already, find a good jeweler and buy all the plus 
                    wisdom jewelry that you can. It is not that expensive and 
                    will put 25 extra wisdom points on you with a top of the line
