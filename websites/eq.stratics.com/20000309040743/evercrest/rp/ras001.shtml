In my childhood my father spoke to me of the ancient and powerful elves of distant
 lands. He told me of thier cities and habits, and that they rivaled even us, the Erudites,
 in thier beauty both physical and in that which they craft. It was what I learned from my
 father that gave my a form of love for the ancient ones and thier culture, to spite that
 they were all but never seen as far as Erudin and we had so little knowledge of thier
 people. I knew when I first stepped from my first training sesson in the tower of the
 CraftKeepers, that I would one day travel there, as part of the worldly travel I knew my
 school would eventually require.
<br><br>
 Slowly, the time came, and I could feel it approaching. I both feared and adored the
 travel to the far East, as I had only been into the commonlands of Antonica once, for
 reasons that shall not be discussed (I will say however, jewelers are commonly far too
 committed to allow any race to hoarde thier knowledge of Srettib's true ways). I
 travelled alone, using the simple magic we learn early on to travel unmolested
 wherever we please, invisability. I followed the route I was shown by former guides, and
 went further then before to the Human city of Freeport. That city is worse than even
 Qeynos and I suggest to any creature of reason to aviod it, as it has become a rotting
 metropolis. There was but one boat that was worthy of the vast Ocean Of Tears, so I
 waited patiently, trying to aviod the bustle of this filthy city as best I could, by fishing.
 Finaly the boat arrived, and then departed again in what seemed like mere moments.
 Again, fishing was my escape from homesickness and my weariness,
 and yet to spite this the journey still seemed to take much time. Finally though, I
 arrived at the port of Faydwer, the land of the elves. I was suprised to learn that some
 of the little men I had seen on Antonica as far as Qeynos itself called this place home,
 but found they were not all too fond of me and thusly continued on to the great forest
 of the elves, it was difficult to navigate the way but I have trained much to travel, and I
 would not be stopped. Following the clouds I finally come onto the path leading into
 the vast forest of the elves.
<br><br>
 The ensuing weeks were most disheartening. I spent all my time making every attempt
 to become accustomed to this new surrounding. I found the "city" of Kelethin to be
 quite distasteful, and saught out Felwithe, the home of the true, fair elves my father
 told me of. I must say the city itself was dazzling and I felt very much at home in it's
 walls, not to mention I was very happy to have escaped the bustle of the forest, it
 reminded me much of the Human cities I do so often loathe visiting, and I had a
 ringing of aspiring merchants shouts in my ears for many hours. Once again I fished,
 but this time as a social means. I did meet a few high Elves, as they call themselves
 much like we call oursleves high Humans at times, many of whom I found very likable.
 However as the weeks passed and I tried to seek adventure, and to aide the Elves with
 thier home's troubles, I was sad to find out the thier people are generally utterly
 apathetic, not only to a homesick woman but even to one another.
 One rainy night with my face wet not from Karana's sobbing but my own, due I believe
 to too much thought of the elves and the predicament thier people were getting into, I
 decided it was time for me to leave the elves, for I could do nothing to assist them on
 my own, and was becoming depressed as the once comforting walls of Felwithe
 became now a mocking reminder of my true home, beautiful Erudin. By the next
 sunset I was once again in Freeport, crushed by what I knew now of the elves and how
 they have fallen from thier once great status. I can only now hope that they see thier
 folly before it results in... well I prey Quellious brings peace should they ever be truly
 attacked by thier foes.
