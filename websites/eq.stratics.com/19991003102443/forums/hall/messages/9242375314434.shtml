In Reply to: <a href="9242353353588.shtml">Be Nice to Healers Week</a> posted by Dharbrin (Povar) on April 16, 1999 at 12:02:14 AM CDT:<p>
Many people are jerks, period. The very same could be said about the flip side of this situation... <br>I admittedly am a ranger, but people know I have a minor healing spell, and the majority of them ask nicely for a heal. (I don't think I've ever had a "demand" yet..) I also go around carelessly healing others, I almost *always* get a warm thank-you, and I do not expect coin. You should not either if you freely give your service without being asked...granted, my heal isn't as powerful as a clerics', but its' principle. <br>As for people asking, of course some form of compensation is in order, and that is sadly rare that people offer it. I don't think this bad situation is as widely spread as you say or think though, I'm sorry if you've had a string of bad experiences, but please don't generalize. Not everyone is bad, in fact, I think the good outweigh the bad. I also don't play on your server, I play on Fennin, so maybe your world is full of rude people. *shrug*<br>In any event, a good rule of thumb would be to politely refuse anyone asking for the "convenience" of a heal. I'm saying convenience, meaning they may just want a heal to shorten their down-time in a non-hostile situation. You could say something like "I'm sorry, I must conserve my strength for my adventuring companions." even if you are grouped or not. Of course, if someone is dying in a fight, and is over their head, and they yell for help, then it is your duty within your beliefs and profession to offer assistance, whether it be in the form of an extra club, or a heal. Free of service. I would handle disease differently though, since a cleric is the only one who can offer relief. Depending on the type of person you are, (and you seem nice and sensible) you could say "I gladly accept donations for my services"  before you cure, or you could just charge outright. (Although I don't agree with that method..for a cleric.) <br>In truth, I've never witnessed someone demanding healing services, then walking away without a word. I can also not even begin to tell you the number of times I myself have been afflicted with a disease, and have politely and repeatedly broadcast for help (sometimes going unconcious in between), all the while there being 6 level 14 clerics in-zone. (I've never directly /telled them, that's rude I think). By the same token, I've seen as many acts of kindness. <br>Cheer up, we do appreciate you. Everyone is used and/or abused in one way or another, just don't associate with those people and you'll be fine.
