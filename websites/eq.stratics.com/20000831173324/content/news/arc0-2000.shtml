He's been adjusting and fixing pathing for over a year now,                and most areas are fixed though, but I'm sure there are some that                could be worked on.               <p><b>Mobs are teleporting</b><br>                 Not sure what you mean here. Mobs can teleport when they get stuck,                  and they can also teleport at times due to lag. There is also                  an obscure bug that can cause them to teleport for no discernible                  reason we've been trying to hunt down for months, but this is                  fairly rare.               <p><b>Login server is puking up a storm</b><br>                 The login server works fine unless more than like a thousand people                  try to log on simultaneously. We have no intention of throwing                  additional hardware at the Login Server to make that number 2,000                  or some such, in that that many people trying to log on doesn't                  happen often and always clears up in a relatively short period                  of time (as more and more people get into the game).               <p><b>Many of the zones are broken/not itemized, causing overcrowding                  in other zones</b><br>                 As of the Plane of Sky, ALL zones are itemized. I'm also not aware                  of any entire zone that is 'broken'. Could zones be improved?                  Absolutely, and that's one of the big tasks the EQ Live team has                  ahead of them. In addition to populating Paineel, they will revamp                  Kerra Ridge and then probably Najena, and perhaps Mistmoore then                  as well, although they'll also be responsible for populating and                  tuning the Hole.               <P><b>And you're working to add "reverb" in caves..</b><br>                 Yes, one of our client programmers (you'll note that most of the                  items you mentioned fall in the responsibilities of Game Designers)                  is working with Creative Labs to enhance SB Live performance and                  features               <p>- Brad                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem949375749,973,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>End            of Month</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:29 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> Found this at: alt.games.everquest.               <p>               <blockquote>Just curious about the upcoming "end of the month" and                  the so called things Brad and Verant mentioned would be implemented                  by the "end of the month".                  <p>I believe it was stated that Paineel would be up by the end                    of the month and that the quest for the Fiery Avenger would                    be finished by the end of the month.

Aeldoz told of the crazed                  shouting of the kidnappers, and their plans to sacrifice Nilanie                  to their dark God. He also spoke of a clue they were given....telling                  them to look for the "Blood that grew" or some such, and that                  they were seeking the Hemoenologist in Mistmoore castle.Enraged                  I wanted to charge in and whet my blade in the blood of the evil                  ones, but Aeldoz convinced me to stay my sword for a short time.                  There was already a team being led into the castle and they were                  nearly upon the Hemoenologist. Quickly I assembled another party                  gathering Caleborus, Yadan, Aeldoz and Fnord. A third party was                  even now heading to Qeynos, led by Aerithon a soldier of the Battle                  Brigade.<BR>                 <BR>                 Karmus sent word that they had killed the Hemo, and had received                  the second clue. This one mentioned the giant twins on a mountain                  in a vast land. Immediately we thought of Froon and Choon those                  notorious brigands of West Karana. Within minutes we had teleported                  to the land of Karana, intent on tracking down the twins. It did                  not take long and the giants fell before our swords. A rune was                  retrieved from one of the bodies and a third clue was given to                  us by a voice on the wind. This clue spoke of a Lone Guard in                  front of a fortress of Ice.<BR>                 <BR>                 So it was off to the gates of Permafrost. We met up with Aerithon                  and his group just outside of qeynos. After resupplying and getting                  some warm gear to protect against the cold of Everfrost we struck                  out into the snows of the North. Arriving outside the dread gates,                  we prepared for the battle to come. Everyone knows that Ice Giants                  are no laughing matter. We cautiously entered the gates, sneaking                  past the two outer warders and into the entrance hall of Permafrost.                  The Giant stood gazing about in the icy darkness, as we huddled                  near a corner. Whispering instructions we laid our plan of attack,                  then when the moment could be delayed no longer we struck. The                  Giant roared in fury as it was suddenly pierced by the swift blades                  of Teran. Karmus, Aerithon, Yadan, Sorrento and I just behind                  struck next. Beleaguered the beast swung about with his dwarf                  sized fists, as the first of the eldritch magics slammed into                  him. Strong magics protected us in front, reducing a blow that                  could drop an elephant in one shot, to a mere scratch. It was                  not long till the blood corpse of the thing was lying at our feet.                  Again a clue came to us on the wind, telling us that Nilanie was                  down in Vox's home, past the ice giants, in the lair of the "white                  beast".<BR>                 <BR>                 Because of the danger we faced we quickly formed 2 groups leaving                  one group behind to give word in case we failed....someone had                  to survive. We made haste deep into permafrost, Teran and Karmus                  leading the way, their blades quickly dispatching any Goblins                  who thought to warn their brethren. It was before the door to                  the Ice Giant we finally paused, if we went beyond that door it                  was entirely possible none of us would make it out. There was                  no question of turning back though, Nilanie was down there, and                  the Dawn Brigade would not abandon one of its own. Caleborus approached                  the door, when suddenly from behind it came a deafening roar.                  Ice chips fell from the ceiling as the sound reverberated off                  the walls. The door crashed open and a large Giant came running                  through wearing some sort of robe, a sigil on the left breast.                  That giant fell with relative ease, and his robe was good enough                  to clean the blood from my sword.<BR>                 <BR>                 Not knowing the area Oohlala went off in search of Nilanie, we                  could hear her voice but in the warren of caverns it was impossible                  to tell where she was. One thing was obvious...she was in pain...and                  possibly dieing. Oohlala instead of finding Nilanie found another                  Giant...this one wore the vestments of a holy man, his long cossak                  fluttered behind him. Even this giant could not stop us, we fought                  fiercely knowing that Nilanie was in danger. After it was dispatched                  we went deeper in, trying to follow the sounds of Nil's voice.                  Eventually coming to a cross hall, one way went further in, the                  other way went up a long ramp. It was from this ramp that Nilanie's                  screams seemed to come. Without a word we charged up the ramp,                  the world turning red in my vision. Suddenly at the top of the                  ramp where my feet should have touched solid ground, instead found                  nothing but air.<BR>                 <BR>                 After a solid impact I pushed myself to my feet, the flickers                  of a recent gate spell and a crumpled form caught my eye. Filled                  with fear I rushed to the body unbelieving what my eyes were telling                  me. It was Nilanie's body, even now the blood seeped from long                  cuts down her legs, and a ragged wound pierced her chest just                  over her heart. I cradled her lifeless body in my arms, thinking                  how close we were. Lindalinda came and whispered soothing words                  to me, and took Nilanie from my arms. Lindalinda laid the still                  form on the ground lips moving in a silent prayer. Working quickly                  Linda rubbed some sort of salve on the wound, then with a finger                  drew several symbols in red across her forehead and down her arms.                  This done Lindalinda sat quietly murmuring a prayer, till she                  glowed with a blue light. Suddenly Nilanie gasped for breath,                  sucking it in as though she had been under water a long time.                  Fresh blood was oozing from the rapidly closing wounds on her                  chest and legs. I rushed forward as Linda sagged exhausted from                  her efforts, putting my hand on her shoulder she smiled then nodded                  that she was ok. I embraced Nilanie glad she was with me once                  again.<BR>                 <BR>                 Karmus gave a shout followed by the sound of his two-handed sword                  leaving its scabbard. Turning I saw a huge Polar Bear charging                  at Karmus, leaving the still weakened Nilanie momentarily in Linda's                  care I rushed to face the beast. We dispatched it but not without                  difficulty. In the silence that followed we slowly became aware                  of guttural growls sounding in the distance. Without warning another                  bear hurtled out of the darkness at us. Karmus once more charged                  it, with Yadan, Teran, and Nilanie following close behind. I heard                  a yell from behind and saw that Aerithon was directly in the path                  of 2 more of the bears. With a cry of rage the elven berserker                  leapt on the back of one of the bears, hewing at it with his axe.                  The push was too much though and the spell casters were wearied,                  sensing death was near the command was given to evacuate.<BR>                 <BR>                 Within minutes we were standing in the still mountain air of Butcherblock.                  My bride beside me smiled wearily as I put my arm around her.                  We had all made it, we were all safe. I looked about at my companions                  some tending wounds, some sitting eyes closed in silent meditation.                  Teran was passing a bottle of Elven wine he had produced from                  one of his packs around the circle.<BR>                 <BR>                 Cuchulain Dawntreader<BR>                 Captain of the Dawn Brigade<BR>                 <BR>                 *OOC*<BR>                 I want to thank everyone for coming to the wedding, and those                  who helped afterwards.<BR>                 <BR>                 Team1:<br>                 Karmus, Lindalinda, Oohlala, Teran, Melior<br>                 Team2:<br>                 Me, Caleb, Aeldoz, Fnord, Yadan<br>                 Team3:<br>                 Aerithon, Sorrento, Talianna, Visnet</blockquote>               </font>I still never get invited to these things >:(                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem949347983,1630,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Karana            GM Petition</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Karana Server News [ 11:46 AM PST ] -              <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri Kagato</a></font>             <div> From an anonymous Karana player:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Hi!

Around 15 to 20 guilds                  at one point had sent a representative to come to the meeting,                  so we do have the support to make this happen. Also we had around                  4 or 5 guides present at the meeting, who also put up a lot of                  good ideas. We did not vote on who shall be governing each city                  on this meeting. What we shall be doing is having a small council                  made that will start off working on this, with a representative                  from all the guilds interested. This council will get us a framework                  for when the cities become governed by the guilds, and also we                  are hoping to confront Lady Daegarmo and have help from the gms.                  This will help very much. Some ideas we had discussed during the                  meeting were what the governments are going to do and how to enforce                  them. A simple answer to that was to do what the original Republic                  of Freeport had done, before they had collapsed, which was having                  meetings and listening to those in the areas, as well as having                  events and quests. That will be the main purpose of these governments.                  Not to really rule the world, but to have guilds working together                  to have events, or in the case of race hatreds, having wars between                  cities that would make Norrath much more interesting. Also we                  shall be trying to get a standard for prices in each area, as                  well as opening up trade routes between the cities, so that something                  from Mistmoore could be brought to Toxxulia Forest if in demand,                  and sold easily. A mailing list was made, which is eqgov@listbot.com                  that can be used to spread the ideas around from people in this,                  or who want to know more. It will be easier this way to communicate                  and get things done.

Whom ever gives our tavern the best name will win a                  to be determined prize!<br>                 <br>                 All Innoruuk Server guilds are accepted into this alliance, so                  come on over and sign up your guild! And remember... the success                  of this alliance depends on the people within! If we don't get                  the message boards a bit more active, and more storylines going,                  it won't prosper!<br>                 <br>                 <a href="http://irpa.eqhq.com">Innoruuk Role-Players' Alliance</a><br>                 <br>                 ~Wyndorn Windchaser, Guildmaster - Aven du Sora<br>                 Founder - Innoruuk Role-Players' Alliance</blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem949165731,259,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Scavenger            Hunt On Erollisi Marr</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Erollisi Marr Server News [ 9:08 AM PST              ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div> Submitted by Shmueena:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Here ye, Here ye, Mithaniel's Mirth a Guild on Erollisi                  Marr s sponsoring a Norrathian scavenger hunt and recruiting event.

I am pretty low                  lvl but i think i was first to be attacked by the "centaur-gms-with-name-creatures".                  I sat down by the big tree in the middle of tower, looked up,                  and saw a centaur with name, Akkar Sureshot or somthing was his                  name, he ran by like suuuper fast.. Then suddenly he came up and                  hit me. My pet attacked and stuff, the centaur (as I thought it                  was a npc) attacked my pet.. i conned red so i ran and shouted..                  Then i saw I wasnt the only one having problems with the centaurs.                  There was at least 4-5 of em and some talking birds (aviaks) as                  well.. then a npc halfling too.. My suspicions grew when the "npcs"                  suddenly started taunting us by shout and named people shouting                  and stuff.. I was on other side of zone and shouted something                  like "Hahaha, this is a blast" (i understood it was some kind                  of event planned by gms, not reallizing that the npcs were the                  gms). then one of the kentaurs shouted back something like "Mayaxon,                  (my name) wether you side with us or are against us nature shall                  be avenged!!!!".. I even have screen pix of it all.. haha.. well,                  these "gm-centaurs" kept on attacking everything and all, kind                  of taking over the tower area for a while, then more and more                  players entered sk and gathered to attack them with a powerfull                  strike :)) Well, the pcs kicked their a**es and they carried a                  damn good loot. My friend got two of their loots.. But they were                  TOUGH though.. Hehe, i fought as good as i could for my lvl and                  got killed like twice :))) I hope they do something like this                  again! it was really fun and very inventive.. <br>                 Just thought you would wanna know this :)) <br>                 <br>                 My chars name is Mayaxon (Profetians Krigare)<br>                 Bye...</blockquote>               </font>Coming next week: When GM's Attack!!! :D                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem949164622,565,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>New            Patch Message</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 8:50 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div> This info came with the latest patch:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>January 28th, 7:00pm<br>                 --------------------<br>                 <Br>                 ***Emergency Patch***<br>                 <Br>                 The servers are currently being brought down individually for                  an emergency update. This update is being done to correct a bug                  inthe server code that led to the instability that the servers                  have experienced over the past week. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br>                 <br>                 Included with this patch are several changes that were not supposed                  to occur until the regular patch next week. These changes are                  inseparable from the changes required to fix the network problems,                  and as such are being implemented a little earlier than we would                  like. There will be additional changes in the next patch that                  we wanted to include with the current changes, however to reduce                  overall downtime and customer inconvenience, they are being postponed                  until next week.<br>                 <br>                 ***Changes in Current Patch***<br>                 <Br>                 *Warriors*<br>                 <br>                 Warriors now have a chance to strike a "Crippling Blow" when berserk.                  "Crippling Blow" is much the same as a "Critical Hit" with increased                  damage and an integral stun.<br>                 <br>                 *Magicians and Necromancers*<br>                 <br>                 We discovered a bug whereby all NPCs will not utilize their "Dual                  Wield" skill unless they have a weapon equipped in their off-hand.                  This bug would not allow magician and necromancer pets to use                  their "Dual Wield" skill unless handed two weapons by their masters.                  Since magician pets could not wield weapons at all, they never                  used their "dual wield" skill.<br>                 <br>                 Correcting this bug would cause all NPCs above the mid-20s to                  suddenly begin using their "dual wield" skill to attack players                  with their off-hand. This would cause a drastic shift to game                  balance, as most non-pet NPCs are generally considered balanced.<br>                 <br>                 Magicians may now equip their pets with weapons. This will allow                  their pets to utilize their "dual wield" skill, thus increasing                  the number of attacks that the pet can make per round.<br>                 <br>                 Since magician pets can now wield weapons, an ability previously                  reserved for necromancers, high level necromancer summons (44                  or above) will now randomly cast spell effects upon the creatures                  they fight.<br>                 <br>                 An additional change has been made to make it easier for necromancers                  and magicians to equip their pets. Previously, necromancers had                  to equip their pets with two *different* weapons in order enable                  them to "dual wield". This change allows magicians andnecromancers                  alike to hand their pet two *identical* weapons, thus making it                  easier for them to get their pet to "dual wield".<br>                 <br>                 These changes drew our attention to the disparity that exists                  between melee characters and caster pets. Both of these pets,                  afterthe initial round of changes, could wield certain weapons                  that would significantly increase their attack speed. We acknowledge                  thatnecromancers always had this ability, and apologize for our                  delay in addressing it, but weapons will no longer increase the                  attackspeed (lower the attack delay) of a pet.<br>                 <br>                 In the near future, several new spells are planned for necromancers                  of level 12 and above, including a new type of necromancer-only                  spell that is very group-friendly. We were planning to include                  these new spells with the changes in pet/weapon interaction, butthose                  additions require downtime best restricted to the planned update                  schedule. We expect to implement the new spell effects inthe next                  patch, tentatively scheduled for next week.<br>                 <br>                 --The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem949164257,2138,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Convention            of Necromancers</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Innoruuk Server News [ 8:44 AM PST ]              - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri Kagato</a></font>             <div> Maeric sent this in:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>I have sent this mail to Mr. McQuaid, along with numerous                  news sights.

(I am                  a level 22 monk) Worried my account got hacked, I signed on and                  checked my character. I logged in, moved around to make sure I                  was still a level 22 monk which I was, and logged back off. I                  told my friend he was hallucinating and should seek medical advice.                  Everything was OK until tonight. I'm fighting in Cazic Thule and                  zone out because of a massive train (go figure) and much to my                  amazement the next message I get is, You have entered South Qeynos.                  Not only that, I see a winged helmet on the middle left of my                  screen and upon pressing "i", I see now I'm a level 5 Paladin!                  ACK!!!!! I immediately petition and got a quick response from                  a guide (again, go figure) who has passed the problem to the main                  GM. I log out quickly just to see if somehow there has been some                  terrible video error (I'm desperate at this point) and in my character                  selection screen Torin is now a level 5 paladin and no monk anywhere!                  So basically I'm playing someone else's character and my beloved                  monk is now gone. I log back in my new very nerfed monk (and you                  thought the FD nerf was bad) and wait for the GM to tell me the                  good news that my monk is ok and it's all just a very bad dream.                  A couple hours later and a few friend petitions on my behalf and                  still nothing. Before going to bed I write this letter in hopes                  of having a resolution to this problem quickly. The moral of the                  story is if you ever see a name identical to yours get the problem                  taken care of before something like this happens.<br>                 <br>                 Torin Shadowfist, 22 Monk in waiting of GM response<br>                 aka Torin, 5 Paladin<br>                 E'ci</blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem949028068,1680,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Thursday                  [ January 27 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Xanit            K`Ven - Continued</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Vallon Zek (PvP-Teams) Server News [              6:54 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote>In the name of the Xanit K'Ven Empire, the dark races                  are uniting.

Although my site is devoted to providing                    extensive information on every aspect of the game, it has often                    been pointed out that, like most information sites, it looks                    at most things from the perspective of the good races more than                    the evil ones. Thus, I have joined forces with Neriak.com to                    make sure there is an equal amount of information devoted specifically                    to those who play the dark races.

It appears now that necro                    pets aren't dual wielding unless they are equipped with two                    weapons. It's easy to test this with a piercing and a slashing                    weapon. This could also be affecting mage pets, and could explain                    also why some necros felt their pets got weaker after the last                    patch.</p>                 <p>GZ and I are going to chat wiht the programmer when he gets                    back from lunch. Has anyone noticed that NPCs no longer hit                    as much as they should? I'm wondering if whatever problem this                    is may have affected NPCs across the board or just pets.</p>                 </font></blockquote>               </font> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>>>>Magician pets have never dual weilded in the history                  of EQ.

This caused a few instances where 3 hits ended                    up in the log with the same timestamp. Mage pets do not currently                    dual wield.

This inspired one                    of our guild members Santiago ( <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/santiago/launch.htm">http://www.lostorder.com/santiago/launch.htm</a>                    ) to write a little story:</p>                 <p>"The traveler paused for a moment and lifted his gaze skyward,                    to a sight that never failed to fill him with awe. A thousand,                    thousand, thousand filaments of shimmering silver light filled                    the air, stretching on and on as far as his mere eyes could                    see. It was as if the Celestials had fashioned a giant tapestry                    of light and then unraveled it, leaving behind a vast, sprawling                    tangle of glowing threads that now hung in disarray throughout                    the infinite expanse of the Void. Without those threads, the                    Void would have been nothing but a vast, empty space &#8211;                    cold, dark and utterly hollow. But the coruscating network brought                    light and life to the Void, bridging its vast distances and                    helping to connect its disjointed inhabitants. Instead of darkness,                    there was a soft, crystalline luminescence not unlike the hope-filled                    light of a new morning.</p>                 <p>But it had never been this quiet before. The silver webs were                    usually alive and pulsing with activity; the air usually filled                    with the sound of wind chimes echoing from everywhere. It was                    like the music that angels might have played &#8211; only now,                    that music had died. In its absence was an unsettling silence,                    scored only by the hollow moans of the wind that breathed through                    the lifeless webs, causing them to sway about like phantoms.                  </p>                 <p>The traveler peered over the edge of the precipice, where the                    webs continued into the silver depths far below. He took care                    not to misstep, for a fall from this height would never end.                    Strangely enough, he could see lights in the distance; the rest                    of the Web was still alive. It seemed as though the spell of                    silence affected only this area, which was his own domain. </p>                 <p>And he began to worry. For there were serpents in this paradise,                    and it was possible that one of them had somehow infected his                    own garden. They were known as the Plague-Bringers; and why                    they did what they did was a mystery. Perhaps it was cruelty                    &#8211; or maybe just simple boredom. Who can say why some seek                    only destroy what others create? Whatever their reasons, the                    Plague-Bringers devoted much of their time to the study of the                    Dark Arts. Nothing delighted them more than using the veins                    of the Web to spread darkness and disease. The traveler sighed                    and steeled himself for a confrontation. </p>                 <p>But perhaps it was nothing. Sometimes it was nothing more than                    a broken strand in the web, and the Spinners could take care                    of that. Left too long, however, and the problem would become                    more serious. Travelers would eventually cease to visit, and                    this domain would become nothing more than dust and cobwebs,                    neglected and forgotten. It had happened to other sites, but                    the traveler vowed that it would not happen to this one. </p>                 <p>A whispered word teleported him to the steps of the Nexus,                    where one of the Spinners was busy examining one of the filaments.                    The creature noticed the traveled, and scurried toward him on                    its eight legs. &#8220;This place is closed,&#8221; hissed the                    Spinner. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be here.&#8221; </p>                 <p>The traveler drew back the hood from his cloak, and the Spinner&#8217;s                    red eyes widened in fear. &#8220;F-forgive me, Lord Brimstone!                    I&#8230;I didn&#8217;t expect you to come here today&#8230;&#8221;                  </p>                 <p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; asked Brimstone calmly. </p>                 <p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s the Core, sir.&#8221; The creature opened                    the door and pointed one of its sharp legs toward the center                    of the chamber, where the crystal heart of the domain usually                    hovered in mid-air, shining brightly enough to illuminate the                    entire area. In its place sat an unimpressive lump of grey rock.                    &#8220;It&#8217;s dead or somethin&#8217;, sir. I been tryin&#8217;                    to get it back to life, but I think it&#8217;s a done deal.                    We might have to go an&#8217; get a new one.&#8221; </p>                 <p>&#8220;See to it,&#8221; said Brimstone. &#8220;I want this                    place alive again.&#8221; </p>                 <p>&#8220;Y-yes sir! I&#8217;m on it!&#8221; The Spinner bowed                    and scuttled off across the ceiling. </p>                 <p>Brimstone sighed and sat down on the steps, conjuring himself                    a cold bottle of beer. &#8220;A guild founder&#8217;s work is                    never done,&#8221; he muttered, taking a nice, long, much-needed                    drink. &#8220;I hope they get lostorder.com back up soon.

Rising                    out of the seemingly endless chaos of broken factions, personal                    wars, and blatant atrocities, Xanit K`ven began amassing what                    became one of the largest empires in Norrath's history. Beginning                    with leadership over one of the many factions clawing for power,                    Xanit called for unity among the Teir`Dal. He began forging                    pacts and alliances within the many sects. Some initially fell                    directly under his control, others resisted his rule. But within                    a decade, all were united under one clan.                  <p>Shortly after the Teir`Dal began to unite, K`ven saw that the                    path to ultimate victory would require strong allies, thus he                    approached first the Trolls from Innothule swamp and then the                    Ogres clans near Rathe Mountains. With most of the Teir`Dal                    factions under his control, the brute force of Ogres and Trolls                    at his fingertips, and an iron will bent on domination, Xanit                    K`ven began his conquest of present day Antonica. The Armies                    of K`ven swept across the continent, ravaging villages and towns                    of his enemies. K`ven either totally erased his victims&#8217;                    existence or forced them into slavery. His empire encompassed                    more than two-thirds of the habitable land, and no light race                    dared even look upon his domain. It was a great period for the                    Dark races, who flourished throughout his 40 year reign.                  <p>Today the name of Xanit K`ven has resurfaced. Whispers of his                    name from the depth of shadows, and long forgotten battle cries                    of his warriors, have recently been heard in Norrath. Some say                    that he has returned to lead the dark nations once again to                    world domination. Yet if that is so, why is it that he remains                    hidden? Why not show himself and declare his supremacy? Others                    claim that someone is using the name Xanit K`ven to seize power                    over some factions in Norrath.                  <p>Whether it be a power-hungry individual claiming his name,                    or the warrior himself, back to lead again, someone is uniting                    the dark races in his name...                  <p>--------------------------- <br>                   Taken from the research journals of Ebonminx Aethena: <br>                   ---------------------------                 <p>In searching through an old friend's collection of ancient                    strategy manuals today I came across a Tier`dal translation                    of a manuscript in Elder Dragon. It's title, roughly translated                    as "Merciless Victory", caught my eye. After poring over this                    excellent tactical guide I noticed the authorship was attributed                    to Xanit K`ven. Of course, this could not be possible - the                    arcane text's dialect betrayed its origin as far earlier than                    the Dark Ages when K`ven ruled over Antonica.                  <p>But given the chilling rumors circulating between Innothule                    and Nektulos of a hidden warlord using that name, I found myself                    studying the text with morbid fasciantion. Although I tried                    to remain objective, the descriptions of high elf massacre and                    the shouts of K`ven's name as a war cry only corroborated the                    whispers I had recently overheard. What convinced me of the                    text's sincerity, if not accuracy, was the translation of Xanit                    K`ven... "prepare your soul for the afterlife." This war cry                    of the Indigo Brotherhood has long chilled the blood of the                    Feir`dal and inspired great Tier`dal victories.                  <p>If someone is working from the shadows to unite the Cracknecks,                    Trolls, and dark elves under K`ven's name, then the light race                    alliances have much to fear in the coming months. A new shadow                    of hatred and slaughter is spreading throughout Norrath, heralded                    by cries of "Xanit K`ven" - prepare your soul for the afterlife!                  <p>               </blockquote>               Prepare your soul for the afterlife light dwellars....<br>               Expect more on this soon.....               <p>Alethal La`mort<br>                 EQ Stratics                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948950045,8324,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Stratics            News Team</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Stratics Site Update [ 9:14 PM PST ]              - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>Please note that the news that is from the <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="a00000">EverQuest                  Message Forums</a>.

I rarely have                    a critical hit for more than my normal damage amount. A critical                    hit should be just that, critical. Big damage, at least as much                    as your normal maximum damage. I hate seeing a double hit for                    54/54 then a "critical hit" for 32. Please Brad, Gordon, or                    anyone with the clout at Verant to bring this up at a meeting,                    discuss this. It's only common sense, IMO                 <p>I think there's a misunderstanding about what a "Critical Hit"                    is. When you score a critical hit, you *always* do more damage                    for that hit than you would have done had you not rolled a critical                    hit. In other words, instead of hitting for *2* damage, you                    hit for *32*, despite the fact that your max damage is *54*.                    Basically, you can still get a bad roll.</p>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948928969,589,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Warriors            vs Necro Pets</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 3:22 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div> Another followup to the Pet vs Melee <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/016188.html">thread</a>                on the <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Official                EverQuest Forums</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>                 <p>>>>However, as a lvl 50 barbarian warrior decked out in full                    crafted armor, I got my ass kicked by a lvl 50 necro pet, unbuffed                    and wielding 2 fine steel daggers. I was dead before the pet                    was even at half health</p>                 <p>Couple of things. First, Crafted armor is not level 50 gear.                    It's mid-level gear. However it should be suitable for this                    test. As for the pet versus the warrior, we're not testing apples                    and apples here. The necro pet had two improvments made to it,                    the addition of the daggers. If you are going to test, you need                    to do so with a similar series of improvements. The daggers                    on the necro pet represented a speed buff, so the warrior should                    have gotten a speed buff as well. </p>                 <p>All of that aside, the first test I ran (several weeks ago)                    pitted the top necro summon (Daggers and augment) against a                    level 50 ogre warrior in full crafted (same armor as you), dual                    ykeshas, with appropriate enchanter-made jewelry and an FBSS.                    No other buffs were used. If I used the wrong tactic, I lost.                    If I used the right tactic, I won. Those tactics are up to you                    to figure out. I'm not sure how you managed to lose the fight                    with full cleric buffs.</p>                 <p>But all that aside, why does it matter if necro pets win or                    lose in a battle with a warrior? Again, groups don't tell the                    warriors to take a hike and instead opt for necros. My play                    server has a real shortage of high-level melee types, and a                    surplus of Necros, yet the necros aren't "ruling the planes".                    Even if necromancers pets do more damage, why does it have melee                    types in such an uproar if those pets don't diminish their value?                  </p>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948928526,9952,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Abashi            Speaks On Crippling Blows</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 3:15 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div> Another <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/016297.html">thread</a>                on the <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Official                EverQuest Forums</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>                 <p>>>>That said, the recent upgrades to all melee classes OTHER                    than warrior has made a serious dent in our class</p>                 <p>>>>I think the warrior class is an extremely good one, but                    with all the recent melee upgrades, warriors are simply nowhere                    near as effective as they used to be. I sincerely hope you have                    something planned to address this.</p>                 <p>I heard someone say before, &#8220;You can&#8217;t make class                    A stronger by weakening class B&#8221;. The vast majority of                    people agreed with this statement. Of course, for that to be                    true, so must the reverse: &#8220;You can&#8217;t make class                    A weaker by strengthening class B&#8221;. Strangely enough,                    I&#8217;ve found that doing enhancements seems to cause more                    of a public uproar than &#8220;nerfs&#8221;. With &#8220;nerfs&#8221;,                    the affected people plus a few of those who are sympathetic                    to them disagree loudly with the change. With enhancements,                    those who weren&#8217;t affected tend to complain. The second                    group is usually larger. </p>                 <p>>>>These are low 40's, and blue to a level 50 character. During                    this period, of well over 2000 swings of my sword bladestorm,                    I scored ONE Crippling Blow. That's right, in an hour and a                    half of give or take straight fighting, I scored ONE. I don't                    care if Crippling Blows are a death touch (which they aren't),                    1 of them every hour and a half is absolutely PATHETIC. </p>                 <p>Crippling Blows are only possible under certain circumstances.                    I imagine some warriors will get them pretty often, while others                    will hardly ever see them. It really depends on your fighting                    style.</p>                 <p>>>> This "crippling blow" that I landed scored a miraculous                    58 points of damage. The average regular swing I get with Bladestorm                    is approximately 80, and I can swing for up to 132 damage. So,                    this so called "Crippling Blow" did almost 3 times LESS than                    my max damage swing. </p>                 <p>There are a couple of issues here. First, Crippling Blow went                    in prematurely. The change was made in code, but wasn&#8217;t                    planned until next week. However, due to some network issues,                    new code had to be put on the servers last night to clear up                    a few problems. Crippling Blow went with it, but a typo in the                    damage multiplier has it doing less damage than it should be.                    Second, I think there&#8217;s a bit of a misunderstanding about                    the way Critical Hits (and Crippling Blows) work. When you successfully                    roll for a Crit, you will do more damage than you would have                    done without. Consequently, it is possible that you get a bad                    roll for the hit, and a subsequent bad roll for the crit.</p>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948927593,4126,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Sound            Cards And Servers</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 2:59 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div> This <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/016433.html">thread</a>                jumped out at me on the <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie="true>Official                EverQuest Forums</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>                 <p>Hello All,</p>                 <p>Well.. it looks like things are stable again, with a few exceptions:</p>                 <p>SB Live Users - We are aware of the problems regarding the                    SBLive.. including crashing in some cases and sounds that are                    too loud, etc. It's being worked on right now and we hope to                    have a Client patch in the next day or so to fix this.</p>                 <p>Voodoo3 Users - 3dfx just put up some new drivers that broke                    Mip-Mapping. If you're getting bizzare textures, just turn Mip-Mapping                    off. We're making 3dfx aware of the problem and I'm sure they'll                    fix it quickly. Note - This ONLY happens in Glide.</p>                 <p>Now, on the good side - We've managed to correct the problems                    that were making people unable to log into the really populated                    servers over the last few weeks. NO, we don't consider this                    a "fix" for overcrowding.. it's just something that shouldn't                    have been happening in any case. </p>                 <p>New Servers - We're going to be putting up another new server                    very soon. I can't be more specific than that at this time due                    to some logistics issues we are working out with allowing people                    on Fennin Ro to move to the new server. We're coming out with                    those details here in the next 2 days. After that, we plan on                    putting up 1-2 more servers very shortly. If we still see overcrowding                    on other servers (and I expect to) we will probably do some                    sort of move for a few of the other servers as well. No details                    or promises about that... we'll have to see how Fennin Ro goes                    first.</p>                 <p>We really apologize for the problems these past few days, but                    we thought the best way to handle things was to bite the bullet                    and just work until we fixed the big problems. In any case things                    should be much better now.</p>                 John Smedley<br>                 President and CEO<br>                 Verant Interactive, Inc.</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948927139,4624,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Crippling            Blow!!!</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 2:52 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div>                <p>Apparently, something was implemented under our noses.

Simple enough, when                  a pet from another class can beat another class of comparable                  level, there is something wrong.                  <p>                 <font color="a00000">This isn't really true. A decked out fully                  buffed warrior will take a decked out fully buffed necro pet every                  time.                 <p>Regardless, the pet doesn't have the brains of a real player                    (most of them anyway), so they really don't replace the melee                    type. Outdoors, in wide-open areas, sure, a necro with their                    pet can take some nasty stuff. But in a dungeon, that pet often                    turns into a liability. I've never seen a dungeon group refuse                    a melee type entrance citing, "We don't need you, we have a                    necro pet".                  <p>I've seen people talk about how a group of six necromancers                    could tear anything up, yet I've never seen a group of six necromancers                    get together at the upper levels and go do dungeons. If they                    are so great, why is it that they don't do this?                  </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>I'd like to see this fight, tell                    me how it goes:                  <p>1 Wwarrior, 1 Paladin, 1 Shadownknight, 1 Ranger (all level                    50)                  <p> vs.                  <p>1 Level 50 Necro pet with 2 Fine Steel Daggers and Full Buffs.                  <p>The pet would tear all 4 of them apart, at once, even with                    them working co-operatively and with their spells. The pet would                    kick all of their asses, tell me this is fair.                  <p>                 <font color="a00000">Simply not true.                  <p>I haven't run the test that you noted here, but I have done                    the Warrior vs. the Necro pet. The Warrior won every time. In                    addition, I also did Ranger vs. level 37 hill giant, Warrior                    vs. level 37 hill giant, and Necro pet vs. level 37 hill giant.                    The Ranger had a Win/Loss record of 1/2 (didn't use spells),                    the Warrior went 3/0, and the pet 0/3.                 <p>Though it doesn't have anything to do with this thread, we                    are adding a new type of hit for warriors called the Crippling                    Blow.                  <p>I think they'll like it. <br>                   -Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948857791,3039,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Tuesday                  [ January 25 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EverQuest            Articles Submission</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:36 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>

This is not going to lead                    to a drastic change to how the bard class is played, as bards                    need to know when to stop singing, but it should definatly be                    noticible. </p>                 <p>The problem centers around how a creatures hate-list works.

When's the last                    time that Microsoft made any real effort to have a two-way dialogue                    with their customers? What about the game industry in general?                    If you buy a game, and it sucks, you tell a few people and throw                    it in the closet. What is it about multi-player games that has                    people playing for 10 months straight all the while screaming                    about how awful it is? </p>                 <p>I spend at least $10 a month at McDonalds, yet I don't spend                    my day sifting through alt.restaurants.fast-food.mcdonalds demanding                    that the executive chef put more catsup on the Quarter Pounder                    or complaining that they nerfed the McRib. I pay $20/month to                    my ISP yet accept that throughput at peak hours will be less                    than optimal. I just don't feel that that money gives me the                    right to demand my inclusion in all of their corporate decisions.                  </p>                 <p>Yet in massively multi-player online games, we do feel a need                    to maintain a close relationship with our customers. Why is                    that? Much of the time it feels like a futile effort as everything                    we say is argued to levels never before contemplated. The reason                    why we do this is that we want to constantly improve our game,                    and to do that we need your input. Despite the name-calling                    and obscenity that comes from this board, a good number of enhancements                    have been made to the game based upon your input. Bugs that                    we didn't know or didn't believe existed have been found and                    fixed. Heck, you aren't just our customers, you are the people                    who give us the ideas for both this and future products that                    will insure we remain on top for a very long time.</p>                 <p>>>>Really this is a ( /em looks around ) GAME!

Why dont they just give us a little                    of what we want? </p>                 <p>This is a problem that will plague all successful massively                    multi-player online games. Players (in general) want a game                    where they can be the central figure, or hero, and that they                    can beat or finish. MMOG's aren't designed to be beaten, more                    specifically, they are designed not to be beaten. By virtue                    of the fact that hundreds to thousands of people all play in                    the same world, no one person can be allowed to become an all-powerful                    central figure. Every piece of information we give you about                    game mechanics brings you that much closer to you feeling you've                    beaten the game. </p>                 <p>MMOG's are a constant struggle between the players who want                    to win the game, and the game-designers who insure that they                    never do. </p>                 <p>>>>I can tell Gordon is about to loose it.</p>                 <p>I've been close, but not yet :)</p>                 <p>>>>it's EASY to keep thousand of people who all have their                    own interests which are often contrary to other customers interests                    happy at all times!</p>                 <p>ROFL!</p>                 <p>-Gordon</p>                 </font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948829437,8597,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Necro            Pets And Zone Coding</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 11:43 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:KagatoX5@hotmail.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri              Kagato</a></font>             <div> I found another <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/016064.html">thread</a>,                pretaining to the rumored Necro Nerf and more issues on the <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Official                EverQuest Forums</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>                 <p>Your post claiming necros are paranoid about nerfing simply                    doesn't reflect the fact easily demonstrated BY PLAYING THE                    GAME.

My pet used to be able                    to do X damage per minute and now does Y." Yes I've tested it.                    Yes I've looked at the data. Yes I've looked at their hitpoints.                    Some people are saying they have less hitpoints and have the                    same delay, other people are saying they have the same number                    of hitpoints and have a longer delay. NONE OF THIS HAS HAPPENED.                  </p>                 <p>While I'm on the subject, we didn't downgrade augment, raise                    the cap on delays, or generally increase the strength of your                    test NPCs either to make it appear that necro pets were nerfed.</p>                 <p>I imagine that there is a small group of people that thinks                    if they complain enough about it that we'll just go in and make                    the pets more powerful without testing it out for ourselves.                    The rest of the people complaining about it are either making                    it up, going with the flow, or suffering from the online version                    of the placebo effect.

A zone is either                    a plane, Kunark, not a plane, indoors, outdoors, dungeon, or                    a combination of those. Individual zones have to be coded for                    specifically if we wish to differ spell effects between them.                  </p>                 <p>I ran tests in Rathe Mountains and Lower Guk. In both cases                    the top summon had the same level and same number of hitpoints.                    In both cases the pets fought at the same speed. Also, the dagger/augment                    trick really sped them up. </p>                 <p>Since the spell data was not changed, necro pets could not                    have become inadvertently slower without it affecting other                    pets as well, or combat across the board. To check this, I also                    repeated a test that I did a couple of weeks ago where I pitted                    a necro pet against several of the different mage pets.

I have spend countless hours getting                    my necromancer to level 50 and today I realize that I might                    have spend my time on the wrong class.As of the latest patch                    that Verant has introduced I have noticed, along with all my                    fellow necros on Bertoxx, that our pets seem to have been once                    again nerfed.I am not sure in which form were our pets nerfed                    but from observing my pet throughout this weekend in my hometown,                    Lower Guk, I have noticed that my pet's overall effectiveness                    has greatly decreased. </p>                 <p>My level 49 pet, Invoke Death, used to be able to kill Zol                    Ghoul Knights, Wans Ghoul Knights and lower ranking Ghouls with                    extreme ease. It would shred them to pieces and take little                    to no damage. This was using a fine steel dagger (dly 19) and                    a regular dagger (dly 20) coupled with augment death. The usual                    hitting range of these pets was 53 dmg. After having summoned                    62 pets during the weekend (hehe, i counted them=p) I have come                    to the following conclusions.</p>                 <p>My pet currently still hits for 55 max damage. The problem                    is that even with the lowest delay daggers my pet does not hit                    nearly as fast as he used to be. Not even with Augment Death.                    I have noticed that my pet also takes considerably longer time                    to kill Zols and Wans whereas previously he could do it fairly                    quick.</p>                 <p>The form of the nerf seems unclear to me but I have a few suspicions.</p>                 <p>1.- Augment Death (haste effect on pet) has been nerfed so                    that it does not give as much speed increment as it previously                    did.</p>                 <p>2.- The overall stats of the necromancer pet have been lowered                    so that it is not as effective.</p>                 <p>3.- The amount of Hit Points from the necromancer pet has been                    reduced.</p>                 <p>4.- A combination of any of the previous options.</p>                 <p>Whether this nerf was unintentional or intentional is not known.                    The important thing to know here is that this nerf has indeed                    taken place. If this nerf is unintentional then I would like                    to know from Verant's staff what is their plan to make things                    the way they were.</p>                 <p>Since Abashi has stated that he is now in charge of the patch                    messages and that now everything is included in them, I find                    it hard to believe that this was an intentional patch.</p>                 <p>If it was though, im not excluding this option due to the intense                    nerfing process that necros endure, I would like some word from                    Abashi, Aradune or GZ to please explain to EQ's necro community                    the logic behind this patch and why it was delivered to us in                    such a low fashion way.</p>                 <p>This is not a delusion of mine.

Allow me to explain...Before this week's patch, my pet                    used to take on the Ghoul Lord in Lower Guk and need about 2                    complete Heals (He always has all the cleric HP and Armor buffs                    on.), maybe 3 CH's at the most as the fight progressed to the                    end. I've killed probably 100 Ghoul Lords with my pet, and I                    know what he can and cannot do -- 90% of the time, heneeds 1                    or 2 complete heals, at worst, 3. Now, my pet, fully buffed,needs                    at *LEAST* 5 Complete Heals as he fights the Ghoul Lord, yet                    the Ghoul Lord is not any stronger than he used to be. The Pet                    is hitting for the same amount of damage as before (Level 49                    pet hits for 55 max.), but He is hitting MUCH slower, and much                    less often than before. Therefore, he takes much longer to kill                    the Ghoul Lord than before.</p>                 <p>I have a feeling that Augment Death is somehow bugged and is                    not working at all, and I'm hoping this is the culprit. Maybe                    it was unintentionally bugged during the patch (Wow, this patch                    has caused ALOT of bugs.). I'm hoping this is the case, otherwise,                    our pets are MUCH weaker than before. My pet takes a LOT longer                    to take down a Daror even a Zol Ghoul Knight than it used to                    as well. I heard reports from other necros, saying our pets                    seemed a lot weaker--I didn't think anything of it, until I                    tested it myself. </p>                 <p>I *LIVE* in Lower Guk, and I know what my pet can and cannot                    do--My pet is severely weakened since the patch. I doubt that                    this was an intended nerf, but we need to find out what went                    wrong, and cause an uproar--Otherwise, they will never believe                    us that something is indeed wrong.</p>                 <p>If you have the level 49 pet, and use Augment Death a lot (You                    should if you know what you are doing.)--please test it out,                    and see if you can reproduce the same results I'm getting (Or                    not getting, as thecase is.).                 <p>                 <p>Thanks,</p>                 <p>Gabreel The ShadowQueen</p>               </blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948735467,5741,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Fennin            Ro Event</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Fennin Ro Server News [ 9:37 AM PST ]              - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Tamboran sent in this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>THE FIRST ANNUAL SOERBAIRD COMEDY HOUR!!<BR>                 <BR>                 WHAT: A comedy concert by the finest bards in Norrath!<BR>                 WHEN: Tuesday, January 25th at 9PM EST<BR>                 WHERE: Surefall Glade, Fennin Ro<BR>                 WHY: To make you laugh!<BR>                 <BR>                 Join The Soerbaird and friends for a concert that will make you                  laugh in the Glade!

A few minutes ago I checked the server screen and both Fennin Ro                and Karana had 2400+ users on which was causing zone crashes and                no responses from the overcrowding. So much for trying to level                your character, try playing on one of the less crowded servers or                test server in the meantime.<BR>               <BR>               Should Verant pick up the pace on pretesting thier servers to be                opened?

The entry fee is one platnum piece and the matches                  will be between one-on-one people or group-on-group. The singles                  matches will be matched lvl with lvl. With the matches: the participants                  will have to agree on the terms of each other, i.e. it will be                  two on two or three on three with each of the group members agreeing                  with each other. The main winner (or winners), will win a portion                  of a pot that consists of a number of platnum pieces. The pot                  will be determined by how many people come to the tournament.                  No looting is allowed nor is helping other combatants. Other members                  of the Alliance of Swords Guild will be there.

We weren't comfortable                    with the changes to roll anything in this week. We don't want                    to go through a whole lot of trouble only to have them "suck".                    The changes to the Armor of Ro quests happened before we started                    reviewing the class-specific armor issues in general, so it's                    very possible that they will get an update as well. This is                    among the top priority items for the Live Team (the team that                    handles Quest/Items/and NPC issues). </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>I didn't really read the other                    classes so much, but the wizard changes?

SO HOW DO I SURVIVE TO LVL 35?                  <p><font color="a00000">Group? Wizards were affected by resists                    past about 40th level worse than any of the other classes, as                    they are the only magic using class without an indirect method                    of causing damage, and no other combat-related skill besides                    causing damage. Below 35, the wizards are a very solid class.                    I hung out with a wizard off and on for nearly 20 levels when                    building my Necro, and he didn't have a problem. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>I started picking on green basilisks                    that gave me exp.

We've never                    been able to reproduce it reliably in house. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>hmmm, I noticed that they didn't                    increase a cleric's Lay on Hands or a Necro's Harm touch skill?                  <p><font color="a00000">Clerics don't get LoH and Necro's don't                    get Harmtouch.

Verant won't spend the time fixing the cleric exploit for the                    manastone, so they stuff the game up for everyone by removing                    it.                  <p><font color="a00000">"Fixing" the cleric exploit? The only                    way to do this would have been sweeping changes to buff spells,                    or a complete nerf of the manastone to give it a much worse                    ratio. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Than they alter the entire plane                    gameplay to make it fair for new players .. Unacceptable Verant                    .. Guaranteed to cause weeks of ranting!                  <p><font color="a00000">I fail to see why it's unacceptable for                    us to make the game fair for players that didn't have it. Hey,                    it's not that big of a change. There's only two zones that you                    could use the manastone in that you can't now, so that's the                    only thing that you lost. Of course, I'll again mention, if                    the manastone was so powerful that this change drastically altered                    gameplay, it only goes to illustrate that the stone was too                    powerful to begin with. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>WTG on the manastone. It can still                    be used on Dragon raids but not on the planes. It was a bit                    of a trade-off. We can turn it on or off on a zone by zone basis,                    so we would have had to disable it in the entire zone. We instead                    went with Fear and Hate, so just turned off two of the four                    zones which we were considering. Now i am curious about the                    SKy plane.                  <p><font color="a00000">The Plane of Sky is a *very different*                    zone. There's nothing else quite like it. Not just in layout,                    but in objective. I think it will be a while before people understand                    what the zone is all about. To quell one concern I've seen pop                    up, I will say that none of the armor drops from the other planes                    were moved to Sky, yet Sky is completely itemized. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Abashi could have worded it a little                    better but one of the Erudin NPCs simply wouldn't talk to a                    lot of Paladins for what ever reason                  <p><font color="a00000">I believe this was fixed in the last patch                    if I'm not mistaken. It was an issue with a faction that couldn't                    be raised to the requisite. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Feh, as soon as Druids have *any*                    class armor at all, I'll harp right along with you.                  <p><font color="a00000">One of the issues with putting in Druid                    class-specific armor is that Druids will think it "sucks" compared                    to the other armor already out there. There is already a good                    deal of good armor out there that druids can wear that increase                    stats more than the class-specific armor for the other classes                    does for them. I'm not saying that we won't put something in,                    but if we do I wouldn't expect it all to be +WIS gear. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Have patience. Paladins also were                    promised new weapons and such, as Druids were promised ther                    quested armor, and its not in this patch (I know Druids were                    promised it on THIS patch). If its not in this Patch it'll be                    in the next.                  <p><font color="a00000">Thanks for the vote of confidence. Keep                    in mind that it is not our policy to announce new weapons or                    items. Nearly 200 class-specific items were put in with this                    patch, but we prefer that people go out and find them on their                    own. One note about druids, they haven&#8217;t been &#8220;promised&#8221;                    mid-level class-specific armor, this patch or otherwise. It&#8217;s                    just one of the things that we are looking at.</font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font> Verant says that SK, and paladins                    in particular, were having trouble taunting MOBS off of rangers/rogues/etc.                    AND warriors because of their lower damage output. How much                    clearer do you need it? Verant just said that SK and Paladins                    have more damage output than warriors!!!                  <p><font color="a00000">I never said anything like that, you should                    read it again. I said that the taunt skill was increased because                    their damage output is lower than rangers and warriors. It's                    to help them draw more hits. Heck, if a class complains because                    the mob doesn't beat on them enough, who are we to argue? :)                    </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Ahahahaha, guess what everyone                    seems to have missed?

The ceremony will take place outside of the Cleric's Guild                  in Felwithe, back at the water's edge. A GM or Guide will most                  likely preside over the event. And in the true tradition of Halo                  gatherings, there will almost certainly be plenty of spirits followed                  by tremendous violence (*grin*), most likely in the form of some                  kind of dungeon raid as a wedding reception. All members and friends                  of Halo are welcome to join in -- the more the merrier!                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948428427,5592,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Thursday                  [ January 20 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>SoundBlaster            Live Bug Crash</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 8:20 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Jerry sent in this to us:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>After the patch I logged in and all my sound effects                  and volumes were screwed up from before.

He asked if I had a Soundblaster                  Live, which I do, and replied that there are some problems that                  can be fixed by reinstalling DirectX 7. I tried that and haven't                  experienced anymore problems in the short amount of time I've                  played since then. I assume the problems were introduced with                  the patch and I heard some other players complaining about sound                  problems and lockups while I was playing.

After meeting a friend at the arena                  in West Freeport and binding there, I had decided to head to Lake                  Rathe to kill some Aviaks. Being a wizard we have the luxary to                  teleporting, and at level 20, North Gate is the quickest way there.                  After memorizing the spell i proceded to use it, but where it                  took me was not where i had intended. After the zone had loaded,                  it read you have entered Dagnors Cauldrun (or something simular                  to that) and did one of those "Player is under world, returning                  to safe point". I then attempted to turn around to see exactly                  where i was and it froze my computer. (the computer freezing probably                  wasnt directly linked to the bug in the game, but the computer                  still froze) when i rebooted and relogged in, I was back at my                  bind point in freeport. I then petitioned to have the problem                  resolved, because after all, I wasnt supposed to be dumped in                  Dagnors Cauldrun in the first place. After talking to an aprentice                  guide, it had been escalated to a guide, and was consitered an                  underworld death. The guide that helped me was very friendly and                  helpfull. He brought me to my corpse and resurected me for the                  lost experience i had suffered (and losing my lvl 20). He instructed                  me to fill out a bug report and say what had happened, and that                  he would do the same. After filling out the report explaining                  what had happened, i tested the spell again a few times to see                  if it was only a one time bug, and it wasnt. It consistantly took                  me to the same place, but this time i did not die (luckily). After                  a few more minutes, and being tired of the whole deal, I logged                  off for a little while to get some food. When I tried to reconnect                  about an hour after, i was suprised to see that i had been Banned                  for "Inapropriate Behavior". I then called Tech support, but they                  were closed for the holiday (monday). The next day i waited until                  11:30est to call tech support again, and they told me that they                  could not get any info on it, and to call back later, around 2:00.                  I waited a few hours, called back again, and was told i was banned                  for "Hacking" and had to email the GM in order for anything to                  be resolved. I was also told that the GM would not be in the office                  until Thursday, making it a very long 3 1/2 days without Everquest                  (and for some of you, you know that that is a very long time).                  I have yet to be contacted by a GM, so i am awaiting an email                  from him tomorrow afternoon with an explanation, and to hopefully                  have my account re-activated, because i did nothing to deserve                  the headache and long distance phone bills trying to figure out                  what had happened, when I was only trying to help out by reporting                  the bug in the first place.<BR>                 <BR>                 I was just curious if this sort of thing has ever happened before,                  or am I an isolated case? </blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948413490,1826,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Questions            Concerning EQ Items</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Stratics Network Announcement [ 4:11              PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:den@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Den</a></font>

He has been playing phone tag and told broken email addresses                without no chance to discuss the misshaps, <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=10201.topic>go                here</a> to read the whole discussion from other players:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>On January 17th at about 7:45 pm mountain standard time                  I was disconnected without warning from the Bristlebain server.                  I immediately tried to reconnect and was disconnected again. Upon                  my 3rd try, I received a notice upon attempted login that I had                  been "Banned for Inappropriate Behavior". At no time was there                  any communication between myself and a GM regarding whatever situation                  this may have escalated from. At the time of the disconnects,                  I was soloing avos & cents in South Karana. <BR>                 <BR>                 I mainly play alone and with little interaction with other players.                  I have never at anytime in my Everquest career received a warning                  from a GM. My one "brush with the law" as it were was a forced                  name change on a now defunct character by GM Vencor. (According                  to the old OR the new naming guide, I still contend that the name                  "Creepypete" does not violate posted policy, but this is water                  under the bridge & I digress) <BR>                 <BR>                 I have been playing almost from the start of Everquest. I do not                  cheat (use packet sniffers, etc). I do not operate a cross economy                  business. I do not kill steal, run con games, or use objectionable                  language over open channels (or /say) and NEVER with anyone that                  I have not known for years in real life. If I had erred egregiously                  somehow, contact from a GM in game would surely have been appreciated                  to at least make me aware that I was behaving in an objectionable                  manner. <BR>                 <BR>                 This was much the gist of an email that I sent to both Accounts                  & Technical Support. Gave them a call this morning, as the ban                  message says to call tech support if you wish to contest your                  banning. After about 6 phone calls (including the ones with incorrect                  area codes) to various numbers obtained via the Station & EQ Tech                  Support's phone mazes and 2 hangups on their side, I finally got                  a live person at tech support who informed me that "Tech Support                  is only for if you have a technical problem in the game" despite                  that the ban message directs you to call. He did give me the email                  address for Bristlebain's Lead GM and I have forwarded this message                  to that address. </blockquote>               </font>Do you have a comment about this? <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=10201.topic>Go                here</a> to reply.                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948381384,4161,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Mage            Compendium</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:16 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Ronaldor sent in this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Hello all Magi out there, my name is Ronaldor Vladmir                  of Prexus <BR>                 <BR>                 I have been a mage since EverQuest went public and have always                  been looking for a good Mage only site, however I have found none.

As a reminder to our customers,                  the alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the                  same physical or ethereal rules as Norrath proper. Enjoy!<BR>                 <BR>                 Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have been patched with                  the following changes:<BR>                 <BR>                 *General Changes / Fixes*<BR>                 - Some changes have been made to the exit of Nagafen's Lair into                  the Lavastorm Mountains. This will hopefully reduce if not solve                  the bug that causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen's                  Lair. Please let us know how this goes.<BR>                 - Due to feedback received from the customers concerning the density                  of fog during rainstorms, visibility has been increased.<BR>                 - All drops of steel weapons have been replaced with higher quality                  fine-steel weapons of the same type. This change was made to reduce                  the amount of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper                  levels. The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior to the                  steel weapons that were dropping, they just sell to vendors for                  less money.<BR>                 - Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items.                  This was done to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting                  these items. <BR>                 - The safe-point (the point which you return if you fall below                  the world) in Kithicor has been moved near the entrance to Rivervale,                  a safer part of the zone.<BR>                 - Corrected a bug that caused AC to be improperly displayed for                  higher level characters. Your AC should now reflect all of your                  items.<BR>                 <BR>                 Additional Bug Fixes:<BR>                 - Corrected a bug in the client that could cause a crash if you                  were spammed with emotes by someone on your /ignore list.<BR>                 - Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed<BR>                 - Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges                  if dropped on the ground.<BR>                 - Fire Giants in Nagafen's Lair should now recover properly when                  stuck in lava. Consider yourself warned.<BR>                 - The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers.<BR>                 <BR>                 *Spell Changes*<BR>                 - Shadow Vortex is now a "drain" spell.<BR>                 - Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<BR>                 - Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced. In                  addition, the spell is less resistable.<BR>                 - Angstlich's Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly.<BR>                 - All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius                  slightly increased<BR>                 - Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<BR>                 - Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased.<BR>                 - Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable.<BR>                 - New magician's spells have been added. Check your spell vendors.<BR>                 - Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective.<BR>                 - NPCs will now treat the "Cancel Magic" series of spells as hostile.                  Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their                  buffs before attacking. Now they will.<BR>                 - The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the                  caster when they break. No, seriously, we're certain this time.                  <BR>                 - Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41.<BR>                 <BR>                 *Levitation Changed*<BR>                 Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items,                  the code that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while                  it was active is no longer necessary and has been backed out.                  The Levitate spell may now be refreshed while the spell is in                  use. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Quests and Items*<BR>                 - The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable. We will continue                  to evaluate and adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor                  components to make the pieces obtainable in a reasonable amount                  of time.<BR>                 - We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area                  from a level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll. The issuance of a                  level 49 scroll was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters                  to amass an abnormally large amount of currency. <BR>                 - The stats on the reward for the Rogue Redemption quest have                  been increased to make it better than the favorite dropped-weapon                  for the level range.<BR>                 - Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently as other Ravenscale                  items.<BR>                 - The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by the appropriate                  races.<BR>                 <BR>                 *Fletching Update*<BR>                 All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead (formerly                  the Bladed Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be used                  versus magical creatures. All existing items in your possession                  will automatically morph into the new magical items. Additionally,                  each successful attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10                  arrows instead of the previous 5. As such, the vendor buy-back                  value has been decreased accordingly. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Paw*<BR>                 The difficulty of Paw has been decreased. We found that many of                  the gnolls in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon                  more difficult than it should have been for the desired level                  target. Please let us know how this change affects the viability                  of the dungeon.<BR>                 <BR>                 *The Plane of Fear*<BR>                 The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased.                  This change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however                  the data was not exported. It has been tested and equipment drops                  are now occurring at a much higher rate.<BR>                 <BR>                 *The Plane of Hate*<BR>                 The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in                  the Plane of Hate have been decreased. Previously, these NPCs                  used the same drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing                  overall drop percentages to be extremely high.<BR>                 <BR>                 Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for                  illusions, and tend to "Hate" everyone. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Monk Enhancement*<BR>                 A monk's speed in hand-to-hand combat will now improve with level,                  beginning in the high 20s. This will result in higher level monks                  doing substantially more damage in a given time-frame. <BR>                 <BR>                 Though this change does increase the power of the average monk,                  it should be stressed that the monk is now even more in need of                  true tank classes who have the ability to taunt upset creatures                  off them. We want to stress that the "taunt factor" of a monks                  fist has NOT been increased, though it may appear so due to your                  increased damage.<BR>                 <BR>                 *Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement*<BR>                 Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher                  skill caps on Bash and Taunt.<BR>                 <BR>                 The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs                  over level 25. This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers                  had the same HP base, which upon further consideration is not                  compatible with our vision of those classes' roles. This change                  will basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit                  Points) between rangers and warriors of the same race. <BR>                 <BR>                 The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular,                  Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks,                  Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though                  the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability                  to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells                  should help them become more effective tanks. <BR>                 <BR>                 Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't switching                  to two-handed weapons, choosing instead to continue using the                  bash skill. Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians                  for the most part, do not worry about bash and instead opt for                  slam, which uses the same skill. Paladins are typically the only                  characters who use a shield throughout their lives.<BR>                 <BR>                 *Rogue Enhancement*<BR>                 Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by spell, potion, or skill,                  they are now also invisible to undead. <BR>                 <BR>                 This change was made to add a definite class-advantage to the                  rogue, allowing them to do something that no other class could                  do. It is the first step in a multi-step process to improve the                  rogue class. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Wizard Enhancement*<BR>                 Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic,                  Cold, or Fire) much less likely to be resisted. This effect stacks                  with the Staff of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician                  resistance debuffs.<BR>                 <BR>                 This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards                  at about the level that all spell-casting classes start seeing                  their resistance rates go up. Wizards specialize in direct magical                  damage. It makes sense that they should be better at causing that                  damage than the other classes. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Bard Enhancement*<BR>                 Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at 10th level. This                  skill will be granted automatically the first time a bard zones                  after reaching 10th level, and cannot be trained further. It will                  have the effect of decreasing the amount of time that it takes                  a Bard to memorize their songs. Previously, it would take 50th                  level bards upwards of 2 minutes to memorize a song. Now it is                  much faster.<BR>                 <BR>                 *Druid Enhancement*<BR>                 The skill cap on a Druid's tracking skill has been increased.                  This change was implemented based upon general public opinion                  that the former cap was far too low for the skill to be even marginally                  viable. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Feign Death and Pets*<BR>                 After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer's Feign Death                  tactic, as well as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we                  have implemented a change. As we would like everyone to understand                  why we feel this change was necessary, here is a summary of the                  issue:<BR>                 <BR>                 Problem:<BR>                 Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances,                  providing offensive tactics that are abusive. For this ability                  to remain balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility.                  Offensive tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting                  a saving throw verses the effect. Since creatures do NOT get a                  direct save verses feign death (as you cast it on yourself), and                  since you can retry the combat once you have feigned death, there                  is very little risk to necromancer himself. As this tactic involves                  charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which could                  be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo                  MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could. This situation is                  well beyond what would preserve game balance for any other class                  (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for                  example). <BR>                 <BR>                 Example:<BR>                 While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death                  tactic is abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul                  Lord room of Lower Guk. The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards                  and the Ghoul Lord himself. Using the current system, a level                  50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk to himself.                  The Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead.                  To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms                  the other. When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns. The Lord                  then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable                  damage during the fight. The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul                  Lord returns to its spawn point. When the necromancer gets back                  up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign                  Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again.                  The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed. When the Necromancer                  gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full                  mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, and the Necro collects his                  special items.<BR>                 <BR>                 Solution: <BR>                 Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned                  pets suicide and the charmed ones break Charm. We do not want,                  however, to adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such                  a large degree. What we do recognize is the need to prevent higher                  level Necro's from exploiting key spawn points. Hence, when you                  Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break Charm. However,                  summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected. While this still allows                  the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet, it does                  not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that                  charming an NPC does. <BR>                 <BR>                 *Manastone Changed*<BR>                 <BR>                 The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone,                  which no longer drops. They cite that people without a Manastone                  are not as welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other                  areas as people with them. Since dropping additional Manastones                  via quest or removing them from the existing populace is not desirable,                  we've decided to make it so that the Manastone will no longer                  function in the alternate planes. Furthermore, it will not function                  in any of the zones included with the Kunark Expansion.<BR>                 <BR>                 We apologize to those adversely affected by this change. Our general                  goal is to avoid making changes to items in peoples' possession,                  however we felt this change was, all things considered, warranted                  and for the benefit of the game as a whole.<BR>                 <BR>                 - The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948377339,6035,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Cackling            Klaknak</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 6:08 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> This was sent in to us:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Folks: Cackling Klaknak here.<BR>                 <BR>                 Last week I posted an email from a person who claimed, among other                  things, that a guide abused his power. Yesterday I interviewed                  Semiramis (Elder Guide for Everquest) about this event as well                  as more general Guide topics. Here is a snippet:<BR>                 <BR>                 CK: Do you think Euthanasia is an offensive name? Does it violate                  the common word rule?<BR>                 <BR>                 Semiramis: We stumble into a very gray area here. Is "Euthanasia"                  offensive? That question will be answered differently by different                  people, as you well know. Personally, I do not find the word offensive.                  Do my views on the word preclude it from being offensive? That                  is a resounding no. The diversity of the players in EverQuest                  is one of its most amazing qualities. This diversity also has                  to be taken into account when we handle a situation such as this.                  In a case like "Euthanasia" the Guides would usually discuss this                  before making a name change. If there was a consensus that the                  name could be found offensive, the player's name would be changed.<BR>                 <BR>                 CK: Who is sexier, Kirk or Picard?<BR>                 <BR>                 Semiramis: Hmmmm... Tough one here! I consulted my girlfriend                  on this and she said Picard without a doubt. I, personally, think                  it has to do with the bald head.

Three                    times in a row, and each time I was the second one in group                    to be instant killed after the puller was killed (he managed                    to get CT to aggro on him). I was singing mana and heal song                    miles away at camp.                  <p>In dragon raids, the giants always head for the Bards if they                    are singing any song when the puller returns with some aggro'd                    mobs. From a technical point of view, in a full group, Bards                    are actually 'buffing' (or healing) a group of 6 people (self                    included) with their song, around 10 to 15 times a minute, and                    all those 'buffing' somehow get add up to the hate list counter                    on mobs, and that's why bards are always on most mobs' top 3                    spot in their hate lists.                  <p>However from gameplay point of view, this is not balanced.                    Bards doesn't have as high AC as tanks, they have half the hitpoints                    of tanks (even less than Monks and Rogues at times), so the                    question is, Why make bards the super taunter of all classes?                  <p>I'm sure this is not something intended for bards, and I really                    hope it'll get fixed as soon as possible.                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">Most of your examples reference that the                  mob jumps on you when the "Puller" is returning. I can certainly                  see that happening since the puller has done little-to-no damage                  to the creature he is pulling. All he knows is that he can't get                  to the person who he is most mad at, so he might as well eat the                  person who's buffing the person he is mad at.                  <p>But it is balanced. It might not be *fair*, but it's balanced.                    No other class has the ability to buff an entire party like                    that. Doing that has to have it's downside, one of which is,                    you may get eaten. So, you don't have high AC or HP, that's                    all part of that downside. When you get in a group you have                    to make sure that they can either kill something so fast it                    doesn't have a chance to kill you, or you have to be in there                    with some tanks who can get it off of you.                  <p>Sounds reasonble, yes?                  <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948360684,7994,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Gordon            on Stats</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 1:31 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> Found this at the <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">                Everquest Gameplay Forum</a>.               <p>               <blockquote>I want the truth about stats - every detail.                  <p>                 <font color="a00000">It's not going to happen.

I made the mistake                  a few weeks back giving out the information I did. Truth be told,                  too much information ruins the game. Yes, I know you've heard                  us say this before, and you may not agree with it, but it's true.                  When you know everything there is to know about the mechanics                  of a game, there is no sense in playing it any more.                  <p>Reminds me of a turn-based strategy game I played about two                    years ago. The first game through took hours to mine resources,                    build railroads, etc. Then I discovered that a flaw in the AI                    left each empires capital city nearly completely unprotected.                    That game was won in a few more turns. The next game took less                    than 30 minutes, on the most difficult setting. The manual said                    that a game of that nature should take 6 to 8 hours, but it                    didn't, because I knew the mechanics. That game when into the                    closet.                  <p>The same concept applies to EverQuest and will apply to every                    other Online game of this type. If I give you so much information                    that you can establish with 100% certainty what the outcome                    of an encounter is, there's no point in playing. Contrary to                    popular belief, we do want people to keep playing.                 <p> -Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948360294,5053,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Gordon            on Shrink Item</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 1:24 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> Found at the <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">Everquest                Gameplay Forum</a>               <p>               <blockquote>Clarity is a defining spell for the Enchanter class.                  A clarity item was rejected because it would devaluate the Enchanter                  class.                  <p> This new item is supposed to shrink everywhere (dungeons and                    outdoor zones) making it better than the Shaman spell.                 <p> Now there are three possibilities:                  <p>It's an item that's been dropped. <br>                   It's an item that's quested. <br>                   It's a potion that Shaman can make with Alchemy. <br>                   In the last case how can a Shaman get a spell in potion form                    that's more powerful than the original spell?                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">One of the reasons that the Shrink spell                  is dungeon only is that we wanted it to be a utility spell, not                  a "look at me, I'm a miniature troll" spell. By limiting it to                  dungeon only, we at least have it someplace where there is a context                  for it. The new shrink item will be a potion that is created through                  Alchemy. Since only shamans can do Alchemy, there's no worry about                  taking something away from them. We went ahead and decided to                  make the potion "shrink everywhere", since its cost will dissuade                  people from using it as a "show off" spell.                  <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948341256,3259,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Wednesday                  [ January 19 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Gordon            on Looting</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 8:07 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>This follow up to looting suggestions was Found At: alt.games.everquest               <p>               <blockquote>I hope we'll be able to filter this. Don't get me wrong,                  once you get a character rolling it will be a great feature. But,                  I could do without seeing XXXX sees Bat Wings x 2 and Bat Fur                  x 2.                 <p><font color="a00000">We've discussed this. My understanding                    is that we'll include a filter much like that involved with                    Bard Songs, where you can specify "All", "Group", or "None".

We may have been just a                  little bit optimistic about group loyalty. I do think that the                  vast majority of people wouldn't cheat their group out of an item,                  but its that small percentage that hurts. It's sort of the same                  problem with GMs and the reimbursement policy.                 <p>Of course that's one of the nice things about online games,                    and them being patchable. We can put new features in long after                    release.                 </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Another feature I'd like, which                    they probably won't put in, is auto rolling for items and giving                    the item to that person automatically when looting. I guess                    that would be pretty complex though. It would entail having                    an on or off switch on each char, and then when the person loots                    and it says what the items are it also rolls and displays that                    and when said person loots the items they are instead transferred                    to the winner. You'd of course only have it on when camping                    things that will drop at least something, like say the ancient                    gator who seems to always drop gator arms or legs.                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">An interesting idea, but there are a great                  many variables that would be hard to overcome. There could be                  times when the person who won the auto-roll wouldn't want or need                  the item that was rolled for. This could present a problem when                  the item is no-drop. In addition, I can see cases as well where                  someone already has the item. There's also cases where several                  groups are involved taking down the same critter, and roll among                  12 or 15 people.                 <p>I think that printing the loot message to the group will give                    everyone the information they need.                 <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948326497,833,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Kunark            Factions?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 4:01 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Marcia sent in this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>I thought this was pretty interesting....<BR>                 <BR>                 During a mission to kill a Froglok Headhunter in Misthy Thicket                  for the Avenger Battle Axe quest, I discovered something interesting.

Let's                  say that it takes 500 blue kills to make your next level, then                  it might take a thousand green kills to do the same.

Obviously, if they don't group they aren't going                  to get the good loot, but at least this gives them something to                  do when they log on for an hour to play before bed. This way even                  though you would hardly gain any xp, you would at least gain something,                  and you would feel that your time was spent doing something useful                  for your character.

From her vantage point                  far above, the scout took in the lay of the land, committing the                  details to memory. She was half elven and half human, wearing                  rough leather armor and leaning on a staff that bore her slight                  weight with ease. It was pitch dark, but her eyes were able to                  see.<BR>                 <BR>                 She was one of the few entrusted with the plans, with the knowledge                  of what was to come, what would happen in a scarce fortnight,                  following the Festival of Life in Freeport. This landscape, so                  rich in beauty and with teeming life, would soon be a place of                  death, soaked in the blood of the dark ones as they fell under                  an lethal ambush. From here, the army of light would then march                  into Nektulos and then Neriak and collapse the underground city                  in upon itself. It was appropriate, she mused. Evil always consumed                  itself, and thus Neriak would perish in a fitting way.<BR>                 <BR>                 As she took to the path and began jogging down the side of the                  mountain into the mist, she briefly felt remorse at the imminent                  loss of the dark elven race from the face of Norrath, but it was                  quickly replaced with her anger at the loss of two of her siblings                  at the hands of her dark cousins. Nay, she thought, the evil must                  be washed away, and this time none shall stop us.<BR>                 <BR>                 The scout disappeared into the mist.<BR>                 <BR>                 We are proud to announce "The War of the Secret Fire", a massive                  conflict on Rallos Zek to take place in the commonlands area on                  January 29th, beginning at 3pm PST. This war is being sponsored                  by many strong guilds, among them Antonica's Divine, Black Tear,                  The Blackthorne Alliance, Blood Coven, The Elven Guard, Eye of                  the Serpent, Lordknights, Lords of Law, and Tunare's Justice.<BR>                 <BR>                 The stage for the war is an assault on the Dark Elven race in                  an effort to destroy them and thus make Freeport a safe city once                  more. The attack follows the Festival of Life, happening the night                  before in the city of Freeport.

This site offers various articles                  that discuss topics related to guild creation, management, recruiting                  and prosperity (amongst many other things). With over three years                  of guild management experience, I can honestly say that this site                  will be invaluable for not only guild leaders, but for prospective                  guild members as well. Some of the articles deal with building                  a new guild/community, advertising, setting core policies, managing                  members, attracting new members, and more. In all cases, the Lost                  Order of Akalabeth (my guild) was used as the model for each article.                  As we grew and expanded, various situations came up and needed                  to be dealt with. During this time, I wrote articles based on                  my experience in each situation. The results were achieved by                  the combined efforts of many leaders within the LOA organization.                  I hope that everyone who reads this will give our site a chance...                  and peruse our articles and suggested guild resources. The information                  you will find may have been written with a certain game in mind                  (UO, EQ, AC, etc.), however, in many cases the articles DO apply                  for any online multiplayer game, including games like Unreal Tournament,                  Quake III: Arena, Wheel of Time, etc. The articles aren't just                  for 'roleplaying' games, they are for any game that has the possibility                  of attracting a guild/clan environment.If anyone has questions                  about the Guild Resource site, please send your inquiries to:

Recently, when the forums went down, the former admin/moderator/web                  master, Mung, dropped a note on the main page and wished the site                  well. He gave his approval for someone to step in and aid the                  site however possible, up to and including its relocation. Sunmoon,                  of The Rangers Glade web site (also previously hosted on the Soerbaird                  servers) stepped up and volunteered to assist the Shaman community.                  It is due to his efforts that The Shamans Crucible has its new                  home. <BR>                 <BR>                 In addition, Sunmoon went to great lengths to identify willing                  members of the Shaman community to assist in the upkeep and maintenance                  of the new site. This will ensure frequent updates, and prevent                  any possible issues of neglect. Additionally, the departure of                  a single staff member will no longer create the turmoil that was                  recently experienced due to that very issue. We wish Mung well                  wherever he may be. He will always he regarded as the person responsible                  for uniting the Shaman community. While it's not certain where                  he may be, rumors fleet about regarding his location in Norrath.                  Perhaps he will make a triumphant return some day soon. We can                  always hope! :) <BR>                 <BR>                 Therefore, we would like to extend an invitation for all of our                  Shaman brothers and sisters to come home. The walkabout was nice,                  but The Shamans Crucible is now ready, willing, able to welcome                  you home with open arms. </blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948181190,7687,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Monday                  [ January 17 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Fennin            Ro Guild Hall</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Fennin Ro Server News [ 11:39 PM PST              ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote>Allow me to introduce myself for those who do not know                  me all ready, I am Jubal Kinseeker, Guildmaster of the Sterling                  Order of Knights. I have recently set up the Fennin Ro Guild Index                  in an effort to bring the guilds of Fennin Ro closer. I have taken                  the next step.                  <p>The Fennin Ro Guild Index will now be known as the Fennin Ro                    Guild Hall. I hope that it can be one location where we can                    congregate to discuss our community. I have placed three forums                    in the Guild Hall. The Main Hall will be an open forum for all                    guilds to meet in one place and discuss topics which effect                    us a whole. Bristlebane's Tavern will be primarily focused on                    roleplaying, and the Leadership Forum, which is a replacement                    for Jythri's Leadership Forum on the burned down Soerbaird Forums.                  <p>I hope that with the up and coming changes to Fennin Ro, that                    we can pull together as a community and make decisions for ourselves                    which will benefit all of us.

Please re-read that last part.                 <p>3) Yes, they would get to keep their items, but beyond that                    we don't have enough details to give out yet. We do think it                    would be neccessary to limit it to X number of people (still                    working out how many) so people that would move would have to                    be 100% sure they were willing to go. It would also involve                    completely moving EVERY character a person has on that server,                    not selectively moving 1-2 characters, otherwise there wouldn't                    be much of a point.                 <p>Give us a few days and we will announce all the details, but                    this isn't something that we plan on waiting very long on.                 <p>Also - AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT - we do see other servers                    getting more people on them as well. We're going to be putting                    up 1-2 servers very soon here and we hope this will really help.                    Please keep in mind we want to see how things go on Fennin Ro                    before we make any other plans.                  <p>Regards,<br>                   John Smedley<br>                   President and CEO<br>                   Verant Interactive, Inc.                 <p>-----                 <p>Lifedraw - some interesting points. I'm only going to address                    #1 and #2.. the others I feel have been or are being addressed                    by Brad or Gordon in statements they have made.                 <p>#1 - We are doing this already (We've publicly said 1-2). I                    don't believe it would solve the problem in and of itself however.                 <p>#2 - Interesting idea. We've considered it as well. The problem                    is how do we say "No moving back and forth" given that we aren't                    going to put caps on servers. The idea we are going with insures                    that BEFORE the server launches everyone has already made their                    choice. Your idea has a lot of merit, we just can't close up                    the holes it leaves open.                 <p>Regards,<br>                   John Smedley                 <p>-----                 <p>Hey folks,<br>                   Can you do me a favor and try to keep this topic to just the                    Fennin Ro issue and not so much of an Overcrowding in general.                    I know there are many other factors to consider regarding overcrowding,                    but I'd really like to see a focused thread so I can look for                    other good thoughts on how we may do this. If there are any                    other logical suggestions, we will of course consider them.                 <p>John Smedley                 <p>-----                 <p>No Lifedraw, you aren't wasting my time at all.                 <p>To your point - This is of course sort of a factor, but then                    how can you explain all the newbies that still go to Fennin                    now? I know I don't have all the answers. Actually, the best                    explanation I've heard basically says people go to mature servers                    because the economies are more mature there, so it's cheaper                    to buy things. No idea if this is exactly what's up. It's kind                    of like trying to figure out Traffic Patterns on the freeway.                    After a while it's tough to understand.                 <p>John Smedley                 <p>                 </font></blockquote>               John was busy on this post and there will likely be more, check                out the boards to post your ideas or concerns.               <p>-Alethal<br>                 EQ Stratics                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948074993,2530,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Guides            are your friends!</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 6:09 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>Just a small news story here               <p>I dealt with many of the GM's on my server this weekend (/e waves)                  and would just like to comment to all the other EQ players they                  are there to help you and will do what they can, to do this.

As of the next patch, Paladins                  and SKs will receive additional hitpoints, and increased caps                  on bash and taunt. The additional hitpoints will be noticeable                  for Paladins and SKs over level 25. This was done because the                  Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the same HP base, which was incorrect.                  This change will basically put Paladin and SK HPs midway between                  rangers and warriors of the same race.                  <p>The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular,                    Paladins could not taunt opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues,                    and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though the Paladin                    and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt,                    this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should                    help them fulfill their role as a tank.                  <p>Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't switching                    to two handed weapons, choosing instead of using the bash skill.                    Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most                    part, do not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which                    uses the same skill. Paladins are typically the only characters                    who use a shield throughout their lives.                  <p>The problem of an AC disparity between Paladins/SKs and rangers                    still exists due to the ranger class-specific armor typically                    having an AC that is too high. We'll be further examining the                    AC disparity over the coming weeks, and will address it with                    items.                  <p>Additionally, the need for Paladin/SK 1H weapons above that                    of the Ghoulbane has been brought to the attention of our Live                    team (the item/quest people). Quite frankly, if you are still                    wielding a GB in the high 40s, you aren't doing the damage you                    should be doing. However it's apparent that Paladins (and the                    smaller SKs) prefer to retain their bash.                  <p>Also, the Armor of Ro should be more obtainable after the next                    patch. The class-specific mid-level armor in general is still                    being analyzed and will improve over the next few patches.                  <p>Finally, Fear will drop more items. I was able to obtain several                    pieces for each class upon testing it last night.                  <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem948049990,1252,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Brell            Serilis Event</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Brell Serilis Server News [ 11:13 AM              PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Michael sent in this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>A Glorious day for Dwarven Paladins is come on Saturday,                  22 January at 6pm EST, as two of the most prominent Paladins on                  the server are wed.

Please take the time to create a newbie                  and join in on the festivities if you desire to attend but are                  perhaps not so well liked in Kaladim. ;-)</blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947947630,7147,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Saturday                  [ January 15 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Positions            Available on Sov Stratics</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Stratics Network Announcement [ 6:47              AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:frostbyghte@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Frostbyghte</a></font>             <div>

Recently, I stopped by the Miller farm and had a chat                  with Furball Miller, who informed me of some strange goings-on                  in South Karana. A new clan of gnolls has invaded, and they are                  evil through and through!<BR>                 <BR>                 Not too long ago, they raided and conquered the Splitpaw clan                  of gnolls there, they took the Splitpaw home for themselves, and                  imprisoned or just slaughtered their Splitpaw cousins.<BR>                 <BR>                 Later I brought this matter before Heartwood Master, and though                  Kelethin is far from South Karana, he agrees that if given the                  chance these new gnolls could be a greater threat to Norrath than                  some may imagine. We ordered a Scout of Tunare to explore the                  old lair of the Splitpaw, a young elf who was adept at hiding                  and sneaking and exploring, and after two weeks she had yet to                  return, and we feared the worst.<BR>                 <BR>                 I took it upon myself to travel there with a few friends to look                  for this lost scout, and did find her.. hanging from a noose just                  inside the cave. Her body has since been returned to Kelethin                  for proper burial ceremonies and Heartwood Master has ordered                  me, the General of Tunare, to cleanse the land of this new threat.<BR>                 <BR>                 And thus, the call goes out to all able bodied adventurers, to                  join orassist the Soldiers of Tunare as we raid the Conquered                  Lair of the Splitpaw! <BR>                 <BR>                 Date and Time:<BR>                 <BR>                 This event is to be held Saturday, January 22nd, at 8 PM EST,                  on the Tarew Marr server. All interested parties will meet on                  the stone bridge in South Karana, and from here we will march                  on to the lair no later than 9 PM. The lair can be found STRAIGHT                  south from the bridge.<BR>                 <BR>                 Dungeon Information:<BR>                 <BR>                 This event is geared toward players with levels in the high 20's,                  on up to 50. The new gnolls in Paw have levels that range from                  around 30 to around 40, the deeper in you go, the tougher they                  get. Think of it as inhabited by gnolls as tough as cyclopses                  and giants, with a bunch of casters too, and a couple of tough,                  poisonous snakes (It's kinda like the temple of Cazic Thule in                  toughness, and train-ness).<BR>                 <BR>                 All loot in Paw, except the Robe of Ishva and (I was told it drops                  here) Summon Corpse spell scroll is random. You could, for example,                  kill a gnoll right out front and get a nice new set of those Splitpaw                  gloves, or you could be very deep inside and still get the gloves                  on something. This is sort of a nice change, since you don't have                  to go to 1 set spot and "camp" a special monster, you're free                  to explore and still have just as good of a chance of getting                  the good loot as you would if you sat around. <BR>                 <BR>                 Offhand, I can't remember the names of all the gnoll classes in                  there now. I do know that the weaker white furred-gnolls tend                  to be rogues, and will be happy to backstab you for around 150.                  The tan-furred gnolls are the tougher ones. Tesch gnolls are warriors,                  all the rest are casters (I think Nesch or something is a cleric,                  Rosch is an enchanter or magician), there are a lot of different                  types of gnolls with names that change as they get tougher. But                  no matter how tough they are, the will ALWAYS run away when the                  fight isn't in their favor anymore. Trains get VERY bad if you're                  careless there, somake sure you snare or root every gnoll you                  are fighting when they're around half dead, and keep them snared                  or rooted. If they run, the WILL come back with a lot of friends                  (and these trains can, and have, easily slaughtered full 40+ groups)<BR>                 <BR>                 I've been told the robe and summon corpse spell drop on a gnoll                  that spawns every 12 hours. If we happen to get him once that'll                  be great, but don't expect to be able to stay there and camp the                  place, cuz he won't come back :) Also, my group has explored the                  place a lot, we've found the spawn spot of 2 different "named"                  gnolls, killed them both once or twice, and every time they had                  nothing but pocket change. So in other words, this place is pretty                  much camp-free.<BR>                 <BR>                 Don't come if you just want loot, you're not gonna get much. But                  DO come if you want to have a lot of fun, and do something besides                  sit around bored in Sol B or Lower Guk and argue over camp spots.<BR>                 <BR>                 For more information, keep checking the Tarew Marr Community Center                  at <a href="http://members.home.com/tarewmarr">http://members.home.com/tarewmarr</a>                  If you'd like to see a map of the area before you go, Everlore                  has a nice one at <a href="http://www.everlore.com/geography/default.asp?mapID=1509">http://www.everlore.com/geography/default.asp?mapID=1509</a></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947866551,568,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Xegony            ICQ Activelist</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Xegony Server News [ 8:15 AM PST ] -              <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Drelmo sent in this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>I am Drelmo Tolfara.

Not joking about the "just" part of my statment.               <p>               <blockquote><font color="a00000">Hello all,<br>                 I've been trying to get on these boards all day and haven't had                  any success until now. The upshot of this all is that I did get                  to read all of the hate mail that arrived in my box, and spend                  a good portion of the day picking the brains of the various game                  designers, programmers, producers, and what have you in our shop.                 <p>Let me clarify: Tanks.                  <p>I've seen people using the term "Tank" interchangeably for                    "damage dealer" and "damage taker" as it pertains to the melee                    classes. I made the mistake of doing that as well, hence my                    statement about rangers being better "tanks". In addition to                    much of the hate mail I've received, several people here in                    the studio came up and told me I was mistaken about the whole                    thing.                  <p>So this brought up the question... Ok, so if paladins and sk's                    are supposed to be better "tanks" than rangers, why do they                    have roughly the same hitpoints and similar AC?                  <p>Well the truth is, rangers are right where they should be in                    terms of damage output, however aren't as susceptible to damage                    as they should be. Sure, a ranger should be hard to hit, being                    the lightweight agile fighter that they are, however when they                    do get hit, it should hurt them more than it does. Ask monks                    and rogues, who are meant to be more vulnerable than rangers,                    but still.                 <p>Now I know I&#8217;ve seen someone say, &#8220;You can improve                    my class by decreasing the effectiveness of another&#8221;,                    so I&#8217;m guessing that nerfing rangers wouldn&#8217;t be                    well received. So the question is, how do we &#8220;solve&#8221;                    this issue without &#8220;nerfing&#8221; and without encroaching                    on the warrior&#8217;s territory? After all, we can&#8217;t                    go around bumping all the other classes up every time we see                    a problem with one. That was the question before a subset of                    the tuning team today. Some of it can be done through items,                    some of it can&#8217;t.                  <p>We&#8217;ll be making a couple of changes to the test server                    over the next couple of days to test some things out.

In fear you can't                  event break the zone unless you have some people willing to take                  deaths.                  <p><font color="a00000">The planes are meant to be very very difficult.                    I believe Smed said something like,"People die in dungeons.                    People die hard in the planes", back when fear was opened. He                    wasn't kidding. If you go to the planes, and someone doesn't                    die, there's something wrong. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>That isn&#8217;t the worst problem.                    There is no incentive for classes that have gear in hate to                    even attempt fear. Meaning clerics, magicians, enchanters ect                    steer clear of fear making it incredibly hard to break!                  <p><font color="a00000">Perhaps they want the help of people who                    don't have gear in hate? </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>I think that there should be equal                    amounts of each classes gear in all the planes, making it equally                    attractive for any class to attempt a breakin!                  <p><font color="a00000">Hmmm, maybe. I'll bring it up at the next                    tuning meeting.

In PoH                    its triple that or more!                  <p><font color="a00000">Fear and Hate should be dropping pretty                    much equally now. If it's not, then there might be something                    wrong. Has anyone tried since the patch where we announced that                    armor drops had been enhanced in the planes? </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>On Tarew Marr yesterday we attempted                    fear, around 30 of us zoned in, all went linkdead and died.                  <p><font color="a00000">We put some code in to stop this too.                    Are you sure this happened yesterday? This is the first mass-LD                    report I've heard since we made that patch. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>After a few hours of attempting                    breaking in naked the gms depopulated the zone, which allowed                    us to get our corpses, but meant we couldnt try another fear                    raid for another 16 hours until the zone repopulated!                  <p>                 <font color="a00000">There's no way for a GM to depop a zone other                  than to go around and /kill everything, or down the zone and bring                  it back up. In either case, they would have repopped the zone                  after everyone exited. I'm a bit skeptical about this, so I'm                  having the logs checked. GMs generally aren't supposed to interfere                  with the operations of the planes, however they would have if                  we had a problem on our side.                  <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947729325,323,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>AllaKhazam's            Magical Realm </b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 6:08 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote>AllaKhazam's Magical Realm is pleased to announce thatthe                  new domain of <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a>                  isnow active and the message boards are back up andfunctional.

Yourobjective                  will be to get from the Orc Lift (closest to Crushbone) to the                  Newbie Lift (1st lift as you approach Kelethin along the path)                  using the high pathways in the tree tops.

After all of the items have been                  awarded,ALL names will go back into the hat for a percentage of                  the raffle money and maybe something a little extra. The ticket                  prices are as follows: One gold per level, i.e. Level 1 would                  pay 1 gold for a ticket while a level 10 would pay 10 gold.<BR>                 <BR>                 I would like to add that *severely* twinked characters will not                  beallowed to participate for prizes.

                        OOC: The Avatars of Anarchy is (hopefully) going to evolve 
                        into alarger-scale roleplay involving some other RP groups 
                        on the Rodcet Nife server of EverQuest. Roleplaying will 
                        be one of the driving factors, though there will be normal 
                        grouping and the like which you find in any normal guild. 
                        There won't be any rushes for power or PoF raids. In fact, 
                        the leader char is a brand new wiz which I just started. 
                        We're just going to be out to enrich the game with roleplaying 
                        and most of all to have some fun. :-) Anyways, if anyone's 
                        interested, just drop me a line at <A HREF=mailto:espionage@nomegustaelsol.com>espionage@nomegustaelsol.com</a>

I&#8217;m sure every class out there can                    come up with 10 or 20 things they would like changed about their                    class. Hey, we can too. But the question is, why? What is it                    that SKs and Paladin&#8217;s can&#8217;t do that they should                    be able to? Most of their combat caps are the same as warriors.                    They are every bit as good with a sword as a warrior. They aren&#8217;t                    going to get Dual Wield, nor the hitpoints of a warrior, however                    they do get spells. If the spells that you get aren&#8217;t                    worth what you lose by virtue of hitpoints and a few combat                    skills, then you can choose not to play a Paladin or an SK.                  <p>Yes, I&#8217;m sure that everyone would be happy if we went                    and made these changes above, for about 2 weeks until warriors                    and rogues figure that they are getting the raw end of the deal.

I am sure you know of my Everquest                  information site. Because I want toput it on a better, faster                  server and to gain more control over some of the things I wish                  to do there, I have decided to move the site from Gamestats and                  on to my own server. It was my intention to make the move official                  early next week, but Gamestats, who hosted my site, got a hold                  of my domain name transfer and decided instead to take my site                  down and transfer people logging onto the site to another eq site.                  Thus those who try my old domain will instead find themselves                  at maximumeq. The domain has not yet transferred, but it will                  be <A HREF=http://216.155.25.102>http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a>                  when it gets transferred, hopefully early next week. In the meantime,                  you can go to <A HREF=http://216.155.25.102>http://216.155.25.102</a>                  to get onto the site.

Well known on Vallon Zek for breaking the "Race War" guidelines                  by guilding all races/classes has proven that a dragon can be                  beaten with all classes/races as it is on all other servers. Together                  with a guild "Lords of Hosts" they slayed the beast for the first                  time on the server. In attempt to move to slay Vox for the first                  time they were halted when a few guilds who do not believe in                  this kind of racial tolerance showed up and prevented them from                  trying.                <p>I hope to report of a Team Only slaying in the future.               <p>-Alethal Injection<br>                 EQ Stratics                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947474182,1097,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>New            Poll: What Type Of Character Do You Play?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:16 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:thomlen@stratics.com ?subject=EQNews">Thomlen</a></font>             <div> Sunday night, time to update that great poll.

He was kind enough                  to reply with a very well thought-out response, which is below                  in it's entirety.<BR>                 <BR>                 -Gordon</font><BR>                 <BR>                 -----SNIP-----<BR>                 I've noticed that since retail release the Bard seems to be often                  forgotten when it comes to testing out patches. Things like the                  accidental Selo's nerf (caused by the mem hacking), the Consonant                  Chain debacle (Sow'ed creatures could not be chained), and the                  most recent levitate bug are very obvious to someone who plays                  a bard. All of these unintended nerfs could have been avoided                  with less then 5 mins of play testing these changes on a bard.                  So the question here is beyond compiling the code what kind of                  play testing of changes to the magic system takes place? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 We have a solid internal testing department. The problem is, due                  to the sheer scale of EQ, changes can slip through the cracks.                  We try to fix the ones we miss as soon as we find/hear about them                  &#8211; but in a dynamic world, strange things can happen. <BR>                 <BR>                 You should see some of the bugs we catch that never make it live                  &#8211; or even to test. <BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Kelin's Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out                  vs. a level one human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time,                  using the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141.                  Every round I got the 'so and so head nods' message and every                  nearly every round the test subject was able to attack me (about                  1 in 10 rounds he would not). <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 As most high level enchanters from Beta+ can tell you, there are                  two saving throws that happen with an &#8220;Enthrall&#8221; style                  effect (such as Kelin&#8217;s Lucid Lullaby) hits a creature.                  The first saving throw is against the target&#8217;s Magic Resistance.                  The second saving throw only happens with high level monsters                  &#8211; they get a secondary save based on their level. The reason                  for this is that the Enthrall effect is very, very powerful &#8211;                  it allows a single player to remove a creature from combat. This                  means that a party that could handle two &#8220;X&#8221; level                  mobs might be able to take three, or even four of them on if there                  is somebody around with the Enthrall effect.<BR>                 <BR>                 Because of this (read game balance) higher level monsters have                  a harder time being enthralled. At lower levels, a single player                  can take out a single opponent of equal level. By mid levels this                  is much harder, and by high levels it is virtually impossible.                  Allowing a single player to remove one or more creatures from                  combat at high levels is sick level powerful &#8211; to the point                  that we designed an entire classes specialty around doing it.<BR>                 <BR>                 The second saving throw does not send a message the environment                  &#8211; and that is something that is on our list of issues to                  address. There are, however, no bugs with the Song.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Alenia's Disenchanting Melody, It does now work (9 months                  after release), but it strips good as well as bad spells from                  the party, making the song worse then useless. Is this the intended                  effect? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 Alenia&#8217;s Disenchanting Melody works as it was intended to                  &#8211; it follows the design that we had for it from the beginning.                  It is particularly useful? Depends if your buddy is dying from                  a nasty DoT. People use Egg Shaped Pumice on themselves all the                  time on the PvP servers. Is the Disenchanting Melody as generally                  useful as Cancel Magic? Not really.</font><BR>                 <BR>                 Angstlich's Appalling Screech, When used against very large creatures                  (Giants, Mammoths, Elephants, etc..) You have to be standing directly                  under or in some cases IN the NPC Avatar for the song to take                  effect. Otherwise the creature will glow, but no message or effect                  will be seen. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 Heh. This is due to how the models are built &#8211; each has                  a &#8220;center&#8221; point, which is what calculates where our                  servers think the monster actually is. Really big creatures have                  center points farther away from you &#8211; hidden deep within                  their polygonal body mass. I will bump the radius of the Screech                  up a bit on the next spell patch and we can see if it works a                  bit better. Part of the problem is that when I play my Bard, I                  know exactly how these things work &#8211; and exactly where to                  stand. Sometimes knowing a bit too much about something works                  against you.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Solon's Song of the Sirens, Often times when using this                  in a group situation the newly charmed pet will agro on a party                  member. This could cause a nasty way to get around the PvP switch                  as the pet is immune to PC attack. The pet needs to ignore any                  player characters or pets on its hate list when charmed. Also                  sometimes player pets (party & non-party member pets) will attack                  the Bard charming a NPC if the pet had been attacking the NPC.<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 I&#8217;ve had the pet agro on party members too &#8211; but it                  is usually because one of my party members did something to the                  pet that it didn&#8217;t like just after I charmed it &#8211;                  whacking it, for example. I usually have my pet commands hotkeyed,                  and retarget to something I want my new pet to be attacking as                  soon as I charm it.<BR>                 <BR>                 Charm can be dangerous because once you take control of a monster,                  all of its actions reflect on you. If you charm a monster that                  is fighting your friend&#8217;s pet, and the pet hits the monster                  after you charm it, your charmed monster will attack back. When                  that little fight gets broken up, there is a possibility that                  your friend&#8217;s pet will come after you &#8211; you were,                  after all, the controller of the thing it was just fighting. Charming                  around pets can be done &#8211; you just need to be a little more                  careful.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Crission's Pixie Chase, This song seems to suffer from                  the same problem that Lullaby does, you get the message that the                  song has taken effect, but the target completely ignores the fact                  that it should be mesmerized (similarto the problem with Lucid                  Lullaby).<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 See above.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Fufil's Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The                  percussion aspect of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces                  no additional effect (damage or resistance debuff). <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 Hmm &#8211; don&#8217;t use that one much.

I can understand                  that it would weaken fire based damage shields, but why would                  it weaken thistle based damage shields? I have not had a chance                  to see if it stacks with the necro damage shield (which I believe                  is cold based). <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 The Psalm&#8217;s Damage Shield will stack with the Druid and                  Ranger personal Damage Shields &#8211; but they will not stack                  with other damage shields &#8211; in the same way that no other                  Damage Shield stacks with another. You can not, for example, stack                  Shield of Spikes and Shield of Fire.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Denon's Dissension, The instrument portion of this song                  seems to be broken. In tests I have run using a horn made no difference                  in mana drain in PvP combat. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 This was a very tough song to balance. It takes away mana from                  other casters &#8211; the virtual lifeblood of 7 of EverQuest&#8217;s                  14 classes. The amount taken away is nice, but not great. Using                  a Horn increases the amount of mana drained. Again, nice, but                  not great.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>McVaxius Berserker Crescendo, I do not have this song yet,                  but other bards have informed me using a horn only increases the                  song's Strength effect, leaving the attack speed unchanged. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 The way our song system works, if an instrument effects a song,                  it effects the entire song. Without specifically hardcoding it,                  I couldn&#8217;t actually make the Crescendo only effect the AC                  and STR but not the Attack Speed. As I didn&#8217;t hardcode it,                  the Horn should increase the attack speed along with the Strength                  and AC. <BR>                 <BR>                 Speaking of which, unless my memory serves me wrong (which it                  could), you *must* use a Horn to use this song.<BR>                 <BR>                 As a completely side note, I saw on a certain website that this                  song increases attack speed by 15 percent. It actually does considerably                  more then that. I stand by an earlier comment that I still haven&#8217;t                  seen an exceptional spell analysis program yet.<BR>                 <BR>                 </font>Verses of Victory, Many of the higher level bards I have                  spoken with are very upset by the recent downgrading of the attack                  speed component, is there any chance this can be restored to previous                  levels? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>***GZ SAYS***<BR>                 Nothing has changed on Verses of Victory since I put the song                  in.

I have a few specific comments:<BR>                 <BR>                 They currently have some skills that have no use in game, and                  for which no use is planned in the near future. I'd like to see                  some compensation for this in the form of redefining their class                  slightly. I'll bring up a few things in the next tuning meeting,                  but I'm not prepared to comment on that at this time.<BR>                 <BR>                 The comments about rogues "sucking" in combat damage are grossly                  exaggerated. Strangely enough, this isn't the rogue&#8217;s fault.                  There seem to be more non-rogues complaining about rogues than                  there are rogues. A properly played rogue is very deadly. In fact,                  out of the first 3 characters to 50 when the game went live, 2                  were rogues on the same server who grouped together. They played                  Ping-Pong backstab with everything they fought and were lethal.<BR>                 <BR>                 I hear there are a few items that are usable by rogues, but it                  seems that the gnomes were forgotten. Please compile a list of                  these items on the board here, and I&#8217;ll get them fixed.                  As a note, the Mask of Deception will be usable by gnome rogues                  on the next patch.<BR>                 <BR>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947344343,5408,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EverQuest            Wins Game Of The Year At GameSpot!</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:12 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Gordon informed us that Everquest won the award of Game of the                Year at GameSpot!

As we would like everyone to understand hy                  we feel this change is necessary, our Lead AI Programmer was kind                  enough to sumarize our position:                 <p>Problem:<br>                   Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances,                    providing offensive tactics that are abusive. For this ability                    to remain balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as                    invisibility. Offensive tactics used by other classes involve                    the creature getting a saving throw verses the effect. Since                    creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign death (as you                    cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once                    you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer                    himself. As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning                    it against another NPC,which could be part of the same spawn,                    it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any                    other class could. This situation is well beyond what would                    preserve game balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty                    Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for example).                 <p>Example:<br>                   While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death                    tactic is abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul                    Lord room of Lower Guk. The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards                    and the Ghoul Lord himself. Using the current system, a level                    50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk to himself.                    The Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead.                    To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms                    the other. When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns. The Lord                    then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable                    damage during the fight. The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul                    Lord returns to itsspawn point. When the necromancer gets back                    up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign                    Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again.                    The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed. When the Necromancer                    gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full                    mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, and the necro collects his                    special items.                 <p>Solution:<br>                   Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned                    pets suicide and the charmed ones break Charm. We do not want,                    however, to adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such                    a large degree. What we do recognize is the need to prevent                    higher level Necros from exploiting key spawn points. Hence,                    when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break                    Charm. However, summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected. Whilethis                    still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned                    pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns                    to the degree that charming an NPC does.                 <p>This change will be live on the Test Server when it comes back                    up. Baring any problems, and assuming that we have not missed                    anything, these changes should go live in the next patch. Please                    feel free to comment on our new solution further. We'll review                    your opinions again before making the final decision to implement                    it on the live servers.                 <p>-Gordon                 <p>                 </font></blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947123713,936,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Blade            of Enric Trade and Language Bazaar</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Brell Serilis Server News [ 5:55 PM PST              ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <blockquote>                 <p>From: Kaldaria<br>                   Subject: Blade of Enric Trade and Language Bazaar, Brell Serilis                  <p>The Blade of Enric will be holding a Trade and Language Bazaar                    on Saturday the 8th of January from 1:00pm-4:00pm PST (4:00pm-7:00pm                    EST), in the East Commonlands, at the tunnel to North Ro.

Only recently have the numbers                  on the teams servers been increasing, and this may have been due                  to people just looking for a lower server population. <BR>                 <BR>                 I've played PvP since the day the Baby Zek's opened, and really                  enjoy it.<BR>                 <BR>                 Here's a few interesting ideas I've seen:<BR>                 <BR>                 1. Experience loss on all deaths. Pro: Would give naked mage/monks                  something to lose. Would open some strategies that are currently                  illegal (e.g. Snare the kiting druid). Con: Raises some harassment                  issues with zone/bindpoint camping.<BR>                 <BR>                 2. Binding in city-only for all classes. Pro: Should cut down                  on bind-rushing. Con: Might upset casters a bit.<BR>                 <BR>                 3. "Sick and Tired". Make people come back from death with the                  "Ressurection effect". Roughly 50% hitpoints and zero mana. Pro:                  Should eliminate the remainder of bind-rushing. Con: Would be                  a pain for people who are fighting PvE at the time.<BR>                 <BR>                 4. Changing loot to coin-only. Pro: Should make melee classes                  feel more at ease. Con: Could make it very difficult for people                  to obtain items from unfriendly areas. <BR>                 <BR>                 5. Changeing loot to any item, in bag or otherwise. Though I still                  think the casters come out on top of this one, I believe there                  is a pretty large technology hurdle that has to be overcome for                  this to be possible.<BR>                 <BR>                 6. /CON. Making so that anyone above the level limit cons RED,                  anyone below cons GREEN, and anyone in it cons WHITE/BLACK.<BR>                 <BR>                 I'll be reading the posts on this board and will comment as I                  can. Right now we are just on a fact finding mission to determine                  where people want to go. After we've beaten everything to death                  for a while I'll make a hotlist and take it to the developers.                  <BR>                 <BR>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947092874,372,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Root            Cap?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 9:21 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> <A HREF=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/012321.html>lerash</a>                ranted on the <A HREF=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true>Official                Everquest Forum</a> about his character's problems not being able                to root:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Because of u or one of u (not sure).

Yes, everyone,                  he did respond... after it hit 200 responses (mostly Bumps). So                  it appears that we have always picked our loot from the 'common'                  pool, despite Brad's previous statement a few months ago (which                  he eventually corrected). No problem, I can handle that... now                  that we finally have the facts.<BR>                 <BR>                 Abashi, clearly this is not a group (or game) friendly skill.                  So, per your request, I am going to list my suggestions for improvements.                  Of course, these are only my opinions, and additions/alternates                  are welcome; flames are not... friends, please ignore them, leave                  the Taunting to the Warriors in-game. <BR>                 <BR>                 I doubt we will ever get the 'separate' pool option - clearly                  the economy in-game cannot handle the extra loot (at least as                  far as the developers are concerned it seems). Since the loot                  must come from the same pool, the best 'group-friendly' option                  I can think of is to include it in the '/autosplit' when grouped.                  For higher level groups (20+) who more commonly use the 2pp method                  (loot until you acquire 2pp in cash and/or items - an honor loot),                  Autosplit is off and so would not be affected; it would all depend                  on the honesty of the player.<BR>                 <BR>                 That would cover the cash, but not the items. However, since items                  are much less likely to be 'picked' (worn/wielded items should                  very rarely if ever be picked in my opinion), then that should                  be considered a bonus for the Rogue... high skill, high profits.                  I do believe that Magic items should be included, but extremely                  rare - even more so if wielded or worn by the NPC. But No Drop                  items - especially Class/Race specific - make no sense if the                  Rogue can loot an item s/he cannot use; it would be rather senseless                  to pick pocket a No Drop item for a Cleric, and not be able to                  give it to the Cleric in the Group. Perhaps a No Trade key (in                  addition to No Drop/Lore/Magic)? An issue for further discussion                  I'd say. Comments?<BR>                 <BR>                 Abashi, there are additional Rogue skill issues, which I hope                  you are aware of, but this one is currently at the top of most                  of our lists. I'll list the other ones I'm aware of, and others                  will surely comment and add to this. I don't expect a response                  to them all - as this is very long - but if you have the opportunity                  I think most of us would appreciate the attention, if not immediately                  then perhaps eventually. Note to the flamers: Yes, there may be                  skill issues with other classes, but that is not what this thread                  is about; stick to the subject at hand, please - the Rogues.<BR>                 <BR>                 Pick Lock: Not enough locks in the game; and apparently we cannot                  pick the locks on items in our inventory, only doors and ground-based                  items. I may be incorrect on that last one, please correct me                  if I'm wrong. More locks would be nice, as long as keys are available                  (via quests/NPCs) for other classes to acquire... but it would                  make us more desirable as group members.<BR>                 <BR>                 Sense Traps: Not enough traps in the game; a few in the high level                  dungeons, but I've heard they don't even cause damage, thus pointless.                  At least it's easy to practice - just like Sense Heading - but                  it's relatively useless. Perhaps a locked/trapped chest could                  be placed in some camps - inside a tent/hut - that spawns loot                  similar to that carried on the NPCs that guard it. Rogues would                  then be rather useful - after the camp is cleared. <BR>                 <BR>                 Disarm Traps: See Sense Traps. Perhaps some chests in the 'easier'                  areas could be locked but not trapped, but in the higher level                  areas - where you would go once you've acquired the skill - traps                  would do more damage, and thus disarming them would be more desirable.<BR>                 <BR>                 Apply Poison: Not having used this skill yet, my opinions are                  based solely on the comments of higher level Rogues I've met.                  I'll allow others to comment here - their opinions would be much                  more informed.<BR>                 <BR>                 Make Poison: See Apply Poison. Sounds like it's as difficult and                  unprofitable as most Trade skills; another can of worms, I won't                  get into that discussion here. <BR>                 <BR>                 Instill Doubt: Again, never used, but I've heard it's as difficult                  to practice as Sense Heading, if not more so. Perhaps some tweaking                  would be in order. Comments from others?<BR>                 <BR>                 Stats: I don't have a real problem here, but some have commented                  that our stats are a bit low for a 'fighter' type class. I don't                  expect to be as buff as a genuine Warrior, or even the Monks or                  'hybrid' classes. However, perhaps we could benefit from our higher                  Agility and Dexterity just like the Monks - in a limited sense                  - by receiving AC and Attack bonuses for carrying less weight                  (Monks take AC hits for carrying over 15 lbs). Maybe we could                  get bonuses in those areas while carrying less than 50% of our                  max unencumbered weight (and/or perhaps non-metallic armor), then                  slowly lose those bonuses as we approach our maximum weight; a                  plus for a minus. Magic armor could reduce or eliminate some negatives.                  Just a thought.<BR>                 <BR>                 My logic there is based partly on the traditional pen-and-paper                  RPGs. Rogues are often Fighter/Thieves - with skills of both -                  but not as good as either; balancing those skills is delicate.                  There are also the Assassins and spell-casting 'thieves' (Nightblades,                  etc), but I don't think we're asking for too many extra skills                  - just more useful/working ones. <BR>                 <BR>                 On that note, here are a few additional skill ideas to counter                  balance our relatively useless skills - assuming those will never                  be fixed. Afterwards I'll link to some of my sources, so those                  who suggested them may get some recognition.<BR>                 <BR>                 Subdue: A skill much like Stun/Bash - essentially it would stun                  an opponent. Perhaps this could only work like Back Stab - from                  behind. Perhaps it could require a Rogue-only item/weapon, or                  at least a Blunt one.<BR>                 <BR>                 Fatal Blow: Possibly dependent on a successful Back Stab (which                  can also be used from any position as a normal extra attack);                  a chance to damage an opponent with a limited DOT (Damage Over                  Time) due to hitting a vital organ, etc.<BR>                 <BR>                 Evade: An ability to outrun/outmaneuver an opponent, in order                  to escape. Similarities to Feign Death, with a chance to clear                  the NPCs aggro list - he loses us, and gives up. Combined with                  Sneak/Hide, this could allow the Rogue to escape a bad fight -                  much like Gate for the spellcasters.<BR>                 <BR>                 Sprint: Faster than run - but not as fast as SoW or Selo's - and                  with greater loss of stamina than running. Another evasion skill.<BR>                 <BR>                 Dirty Fighting: Throwing dirt in their face, tripping them up,                  etc. We are Rogues afterall. Could work like Stun or certain spells.<BR>                 <BR>                 Double Stab: Back Stab with Duel Wield. May be over the top, but                  we'd like that. <BR>                 <BR>                 Climb Walls: Opposite of Safe Fall in a sense. Saves time running                  around the cliffs or up the stairs. <BR>                 <BR>                 Silent Kill: More of an Assassin type skill, but could be another                  limited DOT attack; would perhaps require Hide/Sneak and perhaps                  a Rogue-only item (garrote, etc).<BR>                 <BR>                 Disguise: Ability to disguise oneself as another race/class. Would                  require a 'disguise' kit, components that may be expensive, etc.<BR>                 <BR>                 I know most of these suggestions may be rather difficult to implement,                  if not impossible. However, these are just ideas. More are welcome                  of course. Here's where I acquired most of them, from The Safehouse.<BR>                 <BR>                 Intelligent comments anyone? <BR>                 <BR>                 Thank you for your time.<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>There's some good ideas here.

Mages get four pets to choose from, each                  with unique abilities. This is very conveniant to independance                  in the world, and also lends to being desirable to a group. Now                  I am not saying that Mages are overpowered or underpowered. And                  yes I am jealous that they get pets that look different, and have                  different abilities. Why? It lets the Mage form a personality.                  Why not give this ability to the Necromancer?                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">Though your ideas are certainly well thought                  out, this issue was actually considered a while back. Magicians                  are supposed to be the master summoners. That is why they get                  multiple pet types that can adapt to the situation at hand. As                  I&#8217;m sure you will agree given your note about being jealous,                  class distinction is a commodity, and the ability to summon different                  pets is one commodity owned by the Magician. Not to mention, I                  shudder at the idea of making Necro pets any more powerful.                  <p>There is something that Necro&#8217;s get, that&#8217;s the                    ability to arm their pets.                  <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem947035966,8188,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Twinks            Anonymous</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 5:32 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Enhasa sent in this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Are you a twink? <BR>                 Do you feel you cannot stop twinking? <BR>                 Do you have a problem? <BR>                 Do you want to talk to other twinks such as yourself? <BR>                 <BR>                 Twinks Anonymous can help.

A necromancer can sic their pet (charmed or summoned) upon a critter,                  load on DOT spells, and then cast Feign Death. The pet remains,                  fighting the critter, and the critter ignores the necromancer                  despite all of the damage being done by the DOTs. <BR>                 <BR>                 What *should* happen is that the pet should behave as if the owner                  hid or became invisible.

But something really wierd                  happened this morning that leaves a big question in my mind about                  pets in groups.<BR>                 <BR>                 I was in SolB looking for a group in the pool room. There was                  13 people there including me, two full groups. I was able to get                  to the pool room party and was waiting to be able to join since                  one person was leaving in less than a hour. The party consisted                  of a mage with an air elemental, two rangers, a druid, a paladin,                  and a warrior. I asked if it was ok for me to work on my piercing                  with the group. I do this a lot and most don't mind at all. I                  had a FS dagger in my primary hand and a dragoon dirk in the off                  hand. I wanted to max my piercing so I could use the unicorn shield                  effectively. (Any weapon with an AC component seems like a good                  idea to me) My piercing was around 110 and I needed to max it                  out to 195.<BR>                 <BR>                 Then the wierdness started. I KSed two kobolds somehow! I would                  /assist their puller and wait until they got in a couple of rounds                  before attacking. Somehow the pet was enabling me to put in more                  damage and get the kill for 1/2 bubble total of exp!<BR>                 <BR>                 Don't get me wrong, I can tell very little difference in the exp                  pool when in a group with pets. Almost none at all actually. But                  there seems to be an anomoly that affects group damage with a                  pet in the group. The best I can tell is that the following was                  true in this case:<BR>                 <BR>                 Group damage = PC's damage - pet damage<BR>                 <BR>                 In cases where the pet was hitting a lot and I was also, my single                  damage would outwiegh the group damage.<BR>                 <BR>                 The group kind of laughed about it and didn't really care that                  this happened twice in a hour. Me assisting them just gave them                  less downtime overall and since the only other party was in the                  king room there was plenty of kobolds to pull.<BR>                 <BR>                 Has anyone else seen this happen before? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>I've actually heard a couple reports of something                  alone these lines, about melee types KSing from others.

Does the exp given come from the level 40 (meaning                  the exp changes dependings on their level) or is it based on a                  level 36 person (Average level of group) or is the amount of exp                  given the same no matter what level the party is but that higher                  levels need more exp and thus their bar raises more slowly than                  the level 32? I mean how exactly does this work?<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>We choose not to release any formulae in regard                  to how experience is divided up. That is probably why you haven't                  seen explained "exactly". What I will say is that it is divided                  up in such a way that a group of friends who always play together                  will level at a similar rate.</font><BR>                 <BR>                 My druid could solo up to level 50. I could kill say 6 mobs in                  an hour, or as much as 30-50 in an hour in a group but my druid                  consistently got more exp in a shorter amount of time then in                  a group. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>This can really only be done by kiting. The                  changes to kiting a few months ago should have cut this down a                  bit. Additionally I wouldn't be surprised if you see some additional                  changes in the future to put a check on druid powerleveling. They                  weren't meant to be a solo class.</font><BR>                 <BR>                 A group of 4 levels much slower than a group of 2. Is this not                  supposed to be so or could there be a glitch? If not then how                  could this be based on your example you gave?<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>A group will only level faster if the group                  takes things harder or faster than they could with one less member.                  If you aren't doing that, then you'll level slower, but you'll                  still have less downtime.</font><BR>                 <BR>                 Why exactly were hell levels placed in the game? When I first                  hit the hell level (I was second on my server to do so) I thought                  it a bug and reported it. GM Solist said he couldnt understand                  the hell level and said he'd look into it as well as several senior                  guides but after a while it was considered a game feature. Why                  though? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>It's the way the experience curves work. Unfortunatly,                  going in and fixing it at this point isn't an option. Anyone who                  had gone through a "hell level" would instantly get another level                  or two. <BR>                 <BR>                 Additionally, people who had already fought there way through                  several of them would be cheated out of the work they did.<BR>                 <BR>                 There is one upside to them.

My main character has been a bard for nearly all that                  time who is currently 41st level on the Karana server. Last month                  I launched the <A HREF=http://rgonzalez.net/EQSongs/>EQ Song Analysis</a>                  web site and have been getting lots of good information from my                  fellow bards. From their feedback and my own experience there                  are a few things I would like to ask. <BR>                 <BR>                 I've noticed that since retail release the Bard seems to be often                  forgotten when it comes to testing out patches. Things like the                  accidental Selo's nerf (caused by the mem hacking), the Consonant                  Chain debacle (Sow'ed creatures could not be chained), and the                  most recent levitate bug are very obvious to someone who plays                  a bard. All of these unintended nerfs could have been avoided                  with less then 5 mins of play testing these changes on a bard.                  So the question here is beyond compiling the code what kind of                  play testing of changes to the magic system takes place? <BR>                 <BR>                 Kelin's Lucid Lullaby, I recently tested this song out vs. a level                  one human warrior. My Bard was level 37 at the time, using the                  Lute of the Gypsy Princess and I have charisma of 141. Every round                  I got the 'so and so head nods' message and every nearly every                  round the test subject was able to attack me (about 1 in 10 rounds                  he would not). <BR>                 <BR>                 Alenia's Disenchanting Melody, It does now work (9 months after                  release), but it strips good as well as bad spells from the party,                  making the song worse then useless. Is this the intended effect?                  Angstlich's Appalling Screech, When used against very large creatures                  (Giants, Mammoths, Elephants, etc..) You have to be standing directly                  under or in some cases IN the NPC Avatar for the song to take                  effect. Otherwise the creature will glow, but no message or effect                  will be seen. <BR>                 <BR>                 Solon's Song of the Sirens, Often times when using this in a group                  situation the newly charmed pet will agro on a party member. This                  could cause a nasty way to get around the PvP switch as the pet                  is immune to PC attack. The pet needs to ignore any player characters                  or pets on its hate list when charmed. Also sometimes player pets                  (party & non-party member pets) will attack the the Bard charming                  a NPC if the pet had been attacking the NPC.<BR>                 <BR>                 Crission's Pixie Chase, This song seems to suffer from the same                  problem that Lullaby does, you get the message that the song has                  taken effect, but the target completely ignores the fact that                  it should be mesmerized (similar to the problem with Lucid Lullaby).Fufil's                  Curtailing Chant and the other Chant songs, The percussion aspect                  of these songs is broken. Using a drum produces no additional                  effect (damage or resistance debuff). <BR>                 <BR>                 Psalm of Cooling, The damage shield portion of this song does                  not seem to stack as logic would lead me to believe. I can understand                  that it would weaken fire based damage shields, but why would                  it weaken thistle based damage shields? I have not had a chance                  to see if it stacks with the necro damage shield (which I believe                  is cold based). <BR>                 <BR>                 Denon's Dissension, The instrument portion of this song seems                  to be broken. In tests I have run using a horn made no difference                  in mana drain in PvP combat. <BR>                 <BR>                 McVaxius Berserker Crescendo, I do not have this song yet, but                  other bards have informed me using a horn only increases the song's                  Strength effect, leaving the attack speed unchanged. Verses of                  Victory, Many of the higher level bards I have spoken with are                  very upset by the recent downgrading of the attack speed component,                  is there any chance this can be restored to previous levels? <BR>                 <BR>                 A while back GZ mentioned the meming time for bard songs would                  be decreased, but it still takes forever to mem songs (due to                  the lack of a mediate skill). Can this be looked into? <BR>                 <BR>                 Can a switch be set up (similar to the Fast Destroy option) to                  give players the choice of 1-Always dropping items, 2-Confirm                  to drop, 3-No dropping of items.

This all changed when I hit 29th                  level. The fact that I have failed in 12 attempts to create my                  earth elemental has caused my soloing efforts to become generally                  incredible failures. Water and air pets can't seem to taunt well                  enough to keep things off me so I can cast ans fire elementals                  don't have enough hp's to survive long enough for me to kill things.                  therefore I am, like most classes, forced to the tedious task                  of seeking out a group. <BR>                 <BR>                 Now comes the group seeking part. Most groups will not take me                  because I am a magician. The response I get alot of the time is                  "sorry we are holding out for an enchanter/wizard" I didn't think                  that those two classes could be that much superior to my own class,                  and they aren't when it comes to soloing (although I have personally                  witnessed a 30th level enchanter kill 5 spectres at a time by                  herself) but really I didn't realize how non-group viable us magicians                  really are. lets compare the things that each class lends to a                  group. <BR>                 <BR>                 I am basing my next examples on 30th level character, since that                  is a nice halfway point it seems in this game, and I know about                  it first hand.<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>I saw something pretty interesting when I                  first read this post today. There was a post right above it complaining                  about how powerful magicians are compared to wizards, and how                  groups always want a magician over a wizard.This post talks about                  how groups always want a wizard over a magician. <BR>                 <BR>                 So my question would be, who is right? Well despite the paradox                  of it all, they both are. The fact is that people tend to be more                  sensitive to things concerning their own class, so I'm sure they                  perceive that their class sucks and someone elses class rules.<BR>                 <BR>                 My advice to everyone would be to play what you want to play,                  and quit worrying about what other class might be more powerful.                  Just ask them, your class is better than their class anyway. <BR>                 <BR>                 The groups are there for you to join. How do I know this? Because                  everyone posts how they can't find a group because all the groups                  want someone of a different class than they are. The key in successful                  grouping is to start early. People get attached to people they                  know, because they don't want to die. I've seen many-a-druid powerlevel                  up to 50 only to find that they can't get a group for a dungeon,                  despite the fact that public opinion has them as the "most powerful                  class". <BR>                 <BR>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem946960476,7630,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Monday                  [ January 3 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Gordon            and the Patch Message</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 8:34 PM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>This was found at the <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EverQeust</a>                  Message Boards:               <p>               <blockquote>You are forgetting the fact that Verant DID NOT warn                  us about this nerf.

Recently some kind of bug                  occured with a group i was in, and the whole group crashed, not                  link death, but crashed, making us have to reboot our computers.                  We log back on, all dead. According to the guide there is now                  way to veryify this, thus we are all liars. Thats exactly what                  the guide is saying, we pulled the plug and are liars (i have                  the screen shots to back this up).                  <p>                 <font color="a00000">No, the Guides aren&#8217;t saying that you                  are a liar. We provide the policies that the Guides follow and                  they need to adhere to them. Our (Verant&#8217;s) policies are                  there to insure a fair and even playing field for everyone, by                  not doing reimbursements unless there is irrefutable proof that                  the death or loss was caused by something under our scope of influence.                  The downside of this is that yes, some people who probably should                  be reimbursed aren&#8217;t. Unfortunately, that is the price of                  making the world fair for everyone.                  <p>You might be surprised to hear that the number one infraction                    that causes bannings and suspensions is attempting to defraud                    a GM or Guide, by requesting a reimbursement under false pretenses.                    We have several dozen of these per week, and only suspend or                    ban if we are 100% certain that an attempt to defraud took place.                    We have several dozen more cases where we strongly suspect that                    an attempt to defraud took place, but don&#8217;t have the documentation                    to prove it, so it goes unchecked. Yes, despite the fact that                    we have a reputation for doing reimbursements only when there                    is proof that a claimed incident happened, we are still inundated                    with fraudulent claims. We can only &#8220;weed out&#8221; a                    small percentage of these, and can&#8217;t detect the fraud                    100% of the time.                  <p>We would love to be able to take everyone&#8217;s word for                    everything, thus eliminating the possibility that a deserving                    soul goes unreimbursed, but I fear that item acquisition and                    advancement would become a complete joke, as fraudulent claims                    would be the norm, and the game as a whole would suffer. I&#8217;m                    sorry if I seem a little bit jaded, but in the 14 months that                    I was a Guide, I know I&#8217;ve helped a good number of people.                    In this time I&#8217;ve unfortunately also had to tell a number                    of people &#8220;No&#8221; when I was sure that they deserved                    a reimbursement. It&#8217;s just the price of keeping the world                    fair.                 </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>Second scenerio. Lately servers                    have went down and lost imformation. Players have been reset                    to a few days ago to a certain time or date. Well, in between                    the reset date and the time the server crashed, ALOT has happened.                    Players have started characters, gotten out of "hell levels,"                    and obtained items that seemed to take endless time to get.                    Consequently the gm/verant refuse to do any type of reimbursment                    of items because it was out of their hands. Now lets think about                    this. Once again we pay to play this game. The money we pay                    goes to server maintence and such. Now if our money goes toward                    such items and the server crashes and looses information, why                    shouldnt we be reimbursed.                  <p><font color="a00000">If we had the information concerning what                    items a person got, or what levels they&#8217;ve earned, we                    certainly would do the restoral. But we don&#8217;t have it.                    There is absolutely no way to tell with any certainty what people                    earned or did not earn during the time that was lost due to                    the backup. I&#8217;m very sorry for those who were affected                    badly by the RAID crash, but when you lose two drives in a RAID5                    array, data loss is unavoidable. </font>                 <P><font color="a00000"></font>Whats funny is that if i go to                    a fastfood joint and pay for 3 hamburgers and only get 2, i                    go back and they give me back my 3rd hamburger. They dont tell                    me that well, you cant prove that you had 3 hamburgers or that                    Im trying to scam them. They know im the paying customer and                    the customer is always right.                 <p><font color="a00000">No, they don&#8217;t, but that analogy                    really doesn&#8217;t fit. They aren&#8217;t delivering millions                    of hamburgers every 24 hours with the same 42,000 people in                    their self-service store every night with 2100 of them demanding                    to speak manager at any given time, and where 42 of them are                    just seeing if they can get the manager to whip up a few hundred                    burgers for them so they can sell them down at the local Christine&#8217;s.                    And unfortunately, no, the customer is not always right. What                    is &#8220;right&#8221; is the combined interest of all of the                    paying customers, and their right to enjoy a challenging game.                    The greater majority of these get exactly what they want. Sadly                    a small percentage don&#8217;t. </font>                 <p><font color="a00000"></font>I mean come on, wtf, its a video                    game, give us back oure hard earned items! and soon to make                    all verant employees and guides kos in real life.                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">Ok, put down the keyboard and slowly back                  away.

Are our Guides, GMs, Policies, Game, etc, perfect?                  No, but we try to run the game as fairly as possible. Sometimes                  we make mistakes, and sometimes our policies and treatment of                  an individual can be unfair.
