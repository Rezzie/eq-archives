won't be sorry.'<br>

perhaps I'm simply an eccentric who hopes there is a greater force out there 
that is granting us the use of new magics. Anyway, enough chatter. Tell me where 
you would like to go and I will send you there. I can send you to any of the 
other camps in [Butcherblock], [East Commonlands], [North Ro], or [South Ro]. 
Please be still as I do this.'<br>
