                  <div> <i>The barbarian ducked under the doorway to go into the 
                    tavern that felt just a little too cramped. He grumbled to 
                    himself about having Talos, his High Elf friend, choose Kaladim 
                    as their meeting place. Oh well, better then getting lost 
                    in Faydark I guess, he thought to himself. He took a seat 
                    at an empty table and ordered ale to help ease the wait. 
                    <p> A large dwarf, well just about as large as they come, 
                      after all, it is a dwarf, walked up to him, "Hey there, 
                      me large fellow, you be in my seat. Time fer you to be moving." 
                    <p> "I don't think so little fella, besides how do you plan 
                      on moving me?" 
                    <p> "Listen ya skirt wearing little pimple, my newborn nephew 
                      could kick your puny little arse back to that wretched wasteland 
                      you call a home!" 
                    </i> 
                    <p><i></i> Ok, at this point you have to ask yourself what 
                      did you just see. Well, it looks to me like a pretty heated 
                      interchange between two hotheaded warrior types. Could it 
                      come to blows? Probably not, but that depends on how good 
                      of role-players these two are. What you don't realize is 
                      that the little fella is about 10 levels higher then the 
                      barbarian (I know, I didn't say that up in the text, but 
                      trust me ok!). 
                    <p> With the PvP switch being in place like it is, which I 
                      might add I like more and more as I play, there obviously 
                      isn't going to be an instant brawl unless both of these 
                      people have completed that particular quest. For the time 
                      being, let's assume that they haven't, since that is the 
                      way that the majority of the people play in Norrath. It 
                      has been my experience that to some degree it has limited 
                      role-playing in one way, that being the attacks of rage 
                      or anger. With the switch in place, it makes it hard to 
                      play a hothead for some people, myself included until recently. 
                    <p> Any good role-play knows that at about this time there 
                      is a good brawl coming, and someone is going to get a pounding. 
                      But I have noticed in EverQuest two things that have made 
                      this a little less likely to happen, and let me show them 
                      to you in the way the barbarian who is thinking of starting 
                      the fight will more then likely do them. 
                    <p> 
                    <ol>
                      <li>He is going to target our friend the dwarf, and type 
                        /consider. <font color=red>"What would you like your tombstone 
                        to say?"</font> 
                      <li>Maybe he isn't that much higher then me /who (name). 
                        Wow, 25th level Paladin. Pretty big jump for my 15th level 
                        warrior. 
                    </ol>
                    So in the game, the barbarian just starts a word fight, or 
                    maybe just starts to /ignore our friend the dwarf. Is this 
                    really role-playing? After all, this barbarian serves the 
                    god of war! He knows that he is one tough stud! 
                    <p> Now I realize that we have all spent a lot of time and 
                      energy in getting our characters up to the level that they 
                      are, and we don't really want to have our barbarian to have 
                      to travel all the way back from Halas, after all he does 
                      have an appointment to keep! What I am suggesting is a good 
                      use of the /duel command that Verant Interactive has been 
                      so kind to put into the game. I think that this could be 
                      a great use in role-playing if we allow it to be! Wouldn't 
                      it be fitting for the barbarian to punch, not draw out his 
                      mighty two handed hammer and start to bash the dwarf? After 
                      only a few minutes, it would become painfully obvious to 
                      the barbarian that he is out classed here. 
                    <p> At this point, it would be a good idea for the barbarian 
                      to back down. It would also, in my opinion, and based on 
                      the type of Paladin that the dwarf is playing, be fitting 
                      for the dwarf to heal any wounds that his fists caused on 
                      the barbarian at this time. More then likely, the two will 
                      continue to talk for a little afterwards, and who knows, 
                      they may even meet up again a few weeks later, with the 
                      barbarian being closer to his level, they might even go 
                      as far as actually go out adventuring together and becoming 
                      friends (Remember in grade school, that guy that you fought 
                      at lunch, how next year the two of you were great friends 
                      playing football together). 
                    <p> This little example brings out a few good points if you 
                      ask me. 
                    <p> 
                    <ol>
                      <li>It is not necessary for deadly violence to be the answer 
                        to a dispute. For that matter, would a barbarian and dwarf 
                        really attack each other with weapons inside a town that 
                        frowns very heavily on that sort of thing? 
                      <li>Go ahead and accept that /duel before you find out how 
                        tough they are. Assuming that the situation is being role-played 
                        and it would fit with what you think your character would 
                        do. 
                      <li>Finally, don't be so concerned if you see the statement 
                        of someone running away from a duel. Maybe it was really 
                        completed and they let the other person live. They just 
                        zoned first. If you do this, then it is a start that everyone 
                        else will as well. 
                    </ol>
                    Obviously, this solution will not work all of the time. There 
                    are times when you are running along and someone, lets say 
                    they are playing a bandit, sticks you up and role-plays out 
                    a heist on your butt. I say that if it is a REALLY good job 
                    at role-playing, go ahead and accept it. On the other hand, 
                    there are times where this just isn't appropriate. Here is 
                    an example of something that happened to me last night. 
                    <p> I was playing Juntao, my monk on the test server, and 
                      I had to get over to see my friend and guild leader, Windrunner. 
                      I'm 5th level, he is 13th and a wizard. So he was playing 
                      around in Befallen, a nice little dungeon that is just a 
                      little too hard for a 5th level monk, crazy or not, to go 
                      around in it. Once I zoned into Befallen, I decided to have 
                      a little fun and shout something across the zone to the 
                      effect of, "Windrunner get your sorry ass up here so that 
                      I can kick it all the way back to Qeynos!" Those were not 
                      the exact words, but a fun little jest to a friend in that 
                      same context. A little banter went back and forth, and I 
                      found myself faced with someone running from a greater skeleton 
                      towards the zone. Decided it was a good time to zone as 
                      well, and followed him through. 
                    <p> So now that I am back in West Commons, the guy tries to 
                      duel me! Now I don't even know him, and I asked Windrunner, 
                      he didn't know him either. He was obviously of a much higher 
                      level then me, and while I do not think that is a good reason 
                      to decline a duel, the fact was that he didn't even say 
                      hi to me! He just challenged me to a duel. Also, I was in 
                      the middle of trying to give something to my friend, and 
                      I, as a 5th level character just ran from Qeynos with little 
                      to no help (Thanks Hika & Sobbo). It wouldn't make since 
                      for me to do it at a time like this, let alone with someone 
                      who obviously wasn't role-playing out a situation (really, 
                      I probably shouldn't say obviously, maybe he was mad at 
                      me being arrogant to someone that is much higher in levels 
                      then myself, and didn't feel the need to tell me why he 
                      was attack?). 
                    <p> I guess the bottom line that I am getting at is this, 
                      lets all start to use that /duel option the way it was suppose 
                      to be used, as a tool to role-play with. A way around the 
                      PvP switch that helps keeps the random acts of c0ol d0oDs 
                      from hurting the role-playing experience for the rest of 
                      us. As always, remember this, and I will whisper it incase 
                      it offends anyone.
