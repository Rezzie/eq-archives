Hail Heroes,<p>I wanted to start a call from all tailors.<p>But first: Everytime when we hear the name studded leather armor, we think that it will give more protection than a leather armor. This article will show much more, because there will be explained...<br>a) ... that the name of this armor type isn’t the right one.<br>b) ... that the tailoring skill won‘t be very usefull after LVL 6 (Skill of 35) and that everyone who thought about making reinforced leather should also know that he will have to invest very much time and money. He also will never get the money back he invested.<p>The story: I finally made my first piece of studded armor . And what did I see? It has the same AC as leather armor from the NPC merchant. Is that fair?<p>EQ is a game which builds on interaction. Trading for example. The PCs shoud not always run to the NPC merchant to get better equipment like it is in another popular online game.<br>Now I wondered if the skill tailoring fullfills this sense. At the beginnig it is very funny because patchwork armor is much better then cloth armor, that you get as loot from monsters or from NPC merchants. But if you wanna make studded leather you will lose all liking for tailoring. This will cause interaction loss.<br>One argument is, that it has not more AC than normal leather armor from NPC merchant. The PC don’t need to buy studded leather armor which cost much more.<p>The point of the price:<br>A full set of normal leather armor will cost ca. 20pp. You will get 8 pieces of armor. But there are no leather boots to buy at the merchant. I never see them.<p>A studded leather armor can only be made buy PC Tailors. There are 7 pieces that can be made: gorget, caps, gloves etc. There are patterns for these kind of armor. They cost 6sp 3cp. For 7 pieces it will be a sum of 4gp 4sp 1cp.<br>Then you need medium quality pelts from wolves, cats or bears. If you are lucky you will get them by hunting. Or you pay ca. 3-5gp for each pelt. That will make a sum of 2pp 1gp to 3pp 5gp.<br>And now to the part of this article that is really paradox and that is the cause of this dilemma:<br>If you wanna have a full set of studded leather armor you will need 25 studs. They will cost you ca. 9-10 pp and that make a sum of 22pp 5gp or 25pp.<p>fI you have all the materials you can now begin to make studded armor. If you don’t fail it will cost you all in all 22pp 9gp 2sp 1cp or if you have to buy all the materials 28pp 9gp 4sp 1cp. Nobody will be angry if he have to buy this armor for 30pp, won‘t he?<p>But this question will never be asked!! Nobody will buy such an expensive armor if he can have the same AC for 20 pp!! In my humble opinion the tailoring skill has reach his dead end here. And this is why the tailoring skill will loose his function as interaction promotion. You will have to spend a lot of money to raise your skill above 35, because it is there, when patchwork armor gets trivial. And if you finally make some studded armor you will have nobody who wanna buy it because it is to expensive and has no advantage versus normal leather armor. And you will never get the enjoyment of making reinforced leather armor, because if you finally have the money to make it you don’t need it any more because of magic armor or something else.<p>I am not a powergamer at all!! I only wanna tell you all that the most of us will go the way with less hindrance. That is why everybody will buy a normal leather armor instead of a studded leather armor.<br>I ask you all: Ringmail armor is much better then chainmail armor and cheaper. Why can’t it be for studded armor?<p>I would be happy if this „bug“ will be fixed or you will see that nobody will make reinforced leather in his EQ-life.<p>That was a long story, I know very well but I hope that it will open your eyes. It is good that nobody can sell his „handmade“ stuff to a NPC merchant but if it is impossible to sell it to PCs it has no sense. People, who wanna make reinforced leather will first make studded leather and then destroy it because he cannot sell it. Does it make sense? I don‘t think so.<p>There are possibilites of making feedbacks and bugreports to the GMs and the organisation of EQ. Please help to adjust the skill tailoring. I would be very thankfull if this article will change your mind.<p>Thank you very much for reading,<p>Nadyawin, frustrated Woodelftailor<br>
