Drysart travelled back to Rivervale under the cover of night. His
recent encounter with the dark elf, of whom he still could not remember
a name, and the orc, Lord Garish, left him with a sense of paranoia. He
doubted whether his encounter with Solusek Ro was merely a delusion... the
god spoke in riddles and left lingering thoughts of wonder in the wizard's
tired mind. Even the cold, falling rain, would not cross his mind.<br>
<br>
He quietly wound his way to his room at the Inn and retired for the night,
certain his absence was unnoticed. He saw no one that night upon his
return to the Vale.<br>
<br>
But she saw him. She had been hiding in the shadows, waiting for his
return. Had the deputies seen her, they would have slain her without
hesitation, so she took due caution and kept her distance behind the
wizard, following him from the moment he arrived in Kithicor to the
moment he entered the inn.<br>
<br>
She took note of where he was staying at the inn, scawled in her
native language on a scrap of parchment she carried, she watched him
through the window from a distance until she saw him blow his candle
out, and then she drew back into the shadows, her dark blue skin
camoflaging her as she slipped back out of the Vale. She cursed the
rain as she disappeared into the fog that had set on Kithicor.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
That night, Drysart dreamed. The wizard would never dream, the luxury
being one that had to be given up in his full pursuit of the arts, but
nonetheless, that night for some reason he did...<br>
<br>
He was home... the home he had not seen in many years, the same home he
was forced to abandon with his sister, leaving his parents to uncertain
fates.<br>
<br>
He was not alone. Before him was the familiar dark elf. Between them
was a large crystal sphere... in it, light was bent, giving a view
of his home, upside down.  The dark elf was looking into the sphere.<br>
<br>
Drysart looked at the dark elf, his name now only barely eluding his
grasp. As he tried to speak to the dark one, the image in the sphere
began to alter itself. The image became the home, that night many
seasons past. He saw himself run out the back, pulled by his sister.
His mother and father stood as a dark one... <em>the</em> dark one approached
them. The image shifted.... his parents were no longer there, but
the dark one was holding an ornate jeweled dagger. A ruby embedded
in the dagger closely matched the color of blood on the blade.<br>
<br>
Drysart closed his eyes. He remembered seeing the dark one when he
looked back that night.  His growing anger was tempered by the fact that
he seemed unable to say anything or act on his feelings.<br>
<br>
"Neither was the one I was looking for," the dark elf began. "I
had been told I would find the one there. I believed I had been cheated.
Now... I will get the one I was searching for that night"  A smile
crossed the dark elf's face.<br>
<br>
The image in the crystal altered itself again... this time showing a
time that had not come yet, and the figure of a Wood Elven sister of the
Burning Heart, merrily wandering the Faydark and watching the animals.
Drysart recognized her immediately, but found he had been made unable
to fully realize who she was.  The same force that kept him from speaking
and acting, was also keeping him from completing his thoughts.<br>
<br>
His frustration in his thoughts was quickly disturbed by the sight of
the dark one in the sphere, the dagger with the ruby embedded, approaching
the wood elf quietly from behind.<br>
<br>
"I will get what I want... and I will do what I have to do to get it," the
dark elf said, smiling, "You will get me what I want... and this will
force your hand."<br>
<br>
The image in the crystal sphere followed Drysart back to consciousness. He
awoke in a sweat, unsure of what had just happened, unsure what Solusek Ro
wanted, unsure what the dark elf wanted, but sure that he could
not let it play itself to completion. Sunlight was again beginning to
light the Vale as Drysart left the inn to look for the wood elf he saw
in the sphere.<br>
