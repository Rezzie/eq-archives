CATS!!!<p>  Ok, before I begin my little rant, I would just like to state that this rant is just for fun, to get a laugh and stuff.  It's more along the lines of a story... but this is my story about my life with the 'cat and wolf' population here in EverQuest.<p>  It first began in Everfrost peaks.  I, with a few of my guildmates, was hunting a few wooly calves, some ice bones, mounties and shamans.  Having a BLAST.<p>  Now, I was out luring everything back to the party that was camping out in a corner of the zone.  Now, the snow leapords in the zone all /con green to me... <p>  So I'm safe from these things?  Hell no.  Every single cat that I would either run by, or skirt around would get a whiff of this Paladin in Banded armour (man that stuff must make you sweat terribly) and would want to take a chunk out of me.  So, back to my group I'd go with 3 cats on my tail and a few other things that I was going for in the first place.<p>  It was fun the first several times.... but here's how it got annoying.<p>  Arathros, our guild leader, decided that I had brought back too many cats and green critters...so he'd lure.  He brought back in his first run, 1 mountie and a shaman.  We easily put them down.  Second run - another mountie.  3rd run, an Ice Bone (which I have another story about, haha!) etc.  Don't ask me how he has all the luck.<p>  A mountie spawns right in front of the group while they're camping.  It was blue to me, Ara was out hunting for more pray.... so I shouted INCOMING in /gsay and attacked the mountie.<p>  It was down to 1/4 health and started to run.... I gave chase, the mages with us regained their mana and started blasting it.   Ooops, stumbled into a cat.  It didn't attack me for once...I  was surprised.  No, instead it calls another cat and then comes after me...<p>  No problem...  I kill the mountie, and start attacking the cats.   One is almost dead, and starts to run.  Calls the attention of an orc (wimpy green one) and I end up killing the cat.  So now, I have 1 leapord and 1 orc on my tail.  I start after the orc..... kill it no problem and start on the cat.  (meanwhile, I'm leaving these corpses behind me in a little trail)  The cat's almost dead and starts running...into 2 more cats and a green orc.  Okay, now I'm getting a bit low on health, the cleric in our group starts healing me and attacks some things that are on my tail.  Mages are blasting whatever Ara brings back... we're having fun, no worry 'bout death...<p>  Okay, after a while I've killed the 2 cats and go after the orc that is now running.  Chasing...chasing...oh, look another cat.... doesn't pay attention to me .... running, chasing down the orc (with a 2h sword, it's not that easy) .... kill it, whew.  Umm, I look around.... 3 more cats on the horizon.... aww MAN.  Yep, they attack... killed them no problem... now, here I am, low on health and a mountie spawns RIGHT beside me.  I shout again to my party "INCOMING" and follow my trail back to my party, having to LH halfway there.<p>  I counted the corpses of the fallen... 3 orcs, 2 mounties, 7 or 8 snow leapords... in a line that went pretty damn far.  It was hilarious!<p>  Is my gripe about cats done yet? Nope.<p>  I log on the next night with another character.  These characters are for a sub-guild of Sanctus Covenir where we 'roleplay evil characters to experience the fullness of Norrath" and to wage an inter-guild war for some fun.<p>  We decide to hunt in the East Commonlands, and I tell my pet to attack a lion, since it's white to me.  My friend was right behind me, casting a bit at this thing and it's almost dead.  It killed my wimpy skeleton, and starts in on me.  Now, I wasn't paying attention to anything but the cat.... and another sneaks in and ambushes me from behind -- it's yellow..I'm dieing.  Scratch that, I died.  The second lion really tore a chunk out of my hide.  However, did it go after my friend and his pet who were right there killing the first one?  NOPE.  It just calmly walks away.  I hear in /gsay "HAHAHA, you should have seen this!"  and he told me exactly that it ran in, killed me, and calmly walked away.  I ran back to my corpse, saw the dead lion's corpse beside me and my friend was sitting there UNHARMED what-so-ever.  ok, so cats don't like me.... I decided upon this.<p>  Now here is a more recent incident.  Happened last night, and I'm still laughing (kindof) at it.<p>  I'm running through East Karanas, on my way back to Freeport.  I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing, chatting in /guildsay, when I run into a Lion and a Lioness.  No problem, lion goes down easy.  Ok, when I'm in open areas, I usually switch to isometric view (#3 I think) and survey the area for more dangers and I zoom WAAAY out.  On the edge of my view (which is pretty far) I see a glimpse of movement.... a glimpse of movement that zooms straight for me -- lion patriarch.  Cool, they're blue so I'll get some xp.   Killed it, on to the same ol' lioness... <p>  I'm still in Isometric View..... 3 more patriarchs from different directions at least 100 feet (if you can judge distance in EQ) take a bee-line STRAIGHT FOR Me.  Umm, I'm running now for the zone.   I got within 2 steps of the zoneline before I died (and yes, I LH almost there)<p>  Now, did I get some faction losses against CATS?  Nevermind Wolves (black wolves, level 1 critter and shadow wolves, level 3 or 4) and other things just like them still attack me without provocation.  I'm level 14.... shouldn't these things leave me alone?  <p>   I'll be standing around with my friends and get ambushed out of the blue... leaving everyone else alone.  I know they attack when you're sitting and medding.... but I wasn't at the time.  They were.... everyone else could stand in a circle around me, and I'd still be the one that the thing would target.  <p>  Strange part is, young kodiaks leave me alone now.  Cat's wont.   Of course, if I'm attacking one, it runs and brings whatever back to me.  Ever see a Sand Giant get called by a coyote?  It happens.  Damn coyote!   <p>  Anyway, this was my humorous rant.  Hope you liked it.<p><br>Ya'roc<br>Lord of Crusaders<br>Sanctus Covenir
