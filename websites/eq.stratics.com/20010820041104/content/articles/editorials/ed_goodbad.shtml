                  <div> I would first like to tell you a little bit about the 
                    author of this document, Cold Rain. I began hearing about 
                    EverQuest when I was playing Ultima Online. My interest began 
                    to peak when I attended my first EverQuest Developer Chat 
                    - better known as the Games.Net chat - held in April of 1998. 
                    If you were there, you remember the excitement and craziness 
                    that EverQuest was causing in the online gaming community 
                    and the new world which captivated our interest. Following 
                    the Games.Net chat, I took a greater role in the EverQuest 
                    community by joining the Stratics Network. As time went on, 
                    I watch the development of EverQuest with envy for those selected 
                    for phase .5 following E3. As development continued, I waited 
                    as phase 1 and phase 2 passed. More and more information was 
                    released, and my excitement began to grow. With the start 
                    of Phase 3, the Stratics Network was given "press accounts" 
                    to begin discussing the development of EverQuest and sharing 
                    it with fans. After my brief exposure to EverQuest, I have 
                    come to the below conclusions. This information does not come 
                    solely from myself. I would like to take this opportunity 
                    to thank everyone who participates in the chatroom #Everquest 
                    on the Stratics IRC. Particularly, I would like to thank Ffil, 
                    Tenarrus, DarkSoul, GreenDragon, and all the others who have 
                    helped develop these points which I will layout for you and 
                    the EverQuest Development team.

                  <p> <b><i>Graphics</i></b> 
                  <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;The screenshots do little justice to the truly 
                    awe-inspiring majesty of EverQuest. EverQuest allows the user 
                    to fully immerse themselves into a realistic environment. 
                    Rain or sunshine, the EverQuest world looks much like our 
                    own. The graphics are superb, far surpassing the expectations 
                    of myself and others. 
                    <p> <b><i>Class Variety</i></b> 
                    <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;The variety of classes in EverQuest makes 
                      it truly unique. The differences are distinct, and each 
                      one has importance in the world of EverQuest. While some 
                      are better at combat, others provide a necessary role in 
                      EverQuest, anything from healing the injured to protecting 
                      the weak. Your class will play a valuable role in your group, 
                      community and world. 
                      <p> <b><i>Race Variety</i></b> 
                      <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;Race variety allows the element of role-playing 
                        to be taken to the next level. The variety of races in 
                        EverQuest adds an element which other online games never 
                        could achieve, individuality. The races allows the player 
                        to choose how they will play EverQuest. If players are 
                        willing to immerse themselves in the role of their race, 
                        EverQuest will gain an element of true fantasy. 
                        <p> <b><i>EverQuest Development Staff</i></b> 
                        <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, the EverQuest Development 
                          Staff has been actively involved with players in the 
                          ongoing development of EverQuest. They seem to welcome 
                          opinions and views which may not match their own, and 
                          seem eager to help when they can. I often see many of 
                          them in the EverQuest chatrooms on their beta server 
                          asking and taking questions. Hats off to all the EverQuest 
                          staff.

                            </i> &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=blue>I have yet to enter 
                            the game. I still can not get passed the new account 
                            screen. I have emailed several places, including the 
                            "noaccount" setup that was posted recently. I did 
                            receive an 11 word responce from them 24 hours later 
                            that said "server is overloaded keep on trying and 
                            it will go through" (an exact quote). I received that 
                            last night and have been trying ever since.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;I guess my gripe is not so much in the 
                            fact that I am not in yet (well, maybe a lot has to 
                            do with that), but in the way Tech support has handled 
                            me so far. Sure they are swamped with bugs/fixes, 
                            this is Beta, but what will happen to customer support 
                            when it is mass produced? My email to them included 
                            all requested information, plus all steps etc. that 
                            I had attempted - figuring this would be usefull in 
                            pin pointing problems. As you saw from their response, 
                            a whole lot of time and effort went into their responce.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Guess I'm just getting frustrated, but 
                            I thought my Beta experience would be in helping with 
                            the game, not the "New Account" screen.</font></small></blockquote>
                          <p> <b><i>Gaining Levels</i></b> 
                          <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe (although not positive) 
                            that the EverQuest Development Team has done an excellent 
                            job on restricting how fast you gain levels in EverQuest. 
                            The graduated system of leveling makes every player 
                            work harder for their next level. This difficult and 
                            challenging task of gaining levels continues the excitement 
                            of EverQuest for each player. 
                            <p> <b><i>Item Variety</i></b> 
                            <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;From eyeballs to magical swords, 
                              the diversity of items to be collected in EverQuest 
                              is truly amazing. EverQuest always keeps you wondering, 
                              "what might be found the next time I defeat this 
                              creature or slay this beast." 
                              <p> <b><i>Monster Variety</i></b> 
                              <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;With few exceptions, monster variety 
                                in the lands of Norrath is sufficient. From snakes 
                                to griffins, danger lurks everywhere in many different 
                                forms. You should not have to worry about fighting 
                                the same creatures day in and day out. If you 
                                search hard enough, you can find the challenge 
                                you seek. 
                                <p> <b><i>Monster Intelligence</i></b> 
                                <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;With a recent patch to EverQuest 
                                  3.0, monster AI has dramatically increased. 
                                  Monsters will takeoff running if you hit them 
                                  hard enough, and they do not just run one direction. 
                                  They can twist and turn until you loose track 
                                  of them. In other words, never under estimate 
                                  the intelligence of your opponent, may it be 
                                  rat or dragon. 
                                  <p> <b><i>Substance</i></b> 
                                  <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of Phase 
                                    4, EverQuest has increased its addictiveness 
                                    by adding alternate means of entertainment. 
                                    Players can now find a variety of quests all 
                                    over the world to challenge them. Trade skills 
                                    have also been implemented to give EverQuest 
                                    more depth. 
                                    <p> <b><i>PK Switch</i></b> 
                                    <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;The player killer switch 
                                      has taken online role-playing to new levels. 
                                      Those who do not want engage in combat with 
                                      "Powergamers" or "Random PKers" can now 
                                      be safe. The PK switch seems to be effective 
                                      and reliable, although there are far fewer 
                                      players who want to play as a player killer 
                                      than those who do not.

                                        for me is this: Poor support for +pvp. 
                                        Namely, every city should have a discord 
                                        priest available for characters to choose 
                                        +pvp should they so desire. My troll warrior, 
                                        Blud, worships "The Warlord" and does 
                                        so by combat. Inherently, this character 
                                        should be +pvp. There is no Discord priest 
                                        in Grobb or Oggok. The closest one is 
                                        in Freeport, a city where my troll faces 
                                        the distinct possiblility of being killed 
                                        on sight. I have petitioned several times 
                                        to be changed to +pvp but have yet to 
                                        even be given a response from on-duty

                  Bad</font></b> 
                  <p> <b><i>Name Server</i></b> 
                  <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;As many of you are aware, EverQuest will require 
                    that your character name fit the rules of "high fantasy". 
                    The name server seems to be, for the most part, stable; however, 
                    I have seen many players with names that do not seem very 
                    "high fantasy". Probably the fault of the players in EverQuest 
                    more than a bad name server. 
                    <p> <b><i>Monster Trains</i></b> 
                    <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like some players are beginning 
                      to find a way to player kill people in EverQuest. The method 
                      is known as a "train". Essentially, a strong player will 
                      go around attacking very difficult monsters and build up 
                      a "train" of them behind him. He/she will then run into 
                      a "newbie" or beginner area with this train of monsters. 
                      The monsters really do not care who they attack, so sometimes 
                      they will just attack the closest opponent. So "JoeNewbie" 
                      is fighting his giant rat when "BobPowerful" comes running 
                      through with an Orc Raider. The orc may attack "JoeNewbie" 
                      as he passes. A possible solution is to have the monster 
                      lock on to the attacker until the monster is attacked by 
                      another player, or discipline those who use this method 
                      of player killing. One point that should be made is that 
                      if the orc did kill "JoeNewbie", "BobPowerful" could not 
                      loot the corpse. 
                      <p> <b><i>Lag</i></b> 
                      <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;With the start of Phase 4 of beta testing, 
                        server lag has increased slightly. Highly populated or 
                        large zones seem to cause moderate lag on less powered 
                        systems. "Lagging out" occurs more frequently than in 
                        the past, but still is not a serious threat. 
                        <p> <b><i>Giving of Goods</i></b> 
                        <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;An inherent problem with any online 
                          game is the giving of goods from powerful players to 
                          weaker ones. Since many of the items are class specific, 
                          a level 30 monk has no use for a magical sword, and 
                          might just give it to a friend. This kind of abuse is 
                          not rampant in EverQuest at the moment, but can and 
                          will happen. A possible solution to this problem is 
                          put level restrictions on items. For example, a certain 
                          magical sword could not be held by just anyone. Such 
                          as a level 5 warrior could not even touch a sword designed 
                          for a level 25 player; however, this maybe a bit extreme 
                          and could cause more problems than do good.

                          <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;The EverQuest server is down from 
                            time to time for various reasons. Downtimes can be 
                            as short a few minutes to as long as several hours. 
                            Early evenings seem to be a prime time for down periods 
                            while servers are patched. 
                            <p> <b><i>NPC Interaction</i></b> 
                            <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;One of EverQuest's major promises 
                              was an interactive NPC environment which has yet 
                              to show itself. While I understand this is only 
                              phase 3.5 of beta, NPC interaction is limited. You 
                              cannot just walk up and start talking with the barkeep 
                              as if you were talking with a real person. In fact, 
                              most of the time, the barkeep will saying nothing 
                              at all. A possible solution is to program some of 
                              the NPCs to carry a conversation with players while 
                              others merely say "Leave me alone, you vagrant."

                  <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;The EverQuest interface screen screams for 
                    optimization. An overall unfriendly and unforgiving system 
                    of clicks. The organization itself takes much time to get 
                    used to due to the fact that the location of options are unusually 
                    placed. For instance, if you want to view your stats, you 
                    would click a button on the upper-left hand side of the screen; 
                    however, once you are finished, you must click a button in 
                    the lower-right hand side of the screen. Secondly, many times 
                    you must scroll through a list of items (e.g. skills, chat 
                    messages, etc.) by clicking on tiny little scroll arrows unlike 
                    traditional scroll arrows. The buttons themselves are very 
                    picky on how and where you click. Third, combat is a nightmare 
                    when trying to engage a moving target. One must master the 
                    ability to use the keyboard and mouse simultaneously. Those 
                    who maybe missing an arm or fingers will find EverQuest impossible 
                    to play effectively. Please keep in mind that this observation 
                    is the impression of just a few testers, not all. A possible 
                    solution for these problems is to completely redesign the 
                    interface system. Perhaps a system of windows to make the 
                    game more universal. I can understand wanting to make something 
                    unique, but let's keep this game as simple to operate as possible. 
                    <p> <b><i>Chat System</i></b> 
                    <div> &nbsp;&nbsp;The chat window for EverQuest is lacks much 
                      to be desired. When running in 640x480 mode while in combat 
                      with monsters, chatting with your group, using other forms 
                      of chat (e.g. shouts, tells, says, out of characters), and 
                      guild chat, the chat window is not large enough to display 
                      all the incoming information adequately. Further, when in 
                      combat with monsters, you will find that correcting you 
                      typos is somewhat challenging. The chat system seems to 
                      ignore keystrokes when in intense combat. There are two 
                      possible solutions to this problem: 1) Make the chat window's 
                      size adjustable or 2) Redesign the chat system into a series 
                      of windows (i.e. shout window, tell/say window, group window, 
                      combat window). With the current system, be aware that you 
                      might miss the words "Dragon coming at you".

                        and selling will become more efficent. Maybe a general

                  <div> My overall impression of EverQuest is very admirable. 
                    I still believe that EverQuest holds for many people what 
                    other games failed to give. As March 16 roles near, we, as 
                    testers, need to be diligent in expressing our views, opinions, 
                    and experiences. 989 Studios wants to make a great game, and 
                    we want to play a great game. Together, we can make it happen.
