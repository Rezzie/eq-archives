"Yes, my lord, they have yet to kill one of our member. ",  Tarne humbly spoke to his commanding 
officer, J'larda, of the Dark Lighters.
<br><br>
"Aaah, that is what I like to hear, and what of the one you killed Tarne, will he be missed?", replied 
J'larda.
<br><br>
"Perhaps only by the one he was accompanied by.  The warrior I told you about, the one with the sheath 
made of dark elven skin..  He appeared to be of the warriors guild of Freeport. Even though, he is highly 
skilled and apparently one of our race had already fallen to his blade."
<br><br>
"Yes...Yes.., well, I shall dispatch one of my assassins to kill this unworthy opponent.  You should have 
killed him, and for your insolence, you shall be placed under my discretion for one month's time.  You 
shall no longer partake in any of our rituals, and you shall be allowed one meal a day.  This meal will be 
bread and water.  This will show others what we do to people who don't do their jobs properly.  You fled 
from battle, a most dishonorable thing.  Get out of my sight.", replied J'larda, dismissing Tarne before he 
could speak.
<br><br>
	The guards grabbed Tarne before he could react, and dragged him to his cell in the Commons.  
Thrown into one of his own race's cells, Tarne fumed silently.  He swore he would get that elf someday, so 
help him Innourouk.  Tarne glances at his sorroundings,  a bleak rock built cell with a door of steel bars.  
His hand went instinctively to his blade, but did not find it.  Well, kudo's to those guards for being able to 
disarm him so quickly.  Of course, they weren't of the First Rank of the Inner Circle of his masters guards.  
His hand found his dagger in a cut in his cape.  The daggers hilt, made of bone, felt warm in his hand as 
he thought of how his revenge should work.  
<br><br>
	Tarne stood up, listening for the guards walking the halls of the jail building.  Walking over to 
the door of steel, he shifted the dagger in his hand.  
<br><br>
"Hmm", thought Tarne silently, "Let's see, a simple lock, what idiots."
<br><br>
	Tarne drove his dagger into the hole of the lock, twisting it around, trying to find the place he 
wanted to.  One thing troubled him as he attempted to pick the lock, the fact that he was going to try to 
escape from this prison.  He would forever be an outcast to Neriak, and would probably never be able to 
set foot in the forest ever again, for it was a dark elven land and he would not be allowed in for penalty of 
death.       His heart raced as he heard the almost inaudible click of the lock being picked.  Tarne slid the 
door open, wincing at the loud "creak"ing sound.  Creeping out of his cell, he glanced down the hallway 
quickly.  
<br><br>
	Weilding his dagger, still wearing his cape, Tarne crept down the hall warily.  Coming to the end 
of the hallway, Tarne glanced around the corner, praying to his god that there was nobody there.  
Confrontation was not something he needed at this point.  Pleased that there was noone wandering the 
halls, he fled towards his destination, thinking only of his revenge to this ignorant elf.  Escaping out the 
door of the prison up and then over a hill of stone he sat considering his options.
<br><br>
	5 seconds of consideration brought him to a conclusion and he headed toward's his own residence 
prepared to exact his revenge from the elf's hide.  .  The only problem Tarne had now was getting inside 
J'Larda's residence without disturbing the guards tower that stood right next to it.  Entering his home, 
Tarne ran over to his chest sitting near the edge of his bed.  Tarne opened his chest, pulling his longbow 
from it along with a quiver of arrows, which he hung over his shoulder.  Out the door Tarne went, again 
heading towards J'Larda's residence.  
<br><br>
	PHHT!  An arrow sped through the air heading towards it's target with superb accuracy.  Tarne 
watched as the look-out guard was felled by his arrow, falling of the guard tower and hitting the ground 
with a thump.  Tarne walked slowly to the fallen guard's now quite dead body and pulled a few platinum 
pieces out of the man's money pouch for provisions.  Tarne stood up, gazing at J'larda's residence.  He 
walked slowly, once more considering what this decision would bring.  Tarne slipped through an open 
window in the house, gazing at his sorroundings.  This was apparently the sitting room, where J'larda 
entertained company.  There was a fire lit,  sitting in a circle of stones.  
<br><br>
	Tarne heard movement upstairs, like someone searching rapidly for something.  He made his way 
silently up the wooden stairs, slowly removing his dagger from his cape yet again.  Upon entering the 
room he noticed J'larda bent over a chest  searching through it madly.  Gripping his dagger with renewed 
fury just from seeing this elf, he tapped on J'larda's shoulder lightly whispering , "Now you die Sir.".  The 
last thing J'larda saw was Tarnes grinning face starting back at him.  J'larda, now permenant wide eyes 
started back at Tarne in such horror that he grimaced for a moment.  
<br><br>
	
	Tarne turned his head towards the chest which now lay there open with things thrown all over 
the room just as he heard the guards yelling not 50 ft away from where he was standing.  Resting against 
the upstairs window was Tarne's sword, which he quickly sheathed knowing if he had to use it it would be 
the end of him.  Glancing out the window, he quickly scanned what was happening.  The guards were 
doing a full search of every house in the area because of the dead guard.  Pulling himself out the window, 
Tarne used the momentum to leap onto the next house's roof.  Tarne hit the roof at a dead run, pulling 
strength from every part of himself he knew of and even part's he did not.  
<br><br>
	Escaping Neriak would not be easy, he knew, but he vowed to make it.  One day he would return, 
and lay waste to these people that would condemn him from now on, knowing he killed J'larda.  Exiting 
the forest with grim satisfaction he made camp not far from his homeland but far enough away knowing 
that the guards would not reach him.
