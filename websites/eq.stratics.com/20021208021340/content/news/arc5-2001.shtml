<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText">From Dynamite Shortfuze :<blockquote>Hail my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro!!<br><br>As you know, in past months, I have hosted a rune trade faire for wizards, that we may help each other further our research and development of spells. Last month I was not able to host the faire on account of my writing my final exams, but this month the faire is on!<br><br>As in past months, the idea is simple: wizards of all levels meet together and bring their runes. If you need a rune, ask for it, and if anyone has it, they will give it to you. Conversely, if you have a rune someone else is in need of, that you yourself do not need, then it is expected that you shall give it to them freely. This has been a great success in past months, and I'm looking forward to this month being even better!<br><br>I have had requests to postpone the faire past this weekend as I am told a number of guilds are having events that would coincide with the faire were it held this weekend (I understand one guild is even having an all-weekend scavenger hunt!), and even though that would mean putting the faire past the end of the month, I see no reason why not to postpone it. As such, the faire will be held at the following place, date, and time:<br><br>Where: Toxxullia Wizard Spires<br>When: Monday July 2nd<br>Starting Time: 3PM PST (6PM EST)<br>Ending Time: When all is said and done, and we have finished having fun!<br><br>As always, I ask that if you ply a trade in which others may partake of your wares and enjoy them, please feel free to bring some of your fare with you! I myself brew, and always ensure I bring enough of my wares to keep everyone happy. If you would care to bring some of your own stock, or if you bake and would like to share your wares, then by all means, bring them with you! These are always welcome!<br><br>While this is a faire geared primarily at wizards, I invite everyone to attend. It's good fun and you can get to know your community better. Since I started hosting this faire, I've gotten to know my fellow wizards much better, and am constantly conversing with them... I like to think that this has helped me gain many friends, and will help to gain many more. For this reason alone, even if you aren't a wizard, or if you're a wizard that cannot yet research, or has no more use of research, you should attend anyway! Especially if you are beyond the point that research can advance you, as you can help your fellow wizards who are not quite as advanced as yourself research their spells. Higher level wizards have always been at hand in the past to help younger wizards research their spells, and there is no reason for this to change now.<br><br>If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, by all means, either send me a tell in-game, or contact me at fenninrunes@hotmail.com, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.<br><br>I am using the faire this month as a guage of sorts. I intend to use its success in order to determine how popular the faire really is, and whether it should continue. So the more people that attend, the more likely it is that you'll see another faire! I hope one day to limit the faire not only to wizards, but to all casters to come together and share their research, help each other, and get to know each other in the community.<br><br>I look forward to seeing you there this Monday, my friends, and I hope this will be the greatest faire yet!!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</blockquote>Thanks!</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText">Here is today's patch message<blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">June 27th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Gameplay Changes **<br><br>- Aggro Changes:  We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their targets.  It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense.  But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug.  NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets.  NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm.<br><br>- Spell and Item Interruption:  Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly.  You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells.  This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though not with each other).<br><br>- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<br><br>- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<br><br>- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<br><br>- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<br><br>- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<br><br>- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<br><br>- Egress will now work indoors.<br><br>- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<br><br>- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<br><br>- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with Acumen.<br><br>- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<br><br>- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<br><br>- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<br><br>- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<br><br>- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste buffs. <br><br>- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win out.  This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<br><br>- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<br><br>- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.<br><br>- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br><br>- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game.  The Circlet of Shadows, can now be found in its place.  This item differs from the original only in that it has a five-second casting time.  Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at some future date.<br><br><br>** Quest Changes **<br><br>- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.<br><br>- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. <br><br>- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in Norrath.<br><br><br>** PvP Changes **<br><br>- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<br><br>- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target.  This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers.  The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.<br><br>- Faction hits on Rallos Zek:  Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few weeks.  For example we have corrected all misspellings of "deity" in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<br><br>- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br> <br>- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting after starting it will cancel it.<br> <br>- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101.  This was a problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100.<br><br>- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or "Glug... Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.<br><br>- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first person view when in combat. <br><br>- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit.  It should be a more interesting zone now.<br><br><br>** NOTE **<br><br>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their home town.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>While EQ is patching, why not join us in <b>#EverQuest</b> on <a href="http://chat.stratics.com">Stratics IRC</a>! </td></tr>

It is known merely as the "River Source".  As the name implies, its an invisible mob at the source of the river in the warrens.   What made this interesting was when a GM stated it had never been killed before.<br><br>Upon hearing that, <a href="http://www.llts.org" target="_blank">The Syndicate</a> decided the mob had to be killed.  Being as it was in the Warrens one might assume it is a quick and easy midlevel kill.  That is not the case.  Although the mob is a midlevel one and doesnt hit hard, it is definitely not a quick kill.  This mob appears to have more HP than any other mob in game.  It had anywhere from 1,000,000 HP to upwards of 5,000,000 HP.  A constant beating for hours on end is what it took for this mob to die.  Thousands of HP damage per minute and yet it still took hours to die.  Movement of the health bar was imperceptible except over time.  Exact HP numbers were difficult to judge over that length of time of constant attacking.<br><br>Oddly, when it died it left no corpse and a new one spanwed nearly instantly.  It is unlike Verant to add a mob that serves no purpose. There must be some purpose for this strange mob with a million or more HP.  What that purpose is we dont yet know.</blockquote>Thanks for letting us know!</td></tr>

There is no 'see invisibility' for illusions. The places where we've purposefully staged NPCs that you just can't sneak by would be compromised by such spells. NPCs treat different body types differently, and an illusion essentially gives you a body type.<br><br><hr height="1"><br>I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just explaining how it works. Creatures see body types. They react to them. It is one of the factors that determines how an NPC will react to you. Yes, sure, we could probably design some seriously complicated code that would allow a spell to work, but the effort would be pretty serious, and we're not ready at this time to trade that effort for this one spell when it might buy us better things.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>The original thread can be found over at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=DeveloperAPOs+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_new">The Developers corner forum</a>.</td></tr>

It would certainly honor us necromancers if you would take a look or reply to the email that Qque sent you.<br>I would also like to add to what Qque said in that instead of making a new item (Emeralds w/ charges) you could ask Lawrence to see if it's feasible to make sacrifice create multiple gems while still requiring the original emerald reagent. This would certainly make casting spells like sacrifice more palatable and, while it won't compete with clerics, it will make necromancers a little less sketchy about casting other spells. I for one, would never use Trucidation or Infusion with the current requirement, especially since Infusion is not targetable. <br><br>Also, if you would, ask Lawrence why I can't cast Manaskin and/or Shield of the Magi (both self-only spells) if I have a lower-level character targetted (one whom I would be unable to buff with a 50+ spell, assuming that I had any 50+ buffs). There's a message displayed stating that the target is too low level for me to cast my self-buff. Thanks in advance.<br><br>Kilamon K'Lmal, Tunare server.</b><br><br>We've already discussed Essence Emeralds, actually. We don't have any plans to change the way they work or the spells that use them. We want those spells to be rarely used and difficult to gather components for. We want them to be cast rarely and with good reason. We think the spells and the Essence Emeralds are right where we want them.<br><br>There is a bug that I'm aware of on Sullon that we are working on that is similar to what you describe, but I wasn't aware of it on any Live servers. I'll mention it to the folks working on the fix for Sullon and see if they can expand it to the Live servers.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Alan</blockquote>and a change to spell interruptions<blockquote>BerzerkerBen wrote:<b><br>Under 'Magic changes in Test server' I read once you duck your spell gets interrupted immediately. Is this true? Can this be true? please say yes!!!! many of my friends have died after I accidentally clicked on the complete heal spell... Say this is true and will go live please!!!</b><br><br>This is true on Test at the moment. Whether or not is will remain that way until we patch next is uncertain. Right now, the plan is to leave it this way, but that plan could change so don't get too excited.<br><br>The main reason for this change is to fix an 'exploit'. We are fully aware of the beneficial side of this change, and as of our last meeting we are inclined to keep that beneficial side as it is.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>The original threads can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=">here</a>.<br></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText">Gordon Wrinn has made an official response to the rumours from the Minneapolis fan faire about possible upcoming changes to the existing PvP servers. He made these comments over at the <a target="_blank" href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=">Developer's Corner</a>.<blockquote>Hello all,<br>It&#8217;s apparent that as a result of the Fan Faire this weekend in Minneapolis, inaccurate information regarding our PvP plans for the future were released and/or misinterpreted. <br><br>That has always been one of the difficulties of having a real-time interactive discussion where one doesn&#8217;t have the time to think about the precise wording of their answers. However, what we gain through the interactive forum makes it worth the effort, even when things appear to come out wrong like they did in the PvP panel this weekend. <br><br>For the most part, regarding the information that has since shown up on web sites, it appears that when it was mentioned that we &#8220;discussed&#8221; an issue, it was interpreted as &#8220;we are doing this&#8221;. The fact is, we discuss a TON of things when we&#8217;re driven to improve one area of the game. If you name it, we&#8217;ve probably discussed it at one time or another. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that what we discussed has either been decided or shot down, just that we&#8217;ve given it some measure of consideration in the past. <br><br>So, with that in mind, here&#8217;s the quote-by-quote clarification of the story on Castersrealm (eq.castersrealm.com) and RallosZek.net. (www.ralloszek.net). <br><br>Quote from Article: In approximately one week, PvP 'rules' will be as on Sullon Zek. In other words, there are no rules with respect to PvP. Standard blue server rules apply and sexual/racial harassment will not be tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point camping/exp killing, etc) will be completely legal. No PvP related petitions will be handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems such as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled.<br><br>Clarification: Sure, we discussed it, much like we discuss anything. As we were putting together the ruleset for Sullon Zek, someone suggested that we role it out across Sullon first and see how that goes and role it across the other servers if it works out. Will it go across the other servers? We don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll have to see how it goes on Sullon first.<br><br>Quote From Article: ShowEQ is actively being pursued to be 'fixed' <br><br>Clarification: As actively as &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; allows. We really need to do something revolutionary and complex in our next attempt to address the problem. It&#8217;s just a matter of having enough time to implement and test that. Timeframe? Mid-term, probably prior to Luclin&#8217;s launch.<br><br>Quote from Article: Classes are being re-examined for viability in a PvP environment. Lady Daegarmo specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that is woeful in PvP.<br><br>Clarification: &#8230;with nothing specific planned and nothing beyond minor tweaks, certainly nothing class-redefining planned. Regarding rangers there was talk about improving archery, but that was spoken of with plans to put something out across all servers rather than just as a PvP-related improvement. The truth is, the classes are not balanced for one-on-one PvP, no more than they are balanced for one-on-one PvE (Player versus Environment). If you have to fight as part of a group to be successful in PvE, you&#8217;ll most likely have to do so with PvP. Yes, this does mean that a solo melee player will be at a disadvantage when meeting casters, especially those configured for solo play, and yes, that is part of the plan.<br><br>Quote from the Article: Lady Daegarmo is pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for approx 200P each<br><br>Clarification: Oh it&#8217;s been pushed, but has yet not been taken up by the dev team for consideration. We&#8217;re kind of like the supreme court that way <br><br>Quote from Article: It was noted that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell function with opposite effects so there's no way to give Lay Hands back to paladins on death while restricting the same recycle on HT<br><br>Clarification: Not entirely accurate. The reuse time is not tied to the spell effect, not to mention that each ability is treated as a skill by the game and uses its own reuse timer. The reason it&#8217;s not being done is not a matter of technical unfeasibility, but rather a specific design decision not to. Both are easy to exploit. The level to which they can be exploited is acceptable on the PvE servers and not acceptable on the PvP servers. <br><br>Quote from Article: Cross teaming is coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be locked down. There will be no ability to crossteam at all. No grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with non-team members. This lockdown is probably 60 days out. (I stated that the Development team would make an official date on the lock down in which they would give a minimal of 30 day notice. I also stated that I doubted you would see these changes within the next 2 months.)<br><br>Clarification: Yep, we&#8217;re planning on addressing cross-teaming, probably through locking down the teams. However, the specifics on how this will be done, along with what if any beneficial abilities will be allowed to cross any lock down is still being discussed. Opinions are welcome.<br><br>Quote from Article: The lockdown will entail a guildwipe. All guilds will be deleted and must be reformed. There will be extra staff for the first few days after the wipe to assist in this endeavour<br><br>Clarification: If we decided to do the most severe lockdown (no cross-guilding), then this would probably be the case. However something like this won&#8217;t be decided until we decide what kind of lockdown we&#8217;ll do.<br><br>Quote from Article: It is highly likely that common (the language) will be removed from the racewar servers for general communication use (i.e., public channels). Training in non-team languages will also receive very low caps.<br><br>Clarification: No. While this was one of the many thing suggested as part of a panel discussion, it has only been discussed as one of the many possible options for an &#8220;RP Server&#8221;, for lack of a better term, by the development team. The &#8220;RP Server&#8221;, by the way, will not be PvP. Those looking for PvP rules similar to an &#8220;RP Server&#8221; should look towards Sullon Zek.<br><br>Quote from Article: Strong possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change your team. Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain teams (such as a Paladin joining the evil team).<br><br>Clarification: No. It was one of the suggestions brought up by players in the panel discussion, and has not been discussed by the development team. However, I can say with some certainty that this probably won&#8217;t happen.<br><br>Quote from Article: TZ likely to be changed to a 2 team server (Good vs. Evil). VZ may be changed to a 3 team server<br><br>Clarification: These were &#8216;off the cuff&#8217; examples of how a lock down could possibly be accomplished, rather than an indication of the direction planned. To clarify further, we previously decided not to implement a 2-team system, and are considering a 3 team system, by race, due to the percentage breakdown of players on each team currently.<br><br>Quote from Article: Rallos will always remain coin + 1 item loot. Code for rain spells is currently being changed to not effect your pet or your immediate group<br><br>Clarification: Yep and Yep, but no ETA.<br><br>Quote from Article: Sullon Zek will be live within 3 weeks<br><br>Clarification: Probably within a week actually baring major problems coming up.<br><br>Quote from Article: There's discussion about adding a new Guildwar server with no 'teams' but lockdowns based on your guild.<br><br>Clarification: This was previously discussed and ruled out by the development team, as it would be insufficiently differentiated from the current servers. In other words, most of everything that would be doable on the &#8220;guildwar&#8221; server is currently doable on Rallos, or one of the existing teams for that matter. <br><br>Quote from Article: On Sullon, the new summon corpse mechanism for good races will be obtained via a quest which likely involves PvP/crests of fallen opponents.<br><br>Clarification: This is accurate. In fact I&#8217;ll tell you now that Mages are in line to gain the ability on Sullon. And no, we won&#8217;t roll it out that way on other servers <br><br>I hope this gives everyone a better idea of what we have planned for the near and mid-terms. We&#8217;ll work to be a little more explicit about what is currently planned or not planned to avoid misunderstandings in the future.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive/Luclin<br>Sony Online Entertainment</blockquote></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText">Thanks to Kilyin for submitting this!<br><br><blockquote>Greetings Norrathians!<br><br>We have received many letters and emails asking what exactly exploitation<br>is in light of the recent banning of the guild formerly known as Conquest.<br>We have compiled a list of known exploits at www.everquest.com, but for your own convenience, here are a few simple rules to go by:<br><br>1. Using the landscape to assist you in any way with the killing of a mob is an exploit.<br>2. Using spells that do not stack with a mob?s spell line thus rendering the mob incapable of hitting you with his spell(s) is an exploit.<br>3. Using CoH to clear agro is an exploit.<br>4. Doing anything without the intended number of people for that encounter (see the list of expected participants in certain encounters at www.everquest.com) is considered an exploit.<br>5. Agro management is an exploit.<br>6. Battle rezzing is an exploit.<br>7. Waiting until X amount of mob life is left before nuking is an exploit.<br>8. Having casters stand further away than melees is an exploit.<br>9. Binding and then nuking after death is an exploit.<br><br><br>If you are considering doing anything and are not sure if it is an exploit, please petition a GM. If the GM determines that what you are considering is an exploit, you will be suspended/banned without warning.<br><br>This latest patch also contains several large changes that we hope will make your gaming experience better.<br><br>Cazic Thule and Innoruuk have been upgraded once more. They will now randomly summon and death touch any person in the zone every five minutes. Cazic Thule has been given a 1000 hp damage shield, and Innoruuk can now Lay on Hands three times in an EQ day. Both now wield a non-resistible area of effect disease/fear DOT that will kill those inflicted in under a minute. God levels have now been increased and melee damage upped appropriately. Upon initial agro of the god, all mobs will be respawned and instantly teleport to defend their god. Because we wish to maintain the current influx rate of planes gear and items, these respawned mobs will not have loot.<br><br>The Sleeper will now do a zone wide death touch every five minutes, regardless of whether he is spawned. There are eight warders instead of four, and the warder levels and skills have been upped accordingly.<br><br>All giants in Kael now see invis.<br><br>All mobs in Skyshrine now see invis.<br><br>It has come to our attention that there are Iksar who have actually managed to up their faction enough to be non-kos in cities other than Cabilis. These factions have been reset. Experience loss from death loops due to binds next to kos guards will not be reimbursed. Reversely, all Cabilis factions have been reset for non-iksar.<br><br>In order to reduce camping in Lower Guk and Sebilis, all loot from these zones has been removed and may randomly drop off of any spawn in Norrath.<br><br>All epic quests now require a drop off of either Innoruuk, or Cazic Thule.<br><br>In order to keep variety among the classes, All beneficial spells are now self ONLY. Group spells such as pack regen have not been affected.<br><br>In response to popular demand for rangers to have a once a day ability, rangers can now cast ?revive? on their corpses once an EQ day. We believe this ability follows our Vision for the ranger class. *note: because of this ability?s potential for being overpowered, clerics will no longer be able to resurrect rangers. Other classes abilities to be rezzed are not affected by this change.<br><br>Call of the Hero has been changed. The magician and his target must be able to see each other for the spell to work. Agro wipe will no longer occur when successfully cast.<br><br>The effect on the Singing Steel Gauntlets has been changed from Enduring Breath to Summon Wisp.<br><br>There is now a confirmation box for all Evac spells. The evac will not occur for anyone unless all party members click yes.<br><br>Your group members will now receive a message any time you automatically eat, or drink. A message will also be sent when you open or close a bag.<br><br>If your avatar is standing in one place for more than a minute, any PC you are facing will receive the message ?Soandso is STARING at you?. If you are looking at their back, the message will read ?Soandso is STARING at your BUTT.?<br><br>Spirit of the Wolf is now available to all classes to cast, but because of the power of this spell, a ruby is now required for each cast. This applies to all classes.<br><br>The agro on the snare line has been increased.<br><br>The agro on the Tashani line has been increased.<br><br>The agro on all weapon procs has been decreased, unless you are a ranger.<br>If you are a ranger, the agro on weapon procs has been tripled.<br><br>Root is no longer available to rangers. This spell line has been replaced with Summon Wisp.<br><br>Evade now has a 10 second ?casting time?.<br><br>Mobs will no longer move away when a PC feigns death. They will stay next to the PC until either the PC gets up or the mobs are killed.<br><br>Necromancers can no longer Feign Death. This spell has been replaced with Summon Wisp.<br><br>Fear and Snare/Darkness no longer stack.<br><br>Guild size is now limited to no more than 30 total accounts. If your guild has more than 30 accounts, it will be deleted in the next guild wipe.<br><br>Our next guild wipe is tommorrow.<br><br>Inspect messages are now more detailed. In addition to ?Soandso is inspecting your equipment?, a message will be sent for every item looked at. IE. ?Soandso is examining your Wurmslayer, Soandso is examining your Fine Plate Greaves.?<br><br>The Clarity spell line has had its mana regen reduced.<br><br>Mez will now break if any spell is cast on the mob.<br><br>Lodizal can now spawn in any zone with a large body of water.<br><br>Wandering Brownies have been added to Kithicor, Wakening Lands, Toxxulia Forest, Swamp of No hope, Trakanon?s Teeth, Emerald Jungle, Burning Woods, and Misty Thicket.<br><br>Brownies now see invisible.<br><br>Griffons of all kinds now see invisible.<br><br>Shadow Guardians now see invisible.<br><br>Wyverns and Drakes now see invisible.<br><br>The Kromrif Death Squad now has a chance of spawning in Great Divide, Cobalt Scar, East Commons, and Thurgadin.<br><br>Wuoshi will now spawn randomly at any wizard portal. In addition to Velious zones, this includes Kunark as well as Antonica. Wuoshi's faction has also been changed to Guardians of Veeshan.<br><br>The 96% Reviviscence spell has been replaced with Summon Wisp.<br><br>The effect on the Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh (cleric epic) has been changed to Abundant Food.<br><br>Because of item envy, all weapons are now variations of rocks and sticks. In order to keep the epic value of epic weapons, epic rocks and sticks will glow slightly. There are rumors of lava boulders and sharpened stakes in Dragon Necropolis and Veeshan?s Peak.<br><br>-- The Everquest Team.</blockquote><br><br>By The Way, no this is not real, but it was really funny =).  <br></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText">I found this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000216.html"target="_blank">here</a><br><br><blockquote>Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes. <br><br>The "problem" with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when a better solution will be implemented.<br><br>Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and Druids evac spells. <br><br>Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self version work indoors. <br><br>Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form.<br><br>Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will no longer conflict after the next patch. <br><br>New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again. <br><br>Now on to the "Burning issue". I know the Wizard community has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser &#8211; cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is group utility. <br><br>As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be struggling for usefulness. <br><br>The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for multiple wizards to "Anchor" an NPC won't really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented and ready to go before the next patch. <br><br>Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated.<br><br>Take care all!<br>/Lakers secret handshake<br><br>- Lawrence Poe</blockquote></td></tr>

I don't see any real reason to prevent people from trading."<br><br>There are roleplaying reasons and gameplay reasons. The RP reason is the same reason that you can't group with someone on another team and that is that your god would not permit you to render assistance to an enemy. Trading is the exact same thing. Is not selling someone a SoW potion the same thing as paying someone to cast sow on you? Also, I think you underestimate the number of people with multiple accounts. Heck, I know that if *I* built up a character on another team to the 50's and wanted to start a newbie, I'd certainly give it stuff, just because I can.<br><br>From a gameplay standpoint, I think you're missing a wonderful dynamic that preventing inter-team trades would create. If there is a certain item that is considered "great" (such as E-boots), a team can literally prevent other teams from getting them. The dynamic is jealousy. With enough cash, a player could ply an item off of an opponent. But without inter-team trading, that person (and others like him) would be jealous of that race. That creates even more conflict.</b><br><br>And on the other hand, there are some interesting possibilities that not allowing trading would restrict. In fact, in your example, imagine the wealth that can be gained by a team that is able to corner the market on something and then sell it. It also allows players to set up some of their own events, like convincing the evil guild leader to give up some item to a neutral guild to prevent them from aiding a good guild in some action.<br><br>I can see both sides here, and I can't see one as clearly better, except in one way. Sometimes it's just plain better to be able to help someone out. So if a neutral character sees a good character that has lost all of his stuff, he can help that person out a bit. I think that's the reason that I'm in favor of allowing trades across teams.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>The original thread can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</td></tr>

We DO fix bugs AND we go after people who exploit. Now why don't we just do the former? Because in the time between a player discovering a bug and us fixing it, in some cases, a LOT of damage to the game can be done. An extreme case would be duping -- a player exploiting a dupe bug could irreparably harm the server's economy before we had a chance to fix the bug.<br><br>In this particular case, while not as extreme as a duping bug, the guild did appear to be conquering one of the hardest zones in the game with far fewer people that what would have been necessary had they not been exploiting. This hurts the game -- more specifically, it cheapens the experience for those groups of people who might have been one of the first groups through that zone NOT exploiting. <br><br>No man is an island in a massively multiplayer game. What one player or group of players does can OFTEN affect other players, and so we have to protect the players as a whole by cracking down on those few who would make the game less enjoyable for others via exploiting bugs.

(removal of Common tongue?)</b><br><br>No. We considered it but decided we didn't want to do too many things at once. Not to mention, there's a real question among the team as to how this would add to gameplay. We aren't sure it will. We'd be happy to entertain arguments on the subject for the RP server which is coming up next.</blockquote>On the lack of a level limit for PvP :<blockquote><b>My only complaint? That ANYONE can kill a level 6 player.<br><br>Grief players are going to flock to this server, level up at light speed, and spend their nights in lowbie/newbie zones AOE killing low level players... sorry, but I seriously disagree with this one.</b><br><br>That may very well happen. But we also anticipate that if it does, people will jump at the chance to defend their teammates. Picture it like this. Someone Innoruuk follower decides to wipe out the newbie humans in the Commons. He blasts ten or twenty of them only to find that he's being attacked by two humans that are hurting him. He ends up getting killed by them, and losing experience.<br><br>Will he come back to pester the newbies again alone, or will he find friends and make a war on the guys that killed him?</blockquote>On the possibility of a movelog :<blockquote><b>Will there be a move log for this server?</b><br><br>Nope.<br></blockquote>and finally :<blockquote>- The environment WILL cause experience loss. If you jump off a cliff and die, you will lose experience.<br><br>- Naked corpses WILL disappear when looted by a player character. If you are naked and killed by a player character, your corpse will disappear when it is looted.</blockquote>Have your own say on this topic <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/postings.cgi?action=reply&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&topic=000203.cgi&TopicSubject=Deity+Team+Server+Announcement" target="_blank">here</a>.</td></tr>

Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.<br><br>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled.<br><br>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.<br><br>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.<br><br>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters.<br><br>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level.<br><br>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters.<br><br>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels.<br><br>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally', members of another team will be shown as 'threateningly'.<br><br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br><br>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on these servers to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning on PvP servers. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on PvP servers.<br><br>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team.<br><br>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones.<br><br>16. Beneficial spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule.<br><br>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward.</blockquote>You can discuss your thoughts on this new server on our <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/eq/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=eqwestwood" target="_blank">forums</a>.</td></tr>

In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back.</blockquote><br>You can read the entire response and add your own comments <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/eq/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=eqwestwood&Number=551307&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part">here.</a></td></tr>

All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves. There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves and Half-Elves in Greater Faydark.

<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText"><i>Kevdawg_the_Rapper</i> had some concerns about the recent 1.5x resist debuff change in the recent patch.<blockquote><b>The 1.5 resist debuff was a bad idea. as a melee i use resist to help protect my self from the casters. its bad enough for meele casses with all the unresistable spells casters have and the eggshaped prumice nerf , but now Root ,snare, and blind spells can can stick now with 150+ resist. anyways befor you ruin pvp anymore how about telling or asking us what you going to change befor you put it live</b></blockquote>Absor responded by saying this :<blockquote>Well, it's a fine line there. As it is now a melee character can make him or herself nearly immune to all enchanter spells with high resists (and high resists are probably much easier to get than they really should be).<br><br>If I were to take a poll on this change, I promise you I would get a yes from every caster and a no from every melee (as a rough generalization). I suspect I could simply count the number of each type of character on the server over level 40 or so and that would fairly approximate the results of a poll on the matter.<br><br>We've examined the numbers and looked at it carefully, and for now we're sticking with this change. It may indeed turn out to be too much of a change. It also may turn out to be too little of a change (as most enchanters would probably tell you).<br><br>Let's try this out. We're certainly not going to change this at all for a while, at least until we've all played with it some.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Agree? Disagree?

The original article can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000190.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<blockquote><b>Since spell issues are all the rage, I have a couple small nits I'd love to see fixed.<br><br>1) Feign Death doesn't give any indication to the caster that it's worked. In heavy combat it can be hard to tell if it when off or not. The caster is told if the spell didn't work "Soandso has fallen to the ground." and if it does work *others* see "Soandso dies.". If would be nice if the caster got the "dies" message. A spell icon would be even better, but I can see where that might be a problem if you already had 15 effects on you.<br><br>2) Tap type spells wear off twice. Spells like Siphon Strength and Shroud of Hate have their own message when they wear of. But you also get the stock yellow "Your xyzzy spell has worn off.". For example:<br><br>Your Shroud of Hate spell has worn off.<br>The hatred departs.<br><br>It might make sense to get the yellow message if the MOB you cast the spell on was still alive, but you get it when they are long dead as well. However if you zone before the spell wears off you get only the spell's message and not the yellow one<br><br>3) Dead Man Floating doesn't stack with Deadeye (self only see invs/infravision). Both have see invs, which might explain it, but the See Invisible spell does stack with Deadeye and I'm pretty sure that Infravision stacks with DMF. It all seems pretty odd. It is true that DMF should not overwrite Deadeye as infravision would be lost.<br><br>Thanks for looking at these!<br><br>Mynegon</b></blockquote>Lawrence responded with:<blockquote>1) Having played a high level Shadow Knight, I agree there are times when I will not notice my spell going off. However when I get into situations where I think I'm going to need to FD/DP I just pop into 3rd person mode so I can see my character.<br><br>2) I'm sure you understand why you get two messages. The effect is on you, and the NPC. When it wears off it wears off from both of you which is why the double message. That being said I doubt we will get this changed any time soon. <br><br>3)These spells should stack with each other. I'll modify Deadeye and throw it up on test and see if any other stacking issues arise from the change. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe</blockquote>If you have any comments on any of these issues you can submit them <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/postings.cgi?action=reply&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1&topic=000190.cgi&TopicSubject=Minor+Issues+with+Shadow+Knight+(and+Necro)+Spells" target="_blank">here</a>.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top" class="newsText">The in development page has been updated. Read about it <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/main/indev.jsp" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br><blockquote><br>With E3 out of the way and summer starting up here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br><br><ul><li><b>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current "Trivial Combat Code" as well as looking at the problem of "spell twinking" in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.</li><br><br><li><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next "free" zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.</li><br><br><li><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some redecorating of her lair, which includes replacing some of her more lackwitted minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.</li><br><br><li><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.</li><br><br><li><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the "moving stair step" visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved.</li><br><br><li><b>Deity Specific Quests:</b> We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.</li><br><br><li><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.</li><br><br><li><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.</li><br><br><li><b>New NPC Return Policy:</b> Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the "Thank You!" message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non-quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.</li><br><br><li><b>Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.</li><br><br><li><b>But That Doesn't Make Sense!:</b> We on the EverQuest Team realize that with all the factions, plots, and quests in Norrath we end up with a few oversights that just don't make sense in the overall story of the world. And so, for the sake of being true to our world, we've decided to keep an eye out specifically for these things and make changes where necessary. The fact that you now have the option to quest for your Ghoulbane from a froglok paladin rather than just brutally murdering the poor chap is just one example of these changes with many more to come.</li><br><br><li><b>Guildwars:</b> We've noticed a huge lack in player participation of this feature due to a lot of bugs with it. Our hope is that by fixing these bugs and enhancing the system a bit more people might be interested in going to war with their local guilds.</li></ul><br><br>Stay tuned for more new info on what we are planning for this summer. Until then, happy hunting!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></blockquote><br><br>It sounds like there will be some interesting patches coming over the next few months. Stay tuned to find out more.</td></tr>
