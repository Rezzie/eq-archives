In Reply to: <a href="9234141789610.shtml">Re: Anybody found a Quest worth a Crap?</a> posted by Gaeris on April 06, 1999 at 11:56:18 AM CDT:<p>
We beta testers have some significant advantages over the release crowd (knowing where Paw is, for example - it was completely empty the first week, while BlackBurrow was packed - sure, it's a hike, but all the blue gnolls you could ever want when we got there!), but quests wasn't really one of them, at least not for me.  I found not a single worthwhile quest in beta, really.  Many many quests didn't exist or didn't work for most or all of beta, and many of the ones that were there have been changed or eliminated.  I've so far found one quest that gives great rewards, it's nowhere near Halas, so it won't help the original poster much.<p>I am so far fairly annoyed by the unevenness of quests and quest rewards.  The one quest I've found that is worth doing is REALLY worth doing at the level you are able to do it, with great financial and equipment rewards for those who complete it (and it can be done many times with random, and sometimes great, rewards).  If you're a class/race that can do this quest and use the items you get as rewards, you can get FAR more money and better equipment than someone who can't, and is of similar levels.  Many other races and classes get no quests at ALL, or ones with no meaningful rewards.  Barbarian rogues, for example, had NO guild quests when the game was released.  Barbarian shamans have a couple, but they seem either undoable or for very minor rewards.  I'm sure lots of other people are in similar situations with their characters.   It'd be nice if every race and class guild gave its members at least a couple of quests that were worth the time to figure them out.  Maybe there are quests that the guilds simply won't say anything to you about until you make a certain level, but I haven't heard of any so far.  Hopefully the new patch, which is supposed to add a bunch of quests, will improve the situation some.  <p>Ravenclaw<br>
