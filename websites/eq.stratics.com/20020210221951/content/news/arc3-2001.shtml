This Faire shall be the first of its kind, where wizards of all levels come together to have fun. We shall have games, contests, duels, prizes, and on top of it all, our monthly Rune Trade!<br><br>For those who do not know, in past months I have hosted a wizard Rune Trade on Fennin Ro. Wizards of all levels came together with their runes and helped each other: if there was a rune you needed that someone had, you would ask and it would likely be given to you. Subsequently, if you had a rune another wizard needed that you didn't, it was expected that you would offer it to your fellow wizard in order to further his or her own advancement. Several higher level wizards also offered their time and skills in research to the cause, ensuring their lower level comrades were able to get their spells.<br><br>This month, the trade is still on. However, on top of that, we will be having several contests and games just for fun, some of which will have prizes for the winners! As this is an effort put forth by the community, as a member of the community you are welcome, and even expected, to lend your assistance. If you have ideas for games (we ALWAYS need these), prizes or money for prizes you would like to donate to the faire, or any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at fenninrunes@hotmail.com or contact me in-game.<br><br>If you are making a donation, I would ask that you please hold on to it until the Faire, but please let me know that you intend to donate it. This way I can schedule the games around the prizes, making sure the appropriate prizes are awarded for the appropriate games and contests. Also, if you are not able to attend, but have runes or prizes you would like to be at the Faire, then please give them to a wizard friend who intends to attend. On that note, be sure to tell all your friends! The Faire schedule is currently:<br><br>Fennin Ro Server<br>Toxxullia Spires<br>Saturday 28th April<br>Begins: 2PM PST (5PM EST)<br>Ends: when it's over! =)<br><br>    The trade itself shall begin when attendance has peaked, so the more people you bring with you, the faster we can begin trading. Also, I am only one brewer, and in past months, I have had JUST enough of my fare to please the attendants of the trade. If you are a tradesperson and would like to bring some of your stock to the Faire, no matter what it is (baked goods, alcohol, anything!) then you are more than welcome...just remember to save yourself for the drinking contest!<br><br>Thank you my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro, for being such a wonderful community and making this possible. When we stand together like this, we truly shine in every way. It is you that makes the Faire, and the Faire is magnificent. I look forward to seeing you all there!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro<br><br></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This weekend we will be upgrading our forum software. The new upgrade is going to introduce a great number of bug/feature fixes; many brand new features as well as performance improvements across the board. This is a MAJOR upgrade that will impact every site on the Stratics Network.<br><br>The URL used to reach the forums will be changed. This change reflects the fact that we will be moving from a Perl based system to a PHP system. The new URL will be posted to the existing forums so that after the upgrade is complete, even if you do visit the old URL, you'll receive a notice indicating where to find the new forums. Please be sure to update your bookmarks at that time.<br><br>Some features that you'll find in this upgrade:<br><br>1. Over 79 different stylesheet options to choose from and each stylesheet now includes matching button sets. You're no longer subject to the same button colors no matter what style you choose. Each style now has a matching button set.<br><br>2. Expanded FAQ giving detailed explanations of all Markup Tags. Be sure to check it out.<br><br>3. Many new smile and emote icons that may be used (see FAQ for details). We now have 97 icons in our database that may be used.<br><br>4. Fifty-one (51) new Markup Codes, including 42 new colors have bee<br>added. You can also now use new markup tags such as blockquote, standard lists, ordered and unordered lists and others (see FAQ for details).<br><br>5. Several New Titles have been added.<br><br>6. New Colored icons have been introduced. These icons now reflect whether a person is an Administrator, a Moderator or VIP. VIP's include game developers and other special guests. These icons replace color-coding of names since such colored names often looked bad in certain stylesheets.<br><br>7. A new option to login directly from the Main Index if you're not logged in.<br><br>8. A new "Show Threads" option within each forum that allows for you to choose how old the messages are you wish to view. If you choose to view only news messages within the last day or two, this drastically reduces the load time, so you're not stuck loading day's worth of posts. This is a terrific new speed enhancement. There is a matching option within your User Profile that allows you to set the default age of posts.<br><br>9. A new "Quick Search" field right inside each forum listing. This allows you to quickly search that forum alone.<br><br>The majority of the upgrade however has taken place on the back end. All of the Administrative features have been enhanced for performance and stability. The next release, due out in a month or two, will include a huge assortment of additional end-user features.<br><br>I would like to take a moment to sincerely thank both Panther and Auz for their outstanding assistance in preparing this software for release. We had to take the vanilla version and make a great deal of enhancements and changes to it prior to reaching this point. Thanks again guys; I really appreciate your help!<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Community Development<br><br>Stratics<br><a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a><br>The Massively Multiplayer Network

So I am now officially stating  that the Wizard Faire is on! Again, we shall meet at the Toxxullia Spires.  The first Rune Trade was at 4PM PST and some complained that was too late. The second was at 1PM PST and some complained that was too early.  This month, the Faire shall begin at 2PM PST (5PM EST) and carry on as it has in the past: until it ends. When attendance is at its peak (whenever that is), the Rune Trade shall begin. In the time surrounding that, there shall be games, contests, duels, and hopefully, prizes!<br><br>    Some have contacted me since the first announcement of the Faire with donations of prizes, and to them I am very grateful. I would like to once again remind the community that this is an effort put forth by no guild, but by the community, and as such, all can and are expected to help. If anyone has any prizes they would care to donate to the cause, any ideas for contests and games they would like to share, or if they feel they can help in any way further, then I urge them to please contact me in-game, or email me at:<br><br>fenninrunes@hotmail.com<br><br>In regards to prize donation, I would like to remind everyone that I will not be accepting the donations before the Faire. I would ask that if you have a donation, hold on to it, and bring it with you to the Faire. In the event that you are unable to attend but would like to make a donation anyway, or you have runes for the trade you would like to send, please give them to a friend or guildmate who will be in attendance. Also in that regard, don't forget to tell your friends and guildmates!<br><br>Again, the details of the Faire:<br><br>What: Wizard Faire<br>Where: Toxxullia Spires<br>When: 2PM PST (5PM EST)<br>Server: Fennin Ro<br><br>Thanks again for helping me get the word out.

Please make note of this, and excuse our mistake.  <br><br>I found this  <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000100.html">here</a> at the  <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Official Everquest Forums</a> <br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="a00000" size=2><br>I wanted to give you all a brief explanation about how to use /report.<br>When you have a problem in game where there is text describing the problem in your chat window, /report allows you to send that information to us. This information comes directly off the server and is stored to a database here, so there is no concern about anyone using /report to cheat. This is the most reliable way to get your information to us.<br><br>The most common example for using this feature is when someone is harassing you. Use /report to send us the offensive text and then send in a /petition with full details of the incident (include the fact that you've used /report as well, so the GMs know that it's there).<br><br>/report will only send us the text that is currently visible in your chat window. So make certain that the text you want us to see is visible when you use /report. Scroll up until you have what you need in the chat window.<br></font></blockquote><br><blockquote><FONT face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056> <br>Also, the syntax for /report is /report &ltname&gt. The &ltname&gt is the name of the person you are reporting about. If someone is harassing you, use their name. But if you are reporting something that happened to you, such as a bug that made you fall for 10,000 points of damage, then put your character's name after /report.<br></font></blockquote><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="a00000" size=2><br>Nothing else is needed with /report. Please don't type /report &ltname&gt and then a lot of text explaining your concern. Use /petition to explain the concern.<br><br>Correct use of the /report feature can make it much easier for us to get things straightened out when there is a problem.<br><br>Alan<br><br></font></blockquote><br>

This means that some food items will not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain your character longer than they did before.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat.  This fellow has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to.  We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to work with this patch.<br><br>- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character was healed or damaged by spells.  This could be seen, for example, when a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go back down a bit right afterwards.  There was no error in the assignment of healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed.<br><br>- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different bracer graphic than you would.  Now everyone (including the wearer) will always see the same bracer texture.  If you have two bracers that have a different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).<br><br>- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to accidentally zoning back the way they had come.  You should be facing the right way when you make that zone transition now.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This should make at least one quest more available.<br><br>- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens.  Hopefully this will allow Troll bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items.  Previously, if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy.  Now he will have 4 in either case.<br><br>- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains.  Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests.  Hopefully these changes will dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.<br><br>- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This is the beginning of our overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious.<br><br><br>** Improved and New Features **<br><br>- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of your corpses.<br><br>- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, etc...) from merchants.  It works the same way as sell in that you can hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item.<br><br>- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with /wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is).  You can now use /wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window separately.<br><br>- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them.  This will work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 'auto-equip' area of your character profile.  So if there is already a piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for it.<br><br>- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when the chat bar is up.  When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names.  When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your last target.<br><br>- /assist has an added parameter.  /assist on and /assist off will determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist.  So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage your character's auto-attack.  This change will be persistent, so it will remain as you left it when you log out.  /assist also now has a range of 200 feet.<br><br>- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins.  This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong item.  PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it.<br><br>- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than just 'hail'.<br><br>- Added /charinfo command.  Currently this command only reports the zone where the current character is bound.  We may add further information as things progress.<br><br>- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported).<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two one-handed weapons.  What will happen now is rather simple.  The very next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it.<br><br>THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your inventory.  So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in your inventory.  And don't panic, the items didn't disappear.  :)  But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to fit into your main inventory).  If you end up with a No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a problem...<br><br>Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged.  Right now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is created.  We're working on fixing that bug.  We decided to make this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the old scabbard.<br><br>This new scabbard will have a special ability.  It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them.  Simply place a Sword of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button.  The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the permanent epic sword.<br><br>Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones.  That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and combined the swords for the first time.<br><br>- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it's a big two-handed axe...).  If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out.<br><br>- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character inventory upon disconnection with the server.  If you are disconnected from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to that character within 30 minutes.  After thirty minutes those No Rent items will be deleted.  There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe.  No reimbursement will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner.<br><br>- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the "Pouch of Quellios" as intended.  If you have one of these items and it still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch yours for a new one.<br><br>- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.<br><br>- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly.<br><br>- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced.<br><br>- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3.<br><br>- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed.  If you're wearing these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd announce it anyway.  New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped armors and on the questable armors.  Because the Velious textures can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be loaded by default by the game.  If you want to see the new textures you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE.<br><br><br>** Trade Skill Changes **<br><br>- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry made for their god.  For those that not only sing around the campfire, but sing about the campfire!<br><br>- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed.  Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear.  But if the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it.  Those items should no longer seem to disappear.<br><br>- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel Chestplate has been increased a little.<br> <br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making cultural armor.<br><br>Enchant Velium<br>Enchant Mithril<br>Enchant Adamantite<br>Enchant Steel<br>Enchant Brellium<br><br>- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis Lazuli to Malachite.  They now use the same reagent as every other Magician pet spell.<br><br>Minor Summoning: Earth <br>Minor Summoning: Water <br>Minor Summoning: Fire<br>Minor Summoning: Air<br>Elemental: Earth<br>Elemental: Water<br>Elemental: Fire<br>Elemental: Air<br><br><br>- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets will now appear upon a successful use of the spell):<br><br>Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)<br>Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)<br>Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)<br>Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle)<br><br>- Cannibalize IV now exists.  This spell is now available in Velious.<br><br>- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved.  They now return more mana to the caster than they did before.<br><br><br>** Class Specific Changes **<br><br>- Monk weight allowance has been increased.  Every 15 levels monks will get an extra 1 stone weight allowance.  The post 50 weight allowance has also been increased by 2 stone.<br><br>Level 15, Limit 15<br>Level 30, Limit 16<br>Level 45, Limit 17<br>Level 51, Limit 18<br>Level 55, Limit 20<br>Level 60, Limit 24<br><br><br>- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.</font></blockquote>

Saturday night (Pacific) I was in North Karana and saw a Guide, The Dryad Knight of The Green, suffering the same afflictions as the rest of us while sitting before the fire at the gypsy camp.  He said he was disgusted by the decay in the land but not much more.<br><br>I talked to the farmers, put some rabid creatures out of their misery, and generally wandered about all the Karanas checking for tracks of unusual creatures.  Around midnight (real time- no idea of the game time but it was at night) I was near the barbarian fishing village and farm fields in West Karana when a farmer shouted out something to the effect that "The plague is upon us- run for your lives!"  At last, something was going to happen...<br><br>Although I had checked tracking just a moment before, and saw nothing unusual, when I checked again I was surprised to see nothing but "a swarmling" for most of the list  (They were all con green to a Level 36 Druid).  Although I was not buffed, except for SOW, and at about 10% mana, I ran to find one of these things.  As it turned out, they were small green beetles about the size of typical fire beetle.  One attacked me at the Miller fields on sight but was easily despatched.  All of a sudden, a short ways away, I saw a similar beetle but it was very large.  This was The Swarm Mother, which conned blue, and was running toward me.  With it hitting me for 60-80 points of damage a hit, me at almost no manna, and just lower level folks nearby, what ensued must have been the longest bug-kiting in the history of the Karanas.  About 20 or more minutes later, it at last fell.<br><br>All I found on it's ichorous corpse were two fire beetle eyes and a diamond.<br><br>My thoughts (now where is my copper?),<br><br>Neurot Oldegrowth, 37th Rank Soldier of Tunare</blockquote><br>Thanks!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We've been recieving a lot of reports on the GM events revolving around Bertoxx and the Karanas. Here's a report from Tarask of the Saryn server:<br><blockquote><br>The plague seems to have started in West Karanas on the morning of Friday the 13th of April (real time). <br><br>"I had little time to adventure that day, but managed to get a kindly wizard to port me into the North Karanas to investigate the rumor of a bug invasion.  Immediately upon arriving, I felt weak and my eyes began to to itch.  Evil magicks had accursed this land.  I started to make my way to the gypsy camp where a guild brother waited.  Along the way, I passed animals afflicted with rabies and strange beetles not common to this area.  I set about destroying the afflicted animals, least they attack a farmers family.  Soon however, I realized that there were far to many for myself alone to kill and continued toward the wagons.<br><br>I met with Medikar and his companions.  They did not know the source of the strange occurrences and knew only that it seemed to be a plague that had started in West Karanas.  The adventurers were valiantly trying to defend the inhabitants from the dangers that had arrived with this plague.  Our healers tried to cure animals of the disease, but their spells had no effect.  Even trying to stem off the beetle invasion seemed futile as every one we killed seemed only to be replaced by another.  One of the party pointed out a strange green mist that seemed to cover whole of the land.  The mist was so light that it could only be noticed when peering into the distance.  This seemed the likely cause of my weakness.  It was obvious that no simple actions would rid us of this curse.<br><br>The group began to search the area hoping to discover the cause of this atrocity.  I headed to a nearby farm to question some of the local townsfolk about the sudden changes.  Indeed, the farmers knew the cause of this curse.  The God, Bertoxxulous, sought revenge on the inhabitants here for the death of one of his high priests.  His Bloodsabre cult enlisted the aid of Dark Reflection to bring about a threefold plague.  Animals were stricken by rabies, a hoard of beetles invaded the realm, and a green mist hung over the land that threatened to poison crops whenever rains fell.  The villains had transformed Karana's blessing rain into a curse!<br><br>We contempated for a moment on the possible locations of the groups involved.  A Bloodsabre faction is known to reside in the Qeynos sewer system.  Dark Reflection is the name by which gnomish necromancers of Ak'Anon go.  These areas are to far removed for the casting of a spell of such magnitude however.  I suspect a circle of mages to be hiding in the mountains of West Karana.  Indeed, I remember passing many shady characters there while I had recently traveled these lands.  My friend, Zior, was willing to help me investigate my suspicion, but I was called away before I could lead him there.   I do not yet know if he was successful in his venture."<br><br>Tarask Painkeeper <br>Dragonchow on Saryrn</blockquote><br>Thanks!

This information comes directly off the server and is stored to a database here, so there is no concern about anyone using /report to cheat. This is the most reliable way to get your information to us.<br><br>The most common example for using this feature is when someone is harassing you. Use /report to send us the offensive text and then send in a /petition with full details of the incident (include the fact that you've used /report as well, so the GMs know that it's there).<br><br>/report will only send us the text that is currently visible in your chat window. So make certain that the text you want us to see is visible when you use /report. Scroll up until you have what you need in the chat window.<br><br>Also, the syntax for /report is /report <name>. The <name> is the name of the person you are reporting about. If someone is harassing you, use their name. But if you are reporting something that happened to you, such as a bug that made you fall for 10,000 points of damage, then put your character's name after /report.<br><br>Nothing else is needed with /report. Please don't type /report <name> and then a lot of text explaining your concern. Use /petition to explain the concern.<br><br>Correct use of the /report feature can make it much easier for us to get things straightened out when there is a problem. <br><br>Alan<br><br></font></blockquote><br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We have received more information regarding the GM event the other night.<br><blockquote>In what I think is a related bit of lore, a female paladin or cleric in Qeynos talks about a plague in the Karana's caused by the Heretic Erudites, and that her mother died in it. She also discusses the Realm of Heroes, which I believe is part of a Epic Quest. I don't remember exactly what the woman said, as it was over a month ago when I talked with her on the Erollisi Marr server. But, she claimed that the Heretics had caused a plaque among the animals of the Karana's, and that many clerics and paladins fought against the rabid beasts, including her mother, who died. And I believe she also said she fought, and as she believed she was about to die, she prayed to her god (The Tribunal I think), and was lifted to the Realm of Heroes, only to be sent back to serve among the mortals again. A similar quest NPC is in most major cities, talking about this Realm of Heroes, and Coins of some sort. Might want to do more research on it, as I can't give you the full details on this woman and what she says.<br> <br>Jaarus Star<br>Order of Ascension<br>24th Circle Wood Elf Warrior<br>Erollisi Marr</blockquote>We also received this from Aravail:<br><blockquote>Re the GM Event last night which you report on Luclin, and which also happened on Innoruuk.<br> <br>It was a shambles. Yes, there was a green mist and it brought with it rabid wolves, griffawns and other diseased animals, and there was talk of a swarm being defeated but I never saw one. Yes, talking to farmers in West Karana yielded the information that Bertox's high priest had been slain and as a result the Plaguebringer would visit disease, swarms and much worse upon the land. Yes, a lvl 1 shadowknight called Faraeb (not receiving tells and assumed by all to be a GM) called out that he was a messenger of Bertox and who would wreak destruction upon Qeynos. Yes, we all gathered in WK to defend the pass to the Qeynos Hills and outside Qeynos itself. Yes, we even learnt from a Priest in the Temple of Life in Qeynos that Mordavin, the man responsible for the (attempted?) resurrection of Bertox, had been discovered and slain by Antonius Bayle but that Mordavin's lover remained at large drinking with a bunch of scoundrels in the Lion's Mane Tavern in Qeynos. I forget her name.<br> <br>But no, we never found the lover - she was not on tracking - and nothing more happened. In time we all drifted away, at least that was the state of affairs when I retired for the night. As of this morning sickness messages are still received in the Karana's (affecting North East and West) but the mist has gone and nothing else seems to have happened.<br> <br>In all therefore it was much more of a non-event that an event, it provided some entertainment and did cause a great many to join together in a common stand against the evil forces. Just a shame that no eveil forces ever turned up..... Even more of a shame that we got no information as to what was going on, there was a lot of speculation that Faraeb was no more than a player exploiting the situation with some (excellent) role-playing that had us all going.<br> <br>Was it just a spoof event for Friday 13th? Was it part of a weekend-long quest? So many of us recalled with pleasure the Halloween event with the undead of the early times in EQ which has never been repeated or equalled. Was it a prequel to a new Plane being introduced? The trouble is no-one knew, and therefore the whole night descended into a farce.<br> <br>The exchanges with a number of NPC's suggest something is afoot, but as for what I simply don't have a clue. Wish I did! :)<br> <br>Loremaster<br> <br>aka Aravail, Druid of the 41st season on Innoruuk.</blockquote>Thank you both Jaarus and Aravail for this information!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We just received a report on a harrowing event that took place last night on the Luclin server. Here is the report:<br><blockquote>April 12th, 2001 10:00pm - 12:30am<br>The Buggy Bug, a Plague of Questions?<br>A suspected GM event occurred last night on the Luclin server.  <br> <br>All travelers to the East Karana or North Karana during the evening hours were struck by a horrible plague of various ailments, including runny nose and blurred vision.  The sickness didn't have any major effect on magical or fighting capabilities.  The sky was over cast with a sickening green fog, that had the thickness and texture of Ogre snot. <br><br>As the plague spread the intelligent races alone were not the vectors for the disease, many animals became rabid as well, causing increased danger to travelers.  <br> <br>The confusion that followed was great and the solution, when I was forced to leave late in the night, was unclear.  At first many groups of adventures sought to destroy all of the rabid animals but it soon became clear that with elves and humans alike infected nothing short of killing every living thing in the two areas would end the disease.<br> <br>Powerful clerics of the Realm attempted to cure the pestilence but no magic possessed of the mortals could bring relief from the dread pox.  Then news came that farmer Miller had knowledge of a swarm that presumably carried the plague.  The Swarm Queen was in short order hunted down and killed.  It was reported that a necklace was looted from the feted corpse of the Queen,... this was then promptly sold to a merchant and lost!  At this point any hope of finding a cure seemed to fade away.  The plague did not leave with the slaying of the Swarm and the green fog did not lift.<br> <br>As the Night of Pain progressed without resolution some began to question if the gods had forgotten us.  Others insisted it was the work of Bertoxxulous the Plaguebringer and then they even called out his name to face him in combat, which surely would have brought about the death of all present.  No further words of any worth were gained in the night.  Many local peoples were inquired including the Gypsies and the Ancient Treant Xanuusus, but these few could tell us not.  <br> <br>As I left late in the night the plague was not ended and the greater number of adventurers had retired to rest.  I felt honored to have been present at one of the great events to touch the Karanas... I think.  Nothing really seemed to happen and no one could say what was to be done? The gods were to vague in their task for us.<br> <br>-- Celistian, Druid of the Realm of Enlightenment</blockquote><i>Note: If anyone has more information about this event, please send it to us!</i><br><br>Thank you Celistian!

There is some great information here.<br><blockquote><div align="center"><b>In Development</b></div><br><br>              We're finally starting to get back on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br>            <ul><br>              <li><b>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current &quot;Trivial Combat Code&quot; as well as looking at the problem of &quot;spell twinking&quot; in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next &quot;free&quot; zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Continued UI Enhancements:</b> A number of things are planned, from allowing people the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look on the screen.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the &quot;moving stair step&quot; visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved.  Update: This is actually now implemented however is not yet bug- free.  You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini.  Note: If your card doesn't support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash.  Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>New NPC Return Policy: </b>Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the &quot;Thank You!&quot; message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b> Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Velious Magic Resistance:</b> In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion, we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player characters.</li><br>            </ul><br>            We'll fire off more updates as we have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!</p><br>            <p>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>            </p></blockquote>

Necromancers are the masters of the dead, reaching beyond the bounds of the grave to magically manipulate their dark minions.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><FONT face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056> <br>Hail good wizards of Norrath!<br><br>I come before you today with news of Fennin Ro's first ever Wizard Faire! In months past, I have hosted a Rune Trade on Fennin Ro, and the time has come to expand upon this, with a huge faire... for wizards!<br><br>I'm hoping that this can be held on the 28th of April. I know, it's very early to discuss this, and I don't even know myself if I will be available, but I've been getting pressure to start announcing it (especially from Omnip, who is possibly the Faire's biggest supporter). Let me explain how it works...<br><br>Before, at the rune faires, wizards of all levels would come together.  We would discuss life and have fun (the Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew helped with that I'm sure), but most prominently, we would trade runes. If you needed a rune, you would ask if anyone had it, and you would likely receive it. Conversely, if you had a rune someone else needed, you would offer it to them. Higher level wizards were on hand to assist lower levels in the research of their spells, and fun was had by all.<br><br>No changes are being made to that. We're just expanding on it. This month, we will have contests, games, duels, the rune trade, and above all, fun!<br><br>I would like to offer prizes of cash and items for this event, but as this is an independant project and not one of any guild with a large support base, my income restricts this from being much good. I can offer prizes just fine, they just won't be good in many respects. So much so that prizes would probably have just as much impact if they weren't present. However, if you have any donations of items or cash that you would like to put forward to this, please contact me in-game and let me know. I won't ask that you give it to me until the event (since I can't guaruntee my presence just yet), but I would like to know that these things are available so I can plan ahead with them in mind. If you can't get to me in-game, please contact me at<br><br>fenninrunes@hotmail.com<br><br>Also, I am just one wizard, and in past trades, I have had JUST enough alcohol to please the masses. So if you'd like to bring some of your own brew for all to sample, please, I wholeheartedly encourage it!<br><br>We have a few games in mind, and Omnip has some that she won't tell me about (she says it's a surprise and she'll post it on the boards herself), but we can only get better with help. So, if you've got an idea for a game, again, contact me with the procedure and rules at<br><br>fenninrunes@hotmail.com<br><br>I'm really looking forward to this month, I expect it's going to be the best we've had yet! I hope to see you there!<br><br></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Obviously, toggling it off will prevent auto-attack from starting when you assist.<br><br>The programmer working on this has read every /assist comment you all have sent in. The responses were overwhelmingly in favor of using the new system (where /assist will send target the opponent whether or not the person assisted is attacking). With the new toggle for auto-attack on assist, we think that the new method offers a lot more functionality.<br><br>So, once again, we are going to use the new method. As of the next patch /assist will set your target to the assisted characters target, regardless of whether or not he is attacking.<br><br>I'm afraid to encourage you to comment on this&#8230; <br><br>We're working for the best solution here, and this one has the most functionality.<br><br>Alan<br><br><br></font></blockquote><br>

Could you please tell us what the average number of players is you think to be OK for a server. I am from Europe and at the moment, on weekends, there are sometimes about 1500 players on my server (Morell-Thule). <br><br>There were 170 people online in Faydark the other day. The point is that i am concerned this amount is quite high for the servers, and I got a feeling there are some bad effects developing from this crowding (don't want to see the servers at peak-time though, more than 2000 people, geez). Besides intensive camping with long waiting lists there are especially quite rude manners in the newbie zone of Kelethin regarding kill stealing.<br><br>2)It seems to me that there is a constant inflation of equipment (and money too?) in the game. Example: weapons and armor from Crushbone can be found at NPC-vendors in Kelethin. Equipment from monster-killing drops in price generally. Could it be this is due to the fact that there is no effective item sink balancing the amount of things? Is this intended to be as it is? Or am I even wrong?<br><br>3)What is your idea of the development of the server population? As far as I can see the level of the average character will constantly grow. Doesn't that lead to a population profile with lots of highest level characters and unused newbie zones? Is it intended to be as that or is there a mechanism limiting the amount of people reaching a certain level (except their playing time)?<br><br><font color="#a00000">I'll just answer your questions by the number.<br><br>1) Actually, 1,500 is a pretty low number of people on a server. I can't imagine that this was a peak time number. If a server were to have only 1,500 players on at peak times, then during off times it might be nearly impossible to find a group. Though crowding certainly wouldn't be an issue, when the server population gets too low there is a legitimate concern about under population. Though with only 1,500 players on finding more than 10% of them in one zone would be shocking. That's got to be a pretty rare occurrence (not the number of people in Greater Faydark, that's number doesn't surprise me if a server has 2,500 people on line at the time).<br><br>With the addition of Velious (and in relation to your third question), I think 2,500 players on a server at peak times isn't too unreasonable.<br><br>2) I'm not an expert on MUD or MMORG economies, but I'll tell you what I see. Yes, there will be a decrease in the value of items over time in EverQuest. Items don't generally leave the economy. This was a known side effect of the decision to not have items decay or get damaged. For the most part, people don't really enjoy doing maintenance on items. It can become a tedious part of gameplay. And for item decay to really have an effect on the economy, to have it effectively keep prices for items stable, it has to eat up a lot of items. This upsets people and makes gameplay less fun. So given the choice to either have items decay (by whatever method) to 'help' the economy or having them remain as relatively permanent things, the designers of EverQuest decided that relative permanency was the better choice.<br><br>So the relative value of older items, ones that have had more time to become more common, will decrease as time passes. Debates have raged over whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, and they will continue to rage. Personally, I think it's a good thing, as an acceptable alternative to the other options.<br><br>3) Yes, there is a growing population at the higher levels on mature servers. Similar to the point about item decay, the only way to prevent this 'problem' would be to have levels 'decay' by some means. That's also not really going to be popular with players&#8230;<br><br>We've added content for the growing population at those levels. And that helps a lot.<br><br>But if you start a new character on even the oldest of servers, you will notice that the newbie zones are not empty. The influx of new players has been steady. Players that have played for a while will start new characters. People will try playing on a different server to see what the atmosphere is like there. The newbie zones aren't empty at all.<br><br>Alan</font></font></blockquote>

Spam should be minimal now, but you won't know a NPC is mad at you until it smacks you.<br><br>Innoruuk can now see further, so be careful dancing with him now, he knows a few new steps. <br><br>Drop rates are meant to be fairly low on an individual basis, but in bulk the upstairs area yields pretty good loot. The patrolling NPCs have the lowest chance of loot, and some loot you can only get from the statics.<br><br>There is a core issue with this zone that creates the pathing problems and the ability to get whacked from above or below, as well as mystery healing. <br><br>The zone is one of our earlier creations, and the software used to create it was the same we used on all outdoor zones. The problem with that is, NPC collision detection through walls/floors is non-existent. <br><br>The 'new' area has been there since the zone first came up, but wasn't used due to the problems listed above. <br><br>With a few new tools to work with, we felt we could make the neglected real estate usable. <br><br>While I'm not totally satisfied with the pathing/vis issues, I am satisfied that the area is playable, though it requires a bit different play style than most Planar raids. I.E., you can't rely on a static camp and pullers there.<br><br>- Kendrick<br><br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Not much more that I can add. The zone is a lot more interesting than it was before, and a lot better in terms of gameplay. It's not perfect, that's for sure. Completely rebuilding the zone would help, but not enough to warrant the effort. Rebuilding the zone would take the same amount of time that it would take to build new content, and new content would be a better use of that time since the old one is certainly playable and fun.<br><br>Alan</font></font></blockquote>

Now you can use the equipment database, with its over 5,500 Everquest items, and list the items you have for sale for each of your characters (for<br>platinum pieces of course).  This is a great way to sell off items without going through the hassle of /auctioning, and a great way for craftsmen to advertise their wares to the rest of their server.  It<br>is also an easy way to find that item you have always wanted but didn't want to spend the time waiting around hoping it would get auctioned.  All of the items for sale can be searched either by server or right from the item description page.  No auctions and no hassles. All you need to do is arrange through e-mails for the time and place to make the trade. <br><br>Check it out at <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com.">http://everquest.allakhazam.com.</a><br></blockquote>

Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd <text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD).  From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message.

You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<br><br>- /assist changed and improved.  It should be much more reliable now.  It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted.  The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.<br><br>- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that were too far above or below you.<br><br><br>** Skill Change **<br><br>- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food.  We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.<br><br>- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.<br><br><br>** Bug Fix **<br><br>- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users.  This fix will most likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are having problems.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures.  We have decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show no graphics.<br><br>- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been added.<br><br>- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed.  It no longer has the same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.<br><br>- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors.  Tinting was never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look better without it.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous Items **<br><br>- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing the availability of one of the quest items.<br><br>- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.<br><br>- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.<br><br><br>** 'Combine' container changes **<br><br>We've made a change to 'combine' containers.  In order to prevent people from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe.  This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.  But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks.  Their reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.<br><br>We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat.  Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.<br><br>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From Zandar:<br><blockquote><br>Greetings good people, <br><br>I wish to inform everyone where the <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/btheeverquestnewbiezone">New Newbie Zone</a> has been created so that Newbies young and old can participate in the direction and understanding of the wonderful world of Norrath. There is no question the old official forums had outgrown their usefulness, and I can&#8217;t say I blame Verant for removing them. To get the advice and tutelage that has always been prevalent in the Newbie Zone follow the link below, and happy adventuring!<br><br><a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/btheeverquestnewbiezone">The Newbie Zone</a><br></blockquote><br>Thanks Zandar!
