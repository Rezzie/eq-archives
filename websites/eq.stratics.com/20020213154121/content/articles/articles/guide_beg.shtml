                  <div> In an effort to help all those players out there that 
                    are computer and EverQuest illiterate, I have decided to put 
                    together a quick and dirty tutorial of what can be expected 
                    when first installing EverQuest and creating your brand-spanking-new 
                    character. 
                    <p> I realize that many of you out there are relatively new 
                      to Online Computer Gaming, and as such are not versed in 
                      the ways of a massive multi-player environment. This guide 
                      will hopefully prepare you for what to expect and allow 
                      you to not make the mistakes that are so common to newbies. 
                    <p> This guide will start from the moment the user installs 
                      EverQuest and leave off after that user has attained a sufficient 
                      proficiency with the EverQuest world.

                  Generation</font></b> 
                  <div> Starting out, I know many of you out there during the 
                    character creation are asking the question "What am I going 
                    to play?" Well, this question, while seemingly innocent, realistically 
                    has the most impact on not only how you play the game, but 
                    also where you can go in the game. For example, those human 
                    guards just aren't going to like you if you choose a Troll, 
                    Ogre or Dark Elf. Think about what you want to accomplish, 
                    what you want to do and how you are going to (Yes, I am gonna 
                    say it) role-play your character in the game. All these variables 
                    will greatly impact the Class/Race combination you will want 
                    to create. 
                    <p> Once you have selected the Race/Class of your character, 
                      the next step is to create a name. Now I know all you unimaginative 
                      KeWlDoOdZ out there are gonna just love the name generator 
                      that 989 has provided with the game. Simply click the create 
                      name button and a name will appear for you. Clicking again 
                      will change the name. Repeating the process will continue 
                      generating different names, until one you approve of shows 
                      up. Now, for you people out there that are determined to 
                      have a name like Superflykewljoe or something like that, 
                      there is also a name screener that tries to weed out names 
                      that aren't "fanciful." If your name gets rejected, odds 
                      are it is either in use by someone on that server already, 
                      (989 implemented code to prevent duplicate names in phase 
                      3.0) or it just isn't creative. Please, please try to create 
                      a name that is fanciful, one thing the GM's actively do 
                      is change the name of characters that don't fall within 
                      their definition of "fanciful." I knew a monk with the name, 
                      believe it or not, Brucelee, and one day he logged on to 
                      find that the GM's had changed his name.

                  Flight</font></b> 
                  <div> Ok, now you have created a Character, and have clicked 
                    the "Enter World" button. Anxiously awaiting your arrival 
                    in Norrath you grab a Coke, and settle down for some hard 
                    core gaming. Once to splash screen fades out and the screen 
                    brightens, your eyes are met with a beautiful 3D world full 
                    of color, sounds, and movement. Not unlike the hustle and 
                    bustle of everyday life, NPC's & PC's will be wandering around 
                    the city. The first thing I always do is set up my hotkeys. 
                    The hotkeys are located in the lower left of the screen and 
                    number 1-6. You can ascribe actions, skills, sayings, and 
                    personal buttons to these hot buttons, creating shortcuts 
                    that make life in EQ much easier. There are 6 banks of hot 
                    buttons, each of which will hold 6 hot buttons each. Assigning 
                    hot buttons is a simple matter of patience. Every button that 
                    you have for your character can be assigned a hot button. 
                    To assign a hot button, left click and hold the button you 
                    want to make a hot button. After about a second the button 
                    will come off and actually take place of your mouse pointer. 
                    (The upper left hand of the floating button will act as the 
                    tip of the arrow for purposes of clicking on things if you 
                    need to move around to get back to your hot button bank.) 
                    Take your floating button and left click in the hot button 
                    box you want it to go into. This should drop the button into 
                    the hot button box and can now be accessed through the hotkeys 
                    1-6. For example, lets say you have the Bash skill. Drop the 
                    Bash skill button in hot button box # 4, and every time you 
                    press the 4 key, if you have an NPC targeted, your character 
                    will bash. **Important to note, the game does not differentiate 
                    between a monster NPC and a merchant NPC..bashing or attacking 
                    will work on both without discrimination** You can access 
                    the different banks but holding the shift key and pressing 
                    1-6. Shift+2 will take you to the second bank of hotkeys. 
                    An alternate method of reaching the different banks is provided 
                    for those less dexterous, simply click the left/right arrow 
                    buttons above the hotkey buttons and you can scroll through 
                    the hotkey banks. A good button that is used A LOT is the 
                    "Personal" button, it essentially opens up your inventory 
                    and allows you to take a look at all that gold you have, or 
                    all those nifty items you have collected, I suggest making 
                    that one a hotkey. 
                    <p> Now that you have assigned the buttons that you want to 
                      hot keys, its time to take a look at your inventory. If 
                      you assigned the personal button a hot key, hit that hotkey 
                      now, and you will bring up a framed windowed view that has 
                      a picture of your character in the upper right hand side. 
                      You can still see what is going on out there, but it also 
                      allows you to see what you have in your inventory. From 
                      here you can click on the button just above your picture, 
                      and open up the inventory slots screen. This screen allows 
                      you to see what you are currently wearing and using as a 
                      weapon. At the bottom of this screen, it also lists the 
                      funds you currently have on hand. 
                    <p> In your inventory you will have differing things depending 
                      on your Race/Class. However, all characters start with the 
                      same basic items. 1 newbie weapon, 2 notes, 5 Food & 5 Water. 
                      Of the 2 notes, one is a PK note and one is your guild note, 
                      right click once on either of the notes and you can read 
                      the note to find out which is which. Right click and hold 
                      over any object in your inventory will give you a brief 
                      description of the item. Single left click on the item will 
                      pick the item up and replace your mouse pointer with that 
                      item. There is also a button above your inventory that says 
                      "Destroy" picking an inventory item up and clicking this 
                      button will irrevocably destroy that item. The only item 
                      you may want to destroy at this time would be the PK note. 
                      Keep the rest. Try playing around with the different items 
                      and the functionality of mouse usage in EverQuest. Once 
                      you have had enough of that, go ahead and left click on 
                      your newbie weapon and drop it into the inventory slot for 
                      your right hand. Guards in this land don't mind crazy psychos 
                      running around brandishing weapons!!! 
                    <p> Once you have your nifty weapon in your hand, read the 
                      guild note, (remember to single right click on the note 
                      to read it). The guild note details who you need to give 
                      the note to in order to join your guild, be it Necromancer 
                      or Paladin. The city you started in will contain your guild, 
                      and guildmaster, so no need to journey outside just yet, 
                      unless you absolutely want to. If you do decide to leave 
                      without giving the guild note to the guildmaster, remember 
                      that if you meet an untimely demise your guild note will 
                      disappear and be lost forever. Finding the guildmaster may 
                      be a bit of a problem. Some of the cities in Norrath are 
                      just plain huge. Freeport for example comprises 3 zones 
                      all its own. Simple trial and error, and aid from other 
                      players online will soon get you to your guild. Once there 
                      left click on the guild note, and drag the note over the 
                      body of the guildmaster. Left clicking on the guildmaster 
                      with the note in hand will bring up the trade window. Click 
                      the Trade button located at the bottom left of the screen 
                      and your guildmaster will welcome you to the guild. You 
                      will also get a small amount of experience points for completing 
                      this relatively easy quest.

                    skills, that means you can currently practice that skill and 
                    increase it. If a number appears under that skill, then you 
                    have to achieve that level before you can train in that skill. 
                    You get a certain number of practice points per level, 5 to 
                    be exact, and you start out the game with 5 practice points. 
                    You can technically put these points anywhere you want, but 
                    initially I usually give them to one of my weapon skills. 
                    (one handed blunt or one handed slashing) depending on the 
                    newbie weapon I have. It makes an extreme difference when 
                    you finally decide to tackle the wilds of Norrath. Skills 
                    at low levels will increase rapidly, and each level has a 
                    "skill cap." Not gonna see many 2nd level warriors out there 
                    with a 100 one handed slashing. A combat skill, by which I 
                    mean defense, offense, piercing, one handed slashing, etc, 
                    can increase by 5 points per level. A good way to judge how 
                    close you are to the max for your level is to take your level 
                    and multiply by 5. For example a max one handed slashing for 
                    a 10th level warrior is 50. As you progress in level skills 
                    increase slower, and as such, the skills that you acquire 
                    at higher levels (riposte, dual wield, parry, disarm, etc) 
                    will take more effort on your part to increase. Most people 
                    ascribe to saving practice points from the lower levels and 
                    applying them to skills you get at higher levels since these 
                    skills raise slower. Good practice if I do say so myself.

                  <div> EverQuest has recently had a major addition to the playability 
                    of the game, and basically has added a completely now aspect 
                    of the world, Trade skills. Some minor skills were available 
                    prior to this huge installment (tailoring & fishing for example) 
                    but now you can do most anything, from attempting to create 
                    that most expensive metal armor, to backing cookies and bread 
                    and everything in between. I have toyed around with the smithing 
                    skill for the past couple days, and let me tell you, it is 
                    just down right hard. I don't think that we have to worry 
                    much about seeing newbies running around in plate mail for 
                    a while yet. I have been saving all my practice points for 
                    my new charcter I created in phase 4 for this very experiment, 
                    I have a level 14 rogue now, and all but about 10 points were 
                    sacrificed for the sake of smithing. (Basically I have about 
                    a 60 smithing skill). Out of 5 attempts I was able to create 
                    1 banded tunic, and 1 set of banded arms. The rest went down 
                    the toilet. At about 5-6 plat a pop for the try it can get 
                    real expensive. Well, to give you some general information 
                    about trade skills: 
                    <p> Every trade skill has a book that you can read that will 
                      teach you how to use the skill, what materials you will 
                      need, what templates you need, and in what quantities. 
                    <p> All trade skills require to have a template of some sort, 
                      which is destroyed when you attempt to create whatever it 
                      is you want to make, regardless if you succeed or not 
                    <p> The materials you are using will also be destroyed whether 
                      successful or not. 
                    <p> Trade skills generally go up on there own very slowly 
                      (My tailoring skill has maybe gone from a 20 to a 23 the 
                      entire time I have played, and I have made bunches of leather 
                      armor for people, my smithing skill has not moved at all 
                      on its own) 
                    <p> I cant speak personally about the other skills, but they 
                      all seem to work pretty much the same way, give em a try 
                      and see what you can create!! 
                    <p> After training in what you want, now is the time to find 
                      your way outside the city and practice what you learned!! 
                      Find the exit to your city, or in the instance you are in 
                      Kelethin, find a lift, and journey into the wilds of Norrath. 
                      You will be visited with wide-open plains, dense forests, 
                      and steamy deserts. You can go anywhere you like, however, 
                      it is probably not a good idea to journey too far from home 
                      until you gain some real life experience in Norrath. There 
                      will be plenty in your home zone that you can use to gain 
                      experience from until you feel comfortable to journey farther.

                  <div> While an unfortunate aspect of adventuring, chances are 
                    that at some point in time during your career you will face 
                    the uncertainty of your ultimate demise. Never fear, death 
                    while unwanted, is not permanent in the land of Norrath. However, 
                    it can be extremely disheartening and simply a pain. Upon 
                    your resurrection you will find yourself back at either your 
                    starting city or a point where you have had your affinity 
                    bound to. It is an either/or situation, you can only have 
                    your affinity bound to one location at a time, good sense 
                    tells you to get bound to wherever in Norrath you are going 
                    to be doing your adventuring. Bind affinity is a sell only 
                    castable by the magical classes. Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians 
                    and Necromancers can all learn the Bind Affinity spell at 
                    12th level. Clerics, Druids and Shaman can learn the spell 
                    at 14th level. Problems arise when you are in a Greater Feydark 
                    and meet and untimely demise and find yourself in Halas. (Unfortunately 
                    a true scenario in my case J) Death at low levels (1st through 
                    3rd) can actually have beneficial side effects. Your food/water 
                    is restored, and it allows you to instantly regain all your 
                    hitpoints, and at this low level there are absolutely no penalties 
                    for dying. Problems arise after reaching 4th level and are 
                    detailed below: 
                    <p> 4th level: 
                    <div> 
                      <blockquote>At about 25% of your health, you cannot run 
                        as fast, and at about 15% you can no longer run. If you 
                        die at 4th level your newbie weapon and food does not 
                        spawn with you when you resurrect. </blockquote>
                      5Th and above: 
                      <div> 
                        <blockquote>If you die you lose experience points, and 
                          can lose levels if the experience point loss drops you 
                          to under the experience requirement for the current 
                          level you are at. Experience loss is conditional depending 
                          on what level you are at, the higher level you get the 
                          higher loss as a percentage of your experience you lose 
                          when you die. For example, a level 10 warrior would 
                          lose more exp as a total of his exp. Bar than a level 
                          5 warrior. (Realistically, at 10th level if you die 
                          you lose about 10% of your current exp. Bar, or about 
                          ½ a bubble, at 5th level you can hardly notice a difference 
                          in your experience points from dying)</blockquote>
                        <p> Single Right Clicking on NPC's will give you an idea 
                          of the toughness of the monsters, called /con, anything 
                          red pretty much stay away from, white (or black if using 
                          the windowed mode) is pretty much an even battle, and 
                          blue is lower level than you, green is pretty much an 
                          easy kill. 
                        <p> By now you have gained a pretty good understanding 
                          of the basics of mouse and keyboard functionality of 
                          the game. I will leave you here to continue your EQ 
                          education by saying you now have all the knowledge you 
                          need to develop yourself in the lands of Norath. Have 
                          patience, and your rewards will be great. Don't try 
                          to rush headlong into situations, when time permits 
                          analyze and adjust to the situation, when not do your 
                          best, and if things go badly do not be afraid to run.
