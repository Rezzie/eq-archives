I don't blame you, the thrill of saving someone's life can be a real rush, much more than killing your umpteenth critter of the day. Everyone always wants to group with you, and you are very popular even outside of a group. Wait and see how many tells you get asking for a cure for this or that malady. But why a Dwarf? Many races can play a successful cleric. A Human cleric is very well balanced and gains experience faster, but cannot see in the dark, probably the biggest reason they are shunned. A High Elf has a higher wisdom, making them the more powerful cleric in the long run, but are less suited for solo play, and it can be a real challenge when trying to wear plate and carry loot with a 60 strength. A Dwarf, on the other hand, can solo longer than any of the other races, can actually do some decent damage in combat, and besides, they look great doing somersaults in those pointy patchwork hats.<p>First, read the excellent <a href="classes_cle_st.shtml">Guide to Playing a Cleric</a>. This guide is more of a supplement, and only considers dwarf clerics for the first nine levels or so. Up until that point, everyone is pretty much on the same path, trying to get the same spells, same equipment, and fighting in the same areas. At level nine and up you really start to come into your own as a cleric, and your character will start to develop his or her own personality. You will have a wider range of areas in which to hunt or adventure, buy or find unique items, and generally become more of an individual. From these medium levels onward there is no particular cookbook method to develop your character or a "best way" to build; you will have to find your own way depending upon what you want to do. However, there are tried and true strategies to get to those medium levels faster and better equipped, which is what this particular guide is all about.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>   </tr></table><br><br><a name="create"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>    <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Creating a Character</font></b><div>Put all the extra points you can into wisdom. Your main role will be to cast spells, and your wisdom will determine the amount of mana you have to do this.<p>For the remaining points, I suggest putting them into agility. Dwarven agility is not exactly renowned. Don't put any points into stamina; your starting stamina is already higher than any other race that can play a cleric. And forget about strength too. Again, it is already higher than any non-dwarven cleric, and while it will help a bit in the lower levels, sooner or later you will have to group. At this point you will not be expected to fight hand-to-hand; hybrid classes will be better than you at this, and the pure classes of warriors and monks will be much, much better. You will, however, be expected to jump in every once and a while and take some damage, to draw a monster away from your tanks. This is why you can wear platemail, after all. In this function as dwarven punching bag, your added points into agility will also help you take less damage.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td> </tr></table><br><br><a name="one"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>       <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Level One</font></b><div>Go immediately to the cleric temple located in North Kaladim. Put all of your five training points into one-handed blunt. On the way out, stash your PK note in the bank, or just destroy it if you know you will not be taking that route.<p>The first spell that you should purchase is Strike, your essential ranged attack for the time being. Not only will it assist you in damaging your opponents, it will allow you to draw them into combat. Instead of chasing a creature until you are within melee range, you can cast Strike and watch it run to you. In addition, killing off fleeing enemies is much easier with Strike in your memory. Don't expect this spell to dole out a great deal of damage (approximately 7 points at lower levels), but be sure to have it on hand in order to take advantage of its other purposes.<p>For your first three levels, you are given a little extra leeway when you die. You come back with your starting weapon, four bread and water, and do not lose any experience. More practically, this means that you don't have to spend your precious silver and copper pieces on food and water - just die instead. When you get a message saying you have run out of food, or get those "you are thirsty and you are hungry" messages, go somewhere near the gates of Kaladim and get yourself killed. It is pretty easy - just cast Strike on yourself until you die. It helps you practice evocation too. If you can't kill yourself before your mana runs out, you will need to find a creature to help you along. Stay away from the chicks and guards however; they can lower your faction standing. Just remember where you die, and don't die too close to any object (wall, rock, etc.) that can hide your body. You can save many, many gold pieces by using this trick, enough to buy an extra spell when reaching level 5.<p>Note that for your clerical spells, you can increase your skill levels quite fast by casting them on other players. For example, healing spells cast on other people improve your alteration skill (whether they need healing or not). Casting Strike on other people will increase your evocation, and won't affect them as long as you do not have your PVP switch on.<p>Some of the above recommendations may not be preferrable to some, who prefer to strictly roleplay their character. To put it best, the above courses of action are strictly optional.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>        </tr></table><br><br><a name="two"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>       <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Levels Two & Three</font></b><div>Put all your training points into one-handed blunt, and get back out there. Don't worry about buying any patchwork armor yet, you will most likely not be able to afford it at this point and won't truly need it until about level 4 or 5, as long as you are careful about what you fight.<p>Remember to make ample use of the spell Courage at this point. This will help increase your hit points and armor class, and is worthwhile, ifnot very effective at lower abjuration skill levels. By this point, however, you should have ample mana enough to burn on keeping Courage up at all times. Also, make sure you cast it on other people--this will not only raise your abjuration skill a bit, but assist your fellow dwarves as well. Many a thanks will await you if you just take a moment to assist your fellow players. And, again; this really helps raise abjuration.<p>Around this stage of your life, your small horde of currency should start developing. At this point you have two options: begin filling your spell book with rank 1 spells (spells such as Cure Poison and Flash of Light can really come in handy) or save up for armor. If you decide to take the armor route, start saving gold and silver until you have enough to purchase patchwork armor from your fellow players. It may be a while before you can purchase a full set, but the added AC is well worth the money; even after devoting your extra attribute points to agility, dwarves still suffer from low dodge percentages and AC. You should also consider purchasing a small buckler as soon as possible--not only does it add to your appearance, but increases your AC by a few points as well. Regardless of which path you choose for your early coins, remember to save enough to purchase two or three rank 2 spells, which will become available to you at level 5.<p>Last but not least, keep your eyes open for a rusted mace/warhammer or a splintering club. These are reasonably cost effective and, if you choose a rusty weapon, will further remove your appearance from that of a newborn dwarf. Once you hit level 4, your newbie weapon will disappear upon dying--you'll need a good but cheap weapon to replace your starting club.<p>If you remember, kill yourself near the end of this level to get more food and water (again, only, my preferred method--this is utterly optional). As soon as you reach level 4 this trick won't work anymore.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>  </tr></table><br><br><a name="four"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>      <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Level Four</font></b><div>You are now able to train the skill channeling. This is an essential skill that will enable you to cast spells faster, and make it somewhat harder for you to be interrupted if you are hit during casting (although don't expect too much help here - even at very high channeling it is easy to be interrupted). For your training, buy one point. It will go up very fast, as you will be casting quite a bit. The rest of your training points should go into one-handed blunt.<p>Look for those creatures that give you more cash, such as large skunks (which can give you scent glands) and decaying skeletons that have weapons visible. Remember to let the skunk stink wear off before you sell anything, however, or merchants may not give you the best deal!Sometime during this level, make sure you have a backup weapon and extra cash in the bank. After this level, you will no longer get anything back when you die. If you are not prepared, you will have to beg strangers for enough cash or equipment to get started again, never a good way to gain a good reputation.<p>Also, from this level onward you can consider travelling to other areas. The choice is somewhat limited, as if you go too far you will probably be killed. The two most obvious choices are the newbie areas around Kelethin and Freeport. Kelethin is about ten minutes run away. Just turn left out of the main gate of Kaladim, and at every fork in the road turn left again. Freeport is a bit more complicated; turn right out of Kaladim, and in about 3-4 minutes you will be at the docks. Wait for a boat at the longest dock, and take it to Freeport (about a 20 minute ride). Before travelling to either area, make sure you go to the bank first, and vault all of your stuff. If you go at Level 5 or below and get killed, it is no big deal as you don't lose experience.<p>If you do go, make sure you get someone to cast a Bind Affinity on you once you reach your destination, so if you die you will not end up back outside of Kaladim. This spell binds your spirit to a particular city.<p>Of the two choices, my favorite would be Freeport. It is easier to get to, as you don't have to run through some of the more dangerous areas of the Butcherblock Mountains. The newbie areas around Freeport (out of the West and South gates) also have some very decent creatures, including fire beetles, which can net you up to four silver each if you are lucky. At level four and above you also can go to the East Commonlands (the first zone past the West gate), which has lots of fire beetles and other good creatures. Don't venture too far beyond the inn although, as it can get pretty dangerous at your level. The East Commonlands, although sometimes a bit dangerous (watch out for the pumas and bears!), will increase your bank account by a great deal. All of these areas have the advantage of being relatively flat, which means you spend less time looking for creatures to kill. If you are getting into hilly areas at this level, you have gone too far.<p>Why travel at all, when everything you need is in the Butcherblock Mountains? For a few reasons. First, it is a lot of fun to be a lower-level dwarf in these areas, and you will be somewhat unique. For many new characters, you will be the first dwarf they have ever seen. Second, you will get to see more of the wonderful world of Norrath. Each area is very different, and has its own charms. Third, there are already a lot of clerics in the Butcherblock Mountains, as dwarves are a popular choice for this class. You will find far fewer numbers of clerics outside Kelethin and Freeport, and therefore be more in demand for groups. Finally, you will get to know some areas that will become very important later on. Some of the best areas in the game for mid-level characters are Crushbone (outside of Kelethin) and the fabled dungeon of Befallen (in the Commonlands).<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>        </tr></table><br><br><a name="five"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>      <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Level Five</font></b><div><!--In addition, beyond level 3, you no longer get back any food or water when you die. Luckily, there is a very good food source available: Fish. When you train at this level, buy four points in fishing. You should not spend just one point as in other skills - it will increase by itself, but you are more likely to break your pole (at over one gold piece each) with only one point.<p>-->At this level onward you will lose experience when you die. Remember this well, and use far more caution when travelling and engaging in combat.<p>Use your one training points as desired--I recommend that you either save 4 for the future or train your highest spellcasting skill--but regardless, invest one into your hand-to-hand skill, which will double your damage in unramed combat. This will be important in the future in case you are disarmed, and is also important to kill newbie critters in case you die and somehow have no money (but of course that should not happen, should it?). In any case, you will need to learn this skill sometime, and a point is not a big deal. Better to learn it before you need it, which could be anytime from this point onward.<p>Next, go buy a fishing pole and bait, even before you go buy your new spells. You don't want to find out you don't have enough money later on. Relax for a while, and try your hand at fishing. You can fish anywhere there is water, including many of the streams inside Kaladim. Don't worry about breaking your pole, keep fishing as it won't be unusable until the third break. If you have some extra time, fish some more and sell the excess.<p>Congratulations! You can now buy your second rank spells. First, buy Summon Drink, which is extremely inexpensive compared to other spells of this rank. The money you save by not buying water will soon allow you to buy another second rank spell. Next, get Light Healing. You should have enough saved to immediately buy these two spells, and if you have been lucky in hunting you have enough to buy a third, which should be Holy Armor. Gate is fun, but at this point you can walk home and save some money. You should not be that far away from your home point at this level anyway.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>   </tr></table><br><br><a name="six"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>       <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Levels Six & Seven</font></b><div>The first thing you should do upon reaching level six is to go and buy that old first rank spell Divine Aura you were probably wondering about. Basically, this spell gives you temporary immunity to attacks, and can be a real life saver. You don't really need it before this point, as dying is no big deal. Once you memorize it, it takes a few minutes to appear, as this spell can only be used a limited number of times a day. Practice using it in combat a few times, just to get the timing right for when you really need it.<p>You should devote all of your practices from both levels 6 and 7 exclusively towards your spellcasting skills. Upon reaching level 6 or so, it is no longer a good idea to save training points, as higher level skill points rise very quickly. The higher a skill, the more it succeeds, and, therefore, the faster it climbs.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>  </tr></table><br><br><a name="eight"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Level Eight</font></b><div>Now spend all but one of your available practices on a single spellcasting skill (or two, if you cannot train your chosen skill anymore). As for your remaining point, allocate it towards the Meditate skill, which will have just come available to you. As with Channeling, a single practice will teach you the basics and future skill points will be gained rapidly through repeated use. There will be a lot less sitting around waiting for your mana to come back from here on out.<p>At this point (or earlier for those daredevils), you should be able to solo skeletons (the real kind, not the decaying ones), although you still probably want to stay away from skeletons that have weapons if you are alone. However, you will need to buy Ward Undead if you want to go this route. It can take four hits of this spell or more to take down a skelly, so you need to be able to time it correctly. Make sure you leave enough mana for Divine Aura and be close to some guards when first starting out, just in case.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>        </tr></table><br><br><a name="nine"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>      <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Level Nine</font></b><div>First things first: buy Create Food. Don't throw away your fishing pole yet, however, as there is still money to be made when waiting for those boats.<p>The next spell (which you should have enough money for) should be either Center or Hammer of Wrath. Center is better if you are grouping a lot, as it really helps out the tanks by giving them more hit points. Hammer of Wrath is better if you are soloing more, as it gives you a great one-handed weapon. You should get both as soon as possible, however. There are a lot of little decisions like this to be made from here on out, as you now have a choice of many different paths to travel... <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>      </tr></table><br><br><table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=908070 width=80%>  <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1></td>  </tr>   <tr>            <td align="center"><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;<div align="center">Author: TooMuch Coffee (Edited by Den)<div align="center">Additional: Gnimsh<div>&nbsp;</td>       </tr>   <tr>            <td bgcolor=f0f0f0><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&copy; Copyright 2000 Stratics.
