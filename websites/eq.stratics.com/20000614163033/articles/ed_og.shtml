<div>
 Well, as the days get longer and longer and the final release of EverQuest gets nearer and nearer, I can't help but look back at my nine years as a participant in the online gaming industry. For me, it all started playing a game known as "Lords" on a local BBS. I remember the old ANSI graphics; long scrolling and unclear. I remember the text as the game loaded up my character at the Inn, and watching as the host server informed me, in the same text-based chatter, of the crowd drinking in the Inn's common room. Due to the way Lords was set up on the BBS, only one person could be logged on at a time, and you would use keyboard shortcuts to choose options from an ANSI menu of what you wanted to do. There were quite a number of options, as I remember it, ranging from going to the Fair and playing a guessing game to going to the Fields of Challenge in the town center and taking on Dreaded Knight, the BBS host's unbeatable character.
 <p>
 In total, there were only about 25 people who played the game, but the same interaction between players was present even then... the surprise when you logged expecting the daily routine of killing monsters and gaining experience and gold, only to find the message, "Angel has broken into your room at the Inn and killed you!". But the real thrill of online gaming was missing, the direct player-to player-interaction, not blocked by a computer host. This type of game held some thrill over a single player adventure in those days, but it was not truly an online game in the sense that we now use the word. Still, I look at "Lords" and see the roots of the same player archetypes I often see today: the powergamer, the die-hard roleplayer, and the player killer.
 <p>
 After I got bored playing BBS role playing games, It was time to move on to something on a larger scale. I had recently received an AOL disk in the mail, and, lacking an online service, decided to try it. I signed on to AOL and discovered, hidden behind its many inefficient employees and vaults of boring and perverse chatrooms, an online AD&D game called "Neverwinter Nights" (Or "NWN" as it was more colloquially named). NWN was my first true multiplayer online experience. The 500 person server was small in comparison to the ones that are now hosting thousands simultaneously, but then again the game was not all that large in itself, comprised of perhaps 20 areas of 124 screens each (very small when compared to today's games). The EGA graphics weren't all that stunning, but they didn't need to be. NWN had what every online game must have but that none can guarantee: a sense of community. When a newbie got into a fight out of his range of power, passing players would see it and inquire if he needed help. Why? Because they cared about the game and felt like they identified with the people who played it.
 <p>
 Neverwinter Nights was not all that challenging, but it was fun to play with others, and that is what made it outstanding as an online game. I joined my first guild there, and am with it to this day, waiting to expand into the waiting world of Norrath. I have to say that what made NWN a great game made the people I game with a great guild, the sense of friendliness beyond greed that makes a guild hold fast through hard times during which many fall apart.
 <p>
 Unfortunately, NWN eventually fell apart. There were several reasons for this. First and foremost, the way NWN was designed, your character and all the game data were stored on your computer, not the host. This made hacking rampant. I would have to say that nearly half the population of Neverwinter Nights, however friendly, used a cheating program called XGM which made the game quite easy. Second, the graphics and sound in NWN were definitely not state of the art. They were EGA, which only allows 16 colors. Anyone who has played any of the gold box series of games from TSR knows the engine which ran NWN quite well, and the quality of the graphics therein. 
 Third, NWN was a game on AOL, which anyone who has used AOL extensively knows is a major flaw in itself. This was a major contributor to the cheating factor within the game, I think, because the people who played NWN were AOL customers, and as is commonly known, AOL is fraught with hackers and such to no end.
 <p>
 Sufficed to say, NWN was taken down by AOL in 1994. Apparently the staff had grown tired of all the endless cheating and the game itself brought in when compared to actual revenue, as it was free to play as long as one paid the $20 a month for AOL. 
 So, with my guild looking for a place to go and wondering what would come to replace NWN, I started looking for a new thrill. What I found was Darksun Online, yet another online AD&D game. This game ran on a overhead view rather than a first-person one like NWN, and ran with a full and whopping 256 colors. Composed of a somewhat larger landscape than NWN, Darksun Online also had, on some level, a great sense of community.
 <p>
 But the reason for this community was a flawed one; the game itself was not all that difficult. Players would get together and stand, up to 50 in number, around a statue and building in the center of the main city and chat out of boredom. The game was quite simple in fact, once you had a max'ed-out character (which took about a week and a half or so if you knew the game) you could take on any quest or beastie in the land without a problem. This was, for me, the downfall of Darksun Online. Though the staff and people were great, and would get together about once a week and make a great quest, between these quests there really was not much to do.
 <p>
 So, having communicated with some of my guild brothers who had migrated to the land of Britannia, I canceled my DSO account and went on, as so many did, to play Ultima Online, having heard the media hype on how great it was going to be.
 <p>
 UO was not so much a bad time to me as a learning experience. I think this is the way it was for many people. The ideas about working for your money in ways other than adventuring, and in this way creating a player-driven economy were not bad, but they had never been properly tested, as a game of this type had never been attempted. the UO engine was fun to play with, and the combat system worked, but I think UO put too much trust in the players. They expected, indeed gambled, on the fact that the players would want to work to create a sense of community. This was the error of Ultima Online. Gamers as a whole did not want to work for two hours before going out for a few hours of adventuring. Most did not want to work hard to form a community with other players. They wanted these things provided for them, so they could simply hook up with some friends and go adventuring, and become rich doing it. When UO players found that they could not do this, they turned to bug-exploiting and player killing as a quick fix for their fun. While this may have worked for the individual player on a small scale, when everyone started doing it, it destroyed the overall sense of fun present in the game. Britannia quickly became more of a bug exploiting free-for-all than a fantasy environment. And so, looking at that world in dismay as a lost opportunity, I left.
 <p>
 Now I sit at 11 o'clock on this quiet, snowy Monday night writing this very editorial. All I can think as I close it is that for our brave new world of Norrath to gain that intangible sense of community, players, designers, guides, bug-exploiters and powergamers must work together with open minds and a spirit of adventure in order to make EverQuest the best that it can be. If everyone who will participate in the game does so with the goal of having good, constructive fun toward the ultimate goal of creating the best ORPG on the market, that is exactly what EQ will become. Remember that we all have a piece of the power within our grasp to make or break this game.
