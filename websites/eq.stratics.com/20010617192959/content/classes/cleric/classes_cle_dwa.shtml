                    you want to be a cleric, do you? I don't blame you, the thrill 
                    of saving someone's life can be a real rush, much more than 
                    killing your umpteenth critter of the day. Everyone always 
                    wants to group with you, and you are very popular even outside 
                    of a group. Wait and see how many tells you get asking for 
                    a cure for this or that malady. But why a Dwarf? Many races 
                    can play a successful cleric. A Human cleric is very well 
                    balanced and gains experience faster, but cannot see in the 
                    dark, probably the biggest reason they are shunned. A High 
                    Elf has a higher wisdom, making them the more powerful cleric 
                    in the long run, but are less suited for solo play, and it 
                    can be a real challenge when trying to wear plate and carry 
                    loot with a 60 strength. A Dwarf, on the other hand, can solo 
                    longer than any of the other races, can actually do some decent 
                    damage in combat, and besides, they look great doing somersaults 
                    in those pointy patchwork hats. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, 
                      read the excellent <a href="classes_cle_st.shtml">Guide 
                      to Playing a Cleric</a>. This guide is more of a supplement, 
                      and only considers dwarf clerics for the first nine levels 
                      or so. Up until that point, everyone is pretty much on the 
                      same path, trying to get the same spells, same equipment, 
                      and fighting in the same areas. At level nine and up you 
                      really start to come into your own as a cleric, and your 
                      character will start to develop his or her own personality. 
                      You will have a wider range of areas in which to hunt or 
                      adventure, buy or find unique items, and generally become 
                      more of an individual. From these medium levels onward there 
                      is no particular cookbook method to develop your character 
                      or a "best way" to build; you will have to find your own 
                      way depending upon what you want to do. However, there are 
                      tried and true strategies to get to those medium levels 
                      faster and better equipped, which is what this particular 
                      guide is all about.</font>

                    all the extra points you can into wisdom. Your main role will 
                    be to cast spells, and your wisdom will determine the amount 
                    of mana you have to do this. </font>

                      the remaining points, I suggest putting them into agility. 
                      Dwarven agility is not exactly renowned. Don't put any points 
                      into stamina; your starting stamina is already higher than 
                      any other race that can play a cleric. And forget about 
                      strength too. Again, it is already higher than any non-dwarven 
                      cleric, and while it will help a bit in the lower levels, 
                      sooner or later you will have to group. At this point you 
                      will not be expected to fight hand-to-hand; hybrid classes 
                      will be better than you at this, and the pure classes of 
                      warriors and monks will be much, much better. You will, 
                      however, be expected to jump in every once and a while and 
                      take some damage, to draw a monster away from your tanks. 
                      This is why you can wear platemail, after all. In this function 
                      as dwarven punching bag, your added points into agility 
                      will also help you take less damage.</font>

                    immediately to the cleric temple located in North Kaladim. 
                    Put all of your five training points into one-handed blunt. 
                    On the way out, stash your PK note in the bank, or just destroy 
                    it if you know you will not be taking that route. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      first spell that you should purchase is Strike, your essential 
                      ranged attack for the time being. Not only will it assist 
                      you in damaging your opponents, it will allow you to draw 
                      them into combat. Instead of chasing a creature until you 
                      are within melee range, you can cast Strike and watch it 
                      run to you. In addition, killing off fleeing enemies is 
                      much easier with Strike in your memory. Don't expect this 
                      spell to dole out a great deal of damage (approximately 
                      7 points at lower levels), but be sure to have it on hand 
                      in order to take advantage of its other purposes.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
                      your first three levels, you are given a little extra leeway 
                      when you die. You come back with your starting weapon, four 
                      bread and water, and do not lose any experience. More practically, 
                      this means that you don't have to spend your precious silver 
                      and copper pieces on food and water - just die instead. 
                      When you get a message saying you have run out of food, 
                      or get those "you are thirsty and you are hungry" messages, 
                      go somewhere near the gates of Kaladim and get yourself 
                      killed. It is pretty easy - just cast Strike on yourself 
                      until you die. It helps you practice evocation too. If you 
                      can't kill yourself before your mana runs out, you will 
                      need to find a creature to help you along. Stay away from 
                      the chicks and guards however; they can lower your faction 
                      standing. Just remember where you die, and don't die too 
                      close to any object (wall, rock, etc.) that can hide your 
                      body. You can save many, many gold pieces by using this 
                      trick, enough to buy an extra spell when reaching level 
                      5.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note 
                      that for your clerical spells, you can increase your skill 
                      levels quite fast by casting them on other players. For 
                      example, healing spells cast on other people improve your 
                      alteration skill (whether they need healing or not). Casting 
                      Strike on other people will increase your evocation, and 
                      won't affect them as long as you do not have your PVP switch 
                      on.</font>

                      of the above recommendations may not be preferrable to some, 
                      who prefer to strictly roleplay their character. To put 
                      it best, the above courses of action are strictly optional.</font>

                    out there. Don't worry about buying any patchwork armor yet, 
                    you will most likely not be able to afford it at this point 
                    and won't truly need it until about level 4 or 5, as long 
                    as you are careful about what you fight. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember 
                      to make ample use of the spell Courage at this point. This 
                      will help increase your hit points and armor class, and 
                      is worthwhile, ifnot very effective at lower abjuration 
                      skill levels. By this point, however, you should have ample 
                      mana enough to burn on keeping Courage up at all times. 
                      Also, make sure you cast it on other people--this will not 
                      only raise your abjuration skill a bit, but assist your 
                      fellow dwarves as well. Many a thanks will await you if 
                      you just take a moment to assist your fellow players. And, 
                      again; this really helps raise abjuration.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Around 
                      this stage of your life, your small horde of currency should 
                      start developing. At this point you have two options: begin 
                      filling your spell book with rank 1 spells (spells such 
                      as Cure Poison and Flash of Light can really come in handy) 
                      or save up for armor. If you decide to take the armor route, 
                      start saving gold and silver until you have enough to purchase 
                      patchwork armor from your fellow players. It may be a while 
                      before you can purchase a full set, but the added AC is 
                      well worth the money; even after devoting your extra attribute 
                      points to agility, dwarves still suffer from low dodge percentages 
                      and AC. You should also consider purchasing a small buckler 
                      as soon as possible--not only does it add to your appearance, 
                      but increases your AC by a few points as well. Regardless 
                      of which path you choose for your early coins, remember 
                      to save enough to purchase two or three rank 2 spells, which 
                      will become available to you at level 5.</font>

                      but not least, keep your eyes open for a rusted mace/warhammer 
                      or a splintering club. These are reasonably cost effective 
                      and, if you choose a rusty weapon, will further remove your 
                      appearance from that of a newborn dwarf. Once you hit level 
                      4, your newbie weapon will disappear upon dying--you'll 
                      need a good but cheap weapon to replace your starting club.</font>

                      you remember, kill yourself near the end of this level to 
                      get more food and water (again, only, my preferred method--this 
                      is utterly optional). As soon as you reach level 4 this

                    are now able to train the skill channeling. This is an essential 
                    skill that will enable you to cast spells faster, and make 
                    it somewhat harder for you to be interrupted if you are hit 
                    during casting (although don't expect too much help here - 
                    even at very high channeling it is easy to be interrupted). 
                    For your training, buy one point. It will go up very fast, 
                    as you will be casting quite a bit. The rest of your training 
                    points should go into one-handed blunt. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Look 
                      for those creatures that give you more cash, such as large 
                      skunks (which can give you scent glands) and decaying skeletons 
                      that have weapons visible. Remember to let the skunk stink 
                      wear off before you sell anything, however, or merchants 
                      may not give you the best deal!Sometime during this level, 
                      make sure you have a backup weapon and extra cash in the 
                      bank. After this level, you will no longer get anything 
                      back when you die. If you are not prepared, you will have 
                      to beg strangers for enough cash or equipment to get started 
                      again, never a good way to gain a good reputation.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, 
                      from this level onward you can consider travelling to other 
                      areas. The choice is somewhat limited, as if you go too 
                      far you will probably be killed. The two most obvious choices 
                      are the newbie areas around Kelethin and Freeport. Kelethin 
                      is about ten minutes run away. Just turn left out of the 
                      main gate of Kaladim, and at every fork in the road turn 
                      left again. Freeport is a bit more complicated; turn right 
                      out of Kaladim, and in about 3-4 minutes you will be at 
                      the docks. Wait for a boat at the longest dock, and take 
                      it to Freeport (about a 20 minute ride). Before travelling 
                      to either area, make sure you go to the bank first, and 
                      vault all of your stuff. If you go at Level 5 or below and 
                      get killed, it is no big deal as you don't lose experience.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      you do go, make sure you get someone to cast a Bind Affinity 
                      on you once you reach your destination, so if you die you 
                      will not end up back outside of Kaladim. This spell binds 
                      your spirit to a particular city.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
                      the two choices, my favorite would be Freeport. It is easier 
                      to get to, as you don't have to run through some of the 
                      more dangerous areas of the Butcherblock Mountains. The 
                      newbie areas around Freeport (out of the West and South 
                      gates) also have some very decent creatures, including fire 
                      beetles, which can net you up to four silver each if you 
                      are lucky. At level four and above you also can go to the 
                      East Commonlands (the first zone past the West gate), which 
                      has lots of fire beetles and other good creatures. Don't 
                      venture too far beyond the inn although, as it can get pretty 
                      dangerous at your level. The East Commonlands, although 
                      sometimes a bit dangerous (watch out for the pumas and bears!), 
                      will increase your bank account by a great deal. All of 
                      these areas have the advantage of being relatively flat, 
                      which means you spend less time looking for creatures to 
                      kill. If you are getting into hilly areas at this level, 
                      you have gone too far.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why 
                      travel at all, when everything you need is in the Butcherblock 
                      Mountains? For a few reasons. First, it is a lot of fun 
                      to be a lower-level dwarf in these areas, and you will be 
                      somewhat unique. For many new characters, you will be the 
                      first dwarf they have ever seen. Second, you will get to 
                      see more of the wonderful world of Norrath. Each area is 
                      very different, and has its own charms. Third, there are 
                      already a lot of clerics in the Butcherblock Mountains, 
                      as dwarves are a popular choice for this class. You will 
                      find far fewer numbers of clerics outside Kelethin and Freeport, 
                      and therefore be more in demand for groups. Finally, you 
                      will get to know some areas that will become very important 
                      later on. Some of the best areas in the game for mid-level 
                      characters are Crushbone (outside of Kelethin) and the fabled 
                      dungeon of Befallen (in the Commonlands).</font>

Luckily, there is a very good food source available: Fish. When you train at this level, buy four points in fishing. You should not spend just one point as in other skills - it will increase by itself, but you are more likely to break your pole (at over one gold piece each) with only one point.<p>-->At 
                    this level onward you will lose experience when you die. Remember 
                    this well, and use far more caution when travelling and engaging 
                    in combat. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use 
                      your one training points as desired--I recommend that you 
                      either save 4 for the future or train your highest spellcasting 
                      skill--but regardless, invest one into your hand-to-hand 
                      skill, which will double your damage in unramed combat. 
                      This will be important in the future in case you are disarmed, 
                      and is also important to kill newbie critters in case you 
                      die and somehow have no money (but of course that should 
                      not happen, should it?). In any case, you will need to learn 
                      this skill sometime, and a point is not a big deal. Better 
                      to learn it before you need it, which could be anytime from 
                      this point onward.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, 
                      go buy a fishing pole and bait, even before you go buy your 
                      new spells. You don't want to find out you don't have enough 
                      money later on. Relax for a while, and try your hand at 
                      fishing. You can fish anywhere there is water, including 
                      many of the streams inside Kaladim. Don't worry about breaking 
                      your pole, keep fishing as it won't be unusable until the 
                      third break. If you have some extra time, fish some more 
                      and sell the excess.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congratulations! 
                      You can now buy your second rank spells. First, buy Summon 
                      Drink, which is extremely inexpensive compared to other 
                      spells of this rank. The money you save by not buying water 
                      will soon allow you to buy another second rank spell. Next, 
                      get Light Healing. You should have enough saved to immediately 
                      buy these two spells, and if you have been lucky in hunting 
                      you have enough to buy a third, which should be Holy Armor. 
                      Gate is fun, but at this point you can walk home and save 
                      some money. You should not be that far away from your home 
                      point at this level anyway.</font>

                    first thing you should do upon reaching level six is to go 
                    and buy that old first rank spell Divine Aura you were probably 
                    wondering about. Basically, this spell gives you temporary 
                    immunity to attacks, and can be a real life saver. You don't 
                    really need it before this point, as dying is no big deal. 
                    Once you memorize it, it takes a few minutes to appear, as 
                    this spell can only be used a limited number of times a day. 
                    Practice using it in combat a few times, just to get the timing 
                    right for when you really need it. </font>

                      should devote all of your practices from both levels 6 and 
                      7 exclusively towards your spellcasting skills. Upon reaching 
                      level 6 or so, it is no longer a good idea to save training 
                      points, as higher level skill points rise very quickly. 
                      The higher a skill, the more it succeeds, and, therefore,

                    skill anymore). As for your remaining point, allocate it towards 
                    the Meditate skill, which will have just come available to 
                    you. As with Channeling, a single practice will teach you 
                    the basics and future skill points will be gained rapidly

                      be able to solo skeletons (the real kind, not the decaying

                      will need to buy Ward Undead if you want to go this route. 
                      It can take four hits of this spell or more to take down 
                      a skelly, so you need to be able to time it correctly. Make 
                      sure you leave enough mana for Divine Aura and be close 
                      to some guards when first starting out, just in case.</font>
