              <p>
              <blockquote>I haven't heard much from the everquest folk about pets 
                and dual wield since the "quick fix" went into effect several 
                weeks ago to allow mage pets to dual wield. I have begun to wonder 
                if the problem ever will be addressed further. 
                <p>I for one am not satisfied with the current state of things 
                  -- my pets can in fact dual wield, but only after a considerable 
                  time investment for each pet. Summoning a pair of daggers for 
                  my pet increases the time cost for summoning a pet by at least 
                  a factor of 2. Not only is it an annoyance from a player's standpoint, 
                  but it still is inconsistent with the game world, elementals 
                  should not need weapons -- ever -- to improve their fighting 
                  effectiveness. It also greatly reduces the effectiveness of 
                  one of my favorite soloing tactics -- the chain cast. When a 
                  pet is near dead, and I summon another to replace it, I don't 
                  have the time to hand off a pair of weapons before sending it 
                  into battle. 
                <p>Don't get me wrong, I am glad that the good people at Verant 
                  realized their mistake with npc's and dual wielding and took 
                  quick steps to patch it. What bothers me is that what I once 
                  thought was intended as a "quick fix" now appears to be thought 
                  of as a permanent one. I want the development team to know that 
                  we mages and necromancers are not satisfied with this fix as 
                  permanent, that it is effecting our gameplay adversely, and 
                  that it is an issue that we strongly believe needs to be dealt 
                  with. 
                <p>If I am wrong in assuming that the issue has been closed by 
                  Verant, please let me know. If not, I hope to hear that it will 
                  be reopened to set things right in the realms of Norrath.

                <font color="a00000">Demonhands pretty much hit the nail on the 
                head when he said: <br>
                "This was a code problem from day one. It resulted in Verant beefing 
                up all the mobs to account for the fact that dual wield wasn;t 
                working (and they couldn't figure it out for themselves). For 
                them to fix it now would require that they either beef up all 
                characters or otherwise reduce the power of all mobs. In either 
                case, it's more work than they want to do." 
                <p>Rebalancing the entire game just to fix one bug correctly would 
                  yield tons of other bugs, take a long time, and be painful for 
                  everyone. Yes, you have to hand your pet weapons should you 
                  want him to dual wield, and it is a bit at odds with the game 
                  world in general, but after much thought, it was the option 
                  that was the least suseptable to additional problems.

              <p>I was on Fennin Ro last night around 9:30pm EST, when a broadcast 
                message came up about the Fennin Ro server split. The plan was 
                that, for one hour, Verant would be logging the names of characters 
                who entered the /movelog command. The first 1200 people logged 
                would have their accounts moved to the new server on Tuesday the 
                29th.
              <p>As you might expect, the Fennin Ro population suddenly soared 
                to over 2700, and there was a whole new world of lag for everyone. 
                After about fifteen minutes, more broadcast messages came. These 
                told us all that, for whatever reason, the logging process had 
                not been successful and was being called off.
              <p>They plan to try again tonight, 29th February, at around the 
                same time. Hopefully, it will go well this time, although while 
                it is underway the lag will probably be nasty.
              <p>Good luck to everyone making the move; you'll be missed!

                  The gods determined that fate would prevent the army of Light 
                  from reaching Nektulos forest! Athelan, voice of the gods, announced 
                  that the might of our army was so great that we caused a great 
                  rent in the fabric of the world... our magics were too much 
                  for the mortal world to withstand. Many were lost as the world 
                  openned up and swallowed uswhole! 
                <p>Fate did throw a few of us through this great chasm to land 
                  within Nektulos cut off from the rest of our forces. As we set 
                  about final negotiations for the exchange the Forces of Darkness 
                  pounced upon our meager forces. Treachery was afoot!

                <p>After a truly spectacular battle, Paben finally delivered the 
                  killing blow and slew Balar. And thus the victory to Darkness.
                <p>/ooc<br>
                  As a result of Saturday's events we are going to be trying even 
                  harder to spread the conflict across the lands to avoid overloading 
                  a single zone. We ask commanders on both sides to work together 
                  to plan encounters across the lands.
                <p>Also to weed out those only interested in bloodlust we have 
                  decided to prohibit killing. If this makes no sense to you then 
                  you're in the wrong event. The Light vs Darkness concept is 
                  to give players a break from the boredom of camping spawns, 
                  more roleplay, the challenge of team combat against intelligent 
                  opponents and the chance to be part of a larger and ongoing 
                  story.

            <div> Greetings!<BR>
              <BR>
              The Stratics Message Forum has migrated to a new software platform. 
              The UBB software you have become accustomed to are no longer to 
              be used. They are set for READ ONLY as a courtesy so that you may 
              review old messages. That is why youare receiving the error message 
              that you have described. Until further notice I am bringing the 
              UBB forums down because of this confusion.<BR>
              <BR>
              The migration was completed just last night so some of the Stratics 
              web sitesmay not have updated their links to the new script yet. 
              I apologize for the confusion - I did have all of the web sites 
              post a message in the News regarding this migration.<BR>
              <BR>
              The new Stratics Forums can now be found here:<BR>
              <BR>
              <A HREF=http://boards.stratics.com>http://boards.stratics.com</a><BR>
              <BR>
              Once the site you normally visit has updated it's links, you may 
              begin using that method to access the categories and forums you 
              prefer directly. Keep in mind, that we have migrated the user accounts 
              from the UBB to the new software. So your old username and password 
              will work just fine. You do not need to register again.<BR>
              <BR>
              If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me 
              anytime.<BR>

                <BR>
                (Gordon)Yes, but only due to superior weapons. And no, I'm not 
                talking about the Raincaller alone. I'm talking about the Windstriker.

                <BR>
                (Gordon)I've never used it as an argument. Someone else brought 
                it up the other day. Warriors could make the statement "Aren't 
                we supposed to be the masters of Armed combat?", and since the 
                Bow is a weapon, they'd have a point. Of course, there's also 
                a staff in the game that has a ratio higher than 1, so I guess 
                they'd have a point about that as well. <BR>
                <BR>
                (The players)Our spells are best mana/dmg ratio of any class. 
                Great, and 10,000,000 ants can kill a bear. See my point? Knew 
                you would.<BR>
                <BR>
                (Gordon)Actually, no, I don't see your point.<BR>
                <BR>
                (The players)Archery is not meant to be a primary combat ability.<BR>
                <BR>
                (Gordon)This is correct. <BR>
                <BR>
                (The players)Well, rangers see it otherwise. <BR>
                <BR>
                (Gordon)I'm sorry, but you are a ranger, not an Archer. <BR>
                <BR>
                (The players)Rangers are the masters of tracking. Not if druids 
                keep beating us to MOB's. Tracking is broken, always has been. 
                We're only complaining now because you've made the druid and bard 
                tracking cap higher, thus making it more viable for their class 
                than our's. <BR>
                <BR>
                (Gordon)Tracking is not broken. It works as it should. Could it 
                work better? Sure. But I'm not going to commit to improving it 
                at present. <BR>
                <BR>
                (The players)Anyway... Ranger's are complaining, we haven't in 
                the past. We're going to keep complaining <BR>
                <BR>
                (Gordon)Feel free. Everyone else will too. Rangers are a very 
                good class, way up there in total utility. If you don't see that, 
                I'm sorry, but it doesn't change anything. <BR>

                between <b>4:00pm</b> and <b>6:00pm</b> PST. The UBB forums will 
                be closed to the public for the duration of the conversion process. 
                Once the accounts have been fully migrated and tested, the UBB 
                will be brought back online as a searchable archive. We will retain 
                the UBB forums for a period of 60 days.
              <p>We are very excited about this migration because the new software 
                offers a huge assortment of options for you, our visitors. The 
                mere fact that our forums will be running on an SQL backend ensures 
                lightning fast performance, particularly with page loads and searches.
              <p>Remember, your account information will be converted to the new 
                forums, you will <b>not</b> need to register again. It should 
                be noted that we wanted to move the messages from the UBB to the 
                WWWThread, but due to time restrictions we decided to migrate 
                only the user accounts.
              <p>We hope you enjoy the new forums. Please be patient and learn 
                how to use them &#8211; once you do, you&#8217;ll be very happy 
                that you did. These forums are the most flexible and user friendly

              <FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote>Only recently did a red faced Verant admit to their 
                failure and fixed<BR>
                the Alchemy problem.<BR>
                <font color=#a00000> Well yes, we've apologized about this, but 
                the logic that you are<BR>
                presenting, "They were wrong about alchemy so they must be wrong 
                <BR>
                about everything else" is just a little flawed. <BR>
                <BR>
                As for the FA, if you are expecting to say, "Hail an_npc00", and 
                him<BR>
                to reply "Hello there! Here is your [Fiery Avenger]", it will<BR>
                be a *long* time before you find this quest. <BR>
                <BR>
                Just want to confirm something though Abashi, it is a artifact 
                right?<BR>
                <BR>
                No, an "Artifact" is the name given to a unique item (unique=1 
                per<BR>
                server). For instance, the Butcherblock Hammer is an<BR>
                Artifact. There will never be more than 1 Butcherblock hammer 
                per<BR>
                server. <BR>
                <BR>
                Why do you have to make it a habit to give ambiguous answers to 
                <BR>
                precise questions? (Rhetorical Question)<BR>
                <BR>
                Even though you've labled this question as Rhetorical, I'd like 
                to<BR>
                answer it. If you'll look at the original authors post, he did<BR>
                not ask any questions. He made statements. As for<BR>
                the "answer" being ambiguous, it was intentionally so. I'm not 
                going<BR>
                to give clues. <BR>
                <BR>
                As to your other question, yes it [the quest] has been verified. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                As I told you earlier, there is no mention of this weapon in the 
                lore<BR>
                of EQ and no way to connect the FA with any particular sect or 
                sects.<BR>
                <BR>
                Ideally, you wouldn't know about the weapon until someone found 
                it.<BR>
                However, since word of the weapon "got out" back in beta,<BR>
                we've announced it with a bit of fanfare. I imagine that once 
                someone<BR>
                figures out how to start the quest, it will move along at<BR>
                a pretty good pace, but to tell people where that start is (or<BR>
                even give clues) would cheapen the experience.<BR>

                <p>During my adventures through the lands of Norrath, I haveencountered 
                  many things. I have seen goodness, kindness andfriendship as 
                  well as evil, hatred and treachery. I have seenGods in all their 
                  splendor fall beneath the blade of warrior.And yet none of these 
                  things could prepare me for what I wasto encounter one faithful 
                  night while traveling through theKaranas. I would share my story 
                  with you, and the gift thatwas bestowed upon me.
                <p>Whilst traveling through the Karanas on my quest to rid itslands 
                  of evil gnolls, I did happen upon a camp of bandits.Fierce though 
                  they were, they had no wish to fight this night.So I did share 
                  with them my Mead and Spirits, and they too sharedthings with 
                  me. They spoke of battles and deeds, women and wine.As the night 
                  drew on and our unlikely friendship grew, they didreveal to 
                  me what has been kept secret from all others outsideof their 
                  own. They did show me that which binds all bandits ofNorrath 
                  together. It is not trust, for how can their be trustamongst 
                  thieves. It is not love, for love requires trust. Thatwhich 
                  holds their society together is no more than a game. A gamewith 
                  great risk and involvement. One that can not be manipulatedor 
                  cheated. They call this game Everjack. It is complex in it'ssimplicity. 
                  Men have become kings from the outcome of but a singlegame. 
                  They did teach it to me, and now, I teach it to you.
                <p>The game requires a set of magical dice(the /rand command).
                <p>The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible 
                  withoutgoing over. There is no limit to the number of people 
                  that canplay. Everyone must agree on a fair wager for the outcome 
                  of thegame(say 1 platinum or something like that). The magical 
                  dice mustbe rolled to see who goes first. Going first is not 
                  advantageous, sothe person with the lowest number must go first 
                  and the person withthe highest number goes last.
                <p>Next, you must roll the magical dice with a maximum of 21 as 
                  theoutcome. Should that person roll a 21 on this first try, 
                  theyhave achieved EVERJACK and will win the game providing no 
                  one elsealso rolls a 21 on the first try. If the roll is less 
                  than 21, theperson may roll again, but only for a maximum of 
                  11 as the outcome.They may do this as often as they like to 
                  achieve 21. If theyexceed 21 as their total, they lose. All 
                  losers pay the agreed uponwager to the winner. There can only 
                  be ONE winner! If a 0 is rolled,that player is allowed to reroll. 
                  This means that if a 0 is rolledon the initial first roll of 
                  21, the player may reroll that 21. Inthe event of a tie, those 
                  who tied play another game as a tie breaker.The losers of the 
                  previous game would then pay the winner of thetie-breaking game. 
                  ANYTHING CAN BE WAGERED! Platinum, Items, Etc.
                <p>WARNING: This game is highly addictive and has the potential 
                  toMake you LOTS AND LOTS of Platinum. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

                <P>No, no one ever said you were. 
                <P><B>If so, why is our cap below warriors, and monks. If not, 
                  please stop using this arguement in posts</B>
                <P>See above.
                <P><B>Are we the masters of archery?</B>
                <P>Yes, but only due to superior weapons. And no, I'm not talking 
                  about the Raincaller alone. I'm talking about the Windstriker.
                <P><B>If so, why is our cap below warriors?If not, please stop 
                  using this arguement in posts</B>
                <P>I've never used it as an argument. Someone else brought it 
                  up the other day. Warriors could make the statement "Aren't 
                  we supposed to be the masters of Armed combat?", and since the 
                  Bow is a weapon, they'd have a point. Of course, there's also 
                  a staff in the game that has a ratio higher than 1, so I guess 
                  they'd have a point about that as well.
                <P><B>Our spells are best mana/dmg ratio of any class. Great, 
                  and 10,000,000 ants can kill a bear. See my point? Knew you 
                  would.</B>
                <P>Actually, no, I don't see your point.
                <P><B>Archery is not meant to be a primary combat ability.</B>
                <P>This is correct.
                <P><B>Well, rangers see it otherwise. </B>
                <P>I'm sorry, but you are a ranger, not an Archer. 
                <P><B>Rangers are the masters of tracking.Not if druids keep beating 
                  us to MOB's. Tracking is broken, always has been. We're only 
                  complaining now because you've made the druid and bard tracking 
                  cap higher, thus making it more viable for their class than 
                  our's. </B>
                <P>Tracking is not broken. It works as it should. Could it work 
                  better? Sure. But I'm not going to commit to improving it at 
                  present.
                <P><B>Anyway... Ranger's are complaining, we haven't in the past. 
                  We're going to keep complaining </B>
                <P>Feel free. Everyone else will too. Rangers are a very good 
                  class, way up there in total utility. If you don't see that, 
                  I'm sorry, but it doesn't change anything.

                <BR>
                <B>PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY</B><BR>
                <BR>
                We are in the process of finalizing plans to implement a split 
                of the Fennin Ro server as announced a few weeks ago. At the time 
                the split occurs, players from Fennin Ro will be moved to the 
                new server on a voluntary basis. Current Fennin Ro players that 
                wish to have all their characters moved from Fennin Ro to the 
                Split Server will need to register for the move.<BR>
                <BR>
                The registration log will be opened on Monday during prime-time 
                hours. A server-wide Broadcast will be made on Fennin Ro to announce 
                that the Move Registration Log is open. Furthermore, a patch message 
                will be placed at that time to give the information to incoming 
                players. <b>PLEASE DO NOT ASK THE GM/GUIDE STAFF THE TIME THAT 
                THE REGISTRATION LOG WILL OPEN. EXECUTING THE REGISTRATION COMMAND 
                PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT REGISTRATION IS OFFICIALLY OPENED WILL 
                HAVE NO EFFECT AND MAY IMPAIR YOUR ABILITY TO REGISTER AT THE 
                PROPER TIME.</b> <BR>
                <BR>
                Once the registration log is open, and assuming you are a current 
                <B>FENNIN RO</B> player, you may register for the move to the 
                Split Server by logging into a character on Fennin Ro, and executing 
                the command '/movelog yes' (without the quotes). <B>YOU MAY NOT 
                CANCEL THIS REGISTRATION AFTER IT HAS BEEN ISSUED.<BR>
                <BR>
                PLEASE NOTE:</B><BR>
                <BR>
                The physical move should occur on the following day (Tuesday). 
                We will be moving people on a first-come-fist-serve basis, based 
                upon the order that you executed the /movelog command. The number 
                of people that will be moved is unknown at this time.<BR>
                <BR>
                Moves will be made without regard to guild or group, meaning that 
                should you choose to execute the /movelog command, you may be 
                separated from your friends. In addition, your guild affiliations 
                (guild-tags) will not carry over to the new server. You will need 
                to establish new guilds when you arrive.<BR>
                <BR>
                Some additional important notes:<BR>
                <BR>
                1. If you are selected for the move, all of your characters currently 
                on Fennin Ro will be moved to the new server. Those characters 
                will retain all of their equipment. We recommend that all characters 
                settle any outstanding debts over the next few days. <BR>
                2. You will not receive any confirmation or feedback in regards 
                to whether or not you have been moved. If you log on and find 
                your characters missing from Fennin Ro, you will find them intact 
                on the new server.<BR>
                3. <B>CORPSES WILL NOT BE MOVED.</B> If you have a corpse in the 
                world, and you are moved, your corpse will not follow. Any equipment 
                that was on the corpse will be lost and will not be subject to 
                a reimbursement of any kind.<BR>
                4. As mentioned above, once you register by executing the /movelog 
                command, it may not be revoked.<BR>
                5. The move is one-way. If you are selected for a move, you will 
                not be moved back.<BR>
                6. No special consideration will be made to keep groups or guilds 
                together. It is recommended that you do not execute the /movelog 
                command unless you are willing to risk separation from your friends.<BR>
                7. The GM/Guide Staff will not be able to tell you if you have 
                or have not been selected, but should be able to clarify general 
                information in regards to the move.<BR>

              <blockquote>Sent in by Caaro-
                <p>Last night, after rumors of a coordinated intervention by the 
                  Knights of Truth against the corrupt Freeport Militia, a combined 
                  Multi-League assault was mounted on West Freeport.
                <p>Although reports are still sketchy, it appears that the attack 
                  began without coordinating efforts with the Knights of Truth, 
                  and as a result, the initial skirmishes were bloody and seemingly 
                  without order.
                <p>Swiftly, Sir Lucan D'lere, leader of the Freeport Militia fell 
                  beneath the blade of the Paladins of Prophecy, his prized Testimony, 
                  so sought by the Hall of Truth was triumphantly held aloft and 
                  carried back to the Hall. After that, the tide swiftly turned 
                  against the Corrupt Militia as more and more troops loyal to 
                  Truth arrived in the city, attempting to end the sinister hold 
                  of darkness that had oppressed the streets of Freeport for so 
                  long.
                <p>As the Captain of the guard fell, the long awaited reinforcements 
                  arrived from the Knights of Truth - yet it was not the legion 
                  of Shining Warriors we had hoped for. A lone Knight of Truth 
                  appeared at the West Gate, seemingly out of nowhere. "Sir Lucan 
                  must die" he cried, running, blade drawn, into the now secured 
                  Militia House. Alas, when he reached the chambers of Sir Lucan, 
                  he cried "Where is the Fallen Knight?" and then withdrew, presumably 
                  back to the hall of Truth in North Freeport.
                <p>Still hopeful that more aid would come, the Forces of light 
                  held on toThe Militia House, the West gate and had all but eliminated 
                  every Militia guard in West Freeport. For one rising and setting 
                  of the Sun, the battle raged, more and yet more Militiamen fell 
                  under the swords of the Paladins, the hammers of the Clerics 
                  and the swift, deadly sorcery of the Mages, Wizards and Enchanters 
                  who had joined the fray. By the setting of the sun on the second 
                  day, the streets ran red with the blood of corruption, dented 
                  helms of slain Militiamen scattered all over.
                <p>Yet still, no further reinforcements from the Hall of Truth 
                  arrived. 
                <p>Although casualties were extremely light, the Forces of Light's 
                  assault began to falter, their sword arms heavy with fatigue. 
                  The near endless supply of Militia reinforcements from East 
                  Freeport, and the seemingly futile attempt by the lone Knight 
                  of Truth, who appeared each time the Captain of the guard was 
                  slain, to bring down Sir Lucan began to take it's toll on the 
                  valiant but tired troops.
                <p>A staged withdrawal began, yet at this point, not all got the 
                  message and some of the valiant, particularly those battling 
                  the steady stream of Militia reinforcements, were cut off as 
                  yet another wave of Corrupt Militia men poured forth from the 
                  now recaptured Militia House. Even so, only a few of these brave 
                  freedom fighters fell as they strove to reach the safety of 
                  East Commons.
                <p>With my magic hiding me from sight, I surveyed the now vacated 
                  battlefield. The hated Milita guards were returning to their 
                  posts and the streets, once again, returned to their usual state. 
                  My heart was slowly filling with despair, and I quietly mourned 
                  those who had fallen attempting to bring light into these darkened 
                  streets of Freeport. Yet all was not in vain. I took comfort 
                  in the fact that our Forces COULD indeed take and hold this 
                  city - that, we had proved. Now all that remained was finding 
                  out how to let the Paladins from the Hall of Truth take over 
                  where we had left off.
                <p>As I departed the city, the morning rays of dawn warming my 
                  back, I vowed never to give up until the once fair city of Freeport 
                  could be rid of this foul darkness.

                this area. But what was unusual was the dark shadow fallowing 
                the tribe of barbarians as they hunted down the evasive Ice Giants 
                that had been terrorizing there village. The tribe sent there 
                best men out, there name given to them was the Forsaken Avengers, 
                lead by the warrior princess Sundancer, and for spiritual support 
                was Benorm the tribes high shaman. They had finaly found the lair 
                of the giant when all of a sudden they heard a bone shattering 
                shreek as one of there members was backstabed and almost droped 
                to the ground. But the battlehardened group quickly regrouped 
                to catch a glimps of what was tackingthem. It was a guy, atleast 
                in apearance, although it moved like a cheeta and jumped like 
                kangaroo. It was constantly finding the flesh of whoever left 
                there back open to attack. End the end it came down to a quick 
                thinking spell of malaisment to lower this Dark Assasin's resistances 
                and then the group pounded it to a pulp.
                <p>/ooc this was the from what we understand the fist time any 
                  group has killed this guy since he came in with the last patch,

                  one of the hardest free moveing mobs, backstabing up in the 
                  460's and hitting hard, and found in newbie zones!!!!
                <p>It took 5 casts on malaisment to get it to stick to this guy.

                Renza, Age 53) was well liked by many in Norrath and other on-line 
                worlds. GM Lady Daegarmo of Veeshan has scheduled a funeral event 
                for our guild <Chaotic-Order> and friends to pay last respects. 
                This event will take place on Saturday, Feb 26th, 3pm Pacific 
                in the Temple of Solesk Ro, by Tazgar. The ceremony will include 
                Durwood's corpse, a few words said by some of our guild officers, 
                Durwood's body committed to the Lava, a toast with "Gnomish Spirits", 
                and some of us will take a naked lava bath to sacrifice some exp 
                in his honor (He fell in Lava a lot, a personal guild thing). 
                GM Lady Daegarmo will then transport all to the Ocean of Tears 
                where "Something Special" will happen that Verant was kind enough 
                to do. All who knew him are welcome to come and pay last respects.

                ---------------------<br>
                Today's patch was primarily comprised of server-side changes in 
                preparation for the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark. 
                Only one gameplay-affecting issue was updated as a result of this 
                patch:
                <p>- Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you 
                  to re-spawn with zero mana.
                <p>This change was implemented to counter a strategy used by casters 
                  where they would duel to reduce downtime between fights, thus 
                  allowing groups to engage creatures that they normally would 
                  not be able to.

                it was about 3 patches ago, and was announced at the time. As 
                for its current status, it is our belief that the drop rate is 
                too low at present *for the initial zone clearers*. However, merely 
                upping the drop rate so that it is right for the initial zone 
                clearers will yeild a drop rate too high for those who come in 
                afterwards.

                caps are not based off of level, but off the items that you make. 
                As such, increasing those caps would necessitate the creation

                I know that Soulfires are somewhat common on most of the servers,

                Mountains with the group of 5 other guild members we got approached 
                by Majestic GM Bard with a Drake pet. She asked us to call others 
                to hear Her song. We called other folks in zone, and having gathered 
                close to 15 folks she sang us a song. The following link will 
                take you to a page on our Web site where we have wrote Her exact 
                words. You may not copy those words to your site for 5 days, but 
                please post a link to this page on your "Latest News" on your 
                site because she has asked us to spread the word to Norrath.<br>

              <blockquote>Our concept for Forces of Light vs Forces of Darkness 
                is intended to be open to all players, all levels, all guilds. 
                However due to the inablity of some players to respect their opponents 
                we will begin to remove those who earn a poor reputation. Remember 
                - do NOT attack someone recovering their corpse, do NOT turn off 
                your guildtag (unless you are not participating that day), allow 
                a beaten opponent to flee (do NOT chase them down to deliver a 
                death blow) and avoid using DoT spells to kill (DoT spells are 
                only allowed as your FIRST attack).<br>
                <br>
                Saturday's events and battles will range primarily from Grobb 
                to Nektulos. Do not cluster together for huge battles. Do NOT 
                engage in combat in the Tunnel to Ro. The Tunnel to Ro (in East 
                Commons) is generally considered a market area on Saturdays and 
                as such is a neutral zone where you will be expected to respect 
                your fellow players and NOT engage in combat.<br>
                <br>
                Guildwar will be turned on at 4 PM (Central) so make sure you 
                get invited BEFORE then, we can not invite during guildwar. Please

                <br>
                Last Saturday the heretic Eldrad and the traitor Uglar made a 
                vicious attack on our proud city of Neriak. They slaughtered many 
                of our brothers and sisters and I defeating Uglar, making him 
                flee the town did not even help, he was back later and his revenge 
                was sinister. Innoruuk demand a revenge for these terrible crimes! 
                Therefor I am this Saturday gathering the Dark Brethren for a 
                attack on the very heart of the weak ones, Felwithe! Our goal 
                will be to slay two of the pale ones key citizens, General Jyleel 
                of the Paladins and if Innoruuk is with us, the leader of the 
                very Clerics, Terren Starwatcher.<br>
                <br>
                OOC: This event will be for those of the level 35 and up, considering 
                that the opposition is tough. We will gather in Greater Faydark 
                at the wizard spires at 2 p.m. PST, heading for Felwithe as soon 
                as groups have been organized and we are ready. A warning, there 
                will be no experience but negative on this raid most likely and 
                as far as loot concerns none will be there either. This is a roleplaying 
                and fun event (as Uglar and Eldrad showed us last weekend) and 
                if everyone live their character for a evening this might be a 
                great event. I ask for not too many spectators to come as the 
                lag will probably be high anyway.<br>
                <br>
                With Innoruuk&#8217;s help and our pure hatred we shall be victorious!<br>

              <blockquote>Yesterday the Forces of Light and Forces of Darkness 
                battled repeatedly for at least seven hours over the tunnel to 
                Ro. I've had many wonderful reports of this concept and many complaints. 
                Let's all try to have some patience to get the problems worked 
                out. We also need the cooperation of everyone to NOT attack players 
                recovering their corpses. And *please* leave your guildtags on 
                at all times (do NOT use /roleplay or /anon). If we don't fight 
                with honor, soon there will be no fight at all. Still, all in 
                all it's a great start.
                <p>I'd like to thank Bera, Farilea, Tenil, Shader, Serra, Safka 
                  andMackenzie (probably a few others too) for helping to bring 
                  rganization to the chaos.
                <p>Saturday will continue the conflict with a raid on Grobb (beginning 
                  atapprox 4 PM Central time) and the Cloth of Tunare exchange 
                  (beginning at approx 6 PM Central time). We need more leaders 
                  to step forward and take charge of the Forces of Darkness.

                all that the proposed Light raid on Clan Crushbone is tonight, 
                WEDNESDAY, at 8pm Central Time Zone. We will meet at the Orc Lift 
                and clean out my forest of all the orcs on the way to Crushbone. 
                Then we will enter and run the grounds red with Orc blood!
                <p>But, I must warn you. Being a Scout, I snuck into places many 
                  fear to go and learned of a proposed invasion of my forest by 
                  the Dark races. After warning several friends and guilds in 
                  hope that my information was false... it turned out it wasn't. 
                  This eve the Darks attacked and with the help of the Gods, they 
                  fought a losing battle. When the Gods spoke, darkness took us 
                  ALL away from Greater Faydark for the good half of twenty to 
                  thirty minutes. Upon returning, the Dark faction raiding our 
                  forest was divided and made up of mostly lost individuals. Several 
                  fell to valiant warriors on the side of Light, but several also 
                  got lucky and took the lives of our brave defenders. But their 
                  battle was already lost and they scattered in the wind at the 
                  will of the Gods on our side. Perhaps if their god didn't hate 
                  them so much, he may have sent them help like ours did!
                <p>The only thing I fear is that some of these cowards of darkness 
                  will still be around on the eve of the Light raid on Clan Crushbone. 
                  So I ask all those with light in their heart to please show 
                  up and offer your assistance!

                the formation of the E'ci Raids webpage. This webpage is where 
                everyone on E'ci can post their planned raids and thus fix the 
                problem of having many message boards where people have to post 
                this information to get the word out. Thank you all for your time 
                and enjoy!

                <p>A woman stood outside Qeynos gates shouting for an escort to 
                  Halas Bank for her and her 3 brothers. They were merchants who 
                  came down to Qeynos to get more product for their parents who 
                  own a shop in Halas. After realizing that this was a GM event 
                  (you were not able to see the girl who was shouting inventory 
                  when coning) we got a large group together of 20-25 people and 
                  headed out to halas. This event was fun but rather annoying... 
                  The GM's said they had no weapons and had to be protected, but 
                  every time a monster ran by they would jump in front of it and 
                  get attacked. Also they would wander off and not follow the 
                  group and when the rest noticed they would stop and cry out 
                  for their brothers safety. When running through Paw one stopped 
                  at the stream to get a drink and wouldn't move on until someone 
                  gave him a few bottles of water. Likewise, when we eventually 
                  got to halas one of them refused to swim across since "his cousin 
                  drowned as a child". Ugh!
                <p>Anyways, when all said and done, we got them all there safely 
                  and one of them (Caprai) gave us all a reward. I only got 25gp 
                  for this 1 1/2hour hike but it was my first GM event since the 
                  hordes invaded at the end of the final beta so I guess it was 
                  alright... Next time though how about some unique armor or weapons!!!

              <blockquote>On Feb. 17, a Council of Guilds for the Karana server 
                was voted on and approved by leaders and representatives from 
                about 20 guilds. I've established a web site for the Council which 
                includes forums for discussion, voting, a list of members with 
                links to their web sites, a gallery, and a description of our 
                vision for furthering the player community and player-driven events 
                on the Karana server. As well, there is a log of the meeting held 
                last Thursday night. Visit <a href="http://go.to/karanacouncil">http://go.to/karanacouncil</a>

                I deliver a message to all of you.
                <p>The time is coming. It has been long since theFestival of the 
                  Faydark has been celebrated in theGreat Wood. There is evidence 
                  of this everywhere. TheOrcs of Crushbone and the foul Teir'dal 
                  of Mistmooretaint the air that we all breathe. The last time 
                  I wasin Kelithin the stench was so foul it nearly made melose 
                  the contents of my belly(about 6 pints of mead).The traditions 
                  of the Eldar Days are almost forgotten,only a handful of the 
                  Protector know the secrets ofthe Festival, but the secrets are 
                  only secrets untilthe time of the great Reclamation, the climax 
                  of thefestival. Then all will be clear. But at the heart ofwhat 
                  we are doing is trying to get the elvishcommunity to come together 
                  and represent our finecities as well as the great ones who dwell 
                  in theFaydark. But the High council needs people to helpwith 
                  the preparations which must be made. 
                <p>OOC. Please feel free to post anything about thistopic, from 
                  ideas for events to ideas for some kind ofroleplaying event. 
                  There are possiblities, I haveseveral things that I am working 
                  on. I plan tenitivlyto do this events in 2-3 weeks, most likely 
                  three. Butit will take some time. I am gonna try to enlist thehelp 
                  of the leaders of the other elvish guilds throughthe collective.

                terrorizing the forests around the cities of Kelethin and Felwithe. 
                We have verified these reports and have volunteered to assist 
                the locals in an attempt to eliminate this threat.<br>
                <br>
                We are seeking volunteers with 10 to 20 seasons experience and 
                a yen for adventure, to aid us in a Raid on Crushbone. We will 
                attempt to clear the zone of the Crushbone Orcs, their Emperor 
                and his entourage, the evil Ambassador Dvinn and free the captured 
                slaves. When we are through, those that are left, if any, will 
                think twice before venturing into Greater Faydark for quite some 
                time. On Saturday Feb 26 we will assemble our forces in northern 
                GF outside the entrance to Crushbone. It is strongly recommended 
                that groups be formed before the start. At 10am EST (US), The 
                charge will be sounded and the attack will begin. <br>
                <br>
                /ooc ... For this Roleplaying event we will provide Teleport services 
                from the Qeynos hills area to Greater Faydark. and possibly from 
                the Druid Ring in the commons to Butcherblock. Teleports will 
                cease just before the beginning of the event. Return trips to 
                the major Druid/Wizard spots will begin soon after the event has 
                ended and will run for a short period. Bindings will be provided 
                in Greater Faydark as well. It is recommended that if you plan 
                to attend this event, you become somewhat familiar with the zones 
                in this area. Because of the usually high player usage of this 
                area, this event was scheduled in the morning and will not exceed 
                1.5 hours. GMs will be invited to attend.<br>

                NWN Stratics covers news, information and strategy for BioWare's 
                Neverwinter Nights. Based on the Dungeons & Dragons world of Forgotten 
                Realms(tm), Neverwinter Nights brings an exciting new element 
                to online games by restoring the element of the pen and paper 
                style of gaming to the mix. Players will be able to create modules 
                using BioWare's Solstice Toolkit and then, be the "Dungeon Master" 
                guiding a group of adventurers through the campaign. Dungeon Masters 
                can "link" their module to others on the Internet by use of Portals 
                creating a web of persistent game modules and ongoing adventure 
                with ever changing scenery and surprises.<br>
                <br>
                Along with coverage of the NWN development process and community 
                news, NWN Stratics will contain DM and player strategies, module 
                creation tips, Forgotten Realms lore, and of course statistics 
                to name a few. From the 2nd Edition D&D rules to the new 3rd Edition 
                (being released this August by Wizards of the Coast), the NWNSS 
                staff of Dungeon Masters, writers and technicians will do their 
                best to keep you up-to-date on all of the changes as the game 
                heads to release in early 2001. <br>
                <br>
                Come visit us at <a href="http://nwn.stratics.com">Neverwinter 
                Nights Stratics</a> for more details on this exiting addition

            <div> For those of you that do not know, last week was Wizard Week 
              here at EQSS. During that week we paid extra attention at one special 
              subject on our site, last week's topic was "Wizard". We got a lot 
              of great feedback, which resulted in a <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes_wiz_hum.shtml" target="_blank">new 
              guide</a> and a (soon to be made) new document in the Wizard section 
              featuring tips 'n tricks from the pro's. In addition we have a great 
              new <a href="http://www.darkflame.org/classlist.cgi?class=wizard" target="_blank">wizard 
              spell list</a>, which allows you to view every single detail about 
              any spell!<br>
              We have decided however to extend the Wizard week another week, 
              to get even more information then we already got. So if you know 
              a little about a wizard and have any suggestions / submissions / 
              corrections or something else that would benefit our <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes_wiz.shtml" target="_blank">"Wizard"</a> 
              section, please either <a href="mailto:prophylon@stratics.com?subject=WizardWeek">submit</a> 
              it or post it <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/forums/Forum22/HTML/001017.html" target="_blank">here</a>,

                <p> I would like to thank all that came to the BBBB in the Arena 
                  this Sunday, on The Nameless server. This was a great success, 
                  and The Brethren of the Mystic Dawn are considering holding 
                  another event like this in the near future. There are so many 
                  people I would like to thank, so instead of naming them all 
                  and forgetting somebody, I am going to do a blanket thank you 
                  to all!
                <p> There were many duels, some wares hawked, much beer drank, 
                  in addition to the stories told and songs played by the wandering 
                  minstrels. The raffle was also a great success. The drunken 
                  footrace was hysterical! Nothing like hearing a drunk dwarf 
                  bellowing across the arena in a drunken run.
                <p> I would love to get some feedback or suggestions for the future 
                  event. Please send me an e-mail to Chrysania@mysticdawn.net

                the Cult of The Red Dragon, being a spirited and rowdy bunch from 
                a recent influx of new members decided to do something unique.
                <p>We decided to kill the Priest of Discord.
                <p>Led by Cthaylen von Draechon, our Executive Clan Leader, we 
                  commenced the staking out of our quarry, we assembled at the 
                  cave leading to the home of the Crushbone Orcs. Our hope was 
                  to pull the Priest all the way there, so we would have a 'safer' 
                  staging grounds. Everyone was buffed up and Zastari D'Moira, 
                  the official puller for this event, was in position. But it 
                  seems that the Priest didn't want to play along to our ambushing 
                  games, and returned to his usual post after chasing Zastari 
                  a ways off. We had to change tactics.
                <p>We attempted to kite the wicked Priest, but to no avail, our 
                  spells slid harmlessly off of him. He didn't even notice we 
                  were casting. Again, we changed plans, by The Dragon, we could 
                  not let the Priest best us!
                <p>This time we enlisted the help of the virtuous guardians of 
                  Kelethin and the Faydark at large. Guards Fireblight, Sunweaver, 
                  Frostfallen, Dayblaze, Rainstrider, Lieutenant Leafstalker, 
                  and Captain Silverwind faithfully protected their homeland from 
                  the stench of the Priest of Discord and hisdark influence. This 
                  is not to say that the fight was without casualties. Several 
                  good men and women lost their lives in the long battle.
                <p>When all was said and done, the great cleric Lyfe Savyr scored 
                  the killing blow on the Priest of Discord, turning him into 
                  a corpse. And there was a corpse left!
                <p>We scored lots of bronze of various sizes, rusty weapons, orc 
                  hatchets, foraged food, and a rather nice Robe of Discord. Unfortunately 
                  the Staff of Discord was ninjalooted by Iinil, a level 7 bard, 
                  who later 'boasted' about his loot. We were not impressed.
                <p>But, in all, a good time was had and the Cult of The Red Dragon 
                  wasundefeated by the Priest of Discord!

                Saturday Feb. 26 at 12pm PST, if you do not play on Fennin please 
                make a newbie Necro on Fennin. The sit in will be held outside 
                of Neriak in the Nektulas Forest to protest the recent change 
                to the Feign Death Spell. The Sit In I organized on the 20th was 
                thrown together rather quickly with little advertisement (thanks 
                go out to the guys at eq.statics :)) and participation for the 
                Necro Community was minimal and Verant's Staff attendance and 
                acknowledgment of the event was nonexistent. It is possible that 
                Smed, Brad, GZ, and Gordon didn't get the opportunity read the 
                emails that I sent out to them 1pm Friday, so I will give them 
                the benefit of the doubt and give them a chance to post to this 
                thread, respond to my next set of emails or attend this Saturdays 
                Sit In.
                <p>The issue to be addressed is that fact that the 15 min time 
                  limit is far to short for the spells life saving element to 
                  be useful in dire circumstances. The proposed resolution is 
                  that the 15 min time limit be transferred to the Pet so if the 
                  Necro is Feigned for 15 mins the Pet "pops". This will still 
                  removed the possibility of exploitation but will restore Feign 
                  Deaths life saving component. A couple of other suggestions 
                  on how fix this where brought to light in the previous thread 
                  that have flaws and I can not get behind them; "I would also 
                  like to say that getting no xp while feigned sounds like a great 
                  idea to me." This idea was rejected because it's still open 
                  to exploit by allowing a Necro to FD while grouped with someone 
                  and the other person would then harvest all the exp.This would 
                  also have an AoE on Monks and SK's and I will not partake in 
                  Nerfing another class to benefit mine. "Feign Death should be 
                  changed so that your pet cons "Indifferent" to anything while 
                  you're feigned." Although a good idea, I guarantee that would 
                  be a nightmare to code and I would like to see a this issue 
                  resolved before EQ2. 
                <p>If this issue is addressed and resolved by Verant Staff on 
                  the EQ Message Board before the Sit In I will happily cancel 
                  this event. If you plan on attending this event <br>
                  1) Bump the post on the EQ message board titled "Rescheduled 
                  Necromancer Sit In on Fennin Ro, Saturday Feb. 26, 12pm PST". 
                  <br>
                  2) Contact me at saratj1@yahoo.com to confirm your attendance 
                  so I can see if I can get the guys at <a href="http://www.eqnecro.com" target="_blank">www.eqnecro.com</a>(the 
                  best Necro site on the Web) post updates on how many people 
                  plan on attending. 
                <p>Thank you for your time,

              <blockquote>Many of the citizens of Fennin Ro have worked together 
                since the concept of Common Law was introduced at the first Council 
                of the Collective. Common Law is a system of In Character and 
                Out Of Character rules and government for Norrath and its inhabitants. 
                The intent of Common Law is to provide a persistant setting for 
                Norrath that is nurturing for role-play. Guilds have formed alliances 
                and treaties, governments have been started, people across Fennin 
                Ro are beginning to consider which city to hold their allegiance, 
                or none at all. Common Law is definitely moving forward. The time 
                has arrived to choose your home city! You can do so by editing 
                your profile at the forum, or by visiting the new section 'Citizens 
                of Norrath'.<br>

                discussed a number of things, including player-driven events, 
                guild alliances, but most importantly, a method of communicating 
                between the guilds on the Karana server to organize these events 
                and alliances.<br>
                <br>
                An almost unanimous vote was made to establish a Council of Guilds 
                (to be named later), with only 3 negative votes, and to use a 
                number of means to keep this council together and talking. As 
                a means of opening the communication, I have begun a forum for

              <blockquote>I been a long time player of EQ. As far back as Phase 
                4 beta. Recently I have decided to right small stories of my main 
                characters adventures. I am going to send you volume I of my stories, 
                and if you guys like them I will send you more as I write them. 
                Sor here it is, "Roleplay Vol I: My first journey from Erudin 
                to Qeynos".<br>
                <br>
                Roleplay Vol1 - Leaving hometown for the first time.<br>
                <br>
                Despite the pouring rain and howling wind the excitement was still 
                grand. All his life he had been trapped on this small continent 
                of Odus. He was 22 and struck with wanderlust. The prospect of 
                crossing the ocean and seeing new lands was exhilarating. Yet 
                he was prepared, having studied hard and long on his arts he had 
                reached his 8th season and was ready for what lay ahead. Alone, 
                Shandar Darkstar stood on the docks of the marble city of Erudin.<br>
                <br>
                The sound of the ocean was soothing yet Shandar did not notice 
                all he could think about was the boat. He had only seen a boat 
                like this a time or two and that was off in the distance. The 
                rain fell harder and the wind grew colder, in the distance a shark 
                fin appeared in the water before vanishing in the murky depths 
                once again. <br>
                Shandar clinched his cracked staff tight in anticipation. Then 
                out of the fog it appeared, as if materializing before his very 
                eyes out of thin air. The ships flag's touched the sky, challenging 
                the very rain clouds for supremacy. He had never realized just 
                how big the seaking was, as it could easily fit 50 or more people 
                on its deck with room to spare.<br>
                <br>
                As the marble platform started to move Shandar almost squealed 
                in glee as it brought him closer and closer to his destiny. Once 
                he boarded the ship he found he was not alone. A bard rested under 
                the mast playing his lute in peaceful meditation. The planks creaked 
                slightly in the wind, but yet they fell sturdy and safe. Shandar 
                moved to sit by the bard, she was of strange race. She was small 
                with long brown hair and pointed ears. Shandar cracked a smile 
                and asked meekly, are you a wood elf? I have heard of your kind 
                but never seen one before. The young lady smiled and said, "Yes 
                fellow traveler, I am a wood elf and my name is compassion." As 
                she spoke her green eyes glimmered like precious emeralds, and 
                Shandar could do nothing but stare for a few minutes. As the wood 
                elf blushed Shandar realized what he was doing and shook out of 
                it, "I am sorry compassion, but I have just never seen such beauty 
                in my life please forgive me." Compassion laughed, and it sounded 
                as if the very voices of angels were carried in her laugh, "Don't 
                worry good sir, I understand. . Yet I am at a disadvantage, you 
                know my name, but I know not yours. Shandar nodded, "Of course 
                my name is Shandar Darkstar, pleased to make your Acquaintance."<br>
                <br>
                The ship lurched and suddenly they were on there way. Shandar 
                strolled to the edge of the deck and looked out over the ocean 
                as the rain cleared away and allowed night to rein once more unhindered. 
                Compassion noticed the look Shandar gave to the sea and asked, 
                "Have you never been on boat before?" Shandar didn't turn from 
                the ocean but said in a distant voice, "No I have never left my 
                hometown before, and I am anxious to see what lies ahead, I have 
                heard many stories of all that awaits me there." Compassion laughed 
                again and said, "Well we have a long ride ahead of us, come join 
                me and I shall sing you a song of the hills." Shandar smiled and 
                went to sit by the bard and said quietly, "Yes I would love that."<br>
                <br>
                Compassion begin to play her lute and slowly began singing. First 
                it was quiet, but it grew louder almost in harmony with the very 
                waves. She sang of the hills near Qeynos and of the many races 
                that roamed. She told about the dread things that lurked the hills 
                and of creatures called gnolls. The song carried on entrancing 
                Shandar as he listened and heard about the unparalleled sunset 
                and sunrises, of half elves and surefall glade. Images danced 
                in Shandar's head as the music lead him on a surreal journey, 
                the waves giving the music sustenance and harmony. When the song 
                was finished tears filled the young Erudites eyes, as he didn't 
                want to come out of the trance the song had lead him into. Before 
                he knew it the watcher in the crows nest yelled, "land ho"!!!<br>
                <br>
                As Shandar turned to see what the watcher was pointing out his 
                mouth dropped open. Cobblestone walls sprang up from the water 
                surrounding building shadowed in the darkness of night, yet streets 
                filled with glittering lamp post, making doors seem warm and welcoming. 
                People were going to and fro everywhere like ants, so different 
                from the quiet city of erudin. The town was constantly filled 
                with a lively noise of celebration and joy. He had never dreamed 
                such cities existed, such wonders. When he turned back to share 
                his glee with compassion she was nowhere to be seen. She had seemed 
                to have vanished in thin air. He scanned the crowds for her, but 
                saw no sign of her brown hair. Standing there bewildered the boat 
                finally jarred to a stop. Shandar shrugged a bit and shook of 
                his bewilderment, after all excitement and adventure lay before 
                him and he wasn't about to delay it a moment longer. With that 
                he stepped onto the creaky docks of Qeynos, and began his first 
                adventure. . .</blockquote>

                <br>
                The walls within the Temple of Solusek Ro shook this Friday eve 
                with the sounds of celebration. On this very special night, Keiote' 
                Drak'Uben took the Lady Kiva Ver'ainne to be his wife. Keiote', 
                a priest of Innoruuk and Patriarch of Darkmoon, swore his life's 
                blood to the Lady Kiva in front of a crowd of onlookers from all 
                over Norrath. The Lady Kiva, Dark Guardian to the Patriarch, drew 
                her ebony blade and shed her own blood as sacrifice to Innoruuk 
                in her vows to Keiote'. In the midst of the family and friends 
                that attended, you could here the light dwellers shedding tears 
                of joy and the dark souls of Innoruuk cheer with hate. On hand 
                to perform the wedding was Darkmoon's friend Palladius, lead GM 
                administrator who was once Xegony's residing GM. (As a plug for 
                Verant support, I need to say that Palladius came in on his day 
                off just to perform this wedding.)<br>
                <br>
                Keiote' and Lady Kiva wish to thank all the guilds and players 
                of Xegony that helped make this one of the largest gatherings 
                other than plane/dragon raids. For this eve, all of Xegony's religious 
                and political differences were set aside.<br>

                show of kindness and selflessness from all the players of Xegony.<br>
                <br>
                Once again we would like to applaud Palladius, Xegony guilds and 
                players for making this such a huge success.<br>

                It seems that the Ghoul Messenger that traverses West Karana is 
                no longer dropping the Strategic Map of Kithicor. This map is 
                needed for the Ranger Quest for the Short Sword of Morin. No idea 
                why this has happened... Maybe they thought it was to easy to 
                get such a good weapon, just get a wandering high 20's low 30's 
                pal to kill him and you've got yourself a pretty good weapon! 
                I have also heard of another way of getting this item through 
                a different quest from the same Morin of Kithicor forest, but 
                I don't know the details of that. Well hope that helps any rangers 
                out there that have been wondering why they can't seem to find 
                this map.

              <blockquote>Saturday, 2/19, on the Tarew Marr server, an army marching 
                under Tunare¹s banner assaulted Neriak. The goal, invade and slay 
                Narex T¹Vem, one of the Indigo Brotherhood guild trainers.
                <p>We met in East Commons outside Nektulos Forest and gathered 
                  our forces together. Once we were confidant that all had come, 
                  we pressed on, killing the pathetic Outter Dreadguard soldiers 
                  who feebly tried to stop us.
                <p>Wasting no time, we rushed into Neriak¹s Foreign Quarter. The 
                  sheer numbers in our force at this point worked against us (MEGA 
                  lag!) and many lost their lives due to the confusion, or just 
                  from wandering around the city thinking it was safe because 
                  the gate was clear. Some were resurected, others made the trek 
                  back to the bodies, and we made a second grand push, through 
                  the gate and into Neriak Commons!
                <p>Once we made it here, we utilized Neriak¹s handy tunnel system 
                  to sneak past their waiting guards. Commander Uglar, a fierce 
                  troll, lured several dragoons into the tunnel where the battle 
                  force, over 50 strong, cut them to shreds with little difficulty.
                <p>We made our way out of the tunnels into the city area. We got 
                  settled, prepared ourselves and then Uglar infiltrated the home 
                  of the Indigo Brotherhood and lured the target for the raid, 
                  Narex T¹Vem, out where we all waited to rip him limb from limb, 
                  and we did just that, the killing blow made with a vicious Ice 
                  Comet from the hands of Faalcon! Narex had a friend in the Brotherhood, 
                  Trizam N¹Tan try to assist him, but he fell before our blades 
                  and sorcery as well! Our mission was acomplished!!
                <p>At this point my ISP decided to disconnect me for a half hour. 
                  When I returned I found out that even though we were victorious, 
                  most of our numbers were cut to shreds when they decided to 
                  go for another trainer. I don¹t know her name as I wasn¹t there 
                  =( but she was supposedly the "leader" of the Indigo Brotherhood, 
                  who hit with quad attacks with lightning speed at around 500 
                  hps per hit. Ouch! Things got messy there because of that, but 
                  by the time that I was able to get back (I gated out the second 
                  I appeared and luckily no inkies saw me :) I heard that most 
                  had gotten their bodies and those that did get them were about 
                  to.
                <p>All in all it was a great event and a great success, in my 
                  opinion! Those that died, I was told, were able to recover their 
                  bodies, and a lot og us got some really nice xp and "good elf" 
                  faction hits :). A very special thanks to the GMs and Guides 
                  that took time out of their schedules to help make sure the 
                  "evil roleplayers" didn¹t dump trains on us, or block doorways 
                  (even though some did, but it coulda been a lot worse :). And 
                  extra special thanks to Uglar for pulling everything, leading 
                  everyone and making sure things didn¹t go REALLY bad when they 
                  could have many times =) I¹d suggest everyone that was there, 
                  even the bad guys, /petition about him and tell the GMs to award 
                  him a well deserved title for all his hard work :) And thanks 
                  to everyone that came and had fun :)

              <blockquote>It was a average day in the land of Norranth and I had 
                been doing a quest that would land me Dark Forge Armor. Having 
                had no luck for weeks completing this quest, I was resting just 
                inside the Temple of Cazic Thule.
                <p>A bloody Troll enters the temple shouting for help. He claimed 
                  of some human named "Dark Assasin" was roaming around the jungle 
                  with his pet killing all that got in his way.
                <p>Those in the temple went to assist so I followed. There was 
                  a rally on the bridge to kill this great force and we left to 
                  find him. Shortly after finding this "Dark Assasin" we knew 
                  we were in trouble.
                <p>He tore us apart and just as he was to lay the death blow on 
                  me, the world ended
                <p>OOC: This NPC human spawned and then roamed the zone killing 
                  all it crossed. We banded together as there appeared to be no 
                  GM's online to go kill it. It was vicious and many died. Just 
                  as he was about to kill me the zone was taken down. I could 
                  not log back in as the zone was unavailable. I logged in with 
                  a different character and there still seemed to be no GM's online. 
                  In about 5 minutes the zone was back up. It had time warped 
                  and I spawned with no buffs, full life and mana at the zone 
                  to Cazic Thule. Those who died did not warp and we helped them 
                  get thier corpses. Still no GM's to be heard of. This NPC Human 
                  was double piercing me for 140 and above, resisted all my spells 
                  and my Harm Touch. After the zone came back up we could not 
                  find him again, I do hope he was removed. In closing I would 
                  just like to remind everyone that this was a newbie zone. To

              <blockquote>I've remained silent for far to long, I am organizing 
                a Necro Sit In on Fennin Ro Sunday Feb. 20 at 12pm PST, if you 
                do not play on Fennin please make a newbie Necro on Fennin. The 
                sit in will be held outside of Neriak in the Nektulas Forest to 
                protest the recent change to the Feign Death Spell. The issue 
                to be addressed is that fact that the 15 min time limit is far 
                to short for the spells life saving element to be useful in dire 
                circumstances. The proposed resolution is that the 15 min time 
                limit be transferred to the Pet so if the Necro is Feigned for 
                15 mins the Pet "pops". This will still removed the possibility 
                of exploitation but will restore Feign Deaths life saving component. 
                If this issue is addressed and resolved by Verant Staff on the 
                EQ Message Board before the Sit In I will happily cancel this 
                event. If you plan on attending this event<br>
                1) Bump the post on the EQ message board titled "Necromancer Sit 
                In on Fennin Ro, Sunday Feb. 20 12pm PTS".<br>
                2) Contact me at <a href="maitlo:saratj1@yahoo.com">saratj1@yahoo.com</a> 
                to confirm your attendance so I can see if I can get the guys

                preferred by people on the PvP servers. The server may or may

                forum 60 with 130 more to go. So please be patient, we'll have 
                the entire issue resolved by the close of business today.
                <p> On a more positive note, we will be migrating to an entirely 
                  new software title for our message forums. It is a vast improvement 
                  over the product we're currently using and we fully expect that 
                  such issues as the one we experienced last night will no longer 
                  be an issue. Your current forum account will be migrated as 
                  well so you will still have your username and password which 
                  you are currently using in our forums now. More information 
                  will be made available very soon.

                <p>Hail, and well met. I am rallying together brave adventurers 
                  to join my Guild in gaining some revenge on Clan Crushbone. 
                  The event will take place WEDNESDAY, FEB 23rd, at 8:00 PM Central 
                  time.
                <p>The Reason:<br>
                  Katania EmeraldMaiden, a young adventurer, has expressed interest 
                  injoining the guild I'm in, the Amazons. She comes to us with 
                  a sad story, one that speaks of the terrors from her past. Her 
                  father, a brave Emerald Warrior, and her mother, a Ranger of 
                  Tunare, were slain by Crushbone Orcs in a raid on their home 
                  in the upper forest of Greater Faydark. To revenge her parents, 
                  I am rallying a campaign against Clan Crushbone.
                <p>We will start at the labeled 'Orc Lift' near Kelethin and kill 
                  every orc in sight on our way to Crushbone itself. Once we enter, 
                  we will punish Clan Crushbone and drench its soil with the blood 
                  of those orcs inhabiting it until Dvinn and his motley crew 
                  have perished. We could use many brave adventurers of all ranks, 
                  especially those with clerical abilities to insure our victory. 
                  Rally with us against Clan Crushbone!
                <p>At the end of the event we will welcome Katania into our guild 
                  and I will pass out free drinks so we can do what I like to 
                  do after battle... get drunk!
                <p>Any questions can be directed to me at megtilia@hotmal.com 
                  -- I hope to see you all there!

            <div> 
              <p>For the first time in Vallon Zek history the evil team has slain 
                a god. It was a team consisting of just the Xanit K`ven Guild. 
                This is also noted as it was the first time the god was slain 
                on the server. Below was submited to me by my guildmate:
              <p>
              <blockquote> Wed evening on Vallon Zek. A force of Dark team only, 
                made up of the proud Xanit K'Ven only took on Hate for a final 
                show down with the God of Hate himself. After clearing the way 
                and killng Maestro with 23 people, more of our forces showed as 
                we pushed closer to Innurook himself. After solving ways around 
                a few mob pet pathing bugs, we cleared out Innurooks guards and 
                prepared ourselfs for the battle ahead of us. Our first attack 
                on Innurook was stoped just short of his death, when we had him 
                down to just under 30% life left and over 3/4 of our forces still 
                alive and most with full health and high mana. This is when a 
                mob near by joined the attack without its pet which went to get 
                friends. A train hit us with a few clerics who started healing 
                Innurook and many other mobs that ran around cutting us down left 
                and right. This was a major set back that had us wondering if 
                the all our hard work would be ended do to pathing problems. After 
                a quick corpse recover and regrouping, many of us came up with 
                a plan and desided to give it another shot. Our second attack 
                on Innurook started with 24 people. At about the time he we charged 
                one went link dead and another before the pets even got in the 
                fight. The battle was bloody and cost a few proud Xanit K'Ven 
                members lives. In the end Innurook learned the price of giving 
                his own kin such a love for hate and death. For now he feels the 
                wraith of true hate. With such a crushing defeat at our hands 
                in the name of our leader Xanit K' Ven, he has no choice but to 
                join in the aid of our leaders return to take his empire back. 
                More to come on Xanit K'Vens return to Norrath soon.
                <p>Special thanks to Splorge and Kittjara, who really did a lot 
                  to make this come true. And Thanks to ALL Xanit K'Ven who came, 
                  even the ones who couldnt stay for the final battle. We proved 
                  that a PURE Evil force can take the planes and whipe the floor 
                  with a God. Also noted, this is the first time on Vallon Zek 
                  Innurook has been slayed.

              This was a great day for the Dark Team and all of Vallon Zek. I 
              would also like to thank the members who fought and died with great 
              hatred in this battle to test the ultimate hate.

                <p>There's one minor issue with Paineel that we neglected to mention 
                  in the patch message. At the entrance to the city, there is 
                  an elevator that must be activated with a key. The "keyhole" 
                  in this instance is a rock that is on the ground near the lift. 
                  A minor bug exists that does not allow people to click on the 
                  rock to activate the elevator. In order to activate the elevator, 
                  players will need to hold the key on their pointer, hover it 
                  overthe rock, and press the "U" key. This will be fixed in a 
                  future patch.

                <p>The City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of Erudin, 
                  is now available via the Optional Patch. In addition, Erudites 
                  may now also be Shadowknights in addition to the other classes 
                  available to them. All Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, 
                  and Clerics who worship the God of Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start 
                  in the City of Paineel. As such, if you wish to create a character 
                  of this type from this point forward, you *must* download the 
                  Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch.
                <p>Please note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently, 
                  you must run the Optional Patch again to insure you have the 
                  correct version of the files.
                <p>In related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs 
                  have been fixed.
                <p>Enjoy!
                <p>***Patch Message***
                <p>The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:
                <p>*Spell Changes*
                <p>- The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have 
                  been reduced.<br>
                  - "Reoccurring Amnesia" has had its casting time reduced.<br>
                  - "Yaulp" and "Augmentation" should now stack.<br>
                  - "Solidarity of Vision" has had its duration increased.<br>
                  - The Druid spell, "Skin Like Nature", has been returned to 
                  its former status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield 
                  component has been removed and the regeneration component has 
                  been re-applied.<br>
                  - "Sense Magic" has been replaced in all cases by the "True 
                  North" spell. If you have already inscribed the "Sense Magic" 
                  spell, the spell icon will now automatically reflect "True North".<br>
                  - A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing 
                  their damage to be subtracted rather than added when stacked, 
                  has been corrected. The spells will now stack properly.<br>
                  - The "Feign Death" spell, when cast by a Necromancer, will 
                  now have a fixed duration. The Necromancer will receive several 
                  warnings prior to the spell wearing off. This change was necessary 
                  because some Necromancers found a way to gain experience through 
                  their pet while being AFK for an extended duration, such as 
                  being in bed for the night. Note: This does not affect Shadowknights 
                  or Monks.<br>
                  - New Necromancer spells are now in game. Check your spell vendors.<br>
                  - Alchemy has been revamped. Check with your local Shaman.<br>
                  - DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.
                <p>*General Changes/Fixes*
                <p>- The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update to slightly 
                  reduce the difficulty of the zone. <br>
                  - All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been corrected.<br>
                  - From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all 
                  corpses belonging to that character to likewise be deleted. 
                  This change was made primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug. 
                  It also has the added effect of cleaning up corpses for characters 
                  that people no longer intend to play.<br>
                  - Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the 
                  "You have scored a Crippling Blow (###)" line.
                <p>*Corpse Looting Exploit*
                <p>Recently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory 
                  individuals to loot the corpses of other players without their 
                  consent. The precise symptom of this is that the owner would 
                  find their corpse stripped of everything except for no-drop 
                  items, and items in a bag with no-drop items. This exploit was 
                  fixed in this patch.
                <p>If you were affected by this exploit recently, you are entitled 
                  to a reimbursement of your lost items assuming that we still 
                  have a record of what you had. Please contact a GM in-game to 
                  arrange for an investigation. 
                <p>During the course of the investigation, people who have exploited 
                  this bug will be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff 
                  up to and including item wipes, suspension, and/or banishment. 
                <p>*Rogue Enhancements*
                <p>Rogues received several enhancements as part of this patch:
                <p>- The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon 
                  has been increased significantly.<br>
                  - When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a 
                  rogue now has a chance to score a "Deadly Strike", for enhanced 
                  damage above and beyond that of a critical hit.<br>
                  - A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the "Hide" 
                  skill. It is called "Evade". This skill has the effect of lowering 
                  the amount that the targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the 
                  potential of making the engaged NPC switch to another target 
                  (preferably a tank) within the rogue's group. It is essentially 
                  a "reverse taunt". This ability helps mitigate the negative 
                  effects of the rogue's exceedingly high damage-output potential. 
                  It also will in-turn help the rogue do even more damage as the 
                  NPC is much more likely to expose its back. It is engaged by 
                  targeting the NPC you wish to "Evade" and pressing the "Hide" 
                  button. As a note, you must not be in combat mode in order to 
                  use this ability.
                <p>*Mistwalker*
                <p>The Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often as it 
                  used to prior to the last patch. However, the resulting pet 
                  will now automatically "dissipate" after one combat round. The 
                  change that reduced the "proc" percentage on the weapon was 
                  made due to an unintended interaction between the pet and the 
                  target when several users of this weapon were attacking the 
                  same target. Since the new pet now automatically dissipates 
                  after one round, the reduced "proc" percentage was no longer 
                  necessary.
                <p>*Class-Specific Armor Quests*
                <p>Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to 
                  Clerics, Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms 
                  of how long it will take the average person to acquire the armor. 
                  These classes, and others that found particular pieces of their 
                  armor exceedingly difficult to obtain should find it much easier 
                  now.
                <p>In addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer of 
                  Ro quest for some races has been corrected.
                <p>*Tallon Zek*
                <p>Loot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon Zek, 
                  have been changed from "Coin + 1 item" to "Coin Only". This 
                  change was made to study the impact of loot-rules upon server 
                  population in reference to the loot/efficiency disparity between 
                  caster and melee characters. This change is a test, and may 
                  or may not be retained or rolled out across the other PvP servers, 
                  pending the results of the server population study over the 
                  next few weeks. 
                <p>*Plane Changes*
                <p>Several changes have been implemented in the Planes as part 
                  of this patch:
                <p>- Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering the 
                  Plane of Sky<br>
                  - Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer works within 
                  the Plane of Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow entrance 
                  into the quest room.<br>
                  - A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate in order 
                  to give non-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, 
                  or group teleport.
                <p>*Loot Messages*
                <p>Messages indicating what has been looted from a corpse will 
                  now be broadcast to everyone within the looters group. This 
                  change was made due to public request and to encourage trust 
                  within the group. We may, in the future, employ filters to allow 
                  people to choose whether or not they wish to receive loot messages.
                <p>*Fiery Avenger*
                <p>The greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, the 
                  "Fiery Avenger", is again available within game via a quest. 
                  The *first* devout Paladin to wield this blade and be validated 
                  by a GM in-game will be publicly congratulated within a patch 
                  message and on the Official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com.

              <blockquote>In the deepest dark of the blackest hell<br>
                Four sons were borne by one Cynfel T'Kell<br>
                Dark Elves all, they traversed across the lands<br>
                Each deposited their marks upon the sands. Unable to meet on common 
                ground<br>
                Their separation was soon found To be the only alternative they 
                could see<br>
                To stop their cruel sibling rivalry. One went to Odus, the other 
                to Faydwer<br>
                The third remained on Antonica, lost but somewhere<br>
                The fourth brother borne was simply the best<br>
                His name was Sertain - and he offers this quest:<br>
                To find his traveling boots made of gold<br>
                And return them to him, for riches untold<br>
                You must find Sertain's brothers - one of which he suspects<br>
                Has stolen his booties from his personal effects<br>
                Query them well for they may have some news<br>
                Which will ultimately provide you with meaningful clues<br>
                <br>

                <p>/ooc This should be a fun event for all details are a little 
                  sketchy as of now but we'll leave clues for all of you around 
                  norrath, good luck everyone.A side note and I just realized 
                  this, I do not know if melee classes and people already owning 
                  the boots would be allowed to win the boots(although we would 
                  love it if you roleplayed with us, our server needs more of 
                  that), I will get back to you on that.

                <p>I would like to take this opportunity to address the situation 
                  that arose on the Xegony server last weekend (2-12-00) in Kedge 
                  Keep. This incident has caused many debates over the roles of 
                  GMs and Guides as CS representatives.
                <p>While both sides have their points, ultimately it is my responsibility 
                  to treat each and every customer with respect and dignity regardless 
                  of their treatment of other CS personnel or myself. We are responsible 
                  for maintaining the playability and stability of the game as 
                  well as good customer relations. The last of these is the point 
                  that I have failed on and for that I apologize to the players 
                  involved. I am not going to offer up any excuses or make any 
                  statements about what happened and why. The bottom line in all 
                  of this is that a group of people's enjoyment of the game was 
                  lessened by an interaction with me, and that is unacceptable. 
                  I will consider this an experience for me to grow from and I 
                  hope the players do as well.
                <p>Our main goal here at Verant is to provide the players with 
                  a gaming environment that we hope they will enjoy, sometimes

                  assure each and every one of you that not one person working

                <p>Just a reminder about the Neriak raid scheduled for this Saturday(2/19) 
                  on the Tarew Marr server, we'll be meeting at 8 PM EST in East 
                  Commons by the entrance to Nektulos Forest. The goal of the 
                  raid is to fight our way into Neriak Commons and slay 1 warrior 
                  guild trainer :) If things go well we MAY take a crack at the 
                  Lodge of the Dead, or at least move on to the 3rd gate for a 
                  while.
                <p>Last weekend, I heard rumors that Innoruuk himself appeard 
                  in theNeriak area whining about the raid being planned. So, 
                  ya never know, things could get interesting if we're lucky :)
                <p>Also I do know that a couple guides should be accompanying 
                  us, maybehelping with the roleplaying but mostly making sure 
                  the jerks don't dump guard trains on us and stuff like that. 
                  There will be a lot of high level players, even designated pulers, 
                  etc, at this event, in fact it's geared toward level 40+ people. 
                  Similar to a plane raid in difficulty. If you're too low you 
                  can still come, but do so at your own risk and understand that 
                  if you do die the attacking army may not be able to stop to 
                  res you or recover your corpse right away. But the good news 
                  is, at least anyone can get bound in there :)

                Strangely, people don't seem to remember these enhancements for

              <blockquote>When I was a young gnome enchanter, the most important 
                spell I could contribute to my group was the ability to invis 
                in case of trouble, and/or to retrieve a corpse from a dangerous 
                location.Somewhere along the line, Verant decided to 'ADJUST' 
                the invis spell. I noticed the difference right away, since my 
                normally reliable invis, withered within a minute, leaving me 
                visible (and dead) in Nektulos forest. <br>
                <br>
                Since that time, invis, rather than the stable, reliable spell 
                I had grown with and come to depend upon, has seemed to deteriorate 
                more and more. At this point, I would classify it as unreliable 
                as the notorious 'CHARM' spell. The big difference being that 
                charm, at least, lasts a minute or two before betraying you, where 
                invis can sometimes fade even as its cast. I have had to recast 
                the spell sometimes 4 or 5 times within a two minute period. <br>
                <br>
                I have recently achieved a higher level now. Unlike most spells 
                that get better with level, invis is getting worse. It has been 
                responsible for deaths in my groups, and personal deaths several 
                times in the last few levels. I hesitate to cast it at all anymore.<br>
                <br>
                To my mind, the adjustment (read destruction) of what once was 
                my most important spell, has been the single most devastating 
                nerf Verant has visited upon our class. Where once, we could slip 
                like mist through dangerous dungeons and passages, we now are 
                in more danger than if we didn't have the spell, since without 
                it, we probably would never attempt to play in some of the places 
                we now venture.<br>
                <br>
                The heck with pet nerfs. The pets were never that effective for 
                us anyway. Give me back INVIS.<br>

                this to occur is buried very deeply into EQ's core. The only way 
                that we could stop it would be to move the corpse to a nearby 
                point upon death, but that could get unpredictable. In short, 
                it would be fair to say that we have no short-term plans to address 
                this issue further, and that any GM or Guide can assist you with 
                the recovery of a corpse that is stuck in a wall. Another option 
                available to you is the /corpse command which you can try when 
                right next to the wall where you died. Nine times out of 10, that 
                command will get your corpse out.</font></blockquote>

              <blockquote>I have posted a couple of times about the drop rates 
                after the last patch on the planes. Last week we did the Plane 
                of hate for around 10 hours and kill half the zone including Maestro. 
                We killed mostly house spawns. We would have killed Innoruuk if 
                he had been spawned, but he wasnt. That night we got 0 as in Zero 
                armor drops. This weekend we did PoH again and this time killing 
                half the zone again and killing Innoruuk. We pulled only houses 
                and roamers that got in the way. We got 3-4 drops that night and 
                one so far today. Once we have put in a total of 50 hours here 
                I will report back.
                <p>Last weekend we Broke into the Plane of Fear and stayed there 
                  till it was completely cleared. We then went to bed and came 
                  back the next day and killed everything that spawned for 2 more 
                  days or about a total of 50 hours. In that time we got almost 
                  full sets of every class armor we could for almost all 15 or 
                  so members of the guild who could get items there. We easily 
                  got more then 60 items in the time we where there, but that 
                  is all I could remember off the top of my head. We also got 
                  3 PoH items from Phobos on the Plane of Fear. 2 Warrior guantlets 
                  and a bard bracer.
                <p>I will continue to post back here, But I think you can see 
                  where this is going. PoH drops where lowered across the board, 
                  not just on roamers. They where allready lower then Fear. Though 
                  I must say Fear drops made us very happy, being a young guild 
                  on a newer server. Only Wizard and Paladin gear was rare on 
                  PoF, and we still got alot of both.
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">The difference in loot drops is due to the 
                fact that the zones are designed to drop X pieces of armor per 
                day. Since spawn frequency in Hate is higher than Fear, the percentage 
                is less. We may have underestimated the amount of time necessary 
                to clear Hate, which is having the effect of giving less of a 
                reward for similar effort.
                <p>I've mentioned this to a few of the zone tuners, so we'll look 
                  at it. However, I can tell you that we haven't yet decided whether 
                  or not the loot difference is an imbalance at this point. As 
                  you may recall, a few weeks ago people were complaining that 
                  Fear was useless and people were camping Hate, now they complain 
                  the opposite. It's possible that we let the pendulum swing a 
                  bit too far in the other direction.

                in east comonlands and hail me. I will probably be near the tunnel 
                to nektulos forest, so wait there if I am not there right away. 
                entrance fee is as follows:<br>
                <br>
                lvl 4-7 1pp or 15 bone chips <br>
                lvl 8-11 3pp or 20 bone chips <br>
                lvl 12-15 5pp <br>
                This is how its going to work. Firstly, the event will be on Friday, 
                February 18 at 6:00 EST. Now, to the competition. After you pay 
                your fee, you are to go out and seek undead. You are allowed to 
                go to any corner of Norrath, but must be back in 1 1/2 hrs. You 
                will receive 1 pt. for every bone chip, 3 pts. for every zombie 
                skin, and I will give out a pt. value for any loot that is undead-related 
                because i know there is more than that not mentioned, and I know 
                that there will be lots (mummy skin if it exists, loot from special 
                undead in places like befallen, ghoul skin, etc) Anyway, just 
                bring in any undead loot you find, and whoever has the most points 
                wins the prize-half of the admissions (plus maybe a little extra 
                if you did something special) remember, you must be back in 1 
                1/2 hours, so you may not want to journey too far. Get some experience, 
                maybe win some money, and above all else just have some fun. my 
                name is Tamarak, DE necro of the 9th year, so see you all there!<br>

                Darkmoon would like to invite any and all our light dwelling friends 
                as well the brothers and sisters of Innoruuk. We are hoping this 
                event will bring many guilds together in an even and social atmosphere 
                instead of the "fight for a mob" one we have seen as of late on 
                our server. This would be a good chance to finally relax and really 
                talk to the other players on our server instead of spamming "train" 
                through the zone. On hand will be an "open" bar for those that 
                drink, a Lavastorm scavenger hunt for any low level players (prizes 
                given out). After the reception our hopes would be to see some 
                of our friends gather with Darkmoon as we make our way to G.Fay 
                and clean a few dungeons. This would also be a great starting 
                point for any guilds to make their way to visit ol' Naggy.<br>

                I am Vyvyd a Barbarian Shaman and devout follower of The Tribunal. 
                At a very young age while meditating on a high snowy ridge near 
                my home village of Halas, I was blessed with a vision by The Tribunal. 
                In this vision I saw what could only be described as an army of 
                Barbarians storming through the dark forests of Greater Faydark 
                to take over Crushbone Castle. I have made it my mission to organize 
                this attack. I will not pretend to understand why The Tribunal 
                has seen fit for these Orc dogs to be driven into the ground, 
                but I will not question it. This will be a long hard journey for 
                many of us, but I am quite sure a journey worth the undertaking.

                <p>We have created two "special" guilds on Bristlebane, "Forces 
                  of Light"and "Forces of Darkness". These two guilds are for 
                  running roleplaying events (and will normally be at "guildwar" 
                  with each other). We held our first event Saturday evening and 
                  it was a "success" with the follow up event planned for February 
                  27th.
                <p>All players of all guilds and independents are welcome to join 
                  or leave either side as they wish. Please keep in mind the concept 
                  of "roleplaying fun", this is not for massive battle slaughter, 
                  but rather to allow large forces to engage each other across 
                  Norrath. Weencourage higher levels to be careful not to instantly 
                  vaporize younger players (all levels are welcome to participate)and 
                  allow your opponent to flee when they are down to one or two 
                  bubbles rather than killing them off.
                <p>If players adhere to the good nature of this concept it will 
                  grow andbecome an almost constant "event". We will build up 
                  strongholds andlay siege and assault across Norrath.

                I'm attempting (ha) to make a page, so far it's going to be for 
                pictures of each class, each dedicated to it's own sections, some 
                humor, misc (GM pics, Enemy pics, etc.). I hope to diverge into 
                certain zones (planes). Although I'm gathering shots as of now 
                for it, I need others help! If you have any good pics of your 
                class, or a pic of another class in action, then come to <a href="http://go.to/eversolo">http://go.to/eversolo</a> 
                (I don't know when it will be up, V3 has to take an hour to upload 
                it) . I haven't put up any of the links on the menu, because (duh) 
                I need to get my pics in order. Until then, just use the address 
                at the bottom of the page and submit it!<br>

                illusive Swirl Guardians proved undoubtedly their resolve to protect 
                their master, but their swift deaths were of no consequence. An 
                enraged Phinigal arose, shaken from his throne. All hands fell 
                against him in fierce combat with swords and spells in great fashion.

            <div> At the time I wrote this, it seems there are alot of angry players 
              prevented from logging onto EverQuest because of the backup in the 
              chat server. Just be patient folks and eventually the prime-time 
              hour traffic will eventually clear. *sigh* I do not think Verant 
              plans to widen the bottleneck that gets caused by a single downed 
              server. Feel free to complain to Verant about the bottleneck at:

            <div> Yes indeed folks, it is true! On the <b><u>Test Server</u></b>, 
              you will be able to create an Erudite Shadowknight!!! This is the 
              first time a new race/class combo has been added since the game's 
              release<br>
              <br>
              Erudite Shadowknights must follow Cazic-Thule, as the other Heretics 
              do, and their starting place is in Paineel. Their base stats are 
              as follows:<br>
              <br>
              Strength - 70<br>
              Stamina - 75<br>
              Agility - 70<br>
              Dexterity - 70<br>
              Wisdom - 83<br>
              Intelligence - 117 (Wow)<br>
              Charisma - 75<br>
              Bonus - 20 points<br>
              <br>
              PLEASE note that this is TEST SERVER only as of now. If this change 
              is to hit the live servers, it may not be for awhile.<br>

                time. We're also going to be revamping Kerra Ridge to try and 
                get some people in there.<br>
                <br>
                Odus is, of course, meant to be less populated than the main land. 
                Erud lead his people there to escape the lesser races of the mainland 
                and give his people an opportunity to study magic and pursue enlightenment.<br>

              <blockquote>Here ye! Here ye! Calling all Adventurers of the Luclin 
                Realm!<br>
                <br>
                We are announcing the creation of The Norrathian Combat League! 
                A fighting league, not to be taken lightly and not for wimps! 
                The NCL will be an official league for Professional Fighters on 
                the Luclin Realm of Norrath. It will be a No-Holds-Barred travelling 
                Competition where only the strong survive! Read on for the OFFICIAL 
                NCL Rules and Regulations!<br>
                <br>
                <b>GENERAL RULES OF THE NCL</b><br>
                <br>
                1) Concerning Twinkers- Fighters will be inspected before every 
                fight, any armor, items, or weapons which are declared too high 
                for that fighter must be removed. Refusal to remove the armor 
                will result in IMMEDIATE disqualification.<br>
                <br>
                2) Concerning Pets- Pets ARE allowed but can NOT be brought in 
                before the fight, they must be summoned after the fight has begun.<br>
                <br>
                3) DoT Spells- The loser is the first to hit the ground, period. 
                If a DoT spell kills the second Combatant after the fight has 
                been declared over, he remains the winner.. However, if he is 
                not bound near-by and has another fight which he can not make 
                it back in time for, the fight will be declared a forfeit.<br>
                <br>
                4) Sabotage- Sabotaging a fighter by casting ANY sort of DoT or 
                Debuff on him before a fight begins will be punished to the maximum 
                of our power! It will result in the IMMEDIATE removal of the one 
                casting the spells from the NCL!<br>
                <br>
                <b>NO EXCEPTIONS!!!!!</b><br>
                <br>
                5) Buffing- Buffs are allowed for a caster, but they can NOT be 
                cast before the fight begins. You can not Buff a fellow fighter 
                before or during a fight. You can, however, Debuff someone you 
                are fighting during the fight.<br>
                <br>
                6) Leaving The Ring- While fighting you are NOT allowed to leave 
                the Arena in which the match is taking place. Leaving the Arena 
                will be considered an act of cowardice and result in a forfeit 
                victory for your opponent.<br>
                <br>
                <b>RANKINGS, CHAMPIONS, AND DIVISIONS</b><br>
                <br>
                1)There will be 1 Division for every 5 levels rannging from the 
                Super Flyweight Division for levels 1-5 to the Super Heavyweight 
                Division for levels 45+. Each Division will have it's own champion.<br>
                <br>
                2) Challenging The Champion- Anyone can challenge their Division 
                Champion, however the Champion is only REQUIRED to accept challenges 
                from those in the Top 3.<br>
                <br>
                3) Rankings- Rankings will be based on a Win-Loss system. The 
                player with the most Wins will be Ranked #1. Ties in the Win column 
                will be decided by who has the least losses. Any players tied 
                in both Wins and Losses will be declared tied and hold the same 
                position in the Rankings until a fight is held to declare a clear 
                leader.<br>
                <br>
                <b>FIGHTERS</b><br>
                <br>
                1) Fighters will stay in the Fighter's Quarters before every fight. 
                These rooms will be monitored to make sure there are no attempts 
                at cheating before the fight begins. Any casting of Buffs or trading 
                of Equipment before or after a fight will be declared cheating 
                and result in the Disqualtification of both fighters involved.<br>
                <br>
                <b>SPECTATORS</b><br>
                <br>
                1) Spectators will be allowed in the arena and gambling is allowed. 
                Intereference in the fight will result in your removal from the 
                Arena and banning from all future fights. Refusal to leave the 
                arena will be dealt with as necessary...(use your imagination)<br>
                <br>
                The first event will be a tournament to be held in Freeport Arena 
                at an as-yet undetermined time, watch this page for the official 
                announcement of the opening of the NCL for fighters.<br>

              <blockquote>Greetings all!
                <p>Last night, well over 100 leaders and officers of the guilds 
                  of FenninRo met in the Temple of Solusek Ro in order to listen 
                  to ideas forembettering roleplay on a server-wide scale. Jythri 
                  duan'Cliar of The Soerbaird and Jubal Kinseeker of the Sterling 
                  Order of Knights proposed before the collected assembly a flexible 
                  system of regional law and government, which they have termed 
                  'Common Law'.
                <p>Discussion of these concepts among Fennin Ro residents begin 
                  today onthe Fennin Ro Guild Hall (<a href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro">http://www.sok.org/fenninro</a>). 
                  There's a lot of work to do ahead of us. But even if the idea 
                  of Common Law fails, we, the leaders of Fennin Ro, have already 
                  succeeded--we have begun to set a precedent for communication 
                  and interaction that will go a long way to improving our world.

                <p>We are excited about the support many have shown thus far, 
                  and areready to work to make Norrath a more interesting and 
                  alive place for us all to be.
                <p><b>SIDE NOTE:</b><br>
                  I apologize to any guild who thought the primary reason for 
                  the meeting was to discuss the Fennin Ro split. That topic has 
                  beendiscussed at length on the Fennin Ro Guild Hall for a couple 
                  of weeks now, and most of the guilds who have spoken there are 
                  resolved to stay. We did speak briefly of the split at the end 
                  of the meeting, many leaders there expressing disgust at the 
                  poor options offered by Verant on the matter, and many re-stated 
                  their resolve to remain on Fennin.
                <p>Thank all of you again, for your support and attendance! We 
                  lookforward to the future.
                <p>Listen and Live.

              <blockquote>Knights of the Holy Storm: Mage Recruitment<br>
                Calling all Enchanters, Magicians and Wizards...
                <p>In the depths of night stirs an evil that has gone unchecked 
                  for too long. Its vile claw has begun to reach above the surface 
                  to begin to plague the world. The evil has begun to reach into 
                  the souls of individuals who seek to destroy life with their 
                  powers from beyond the grave. Others come with a sword but seem 
                  to call from the spirit realm to command the dead. Their repulsive 
                  ways of commanding the helpless souls are coming to an end. 
                  On the horizon a cloud of anger approaches bringing with it 
                  a terrible fury. Fierce winds, violent flames, unyielding rocks, 
                  humbling all in its path. It strikes at the heart of the evil 
                  bringing justice to those that know no honor. Nothing can stand 
                  for long in its terrible thunder bringing forth light.
                <p>The Storm is coming...<br>
                  OOC: I have been authorized to announce an open recruitment 
                  call for all good aligned enchanters, wizards and magicians.

              <blockquote>Please bring this issue up with your development team 
                Abashi.
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">It's already been discussed. We want to get 
                away from the idea of implementing so many "Is he doing his job" 
                messages. Currently on the test server, we've added messages to 
                the group for looting. We've further been asked to add messages 
                for taunting, the evade skill, and pickpocket. 
                <p>At some point we have to suggest that people learn who they 
                  can trust. Many craftsman on the servers have established a 
                  well-earned reputation for honesty, and earn a good deal of 
                  business because of it. Would it be fair to them to eliminate 
                  the "trust" factor and have it so anyone could deal with any 
                  craftsman and be sure they won't get cheated? Even if we did 
                  include the message, what would stop someone from just taking 
                  the item and telling you, "tough luck"? I imagine the next step 
                  after that would be a call for us to develop some kind of secure-crafting 
                  mechanism in the game. 
                <p>We want to let people earn their reputations.
                </font>
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>There's only one contradicting 
                  factor in your claim: if you were to let players make or break 
                  their own reputations, then why did you implement a trade window? 
                  Aren't you, in that way, regulating fraud committed in trades? 
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">You indeed have a point, so lets just say 
                that we're not completely oblivious to human nature. I guess it's 
                more a matter of expectation. Due to the implementation of other 
                games in the genre, secure trade windows are expected, but secure 
                crafting is not. 
                <p>It's also a matter of choice. Trading is fairly integral to 
                  the game. It would be hard for someone to get all the way to 
                  50 in this game and never trade with someone. If someone commits 
                  fraud in a trade, they are affected adversely due to something 
                  that they *had* to do, and have no recourse. 
                <p>It is not necessary for someone to engage in crafts for them 
                  to get through the game. They can do so with or without that 
                  black pearl choker, it is just something they want. If they 
                  are defrauded as part of a craft, their recourse is to ruin 
                  the name of the craftsman.

                goes off without a hitch. Here's some things that we know at present:
                <P>1. Accounts will probably be moved on a first-come-first-serve 
                  basis,<BR>
                  based upon a method that we will provide for people to indicate<BR>
                  interest.
                <P>2. No special consideration will be given to guilds or groups.<BR>
                  Therefore, we'd suggest that only people who have no ties or 
                  have no<BR>
                  problem with being moved without contingencies ask to be moved 
                  whenwe<BR>
                  provide the method to indicate interest.
                <P>3. Guild tags probably won't follow over to the new server. 
                  People will<BR>
                  have to setup guilds as if it was any other new server.
                <P>As I have more information on how this will happen, I'll make 
                  the<BR>
                  information available.

              <blockquote>Hello EQ fanatics,<br>
                Just Alethal here, I usually just put up news, submissions, events, 
                and things of that nature. This is basically a calling of all 
                who play and have a concern or comment on the changes about to 
                take place to our world. One of the biggest news issues currently 
                is the test to take place on Tallon Zek. Looting will be coin 
                only, this means there is now no risk of PvP battle other than 
                some money and you get returned to your bind spot. This is a improvement 
                in many ways, however it has caused a uproar amongst the current 
                die hard customers who reside on this server and the other PvP 
                servers. I have submitted a idea to my friend <a href="mailto:gwrinn@verant.com">Gordon 
                Wrinn</a> at verant aswell as using /feedback regarding this. 
                I suggest every one who cares about this makes a statment at <a href="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=PvP+Server+Discussion&number=42" target="_blank">PvP 
                Server Discussion</a>, aswell as using /feedback to comment on

                world.

            <div> Well, I have had to make an additional option on the poll regarding 
              TZ and the Coin-Only loot change coming up. I had quite a few people 
              suggest it to me. I thought I had all the options, but did not think 
              about this one. <br>
              <br>
              So, I have added "On TZ Now - Quit EQ" as an option. If you would 
              like that one, and have already voted, I am sorry. Either clear

                I have a terrible suspicion that the mobs that drop the pieces 
                have been upped in level but that the spawn times (which are the 
                real problem) will remain unchanged. Give some sort of sign that 
                you understand the real concern and that the upcoming changes 
                reflect that.</blockquote>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Analysis shows that some pieces 
                of the cleric armor will take nearly 40 hours to acquire. This 
                is obviously unacceptable, and we are *greatly reducing* the time 
                it should take. Spawn times, spawn percentages, and drop percentages 
                are being adjusted across the board. This is not just for cleric 
                armor, but for several, which I'll announce on patch-day. <br>
                <Br>
                Please keep in mind though that initial availability might appear 
                to be less than it actually is due to the rush that occurs when 
                new items are brought in game. As I recall, when class-specific 
                stuff was first put in, *every* class complained about availability. 
                After a few weeks, only a few were left with a problem, as the 
                hoards of initial people finished getting theirs. Since cleric 
                armor is so rare at the moment, I imagine there will be a similar 
                rush on all the servers as it becomes available.<br>
                <br>
                In response to some other posters, there are currently no plans 
                to adjust any of the statistics (AC, Weight, Bonuses) on the armor. 
                I do agree that AC and Weight needs to be discussed internally, 
                just let us get the spawn times and such worked out before we 
                move on to the next phase. <br>

              on Tallon Zek. It is going to be changed to a coin-only looting 
              system. Granted this is just for testing, but the results will be 
              interesting.<br>
              <br>
              I have decided to put aside the current Pets Poll in favor of something 
              a little more timely. Take a look at the poll, figure out where 
              you are playing now, and where you will be headed when the change 
              is made. Then vote away...

                <p>That's right, the Knights Hospitaller are once again having 
                  their famous Running of the Fools, through the platforms and 
                  bridges of Kelethin, this coming Saturday, February 12th, at 
                  2PM CST! We will be having two races, one for newbies, and one 
                  for everyone. The newbie race is free to enter, and the top 
                  finishers will be awarded various items for their efforts, including 
                  finesteel weapons, raw silk armor, steins, etc. The open race 
                  will have an entry fee of 8pp; that money will be added to 200pp 
                  and will the total will consist of the prize purse for the race. 
                  The winner of the open race will receive 50% of the purse, 2nd 
                  place 25%, and 3rd 15%. 
                <p>Registration will take place at the Kelethin bank, starting 
                  at 1PM CST. Ristorette, our distinguished Master, will act as 
                  registrar, and collect the names and registration fees. Registration 
                  for the newbie race closes at 1:50PM CST, and the registration 
                  for the open race will close at 2:30PM CST, barring unforseeable 
                  circumstances. The race will begin at the Soldiers of Tunare 
                  (the ranger guild) and will proceed to the Scouts of Tunare 
                  (the thieves' guild); participants will be given their alcohol 
                  at the start line just before the start. Spirit of the Wolf 
                  and Selo Accelerando will be allowed; we will haveshamans and 
                  druids on hand to cast SoW on those who wish for it. Levitate 
                  and Spirit of the Cheetah will not be allowed and use will result 
                  in disqualification. Those who fall and die will have to report 
                  to the PoD lift for re-intoxication before proceeding.
                <p>This race course is safe (relatively); I have personally tested 
                  it, totally intoxicated, and completed it most of the time. 
                  There is always the chance of falling, but, as the previous 
                  contestants will say, not many have fallen, and few of them 
                  have died. We cannot guarantee your safety, but, then again, 
                  how much fun is a race with no risk?
                <p>Members of the Knights Hospitaller will be on hand to provide 
                  bindings at the PoD lift for those that have traveled to race. 
                  The prize ceremony will take place at the PoD lift after ALL 
                  races are completed; at that time, all excess alcohol will be 
                  distributed to first the participants, and then to any who desire 
                  it.
                <p>All residents of Innoruuk are encouraged to come; spectators 
                  from other servers are encouraged to make a new character and 
                  engage in the festivities. Races like this are more fun when 
                  there is a crowd to both participate and to cheer on the racers.

              <blockquote>The Scouts returned to Kelethin today, after risking 
                life and limb exploring the depths of Neriak. They've uncovered 
                evidence of a secret tunnel in the works, going from the heart 
                of Neriak's third gate, straight to Crushbone. In addition to 
                new information discovered from several Orc Runners, the Soldiers 
                of Tunare have learned that the Indigo Brotherhood does, in fact, 
                have plans to complete this tunnel system and invade Faydark full 
                force, lead by Narex T'Vem. As the General of Tunare, I have taken 
                it upon myselfto see that this does not happen!<br>
                <br>
                Tunare's army, and all loyal to Her, will be assaulting Neriak. 
                Any who wish to see the Tier'dal slaughtered mercilessly are welcome 
                to join us, but bear in mind this assault will be VERY difficult, 
                and many of our numbers will be cut down. The main assault force 
                will be made up of those who have passed level 35, under this 
                level are welcome to come and help, but expect to die probably 
                more than once.<br>
                <br>
                This assault is scheduled for Saturday 2/19 at 8 PM EST on the 
                Tarew Marr server, the meeting place will be east commons by the 
                Nektulos zone. The assault force will enter Neriak through the 
                Foreign Quarter and lay waste to all in our path. Once in the 
                Neriak Commons, we will bypass the main entrance via a secret 
                tunnel system (swim up the waterfall where the Priest of Discord 
                is stationed) which will take us to an inn called Toadstool. From 
                here we will assault the Guildhall of the Indigo Brotherhood and 
                slay Narex T'Vem, our primary target. Without their leader, the 
                darkling forces will be without guideance, and we may stop their 
                invasion plans once and for allshould we be sucessful.<br>
                <br>
                GMs and Guides have been asked to attend, first to make sure the 
                lessconsiderate players don't do things like dump guard trains 
                on s "because they're roleplaying", but hopefully they can play 
                along with us, maybe take over some NPCs and shout stuff at us 
                to add some spice to the event :) This raid will be very difficult, 
                but no more so than raiding the Plane of Fear or Hate or Sky, 
                which people do on a regular basis. There will be many experienced 
                high level players at the event, designated "pullers", etc. We 
                will have clerics on hand for reses, druids and wizards for teleports 
                out when the event is over, etc. We don't want people coming that 
                want loot, there won't be any to get. We don't want people coming 
                who want experience, because many of us will be dying, getting 
                resurected, dying again, etc. Thepeope invited are anyone who 
                wants to have FUN and do something not many others can say they 
                have. Level 35+ is recomended, but if you're not that high you're 
                still welcome to come, but do so at your own risk. The guards 
                inside are level 35, and other npcs are even higher. Narex T'Vem 
                should be level 50, and will most likely hit for around 300+ and 
                resist most spells.. but to people that kill gods and dragons 
                regularly, he shouldn't post much more of a threat.<br>
                <br>

              <p>
              <blockquote><font color="a00000">Hello all,<br>
                Every Monday here at Verant we hold our weekly meetings to go 
                over the current outstanding projects and make plans for the week 
                going forward. At this week's meeting, we discussed a number of 
                issues that I'd like to bring to your attention and open for debate.
                <p><b>Skin Like Nature:</b><br>
                  Last week a change to the Skin Like Nature spell was implemented. 
                  The change replaced the "HP Regen" component of the spell with 
                  a "Damage Shield" component.
                <p>We also introduced a bug that caused the damage shield to stack 
                  improperly. The Damage Shield values are being subtracted instead 
                  of being added. The Damage shield bug will be fixed in the next 
                  patch for all stackable damage shields that had this problem 
                  (there were a few). However, we'd like to open the damage shield's 
                  replacement of the regen component for debate.
                <p>The regen component on this spell was replaced with the Shield 
                  because it allowed the Enchanter-Gasping and Necro-Heart series 
                  to overwrite SLN. Unfortunately, directly fixing this issue 
                  is not possible, as it would require a rewrite of the spell-interaction/stacking 
                  code. This would undoubtedly introduce other problems that we 
                  don't want to risk at this stage. By replacing the regen component 
                  with the damage shield, SLN is no longer overwritten by those 
                  other spells.
                <p>As it seems that many people were upset by the change, and 
                  since the change was not made for balance reasons, we&#8217;d 
                  like to get general consensus on what should be done with the 
                  spell. The options available are 1) Leave it as it is now (Damage 
                  Shield), or 2) Return it to the way it was (HP Regen).
                <p><b>The Mistwalker:</b><br>
                  We are currently reevaluating the decision to reduce the proc 
                  percentage for this weapon. We&#8217;re looking at the number 
                  of Mistwalker&#8217;s on each server, and the possible effect 
                  should we return it to the way it was. We are also looking at 
                  other ways to avoid the exploit that was possible before, that 
                  would allow us to return the weapon to the way it was. Much 
                  thanks to everyone who sent in suggestions that would make this 
                  possible. I can&#8217;t comment further on it at this time, 
                  but I just wanted to let those concerned know that the issue 
                  was still open.
                <p><b>Tallon Zek & PvP Looting:</b> <br>
                  There is unfortunately no reasonable way for us to eliminate 
                  the equipment dependence disparity between melee and caster 
                  classes. This equipment dependence disparity creates a loot 
                  disparity on the two servers. Casters can &#8220;bag&#8221; 
                  all of their equipment and still be 90% effective in PvP combat. 
                  Melee, on the other hand, cannot. During the next patch, tentatively 
                  scheduled for 2/16/00, we will be changing the looting rules 
                  for the Tallon Zek server from &#8220;Coin + 1 item&#8221; to 
                  &#8220;Coin Only&#8221;. This change is being made as a Test 
                  to determine what looting rules are actually preferred by the 
                  majority of people who play on PvP. We&#8217;ll be examining 
                  server load over the next few weeks to determine the changes 
                  impact on population. Vallon Zek (the other PvP Teams Server) 
                  will remain &#8220;Coin + 1 item&#8221;.
                <p>We expect that this change will lead to a new influx of people 
                  playing melee characters on Tallon Zek. Please keep in mind 
                  that in the event that the change shows itself to be detrimental 
                  to server population or morale, the server may be changed back 
                  to &#8220;Coin + 1 item&#8221; loot.
                <p><b>Alchemy and Poison:</b> <br>
                  Alchemy and Poison are in the process of being revamped on the 
                  Test server. Changes are scheduled to go live on 2/16/00, but 
                  don&#8217;t quote me on that just yet
                <p><b>Rogue Enhancements: </b><br>
                  Some interesting rogue enhancements are being developed on the 
                  Test server with plans of going live on 2/16/00.
                <p>The chance of scoring a critical hit with a throwing weapon 
                  is being increased dramatically. In addition, a thrown weapon 
                  that hits the target from behind will have a chance of scoring 
                  a &#8220;Deadly Strike&#8221;. Additional throwing weapons will 
                  be released at a later date to make throwing even more viable.
                <p>In addition to the throwing changes, a new ability (much more 
                  exciting than throwing) is being granted to the rogue class. 
                  The ability, called &#8220;Evade&#8221;, is tied to the &#8220;Hide&#8221; 
                  skill. It is used by targeting a creature and pressing the &#8220;Hide&#8221; 
                  button. If it is successful, it will dramatically reduce how 
                  much the targeted creature hates the rogue. The Rogue will be 
                  given a message indicating success or failure.
                <p>This new ability is, for all intents and purposes, a reverse 
                  taunt, and will help the grouped rogue shift the targeted creatures 
                  focus back to the tank after landing all of those hits. This 
                  is not like feign death, which makes the creature forget you 
                  entirely, but rather just makes it hate you less. In addition, 
                  it only works against the targeted creature.
                <p>The skill is partially implemented on the Test server. Currently, 
                  getting hit by a creature makes the rogue&#8217;s &#8220;Hide&#8221; 
                  button gray out. Once this is changed so that it doesn&#8217;t 
                  gray out upon getting hit, it will work as intended.
                <p><b>NPC Warping: </b><br>
                  We are dedicating a good number of man hours this week to tracking 
                  down and eliminating the bug that causes a fleeing creature 
                  to teleport away.

              <blockquote>Brad. Its obvious you guys put a lot of time into the 
                backround and substory involved in Everquest and Norrathian History.I 
                know you guys have some of the history of Norrath written up in 
                the Official Everquest guidebook, but considering the expansion, 
                it is quite incomplete. Could I reccomend that you guys publish 
                a mini-book to be shipped with the Kunark expansion?
                <p>Something that details the Combine Empire, the history and 
                  backround of Norrath as well as Kunark. Perhaps some color detail 
                  on the races. Perhaps some detail on notable NPCs, like King 
                  Kazon, or Sir Lucan... Maybe something about the Live-guk vs 
                  Dead-guk situation. Perhaps something about the Estate of Unrest. 
                  That would be some good reading.
                <p>Even if it were only 10 pages or so, Im sure most of the players 
                  would read it. Even if its just toilet reading, eq is still 
                  one of the few games where people would actually read the backround 
                  fluff that would be sent with the game
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">Great idea, we'll give it a shot. Not sure 
                if we can get it into print, but at least on the web site.

                <br>
                My name is Faeryn and I reside on the Povar server within the 
                lands ofNorrath. I have recently spent some time putting together 
                an idea for a role-playing guild in order to help provide those 
                of us who wish to engage in something more then hacking and slashing 
                another option. The guild will be called Knights of the Deep and 
                I invite one and all to visit our site in order to get a better 
                understanding of what we will be about.<br>
                <br>
                Here is the link and I thank you all for your time. :)<br>

                <br>
                February 2, 2000 - Toy Vault has announced it will manufacture 
                highly detailed action figures for the record breaking online 
                PC Game, EverQuest.<br>
                <br>
                Since its premier in March of 1999, EverQuest has quickly become 
                the most successful online role-playing game ever released with 
                more than 280,000 units sold by year end. It's also received numerous 
                accolades from the press, including being named as Gamespot's 
                1999 Game of the Year and among Game Informer's 15 Games that 
                Changed the World. <br>
                <br>
                Published by 989 Studios, this RPG juggernaut has currently accumulated 
                an active, and growing, subscriber base of more than 175,000 players 
                who pay on a monthly basis to access the EverQuest world.<br>
                <br>
                "EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve 
                of entertainment software," said Kelly Flock, President, 989 Studios. 
                "What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and 
                subscription numbers are continuing to grow by the thousands, 
                week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a 
                blockbuster movie than the usual online, computer game."<br>
                <br>
                EverQuest is a 24-hour, virtual fantasy world in which players 
                (in traditional RPG fashion) create an on screen persona. They 
                may then travel through an astonishing 3D "Dungeons & Dragons" 
                styled universe where they can embark on quests and battle incredible 
                monsters. Along the way players can pick up virtual artifacts 
                and weapons which can, in turn, be traded to others. <br>
                <br>
                The allure of EverQuest revolves around an interactive storyline 
                that evolves according to a player's decisions. Players can explore 
                3 continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities. 
                Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, 
                alliances and politics.<br>
                As in more conventional pen and paper RPGs, EverQuest adepts can 
                form alliances with other players, simultaneously slaying monsters 
                and embarking on mutual adventures. This offers gamers an unparalleled, 
                totally immersive, social experience.<br>
                <br>
                "It's not only the best online computer game on the market," said 
                Jon Huston, founder of Toy Vault and an avid EverQuest devotee, 
                "but it also has the most breathtaking selection of characters 
                on which to base a successful line of high quality action figures. 
                With 12 different character classes and thousands of monsters, 
                we can create a line of unique and imaginative toys that will 
                appeal to gamers and fantasy fans of all ages. Our fully articulated 
                figures will be based on a scale of 6 feet to 7 inches and remain 
                faithful to the 3D style of the game. In addition," added Huston, 
                "we'll also be producing figures based on the new expansion pack, 
                The Ruins of Kunark, which is due to launch in April 2000."<br>
                <br>

                <br>
                I created this site so Magicians would have a single spot to have 
                discussions. This site was inspired by The Druid's Grove (Heh, 
                Elial is in my guild so I have to plug his site). I hope it will 
                eventuallybecome the spot for the magician community to congregate.<br>
                <br>
                I'd like some submissions for the Library. In the Library I will 
                postpermanent info, so people don't have to ask the same stuff 
                over andover. I'm looking for good articles on zones, the different 
                pets, tactics, the Sol Ro quests, and anything you can think of. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I'd also like to get a couple moderators. E-mail me at <a href="rebo_eq@hotmail.com">rebo_eq@hotmail.com</a> 
                with suggestions. <br>

              <blockquote>Earlier tonight, Feb 5, The Dark Exile held an unnanounced 
                event in Unrest on the Xegony server. Evidently, two of their 
                members decided to<br>
                <br>
                enter into marriage, and selected the tower in Unrest as the location 
                for the ceremony. Afterwards, Dark Exile members took many excellent 
                items and a large sum of platinum and distributed it among the 
                zone MoBs. Word spread quickly about the event, and at one point 
                there was well over 90 people in the zone. Once all was in readiness, 
                The Dark Exile told everyone to go, and the killing commenced. 
                A few of the nicer items I heard that were dropped: a FBSS, a 
                TBB, 2 SSOY, anExecutioner's Hood, and an Executioner's Axe. Sadly, 
                the event did not go as smoothly as it could have, and there were 
                some complaints. On the whole, though, a good time was had by 
                many. Kudos to The Dark Exile guild for trying to do something 
                fun and different!<br>

                forsale....with a *pewter Iksar figure* included! Do a search 
                at Outpost.com to see it.<br>
                <br>
                Sure wish I could get a plastic version of the races or MoBs in

              <blockquote>Last night on Povar server, the King of the dwarven 
                city was slain. This was lead by the brave troll, Nuglug, lvl 
                40 Warrior of the Harmonium guild. There was a strong presence 
                of Harmonium there, however it was not a guild only raid. The 
                raid was really two separate raids... One which was a small group 
                that started to clear out the King's castle in Kaladim, which 
                was destroyed from all the dwarf protesters who had decided to 
                train guards onto the invading party. The second was the successful 
                one where the group that increased in size by three fold, in the 
                raid the King was pulled to the zone and held there until the 
                raid party rushed in to slay him. This had to be down due to the 
                large number or dwarven protestors at the King's palace in Kaladim. 
                The raid was a success due to the awesome fire power of Cylus, 
                lvl 50 Wiz of the Harmonium. The loot from the King's was a mere 
                Battle Axe and Targ Shield which was looted from the corpse by 
                a immature dwarven protestor named Aweer before a screenshot could 
                be taken. The raid cost many people there lives for as soon as 
                the King was killed another dwarven protestor had trained a huge 
                train to chase all the evils away.Over all a good raid, would 
                have been a great raid if not for the training and childness in 
                the air of Kaladim that night. Another, disappointment was the 
                loot and the fact that the axe was not able to be giving to Nuglug, 
                the leader of the raid.<br>

              <blockquote>On this fair Sunday,February the sixth,at 7:00pm CST

                wedding is between two fine souls:Tachian Vendrevain ,of the Everlasting 
                Alliance, and Roberto Doucette. This will be the first same sex 
                marriage in Everquest,to our knowledge. We hope that all will

                angered players (not to mention the stuff that never was developed 
                *cough* rogues *cough*), it is clear that the EverQuest players 
                need to all band together to have a live discussion of the problems 
                in game. I invite all players to come together and discuss the 
                state of things on Sunday, February 6th, at 8pm EST on the Innoruuk 
                server. All players should meet in the East Commons zone, in the 
                Shady Swashbuckler area of the EC/NRo tunnel, and spill out onto 
                the mountainside.<br>
                <br>
                Players not already playing on the Innoruuk server are of course 
                invited to just create a new PC in Freeport and attend. <br>
                <br>
                Topics of discussion will include, but are not limited to:<br>
                -Overcrowding.<br>
                -Poor implementation/development of rogues.<br>
                -Shaman issues.<br>
                -Recent necromancer changes.<br>
                <BR>
                <BR>
                By bringing players together for multiple causes, we gain strength 
                in numbers. Make your voice heard!<BR>

                <p>Respected guilds, houses, and persona of Fennin Ro:
                <p>I, Jythri duan'Cliar, Pencerdd of The Soerbaird, Bard of Norrath, 
                  hereby convene the Council of the Collective, a meeting of the 
                  guild leaders of Fennin Ro. 
                <p>We assemble to discuss our future in Norrath, especially as 
                  it involves relations and conflict between our guilds.
                <p>The meeting is open to all guilds, regardless of the deity 
                  you follow or your political or racial diversity. We are not 
                  meeting to resolve all our differences. We are meeting to open 
                  official lines of diplomacy so that communication might move 
                  more freely between our groups.
                <p>Each guild will be asked to send no more than three delegates 
                  to the meeting, so that they may be represented, but so that 
                  the numbers attending will not grow to be out of hand. 
                <p>Date: Thursday, February 10thTime: To be announcedPlace: To 
                  be announced
                <p>The time and place of the meeting will be disclosed privately 
                  when you RSVP.
                <p><b>You must RSVP to attend the Council.</b> 
                <p>To RSVP, do the following:<br>
                  1) Go to the Collective's Fennin Ro page <br>
                  (<a href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro/">http://www.sok.org/fenninro/</a>).<br>
                  2) Go to the forums, and in the Meeting Hall forum, post an 
                  introduction of yourself, naming yourself and your guild. Within 
                  a few hours, you will be granted access to the private Leadership 
                  forum where we will discuss and disclose more details of the 
                  event.
                <p>Again, we do not seek to exclude anyone who desires to participate, 
                  but we also do not want an over-large and unruly crowd.
                <p>OOC: The Collective of Old Fennin is an association of the 
                  Roleplaying and Roleplay-supportive guilds of Fennin Ro. Although 
                  newly named, most of us have been working together for four 
                  or five months now, and are desiring to involve even more of 
                  the Roleplayers on Fennin. All guilds are welcome to attend, 
                  but our plans are designed for those who enjoy Roleplay and 
                  want to see it continue to come alive on Fennin.
                <p>If you have further questions, you may visit the Fennin Ro 
                  Guild Hall forums (<a href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro/">http://www.sok.org/fenninro/</a>)

                announced that it will team with Verant Interactive (creators 
                of the wildly successful EverQuest)and Sony Online to create a 
                massively multiplayer, persistent game based in the Star Trek 
                universe. The company, during a conference call with financial 
                analysts yesterday, said the game will be part of a larger expansion 
                into the online world.
                <p>Activision says it expects between 400,000 and 500,000 subscribers 
                  to the game, which would make it the largest online game to 
                  date. Moreamazingly, it expects to hit these numbers in its 
                  first four months.
                <p>Though it's not expected to launch for another two years, the 
                  game looks to be enormous. Activision and Sony will split the 
                  expected $4 million in production costs. The company says it 
                  will charge users a $9.95 monthly fee at launch.

            <div> Looks like the good ol Patch message has been updated:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote>The following changes have been implemented on the live 
                servers: <br>
                *Spells* <br>
                <br>
                - Lay On Hands: Enhanced to heal more hitpoints per level. <br>
                - Enveloping Roots: Casting time reduced to match Immobilize <br>
                - Skin Like Nature: Small Damage Shield added. This will stack 
                with other shields. <br>
                - Insidious Fever: Casting time reduced.<br>
                - Insidious Malady: Casting time Reduced. <br>
                - Burnout series: Negative HP component removed to bring it in 
                line with the Necromancer's Intensify/Augment death series. <br>
                *Songs*<br>
                - Syvelian's Anti-magic Aura: Potency increased. <br>
                - Shauri's Sonorous Clouding: Now also grants See Invisible. Party 
                members can now see each other while under the effect of this 
                song. <br>
                Additionally, the following songs have been given a slightly larger 
                radius: <br>
                - Selo's Accelerando - Agilmente's Aria of Eagles - Shauri's Sonorous 
                Clouding - Tarew's Aquatic Ayre <br>
                *PvP-Teams Change* Customers on the PvP-Teams servers have been 
                plagued by a tactic known as "Bind Rushing". Casters would bind 
                themselves in a hostile area or dungeon, and attack everyone of 
                an opposing race in the area. Sooner or later the caster would 
                die. They would then respawn, memorize a few spells, then jump 
                back in to attack their wounded opponents. As a first step in 
                combating this practice and improving life for those on the PvP-Servers, 
                casters will now respawn with zero mana after being killed by 
                another player in a duel or open combat. <br>
                This code is new for those on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It has been 
                in place for some time on Rallos Zek and works very well there. 
                <br>
                *The Plane of Sky* <br>
                All spells that grant levitation will no longer function in the 
                Plane of Sky. This affects spells cast by Wizards, Enchanters, 
                Shamans, Druids, Necromancers, and Bards. The Plane of Sky is 
                designed to be completed in certain fashion, and the existence 
                of these spells allowed the islands to be completed out-of-order. 
                <br>
                A teleporter will be placed on the first island in the next patch 
                to allow people access to the room below. <br>

                awaits you inside, but you find yourself in the middle of what 
                appears to be an ongoing social event, and the cabin is filled 
                with adventurers, some younger then yourself, some older and wiser. 
                You wander aimlessly through the frontdoor, unknowing what to 
                expect next. A young woodelven woman wanders to you, noticing 
                you coming in from the cold. "Greetings, I am Kalluna, hostess 
                this evening, welcome brave adventure, sit by the fire, warm your 
                spirit, rest your feet, enjoy some elven wine, and the company 
                of others, but leave your weapons on the porch, you won't need 
                them here, you're among friends now." She leaves your side, tending 
                to some other matters of importance, and you find yourself emmersed 
                deeply in conversation with the other adventurers, learning from 
                others, and teaching those younger then yourself. You wonder to 
                yourself why you never noticed that lone cabin in the woods before..

                  message boards, you send them/petitions, you file /feedback

              <blockquote>There will be a peak-jumping contest in Everfrost Peaks 
                on Wednesday, February 16 on the Quellious server. If anyone is 
                unfamiliar with the term, peak-jumping is the extreme sport that 
                was created by linkdead runners relogging and finding themselves 
                on the top of the peaks with no way down. The winner is the one 
                who can inflict the most damage upon him or herself without dying. 
                Damage is strictly self-reported on the honor system.
                <p>A prize to be determined will be awarded to the winner or anyone 
                  who really gets some velocity going before their demise. Entry 
                  is free, and all races, classes and levels are welcome to participate 
                  or watch the gory proceedings.
                <p>The event is strictly BYOB: bring your own bandages (or bind).<br>
                  Please feel free to contact Celian in game or write Celian@aol.com.<br>
                  Good luck, and I look forward to seeing you (albeit briefly) 
                  there!

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>You are correct. The weapon was 
                changed so that it would only proc 25% as often as it used to. 
                This should have been announced. It's not the damage that this 
                pet does that we had a problem with, that was acceptable since 
                the item is dropped by a God.Though I can't go into much detail 
                at the moment, the item was changed because of an exploit that 
                it made possible. Due to this exploit, we won't be able to return 
                the weapon to its old status, and *may* have to reduce its proc 
                percentage further. <br>
                <br>
                We're considering removing the current effect on the weapon and 
                replacing it with a substantial (greater than the average damage 
                of the pet) direct damage spell and returning it to its old proc 
                percentage. Thoughts?</font></blockquote>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>You have a point there. Of course 
                the pet could hit for 1 or just plain miss, so it might as well 
                be resisted. Of course, regardless what proc we put on it, there's 
                always going to be the chance that you run across some creatures 
                that always resist it. That would of course be true regardless 
                what spell we put on it (aside from the pet one). </font></blockquote>

                to do with balance, as it was to stop an exploit, lets not exaggerate 
                like this please. When people say that 1 item made them 1000 times 
                more powerful, or that they are useless without the item, it only 
                confirms our belief that the item was too powerful. No one item

                The two options that are available are: 1) Leave it as it is now 
                for the time being 2) change the proc to a DD spell and return

              <blockquote>There was a GM event last night on E'ci. Upon zoning 
                into GFay the following was broadcast across the zone:<br>
                High pitched laughter fills the air in a gleeish harmony. Echoing 
                from every direction in the forest, the voices seem to come from 
                the Earth, Flora and Sky.<br>
                A few moments later, this was broadcast:<br>
                The laughter grows louder, feminin voices giggling in a tone of 
                playfullness.<br>
                Six named Pixies appeared around the orc lift and the Pod lift 
                in Kelethin.<br>
                The Windlite sisters. Seffena, Ayrelli, Arsaele, Saleria, Endalia, 
                and Niraya. A few people attacked immediately and were either 
                killed or feared.<br>
                It seems the Windlite sisters were visiting Kelethin to cause 
                a littlemischief. ;) They played tag with us, backstabbing ot 
                attacking once to make you "it". Seffena sent me, and several 
                other members of At Fates Hands on a romp through the newbie area, 
                feared of course. Niraya sent several people flying with a few 
                casts of Gravity Flux. (Thanks, my friend Escapee, for the heal) 
                The guards took a liking to the Windlites, but the pixies made 
                short work of them. Most notable, though, was when Seffena took 
                a liking to my friend Darkfiend Lightbearer's sword. Being a powerful 
                Paladin, he wields a Soulfire. Seffena asked if the flames were 
                held on by some sort of magic glue, and then asked if she could 
                have the blade.<br>
                Darkfiend gave her the blade, and she recharged it for him. After 
                causing a bit more mishief, they waved goodbye and vanished as 
                quickly as they appeared. All in all it was a lot of fun.<br>

              <blockquote>It's pretty clear that Verant totally forgot that the 
                change to pets would affect enchanters too. Certainly no one was 
                saying enchanter pets were overpowered - they were barely adequate 
                if that. No one minds if you make a mistake; it happens to everyone, 
                and it's a complex game. It certainly isn't necessary to pretend 
                that it was deliberate in order to save face - just fix it back 
                the way it was if you can - if you can't, then just bump up the 
                speed of the animations to where they'd do the same damage they 
                were doing. 
                <p><font color="a00000">I spoke about this at length yesterday 
                  with several designers and programmers. We're ok with how the 
                  change affects enchanter pets. If they were immune to those 
                  effects, they'd be able to put out more damage than the necro 
                  pet can currently. Enchanters have the ability to cast better 
                  speed buffs than either of the true pet-using classes. </font>
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>I do not know the code involved 
                  but maybe you could get rid of one or several of the stupid 
                  sight spells for enchanters and give us an illusion for our 
                  pets that would increase the delay that is stackable with augment 
                  or quickness series. This would be a great way to incorporate 
                  the theme behind this class to give us back what you nerfed. 
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">As I mentioned in another thread, we are 
                now happy with the way pets measure up to each other, and the 
                classes behind them. Discovering the dual wield bug (thanks guys) 
                really took weight off our shoulders as we suddenly understood 
                why the pets were unbalanced in practice even though their data 
                showed them to be balanced. It might take a little while, but 
                I expect that people will adapt.

                of Discord :) I was thinking Qeynos or Freeport would be the best 
                place, if we can pull him out into the open area.. or greater 
                faydark if we can maybe pull him near the LF or BB zone. <BR>
                <BR>
                I wanna try and get as many level 45+ types there as possible 
                (I'm level 47 right now). He hits for around 350, and casts all 
                kindsa crazy stuff, so I'm sure it'll be like taking down a god, 
                without going to a plane :) Not sure (and don't care really) what 
                loot will drop (Staff of Discord?), but hopefuly if there's something 
                nice we can all random for it fairly and stuff. Just looking for 
                some people sick of doing the same old thing, and people like 
                me that always wanted to see one of these priests die. Who knows, 
                if things go well maybe we can kill him a bunch of times, I'm 
                sure he's got a pretty quick respawn. <BR>
                <BR>
                So, who's with me? I don't wanna hear any "it's impossible don't 
                bother" whines.. cuz ya'll said the same thing about PoF, and 
                now look :) I'd also like to employ a cleric or 2 for rezes, I'll 
                glady pay for your services for the evening :)<BR>
                <BR>
                This is just a little informal event, something I've always wanted 
                to do, and now that my level is high enough I'd like to give it 
                a shot :) It'll happen this saturday (2/5) around 8 PM Eastern 
                on the Tarew Marr server. Further details (like which city we 
                decide on, etc) will be posted on the Tarew Marr Community Center

                Hello dark bruddr,<br>
                <br>
                Me want to take revenge vs the goody races. Me mad dos goodie 
                races come in and kill my guards in trollie swamp. Dis is what 
                I wanna do, Envade dwarf city and kill da king. I know, I cant 
                do it alone, Me probly will die, but at least I will feel gud 
                about what Ihave tried to do. I ask you evils come wif me and 
                lets make an example out of the dwarf town and kill da king. (He 
                doesn't have any gud loot I heard) I know if we all ban together 
                (little darkies too) we can smash dem gud. <br>
                <br>
                Me wanna know if der enough interest, I'm tinkin we can met at 
                da druid rings inside butcher block on Friday, February 4th at 
                10pm central, and start our killin spree dar. Kill da humies, 
                Kill da elves, save da gold for ourselves. If it aint evil, it 
                dies. Weshould be able to handle all the guards and townsfolk 
                outside of da city first, if we cant we shouldn't even attempt 
                to go in. If anything at least show da dworfs whats it like when 
                dem try to run to guards and see no guards. Har Har Har <br>
                <br>
                Me guessin from the nature of dis sucide mission only the foolish 
                and level 29+ need apply. No dis aint no guild event either, Dark 
                Blood should be thicker den Guild noteabilty. <br>
