                    Playing the enchanter is by far no easy task, but reaps the 
                    greatest benefits, and definitely earns the title of being 
                    the 'best' pure caster. <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>NOTE: I won't be including any tactics that may be used 
                    for enchanters that are 51+, simply because some enchanters 
                    don't have RoK :( </i><br>

                    ***Raising/creating your enchanter, and knowing what button 
                    does what.*** <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's begin by raising your enchanter. Enchanters work good 
                    as any race, unlike other pure casters that simply go well 
                    with higher INT. I myself played a Dark Elf, with no reason 
                    in particular, besides I like playing an evil guy, with an 
                    INT of 124 and a CHA of 85. Two things should be held in the 
                    highest regard when creating your enchanter: <br>
                    <br>
                    Commitment to a diety - The enchanter illusion system works 
                    not only off of race and gained/lost faction, but also your 
                    religion! If you want to be able to tread Norrath freely, 
                    then I highly suggest that your enchanter is Agnostic! <br>
                    <br>
                    CHA vs INT - The enchanter's abilities are based off of two 
                    important stats: Charisma and Inteligence. Like any other 
                    robed caster, intelligence mainly determines the enchanter's 
                    amount of mana. Charisma determines mainly the success of 
                    certain spells, and how well they work, which is why I highly 
                    suggest you have your CHA pumped up at all times. <br>

                    <b>Skill importance:</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Channeling and meditation are a given for any caster, but 
                    some casters don't use all of their magic skills. Enchanters 
                    on the other hand may make use of every magic skill. <br>
                    <br>
                    Abjuration (Important) - For any caster, Abjuration fuels 
                    the self shielding line. For enchanters, it also fuels their 
                    AC buffs, Rune series, and Tashan line. I highly suggest you 
                    work on this line, mainly for Tashan and self buffs. Tashan 
                    will be used every battle by a good enchanter. Just keep using 
                    Tashan or higher at least once a battle and this will raise 
                    in due time. <br>
                    <br>
                    Alteration (Important) - Enchanters will most likely use this 
                    skill more than any other magic skill. Most buffs, weakening 
                    spells, Root spells, and other effect spells will run off 
                    of this spell skill. I also suggest that you SPECIALIZE in 
                    this skill when you hit level 20, because you will most likely 
                    use the most mana in Alteration spells. Raise this skill by 
                    casting the low level strength buff <br>
                    <br>
                    Evocation (Fairly useful) - Only 5 spells run from this spell 
                    skill, your direct damage line. Even though these spells should 
                    collect dust most of the time, I suggest you raise this skill. 
                    You never know when a need of self defense will be needed, 
                    or an extra spell hit may mean the difference between victory 
                    and defeat. The only way to raise this is nuke. Be it you 
                    or someone else. <br>
                    <br>
                    Conjuration (Important)- Although this skill only works for 
                    two lines of spells, it's very important. Conjuration will 
                    determine your ability to summon an animation pet, and will 
                    work for your Mesmerise spell line. Both of these spells will 
                    most likely be used by your enchanter at many times. Raise 
                    this skill by Mesmeriseing yourself. <br>
                    <br>
                    Divination (Important) - Invisibilities, illusions, and the 
                    Color series depend on this skill. Most likely, you'll use 
                    invisibility tons in dungeon situations, illusions while exploring 
                    towns, and the Color line during battle. It would be in your 
                    best interest to raise this and keep it maxed. Use Invisibility 
                    or a low level illusion to raise this skill. <br>

                    <b>Important combat spells:</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Mesmerise, Enthrall, Mesmerization, Entrance etc... - These 
                    spells keep your enemy stunned for an extended period of time, 
                    unless they are damaged in some way. This is mostly used to 
                    keep other enemies out of a fight, while your party works 
                    on another creature. Just Mesmerise any creature that currently 
                    isn't being attacked by your party, but happens to be hitting 
                    a group member. These spells can also wipe the enemy's hate 
                    list if you do not do anything to provoke it once it is mesmerised. 
                    There are also Area Effect editions of this spell. Your first 
                    one is researched at level 16. <br>
                    <br>
                    Charm, Beguile, etc.. - Will most likely not be used in excess, 
                    but will come in handy. This spell gives you temporary control 
                    of any being, making it your 'pet'. Any command can be used 
                    with it except the Suicide command. Careful when making pets 
                    sit down, since they will tend to walk away (it's a bug). 
                    Careful when charming a creature. Only do it when your CHA 
                    is high and the target has been Tashaned. Once the creature 
                    is out of the charm, it will attack you. It is not possible 
                    to Charm something that is out of your spell range cap, however 
                    you can still Charm beings that may be red to you (I charmed 
                    by first griffin at 31). A good charm with the lowest charm 
                    spell may last up to about 5 minutes, and the duration increases 
                    with a better charm spell. <br>
                    <br>
                    Color Flux, Shift, Dizzying line etc. - This Area Effect spell 
                    will stun any enemies that are very close to you. This spell 
                    casts extremely fast and is good to use when you need to get 
                    a spell off quickly while your enemies are stunned. The first 
                    spell in the series will last approximatey 3 seconds. The 
                    second one will last about 6 seconds. Good to use along with 
                    the Whirl series (Stun target). <br>
                    <br>
                    Root, Enstill - Use this to simply keep your opponent in place 
                    for a good duration of time. <br>
                    <br>
                    Memory Blur - Great spell. Similar to the Cleric's 'Atone' 
                    spell. Use this on any target to wipe it's hate list. However, 
                    if it is KOS to you, you may want to use something else to 
                    get away from the target. (Will work on any level target) 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Haste spells - Quickness, Alacrity etc... These spells make 
                    you attack a bit faster than before. Extremely useful when 
                    used on a pet or a good tank. This spell lasts shorter than 
                    mosts buffs, but will hold out for a battle or two. A more 
                    long-term Haste buff is Augmentation, which also increases 
                    AGI. <br>
                    <br>
                    Clarity - Increases mana regeneration. Never leave home without 
                    it. There is also a new level 16 spell called 'Breeze', that 
                    is a little less effective than the level 29 Clarity. This 
                    spell is purchased in Kunark only, but should be usable by 
                    anyone that doesn't have the expansion (should someone bring 
                    it to you) <br>
                    <br>
                    Tashan - Use this spell every battle, no questions asked. 
                    This reduces the target's magic resistance. May be used on 
                    any level target. Extremely important because all enchanter 
                    spells are magic based, and mobs have high magic resist. <br>
                    <br>
                    Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp, etc... - Any Direct damage 
                    spell is important in some way. Your first DD spell will be 
                    at level 8, doing up to about 50 damage, which is comparable 
                    to the wizard's DD at that level. However, the damage ratio 
                    becomes a bit poorer, resulting in a 528 damage spell (maxed) 
                    at level 44. The biggest drawbacks are the slow recovery time/casting 
                    time, and they're an extreme taunt. Another important note 
                    is that these spells have no partial resist... either you 
                    do full damage, or no damage. <br>
                    <br>
                    Rune - Makes the target invulnerable till a certain amount 
                    of damage is incurred. A great life saver. <br>

                    <b>***How to play the enchanter***</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike some classes, there is definitely a wrong way to play 
                    your enchanter. Enchaters are meant to be a support class, 
                    which means that they shouldn't be doing damage, or taking 
                    any. What enchanters do is to help others do their job. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Group combat </b><br>
                    <br>
                    Enchanters greatly evolve through the levels. At low levels, 
                    you'll find yourself doing more conventional combat, such 
                    as damage spells, and even cracking at the enemy with your 
                    weapon. That scenario changes by the time you're level 20. 
                    You'll find yourself leaving the DD spells off your spell 
                    list, and will be using those Head icons a whole lot more 
                    :) <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What to do in group situations:</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Before any battle, buff where you see fit. Don't go overboard, 
                    because you'll need to conserve mana. Mainly, you'll buff 
                    tanks with AC buffs, STR buffs, and Haste buffs. However, 
                    you may have someone in your group who can provide better 
                    AC and STR. In that case, don't bother with either of those 
                    buffs. You'll also be using the Clarity line often. Also, 
                    if you are lacking in group tanks, you may want to make an 
                    animation. Once your buffs are placed, memorise the spells 
                    that will be used in combat. It's important to make use of 
                    every spell slot, because most of the time, you'll need to 
                    use a spell that isn't memorized, so choose wisely. <br>
                    <br>
                    There's three things to do as an enchanter. First, be active 
                    in the group. This will include Tashaning, Color Fluxing/Spinning 
                    (more on this tactic later), mesmerising excess MoB's, Rooting, 
                    and if you have a pet, let yourself take a hit so he'll join 
                    in on the combat. If you don't have a pet, Charm an excess 
                    MoB if your party needs help in tanking (Note: Try to keep 
                    Charm and Memory Blur memorized at the same time). Second 
                    is don't nuke, this tactic is just damned foolish if no nuking 
                    really needs to be done. It only angers the MoB to attack 
                    you, and wastes mana, and will most likely get you tossed 
                    out of the group. Once your mana wears down (let's say below 
                    2 bubbles), take a seat and wait for something bad to happen. 
                    One of the enchanter's trademarks is the ability to save a 
                    group's collective butt in emergencies. Your basic practice 
                    of saving your group is to Mesmerise the MoBs, or Rune party 
                    members. This is why it's important to make sure you don't 
                    go OOM. During downtime, ask your group every so often if 
                    your buffs are still in place. <br>

                    <b>Soloing as an enchanter:</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Contrary to popular belief, the enchanter can solo. Although 
                    it may be more wise to find a group, you can solo somewhere 
                    if you can't find somewhere to group. <br>
                    <br>
                    Also, in any case, use the following buffs on yourself: Self 
                    shielding, an AC buff, Clarity, CHA buff, INT buff, and Troll, 
                    Fire Elemental Illusion if your current position isn't in 
                    faction danger. I always keep Gate memmed incase things get 
                    hairy and I have a safe bind point. I also keep a Mesmerise 
                    spell memmed incase I bite off more than I can chew (more 
                    than 1 mob) <br>
                    <br>
                    First thing is to make a pet. I highly suggest against using 
                    Charm to solo. Although Charming may get more monsters killed, 
                    it's quite risky, and you never know when that faithful Mesmerise 
                    spell may fizzle :D <br>
                    <br>
                    Now that your pet has been made, give him some raw buffs, 
                    such as STR, AC, and Haste. Also give him a weapon or two. 
                    From here, there are a few main tactics you can try out (but 
                    there are many more). First is nuke, nuke, nuke. Second is 
                    to nuke and stun. Third is to let the pet do all the work. 
                    Here is how they work. <br>
                    <br>
                    1. Nuke, nuke, nuke - (Note: I don't recommend this tactic, 
                    since it's relatively a bad habit for enchanters to get into, 
                    and it's not very reliable. HOWEVER, it kills the opponent 
                    fast). Make sure you have the following spells memorized: 
                    Your best DD spell, your 2nd best DD spell, a Root spell, 
                    a Mesmerise spell, a Tashan spell, a Color, and a Gate spell. 
                    The other slot is up to you. Make sure your pet has been buffed. 
                    Now Tashan the opponent. If possible, Root the opponent while 
                    it's running toward you. Once the opponent is immobilized, 
                    let loose with your strongest nuke. Now, while your nuke is 
                    recovering, use your 2nd best nuke. Now use your strongest 
                    nuke, etc. Chances. are that the opponent will break Root 
                    and hit you. This is when your pet will go in and attempt 
                    to tank. To get the opponent Rooted again, Stun him using 
                    a Color spell, and then Root while he is stunned. Now your 
                    pet will be on the opponent, and before too long, he will 
                    probably die if you don't help him. So, keep on nuking as 
                    before. If the Root breaks, stun and root again until the 
                    opponent is dead. After battle, you'll likely find yourself 
                    and your pet low on HP. This is mostly like a mage tactic. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Nuke and stun - (I use this one more myself). Make sure 
                    you have the following spells ready. Your best DD, a Color 
                    spell, a Spinning spell, a Mesmerise spell, a Gate spell, 
                    a Root spell and a Tashan spell. The other slot is up to you. 
                    Make extra sure your pet has buffs. First, let loose with 
                    your best Tashan spell. When the enemy hits you, your pet 
                    will rush in and start attacking. The trick here is to let 
                    your pet have some fun in the battle. However, enchanter pets 
                    have poor AC and HP, so you'll need to aleviate some of the 
                    damage being done. To do this, stun the opponent with a Color 
                    spell. Now while the Color is recharging and the effect has 
                    worn off, use a Spin spell. Once that effect has worn off, 
                    use Color again, and so on. Don't hesitate to Root if the 
                    MoB is VERY aggroed on you. By doing this, the enemy will 
                    not be hititng your pet so much, while your pet is whacking 
                    at the enemy. Now here's the other part - make sure you do 
                    more damage than your pet does, so you'll have to throw a 
                    periodic nuke at the enemy when you see fit. Some would call 
                    this tactic silly because it involves nuking, but the truth 
                    is that nuking is necessary sometimes in solo combat. This 
                    tactic also uses up little mana for the time it takes to kill 
                    the enemy, and is relatively easy on your pets and your HP. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Let your pet do all the work - (Recommended) Make sure 
                    these spells are on your list. Your highest Direct Damage 
                    spell, a Color spell, a Spinning spell, a Mesmerise spell, 
                    a Gate spell, a Root spell, a Tashan spell, and Memory Blur. 
                    Make sure you and your pet are fully buffed. Now the trick 
                    here is to let your pet do almost all of the work. This is 
                    similar to the Nuke and Stun tactic, except you won't nuke 
                    till the end of the battle. First Tashan the opponent, and 
                    make sure he gets a hit on you. Now Root, stun with color, 
                    and then stun with Spinning during recovery time and when 
                    Color has worn off. Keep switching back and forth while keeping 
                    the enemy Rooted. (During combat, I've seen people use a Weaken 
                    line spell for this tactic. However, I feel these spells are 
                    useless. I've also seen Rune used on the pet before and during 
                    fights, which can work if you bring lots of reagents). Now 
                    once the mob gets low on HP, Memory Blur it. This will make 
                    the mob forget any damage incurred by the pet. Now that you've 
                    done that, nuke the mob till it dies (try to do the job in 
                    one hit). This will give you all of the experience. The only 
                    problem with this tactic is that it's VERY slow, and I've 
                    had a couple of occasions where my DD was resisted and my 
                    pet ended up outdamaging me after blurring the creature. However, 
                    it's completely safe and makes you look like a good enchanter 
                    :) <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many other tactics you can use. That is the point 
                    of the enchanter - an endless amount of possibilities come 
                    from playing these guys :) <br>

                    <b>***Important Notes***</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of these may have all ready been mentioned, but let me 
                    index them. <br>
                    <br>
                    Direct Damage spells - Highly resistable, long recovery time, 
                    all or no damage, act as a mega-taunt. <br>
                    <br>
                    Pets - Relatively weak at tanking. Try to think of them as 
                    a DOT. All pet spells level 8 and above are puchased in High 
                    Keep. <br>
                    <br>
                    Illusions - Twist around faction, however, religion and previous 
                    faction work still play a role. ILLUSIONS WEAR OFF IF YOU 
                    ZONE! Illusions also give the enchanter the advantages/disadvantages 
                    of the race. Here is a list <br>
                    <br>
                    Humans, Erudites - Blind at night <br>
                    Dwarves, Gnomes, Halflings - Make you smaller for better dungeon 
                    navigation, and grant invravision (As a Dwarf, you can sumersault 
                    if you jump forward) <br>
                    Half Elves, Wood Elves, High Elves - Infravision <br>
                    Dark Elves - Ultravision <br>
                    Minor Illusion, Tree - Makes you 'no race'. Faction is based 
                    on religion and previous faction work. Blind at night. <br>
                    Barbarian - Blind at night, may Slam <br>
                    Ogre - Infravision, may Slam <br>
                    Troll - Infravision, HP regeneration, may Slam <br>
                    Spirit Wolf - Adds Haste, grants 'no race' faction <br>
                    Skeleton - Hides nametag, KOS to guards. Good dungeon faction 
                    (does not help normal undead faction *shrugs*) <br>
                    Drybone - Skeleton form with 25 SV Fire <br>
                    Earth Elemental - KOS to guards, good dungeon faction, 5 to 
                    STR <br>
                    Air Elemental - Levitation, KOS to guards, good dungeon faction 
                    <br>
                    Water Elemental - Waterbreathing, KOS to gaurds, good dungeon 
                    faction <br>
                    Fire Elemental - Damage shield (starts at 6), KOS to gaurds, 
                    good dungeon faction <br>
                    Werewolf - Adds 80 ATK, good dungeon faction, KOS to guards. 
                    <br>
                    Also note that some of the higher end illusion (and Halfling 
                    illusion) are located in Erudin's enchanter guild. <br>
                    <br>
                    Memory Blur - Will not only remove hate list, but also forgets 
                    any damage incurred by a person.. Good tactic for KSing or 
                    powerleveling (I don't condone either). <br>
                    <br>
                    Stat debuffs (ie weaken) - Relatively useless unless you are 
                    battling another player. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Mesmerise line cannot be used on large creatures. <br>
                    <br>
                    In closing... <br>
                    <br>
                    The enchanter may be looked upon as weak, as they are in certain 
                    areas. Their damage output is very low, and their pets are 
                    weak. But proper manipulation of their spells will cause the 
                    enchanter to outperform any other class, it's just a matter 
                    of using the correct spell :) <br>
                    <br>
                    Now go wear that guild robe with pride ;) <br>
