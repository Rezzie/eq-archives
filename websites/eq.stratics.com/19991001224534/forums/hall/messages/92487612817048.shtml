Snore...... If, you have ever waited for the boat to Freeport for like 30 min, get on, and wait another 20 min for the boat to get to Freeport, then you understand why every passenger is secretly wishing to be rescued by Dr. Kovorkian.<p>Well, it was a typical ride last night, everyone standing around with their thumb up their ass saying doh-de-doh waiting for the lightning fast journey to end. Being a mage I can not even practice casting or can anyone sell items while on board. I happen to have a chipped bone rod that I carry in my left hand. This always brings questions, so I began to make up a story as usual describing how I bought the 7,000 pp item by haggling with the merchant. Well the discussion peeked the interests of about 5 of other passengers standing about. So, all of a sudden, in the middle of the conversation we all get dumped in the Ocean of Tears. This was very disconcerting to watch 4 other characters swimming around me. At first, I thought maybe some dwarf had come barreling into us, as they are prone to do, but as I watched the boat slip away in the fog and no dwarves to be found, I sensed I may be in trouble. Well somehow everyone managed to get there bearings and swim to a nearby island. I had no idea what Island this was I was swimming to. I had long since lost interest in tracking my voyage on the ship from hell. After reaching shore I quickly took a headcount and cast invisibilty on anyone nearby. The poor rangers were crying about losing everything and dying. I looked around and saw about 3 or 4 Cyclops. This made my awareness level jump to an entirely new level. One individual, who wasn't cursing some merchant named Verant, got his senses and manuvered the coast to discover a nearby island. I managed to calm the poor rangers that were a wreck by now, and coaxed them to swim to the other Isle. After another swim, we were able to find the dock on the sisters Island. Everybody was calm at this point and started exploring the merchants on this Island. Just then a GM appeared named Chette something who was a very lovely Woodelf in Green armor of some manufacture I was unaware of. She promptly transported us all to Freeport. We thanked her extensively. I even went so far as to offer her my Chipped bone rod. She declined and commented my chipped bone rod has a 7000pp price tag on it. Well, I declined  any explanation on the rod, thinking a bolt lighting would hit me next, and we parted ways. I ended up grouping with the fellas from the little adventure and we had a good time.<p>Some may call this a bug and hate EQ for this beta type behavior, but it made my day.
