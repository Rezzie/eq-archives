Well, it seems that many people have read <a href="group_com.shtml">Intermediate Group Combat</a>.  If you haven't,
you need to, as it the only 'prerequisite' for this document.  In that
document PPI covered the absolute basics of group combat, including
analyzing the function of each class in a party and basic skills for each
class to pay attention to.
<p>
In this document, we're going to extend and move into more advanced
territory, primarily to do with complex interactions between parties and
enemy monsters. 
<p>
Some examples of things that can go seriously wrong while in a party:
<ol>
<li>  The party has two people scouting for enemies and suddenly, they
_both_ yell "Incoming!!" and charge back with big yellow monsters on their
tail.

<li>  As a caster, you are meditating, and suddenly you see your parties
health bars dropping... ALL of them.

<li>  The party sees a group of monsters, and someone mentions an attack...
and immediately, half of the party runs directly into the midst of the
enemies and begins slashing indiscriminately.

<li>  You are in charge bringing a monster back to an ambush, when... low
and behold... the entire party has decided to head back to town for
supplies, leaving you with a new friend and no party favors.

<li> You come back with the next kill hot on your tail only to find the rest
of your group has engaged some wandering creature nearby without telling
you, leaving you to hope they finish the other in time to save you from
whatever you brought back.
</ol>
These are all serious group no-no's (just a few of many).  Most often they
occur because there is a lack of a basic party of any good group.
Communication.  Without good communication skills, your party is
effectively acting as a bunch of solo characters who just happen to be
fighting the same enemy (and that's if you're lucky).
<p>
Most good groups have a designated leader, who acts as a ringleader in a
circus, directing the actions of those around him, while avoiding the
lions and elephants and gnolls... Gnolls!?   
<p>
However, sometimes groups will function perfectly well without a leader. 
This usually occurs when a group is comfortable with each other and knows
their roles and what needs to be done.  These groups will not usually have
a leader per se but instead someone (usually a support character) who
watches the battle from the outside and keeps everyone informed of what's
going on.  It is then this person's duties to back the group off so that
they do not attract the attentions of wandering creatures that would
endanger the group if they attacked.  If you are in one of these groups,
you're probably very familiar with a good majority of the rest of this
document, but keep going, you just might learn something. 
<p>
We're going to cover basic communication skills, leader responsibilities,
and then a related bonus section on multiple enemy combat that uses most
of these ideas.

	<tr>
		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><P><B><font color=050056>Communication</font></B>
<div>
Without communication, the party is doomed.  Those things mentioned in the
Introduction _will_ happen, and they will not be fun.  Even in parties
with good communications, sometimes bad things happen.  Mostly because
someone either wasn't paying attention, or because someone forgot to
mention some action they were taking that could affect the other members of
the party.  For example, they were going out 'fetching', luring a monster
back to the group for an ambush.  Groups without a leader can be much less fun
to play in because without someone to give direction you are more often than
not left standing around waiting for someone to figure out what should be
done next.  (Note: this is different from 'natural' groups who don't require
a designated leader)
<p>
While most online games have a barrier to communication, the keyboard,
there are ways to work around this.  Firstly, if you're working with a
group of friends or some people you often group with, develop a shorthand
that is easy to keep up with.  Most of my groups have about five messages
that are vitally important and also quick and easily abbreviated:
<p>
"OOM" (Out of Mana): For a caster, this is a _huge_ important message.  Always give warning
for both low mana (LOM) and for complete empty tank.  If the party doesn't
know their healer has no more heals, or that their wizard has no more mana
for root or burn... well... someone is going to die.  Good healers and burn
support characters will be able to read their mana bar and call exactly how
many shots they have left.  It is more important for the healers.  For the
burn support characters LOM should suffice.
<p>
"INC" (Incoming): If a group is using the tentacle camping method (sitting in one place and
reaching out and bringing monsters in), this is a key message, as it means
that the designated fetch has found something and is coming in with it.  A
huge warning to prepare for combat (ie: stand up and stop meditating or
healing).
<p>
"[Name] Back out": Get out of melee with the mob.  There are others that can take the damage.
Sometimes people just don't realize they've just been mangled (lag or just
plain blindness, I never miss 'YOU have been mangled for 50!' messages but
that's just me).  If the leader keeps an eye on health and directs combat
movement, it greatly simplifies the jobs of other party members (though it
adds to the leader's responsibilities).   
<p>
This command is the most often ignored.  Many times it is because the
person loses the message in the scrolling text and other times they just
wand to get a couple more hits in.  It is the party's job to be watching
for the leader's commands and a lso the calls from other party members. 
Make sure you pay attention.  If you think that you should get just one or
two more hits in before stepping out DON'T.  Your leader (if competent)
has good reason to call you out.  Step back immediately.  If it is because
you were getting low on health step back and sit down for 3 combat rounds
at least.  This gives the party's healers ample time to attend to you, and
also makes the monster less likely to attack you when you rejoin combat.
<p>
"MR?" (Mana Report): Just something that all casters should get in the habit of announcing.  It
allows the leader to effectively judge the relative 'power' the party has
left, both in terms of healing and in terms of direct burn.  A good leader
always knows what the mana levels of party members is, and if he/she
doesn't, ASK.
<p>
"Rest": Pretty straightforward.  The party is mangled and needs to camp out. 
Should only be mentioned when the party is not in any direct danger nor is
sitting on somewhere that could become dangerous (ie: spawn point). 
Again, it is the leader's responsibility to find a safe place to call
this.

<div>
Well... either you are one, you've been one, or you will be one. 
Regardless of how good or bad you are at playing EQ, it is likely that you
will eventually be called upon to lead a party.  If you are decent at it,
you'll garner some respect and likely get to be leader more often.  If you
get the group smoked... well, let's just say that finding a group might be
more of a problem than leading one. 
<p>
Experience makes a leader.  The leader would have never gotten to that
point if he had not made a few mistakes and learned from them along the
way, though.  Make sure if you do make a mistake to admit that you were
wrong and try to make up for anything that may have happened as a result. 
<p>
The leader has many responsibilities, and actually doesn't have to be a
front line combat type.  I (Drew) play a Magician most often and have been
designated leader quite often.  I usually am no where near melee range
(though I do mix it up as needed to save people who are hosed), and that
helps me keep my mind clear while directing things.  Just a personal
preference, other leaders may have different experiences. 
<p>
The following items should be considered the leaders responsibilities:
<p>
Finding the Enemies:
<p>
Whether the party is a roving band, or is doing the tentacular thing,
finding the enemies is the leaders prime responsibility.  For roving
bands, it's amazing how often the leader turns out to be the tallest
member.  Merely because it's easier to follow a tall leader who doesn't
disappear into the weeds (*snicker* halflings *snicker*). 
<p>
Planning and Organization:
<p>
One of the leader's jobs is to keep everyone organized and aware of the
situation and their role in it.  This is important both in and out of
combat.  Keep the party together and make sure everyone knows the score.
<p>
A strong leader should be aware of your party member's abilities and
limits.  This includes a strong working knowledge of all of the spells and
abilities of those members of your party.  A good leader will direct the
Bard to play the correct song for the situation, and have the Shaman cast
specific spells to turn the odds, etc. If you are not very familiar with
all of your member's skills, ask them and begin learning a little about
classes aside from your own. 
<p>
The leader should be adept at directing actual attacks during combat, as
well as indicating the order of combat for multiple enemies (see Multiple
Enemy Engagement section below for ideas).  This is especially important
when dealing with dangerous monsters with special attacks, or those that
have friends nearby.  It also is important in planning escape routes
should your party end up with more on their plate than they can handle.
<p>
Loot order:
<p>
Though this may seem trivial, it is vital that the leader keep a close eye
on loot distribution.  If a member is getting shorted, it's likely that
he/she will depart for other places soon.  Never good to lose a party
member to those sorts of things.  Autosplit (when working) takes the edge
off of this problem but players still enjoy that birthday surprise type
feeling of looting a mob.  Even if you are not following an order just
make sure everyone loots on now and then. 
<p>
A good leader will also keep their group hunting monsters that are both
interesting and profitable.  If you lead your group around killing things
that you could have taken alone, people will bore quickly and leave the
group to go fight by themselves.  Group fighting is _the_ most efficient
way to improve your character as well as being the most fun.  A good
leader will make sure this is extremely apparent.  A bad leader can sour
players' perception of grouping. 
<p>
Combat Coordination:
<p>
This is where a good leader can make the difference between killing the
enemies and getting the entire party killed.  This is more of an art than
a science and incorporates many skills.  The main skill a good leader has
is the ability to multi-task.  This is because he/she must engage an
enemy, while constantly surveying the situation for changes, and while
directing other members of the party in actions.  Often when I am leading
a party I end up breaking my own rules of breaking off combat at 2 bubbles
of health because my attention is rarely on my own hit points.  Leading is
very rewarding but also can be very risky.  Your first priority is to keep
you group together and alive and your second is to your own health.  This
does not mean you should be reckless, but good leaders will always take
calculated risks for the party. 
<p>
A very important skill for any leader is to know when to fight and when to
flee.  As the leader in combat this is your most important duty.  If you
are with a good party they will not run until the leader calls for the
run.  This means they are placing their lives on your assessment of the
situation.  Do not expect to achieve this until you have proven yourself a
strong leader.  When the situation is getting ugly you are better to call
the run earlier than later.  Waiting can be fatal, and if you are going to
escape a bad situation, you should attempt to reduce the 'downtime' the
party will have recovering.  Heck, if you called it too early, you can
always make another attempt. 
<p>
While in larger combat, it is often good for a party leader to be familiar
with and use the many 3rd person views to scan the area around the combat
for possible dangers and to get a more 'removed', strategic view of
combat.  Some people prefer the overhead view, but I'm very much for the
long distance shots of the combat, as they give ample viewing of the area
around combat while still allowing a good view of combat. 
<p>
Respect:
<p>
As a leader you must earn your group's respect.  This is done by showing
that you know what is going on are able to command the group to peak its
efficiency.  Respect will be gained in time through successful weathering
of bad situations.  It is in these situations that the leader is really
put through their paces and when the group will become forever loyal or
mistrusting and being ignoring commands.  Don't ask people to do things
that you would not do yourself.  The battle described later in this
document gained the leader some respect but if it had gone the other way
he could have easily lost some of the loyalty of his group.

<div>
Unless you are the leader of the party, it is your job to follow orders to
the best of your abilities.  Though that may sound like no fun, it truly
can be cathartic to be 'The Tank' and know that you can and should throw
yourself at the enemy.  Or 'The Healer', who just watches health and makes
sure no one goes negative.  When a party member, your life is simplified
greatly because you really have one or maybe two tasks to concentrate on. 
As long as everyone plays their part, the party will do very well.  It is
amazingly fun to be part of something larger; especially is that something
larger is ripping through the beasts of the area like a scythe through
wheat. 
<p>
Following a part:
<p>
As long as your leader is competent, just relax and play the role you've
been designated.  Try not to do anything that would directly endanger the
party, and use your skills to the best of your abilities.  See the
Grouping 101 guide for ideas and suggestions for each class. 
<p>
As a member, it is your duty to provide information to your party leader
regarding your status.  Casters, periodically report mana; warriors,
mention that you are out of food and water, or that you need to rest. 
These things make the leaders job a little easier and are appreciated. 
<p>
Also, do not hesitate to inform the group about changing situations,
including additional monsters, changes in health, or mana.  It's never
good to have additional monsters enter a fight, but it's worse if no one
realizes they are there.

Story time: Ok... your fetch has just announce that he/she has not one, not two, not
three, but FOUR big yellow aggressive things (for example, Minotaurs). 
This is a bad situation, as your group has only taken one and occasionally
two of the beasts.  You can either panic and bug out, or you can try and
fight the horrible odds.  Let's follow an example party and see how they
do against the monsters.  This is told from Vogyd's perspective. 
<p>
Leader:
<blockquote>
	Teffo, L11 Halfling Cleric (Jim)
</blockquote>
Party members:
<blockquote>
	Zanith, L10 Human Paladin
	King, L10 Half Elf Bard
	Vogyd, L12 High Elf Magician (Drew)
	Adaemus, L11 Dwarf Warrior
</blockquote>
We had all rested up after a combat with 2 of the beasts, when we hear,
"Oh... that's bad." from Zanith, our fetch.  He had been scouting looking
for a minotaur or two in the middle of the area where they spawn... when
all of them spawned.  He high-tailed it out of there with four minotaurs
on him, and informed us as to our fate.  "4 incoming."  We briefly
discussed our options, and then decided to try to smoke them. 
<p>
The Bard switched to a combat anthem, and we waited for the enemy to
arrive.  As soon as Zanith arrived, I dropped a Fire Shield on both him
and Adaemus.  With four enemies, that mana cost would easily be made up
for in damage done to our tanks.  Teffo began to heal Zanith, and then we
began to melee the beasts. 
<p>
After a few seconds, we realized this was going to be close fight as both
of our tanks were below 50% health, and I began searching for a monster
with lowest hps. This would be the monster that was being attacked by our
warriors.  Most of the monsters were slightly damaged (from the Fire
Shields) and eventually I found one at half life.  I then burned it down
the rest of the way.  Teffo began to heal Zanith and Adaemus while
fighting one of the monsters he had engaged long enough to draw its attack
onto himself and away from the damaged warriors.  King had also drawn one
onto himself and resumed his attack on the next one targeted by the party. 
<p>
Quickly, the odds shift into our favor, as we have now a 5 vs. 3
advantage.  Again, the warriors concentrate on one enemy, and I begin to
fry the monster as it attempts to flee having dropped to about 20% of it's
health total.  While I am burning, the tanks are very low on hps, so Teffo
backed out of melee to heal while the tanks switch to yet another enemy. 
After dispatching my runner, I step into combat to make sure that others
have cover, as Zanith was near 20% (he backs out), and I take some hits
from one of the mostly undamaged minotaurs (which quickly reduces my hps
to half). Zanith is mostly restored by Teffo's spells and returns to
combat.  I back out, and dispatch another minotaur who had decided to try
and leave the area (low on health) with a few spells. 
<p>
I am now extremely low on mana, so I save the rest in case of an emergency
and step into melee range of the remaining beast.  Adaemus and Zanith
quickly maim the enemy and we cut it down from behind as it attempts to
flee. 
<p>
Analysis:
<p>
This little story demonstrates many key events in good party dynamics. 
Primarily, it shows that with good teamwork, a party can take out groups
of dangerous (yellow!) monsters very effectively as long as certain rules
are followed. 
<ol>
<li> Concentrating attacks on one enemy removes it from combat, lessening
the damage done to the party as a whole.

<li> When engaging multiple enemies, make sure that they all are
concentrated on players who can take the damage.  Tanks.  If a spellcaster
becomes a target, the party is in big trouble as without the fire support
bad things happen.  Thus, in large combats, the spellcasters should stay
out of combat as much as possible until things are less chaotic (ie: fewer
enemies) and should NOT burn randomly.  That is the surest way to draw an
undamaged beast onto you.  Bad mage. 

<li> Spellcasters should endeavor to finish weaker monsters off quickly. 
This allows the warriors to get on to more important business.  Also is
much safer for the spellcaster (as mentioned in #2), as the monster is
already really angry at the tanks who did most of the damage. 

<li> Good communication.  Zanith told the party what was going on well
before bringing the enemies into range, allowing the party to have a good
look at the situation before committing.  Everyone responded to 'Back off'
commands, and they also concentrated their attacks well on successive
monsters.  They all knew that I was finishing off the 'runners' so they
could concentrate on the monsters in their face and not on the ones that
would be coming back with friends after healing a bit. 
</ol>
Overall, this fight was one of the best I have been in ever.  Everyone did
their part and there was very little confusion.  Everyone knew what was
happening and trusted the other members to do their part.  I hope everyone
gets a chance to experience this sort of coordinated action at some point
in their EQ career.  It's nearly indescribably cool.

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>
	<tr>
		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><B><font color=050056>Pre-Fight Planning</font></B>
<div>
Any time the group is considering attacking a group of monsters, or is
being attacked by a group, it is imperative that the group concentrate
their attacks (as we saw above in the story).  When the aggressor in a
combat, the party has the advantage of pre-planning which of the monsters
is the 'primary' target.  There are a few logical ways to analyze the
targeting order in a combat.
<p>
1)  Enemy spellcasters.  These HAVE to die, or the party is hosed. 
Primarily, this is offensive casting enemies like wizards and
necromancers.  These are a parties worst nightmare in groups because
sometimes you can't get to them and prevent them from casting spells. 
This also applies to those monsters with special attacks (stuns or drains
and the like).  They are also mush easier to take out because of their low
hit points (hopefully!). 
<p>
Tactics:  Have _your_ offensive caster take them out preemptively. 
Usually, starting a fight by having your caster burn on the enemy caster
is effective because then the enemy caster is occupied.  The only problem
is that all of the enemy casters friends are on their way to kill your
caster too.  That's where the tanks step in front and occupy them.  It's
not too difficult to distract a mob if you hit it in the head with a
sword.  Thus, the fight is now divided, casters on casters, and tanks on
tanks. 
<p>
Hopefully your tanks are taking out the enemies by concentrating their
attacks.  It is important at this stage to get a tank on the enemy
spellcaster.  Vital.  Even having a tank with another enemy on his back
while he attacks the caster is worth it.  This is for one reason. 
Interruptions.  If your tank can induce interrupts, and your caster is
unaffected, the fight is over.  The other caster is going to be eating
sword and spells; that's never a good combination.  An excellent tank for
enemy spellcasters is a Monk.  Lots of attacks means a higher chance of
interruption.  Also works with any higher level warriors types with dual
wield or double attack (or both!). 
<p>
2)  Weaklings.  There are always a few lower level monsters in a group of
enemies (at least you hope there are).  These should be prime targets. 
Why?  Because they have less health, and can be taken out quickly.  Never
underestimate the power of 2-3 green monsters will have on a fight with a
blue one.  The sheer quantity of hits can be deadly as well as the power
of those attacks. 
<p>
Tactics:  Either target them first, or have your spellcaster pick them off
with concentrated fire.
<p>
3)  Damaged mobs.  As mentioned previously and similarly to the
Weaklings... the sooner they're dead, the less damage they'll do. 
<p>
4)  Runners.  This is the most dangerous type of enemy for a party in a
dungeon.  If one mob slips away after being damaged in combat the leader
might as well call for a mass retreat while everyone can still make it
out.  In a dungeon,a damaged creature fleeing from combat will run deeper
into the dungeon calling every monster it finds to attack the party that
nearly killed it.  If it does not call red creatures that would kill your
party outright, it will call enough weaker creatures to overrun your party
in a brutal fashion. This is called a train.  You don't want it. 
<p>
Tactics: These creatures should be dealt with by the mages or one of the
warriors if your party is lacking anyone who can cast burn.  _Never_ let
them go unless you want to see how ugly a dungeon can really get. 
<p>
5) Faction.  Attacking some creatures will lower your standing with other
races and mobs.  As Drew or the dwarven guards of Kaladim might tell you,
killing Crag Aviaks will lower your faction standing with many groups.  In
general, if you con the creature (hit 'C' while it is targeted) and it
says that it 'looks at you indifferently' you are best to leave it alone
or you are going to get in trouble with some faction.

Leaders can be the savior or damnation of a group.  Keep that in mind and
pick your group leader wisely.  Oh, and note, the person who forms the
group doesn't have to be the leader, but it helps, because then they can
control the group composition.  If someone is being dumb, they should get
punted, and having control over group composition can be just the sort of
'enforcement' needed.
