                    Magicians are conjurers. They make stuff up, as it were, from 
                    thin air. This stuff can be anything from light, to daggers, 
                    to beasts of elemental substance. This has advantages and 
                    disadvantages. First, all the stuff you make is free (if you 
                    don't count the time you spend meditating when you could be 
                    stomping monster butt for loot). Second, all the stuff vanishes 
                    when you leave Norrath in one fashion or another. So, you 
                    can't make huge profits selling your goods on the market (unless 
                    you're selling to trolls! *grin*). Magicians also have some 
                    of the skills of the Wizard, in powerful offensive spells.

                      Magicians (Mages), I feel, are the most complex class in 
                      EverQuest. They are a caster, so that immediately adds difficulties. 
                      Not subtle like the Enchanter or overt like the Wizard, 
                      they fall into the middle. They are one of the two 'pet' 
                      classes, the other being Necromancer. While most of the 
                      other casters have a way to get a pet, they do not usually 
                      rely on this ability for survival. Mages do not have the 
                      same sheer damage potential as the Necromancer, so they 
                      must rely more upon their pets for effective soloing. Furthermore, 
                      a good majority of a Mages spells do nothing but create 
                      items. Add all of these together, and most new players (and 
                      some older ones) are going to be at a loss as to how to 
                      use the Magician as a Magician, and not as a bad Wizard.

                    While many classes are easy to understand, the Magician has 
                    been the bed of some serious controversy throughout the Beta. 
                    Most of the controversy has been born out of some misunderstandings 
                    regarding the Magician (and pets in general) and their relative 
                    power level. I'm going to briefly address a few of these issues 
                    and attempt to resolve them. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      1) Magicians get less experience because of their Elementals: 
                      </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Magicians, with pet, do receive less experience than any 
                      other (non-pet) class for 'soloing' a given kill. That is 
                      a statement that cannot be refuted. However, we feel that 
                      this is balanced by one important fact. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      With a pet, Magicians should have a slightly easier time 
                      killing a given enemy. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Many people don't grasp the second order concept here. The 
                      Magician can kill the monster and subsequently require a 
                      shorter recovery time (for health and mana) than a Warrior. 
                      Having an expendable tank also makes combat a _lot_ safer. 
                      This allows the Mage to kill another enemy more quickly 
                      than the Warrior could (especially when fighting easier 
                      enemies [blue]). Thus, experience over time is balanced. 
                      A Mage should not level any faster than a Warrior of equivalent 
                      skill with their respective class. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      2) Magicians are not useful to a group at low to medium-low 
                      levels (5-11). </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      At low levels, we feel that Magicians (as most characters) 
                      can, and should be soloed for maximum potential. It is only 
                      after level 5 that grouping begins to become more important. 
                      Many people have commented that at these levels, the Magician 
                      does not seem to offer enough to a group to be worth taking 
                      along. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      The prime reason for this is the same for all offensive 
                      casters. High level (5+ levels above you) enemies are VERY 
                      likely to resist your spells. Thus, if a group insists on 
                      fighting higher level enemies, the casters cannot add very 
                      much in the form of direct damage. However, this does _not_ 
                      mean that low level casters are useless. Both Wizards and 
                      Magicians receive low (~L4-8) level damage shields. These 
                      are an amazing addition to a group and should not be overlooked. 
                      </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      Additionally, it should be noted that 'blue' groups are 
                      as effective at leveling as most 'red' groups. The color 
                      indicates the desired targets for the group. Many groups 
                      (at all levels) feel that the best utilization of a larger 
                      group is to hunt 'Big Game'. While this is very possible 
                      to do, more efficient groups realize that hunting large 
                      amounts of smaller game (blue, white, occasionally yellow) 
                      is faster and less dangerous. Admittedly, this may not be 
                      as interesting as hunting those guards that have annoyed 
                      you for so long, but at the same time, this game is about 
                      social interaction, and you get a lot more of that when 
                      you're not running for your life from a huge red nasty. 
                      Or even worse, retrieving your corpse from the pile. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      3) Elementals should be the same level as the caster. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      At present, elementals summon at a level approximately equal 
                      to that of the level of the Summon spell. Thus, the L8 Summon 
                      Elementaling spell summons an elemental that is approximately 
                      L8 (plus or minus a level or two). </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      This poses some problems for the Magician when soloing (see 
                      Solo Combat Section for more on this). Whenever the Magician 
                      is at a new level, the elemental is a powerhouse of damage 
                      output. However, as the Magician advances towards the next 
                      rank of spells, the elemental become progressively 'weaker' 
                      as more difficult enemies are required to continue to gain 
                      experience. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                      This apparent weakness has a counter. There is a corresponding 
                      increase in the reliability and power of the Magician's 
                      spells that offsets the weaker elemental. Additionally, 
                      the Magician can adjust his elemental choice to further 
                      compensate (see Elemental section for more details) for 
                      these differences in power. A good order is: Fire, Water, 
                      Earth, with Air whenever needed for safety. </font>

                      It has been the contention of many high level Mages on the 
                      test server that Elementals just don't help enough at high 
                      level. We feel that this opinion if primarily derived from 
                      these players noticing a 'decrease' in Magician power over 
                      the course of the Beta. Early in the Beta, a Magician and 
                      an elemental were as good as (or better than) a Wizard and 
                      a Warrior. This was unbalanced and was fixed appropriately.

                      Most often their gripes are: elementals fail to keep the 
                      enemy off of the caster, or they do not do enough damage 
                      to finish the enemy because of the massive punishment that 
                      enemies dole out at higher levels. When pressed further, 
                      most of these Magicians admit that they use their offensive 
                      magics quite a bit during combat. While necessary to do 
                      so, it is imperative that you know when and where to use 
                      the burn (we'll cover this in detail later). </font>

                      Elementals actually do quite a bit of damage, but they need 
                      time to do so, just like most other tanks. It's difficult 
                      to stand by and watch an enemy rip large holes in an elemental 
                      without doing anything, but that is what is required most 
                      of the time for a soloing Mage. </font>

                      Please be aware, that at high level (25-30+), you really 
                      should be in a group to be efficient. Enemies do tremendous 
                      amounts of damage at those levels and it can take a very 
                      long time to recover from an extended battle with an enemy. 
                      At this point, it can be very frustrating for Magicians 
                      because of the long downtime (as compared to earlier levels). 
                      Expect this. </font>

                    Magicians are different from most other casters. They have 
                    some offense, and a little defense, and then quite a few odd 
                    utility spells. They do not have the 'standard' suite of utility 
                    by any means. Here are some ideas to think about when considering 
                    playing a Magician, and while playing one. </font>

                      Magicians are efficiency experts. Both in damage/mana or 
                      utility/mana, Magicians are at least second best, if not 
                      the best. A Human Magician (lowest intelligence possible 
                      [85]) is just as dangerous as a Erudite Magician (highest 
                      possible intelligence [140]). Why? Because almost all of 
                      a Magician's casting should be done before combat. Sure, 
                      it's nice to have a bit of burn to finish things off, but 
                      if you're doing things right, you should rarely need that 
                      extra oomph, and if you do, you should only be using _one_ 
                      burn spell. Thus, intelligence isn't as important for Magicians 
                      as it is for other casters. (Admittedly, if the whole zone 
                      descends upon you you'd like to have enough mana to burn 
                      them all down, but you're going to run out of health a _lot_ 
                      faster than you will mana.) </font>

                      Magicians store mana on a semi-permanent basis in all of 
                      their summonings. The ability to store mana in things like 
                      throwing daggers, spears, swords, knives, food, and (most 
                      importantly) pets is what gives a Magician their power.

                      Mana storage allows the Magician to have 2-3 times the effectiveness 
                      of any other type of caster when fully prepared, because 
                      the Magician can move mana from the mana bar, into the world, 
                      allowing _more_ mana to be stored and channeled (effectively). 
                      A Magician with an elemental, a pile of summoned weapons, 
                      and a full mana bar is incredibly dangerous. The prepared 
                      Magician has approximately double the mana of any other 
                      caster at the same level, simply by the fact that there 
                      a large amount of mana invested in the Elemental, and about 
                      another bar in weapons (daggers, etc). Thus, the Magician 
                      attacks with his Elemental and, if need be, throws a full 
                      two bars (one of daggers, one of spells) of additional direct 
                      damage at the mob in question. </font>

                      However, because the damage dealt by Magicians usually occurs 
                      in smaller quantities (compared to their cousins, the Wizards), 
                      the process of killing a monster takes time. Nicely enough, 
                      the elemental gives you that time because it tanks like 
                      a warrior! If you have a smart mob, which will happen occasionally 
                      (*sigh*), you may still have some problems. </font>

                      Additionally, the Magician has _the_ most efficient buffs 
                      known. All of the Summoned items are semi-permanent, some 
                      allowing the wielder to hit invulnerable monsters (and normal 
                      monsters better), some provide enhanced vision, and still 
                      others allow flight! And because these are _items_ that 
                      provide these effects, the Magician only has to cast the 
                      'buff' once! Other casters must re-buff their party-members 
                      or friends whenever the buff wears off. With Magician buffs, 
                      as long as the player with the 'buff-item' is online, the 
                      'buff' is permanent. Talk about mana-efficient. </font>

                      purposes of hitting magical monsters and that alone can 
                      make them worth using. Everyone in the party should have 
                      a magic weapon as long as the Magician isn't offline. That 
                      makes some monsters that are usually untouchable at low

                      At L1-5 it isn't that much of an investment to work with 
                      a pointy thing for awhile, and it helps out at higher levels.

                    As mentioned above, the Magician does not require as much

                                  concert with armor, and not separate from it. 
                                  We've noticed that high Agility characters receive 
                                  an AC bonus to each piece of armor. The magnitude 
                                  of this bonus seems correlated to the amount 
                                  of Agility above the average value of 75. Additionally, 
                                  there is an observed level-based bonus to AC 
                                  which seems partially Agility based. This effect 
                                  is not apparent at low levels because the difference

                                  are better suited to Melee combat than Mages. 
                                  You knew that. However, this analysis points 
                                  out that at high levels, if the Mage has to 
                                  tank for some reason, high Agility isn't going 
                                  to make that much difference in avoiding attacks.

                                  At high level, the biggest danger for a Magician 
                                  (or any support caster) is going to be enemy 
                                  BURN. As the fighters bash one another protecting 
                                  the weaker group memeber, the casters are battling 
                                  as well, but with direct damage that physical 
                                  abilities fail to protect against. The only

                                  help you avoid melee attacks while casting. 
                                  If you're avoiding melee attacks while casting, 
                                  you're likely outnumbered (elemental should

                    The most important of a Mage's summoned things is the elemental, 
                    in one of its many flavors. Elementals are the Magician's 
                    lightning bolt, sword, and healing spell rolled up into one 
                    stupid AI controlled blob. If used properly, they can be amazing 
                    additions to a Magician, if used poorly, they can get you 
                    killed faster than you can say, "NO!!! NOT THE GUARD!!!".

                    Elementals (pets of all sorts actually) are _the_ single most 
                    effective mana/damage spell of any caster in Norrath. Unless 
                    you suck at using them. I can (usually) keep an elemental 
                    alive until I must to leave the zone to sell... and if there 
                    is a shopkeeper in zone, I almost never lose an elemental. 
                    Only time I lose elementals is when they're taking the beats 
                    while I zone (especially useful when you _know_ you're outmatched).

                    Elementals are continuos burn. Rolling beats (they look like 
                    they're on castors, you'll see). A damage over time spell 
                    that can destroy one target and move on to another. However, 
                    they do have on serious drawback. Elementals have this nasty 
                    tendency to try to find a 'good path' to follow you, and in 
                    the cramped dungeons you'll be frequenting (or sometimes in 
                    the middle of a field), you'll encounter what I call "Elemental 
                    Train Syndrome" or ETS. This occurs when your elemental 'paths' 
                    and wanders off in a random direction near some enemies that 
                    don't like it. The enemies attack it, and the elemental proceeds 
                    to beat on them. Usually it will find 2-3 really large and 
                    ugly enemies just to make your life interesting. When the 
                    elemental dies, you suddenly have 2-3 pissed off mobs heading 
                    for you, and you have no idea they are coming. Thus, you should 
                    get in the habit of periodically issuing pets redundant commands 
                    when running or if you suddenly don't see your pet. Keep typing 
                    '/pet follow'. If you _ever_ see the message, 'You do not 
                    have a pet to command!" and you don't think you killed off 
                    your elemental recently... RUN!!! Zone as fast as possible. 
                    Do not stop to look back, do not check to see if anyone is 
                    near. Just tell your party "ETS" and zone. If they have worked 
                    with a 'pet' class before, they'll know. </font>

                    There are four types of Elementals corresponding to the Primary 
                    Elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air. Other elementals have been 
                    viewed in the wild, for example Mist Elementals (a combination 
                    between Air and Water). There are rumors of other 'hybrid' 
                    elementals like Slime (Water and Earth), or Dust (Earth and 
                    Air), but it is unknown whether a Magician will ever be able 
                    to summon these types (perhaps high level, or quest spells).

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Elementals are strong warriors and recover equal to, or faster 
                    than Trolls. Often they're healing will beat your meditation 
                    of mana, so usually you will be waiting for you, and not the 
                    elemental. </font>

                    I recommend 'considering' your elementals (/con) when you 
                    first summon them. Occasionally you summon the equivalent 
                    of a 'scrub' elemental. You need to know if your elemental 
                    is weak before you sick it on an enemy, or you're dead. Additionally, 
                    if you can spare the money for the material components... 
                    re-summon elementals until you get a large one. The difference 
                    is worth it. </font>

                    Once you know what approximate level your elemental is, you 
                    can judge its capabilities. All elementals have high damage 
                    output for their level (about equal to a warrior of the same 
                    level with reasonable weapons). Max damage and combat abilities 
                    for each elemental are as follows. Please note that elementals 
                    receive all of the special abilities of the levels below them 
                    as well as any listed. </font>

                                          is good by definition. However, they 
                                          really don't have the health to tank 
                                          for long, so be burning, or expect to 
                                          lose the elemental to the caster. </font>

                    Magicians have some of the best offensive spells second only 
                    to the Wizard. They are _NOT_ as good as Wizards in sheer 
                    offensive power because their spells are less reliable and 
                    do slightly less damage. Magician spells are also slower than 
                    Wizards and thus easier to interrupt. </font>

                      Magicians are a partial hybrid between Wizards and a utility 
                      caster. Offensive spells all start around 1:1 (damage to 
                      mana ratio and as you increase in levels, your spells become 
                      more efficient. At much higher levels you begin to get 2:1 
                      damage to mana ratios... very nice indeed. The damage to 
                      mana ratio is the 'Eff' value which is merely damage divided 
                      by mana cost. Anything above 100% is better than 1:1 efficient, 
                      and higher numbers are more efficient (though they may not 
                      be that 'effective', remember the reliability factor for 
                      new spells). </font>

                      Where the Magician really shines is in the Summon X spells. 
                      Magicians get more Summon spells than any other caster. 
                      These are the bread and butter for a Magician and the main 
                      reason that any smart group of adventurers would give up 
                      their cleric for... Or maybe not. :) </font>

                      attack' spell that uses summoned objects aggressively on 
                      the target, so it's very difficult to resist and it continues

                      slightly more effective finisher when needed. However, it 
                      has a huge drawback in being a 'bolt' spell. These have 
                      a tendency to miss their target because of a minimum range 
                      and some tracking issues. Always stand a bit back from your 
                      target, and have a clear LOS to the intended target. Never 
                      good to impact a Flame Bolt on the back of a group member. 
                      They don't like that. </font>

                      radius area affect damage. With 2 targets in the area of 
                      effect (AOE) it remains better than 1:1 efficient and with 
                      each additional enemy within the AEO a bonus. Be aware that 
                      this spell has a _tiny_ AEO. The enemies almost have to 
                      be stacked on the same space for them to get hit by it. 
                      Best usage of this spell can be to target a friendly character 
                      who is being attacked by more than one enemy and launch. 
                      Effectively acts as a Fire Flux around that character, but 
                      for a whole lot more damage. <div> As all Area affects,

                      time, but different. They are an area affect spell with 
                      two stages. Hitting a monster with both stages is optimal, 
                      but rather difficult as the monsters usually move out of 
                      the way of the successive waves. Also _really_ hacks off 
                      monsters at you. I don't recommend this spell that much. <div>

                      all of them) while providing less AC, no HP bonus, and no 
                      MR bonus. However, it does provide the equivalent of Leather 
                      Armor for the purposes of damage absorption. Unless the 
                      overwriting is fixed, I don't feel that this is worth it 
                      for mere Leather. The upper level versions (Chain and Plate) 
                      _might_ be worth it, because the damage absorption on Chain 
                      and Plate is rather large, however, at that level it's likely 
                      you'll required the health and magic resistance more than 
                      decreasing the damage of a few blows by 10 or so. (Out of 
                      100, well... it's just not going to make that much difference.)

                      behold. If you have EVER had problems in your life when 
                      you had to run into danger to 'fetch' some bad things to 
                      have a ruckus with... well, you're in need of your own Eye 
                      of Zomm. <div> The spell creates a little 'self' which acts 
                      as a mobile targeting recticle. You can target things, and 
                      if within range can cast spells through the eye. It moves 
                      very quickly, but is of relatively short duration (around 
                      30 seconds). Additionally, it has few hit points, so can 
                      be easily destroyed if an enemy is so inclined (they usually 
                      are). Even worse (for you) is that a destroyed eye will 
                      cause an enemy NPC to rumble towards you at a rather fast 
                      clip. <div> Common usage of the Eye is for scouting an unknown 
                      area safely (mostly), and for luring enemies to you with 
                      a bit of well placed burn. </font>

                    You are a Mage. The elemental is a summoned creature that 
                    you control utterly. Which one do you think should take the 
                    most damage in combat? Right. Elementals should be the primary 
                    tanks in combat, but remember this important detail. You have 
                    to wait for the elemental to heal before you can continue 
                    your quest (like one of those dumb-ass warriors who insists 
                    on being 'big and strong'). Thus, it is in your best interest 
                    to _trade_ hits with an elemental. If you let the elemental 
                    die, you have to spend 40-200+ mana to re-summon one, lose 
                    a material component, _and_ meditate back up a bit. Losing 
                    an elemental can be dangerous and very inefficient. </font>

                    If your elemental gets down about a third of its health, and 
                    you're not in any immediate danger, step in!!! Take some beats. 
                    You'll have less health overall, so you'll heal before your 
                    elemental will (and you can BANDAGE yourself if you get truly 
                    mangled). You'll notice a great increase in the recovery rate 
                    from combat, and a corresponding increase in efficiency. </font>

                    Initially, your spells are very unreliable at a new level. 
                    You will notice many fizzles and a much greater chance of 
                    resistance (decreased or no damage) than for a Wizard of equal 
                    rank. I feel that this reflects a recognizable difference 
                    between Magicians and Wizards. Wizards have _only_ their spells 
                    to rely on. Magicians have more options. Thus, at each new 
                    level, the Magician must rely upon the new elemental at that 
                    level to be effective. </font>

                    Elementals are strong, but no where near as strong as they 
                    were in the early Beta. Combat now requires a bit more finesse 
                    on the part of the Magician. As mentioned above in the 'Controversy' 
                    section, elementals become relatively 'weaker' as you move 
                    towards your next spell rank. This is most noticeable directly 
                    before the new rank (L7, L11, L15, L19, etc). However, with 
                    the multiple types of elementals a smart Mage can compensate 
                    for these differences. </font>

                    OK, your elementals are getting weaker, and your spells are 
                    getting more effective. Logically, you BURN more as you approach 
                    a new level. However, you must be _very_ careful not to overdo 
                    it and move into the realm of 'dumbass' Mage. If you burn 
                    too early, or too frequently, you will get axed as the enemy 
                    will fixate on you, and beat you bloody. Try some of the following 
                    tactics. </font>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Always drop a damage shield on your elemental prior to attacking 
                    an enemy. The added damage may not seem significant, but it 
                    is. Additionally, the damage provided by the shield acts as 
                    a 'taunt' and locks the enemy more firmly onto the elemental. 
                    This is a _good_ thing when you start to burn. </font>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    The best solution (after L8) that I've found is to hook up

                    Magicians have an odd role in groups corresponding to their 
                    'dual existence'. They act primarily as a Wizard, but have 
                    the added bonus of increasing the 'health' of a group similar 
                    to a warrior. </font>

                      Magicians add that 'little' extra to a group that can make 
                      a good group into an amazing one. My groups often cheer 
                      loudly whenever I enter the area yelling, 'BURN and BEATS 
                      have arrived!' That's because these two things I provide 
                      a group are that important and noticeable. </font>

                      A Mage's main purpose in the group is providing extra damage. 
                      This is damage in the form of burn to stop runners, fire 
                      shields and elementals to take creatures down faster, and 
                      the elementals again to occupy extra chafe creatures often 
                      pile onto fights against multiple opponents. </font>

                      In my opinion they do burn better than a wizard, but less 
                      quickly. They may not do the amazing piles of damage that 
                      a wizard is capable of but generally big piles of damage 
                      lead to a frenzied enemy on your wizard much more often 
                      than a dead enemy. The damage the Magician does comes more 
                      slowly, but is a heck of a lot more steady. No 200 point 
                      lumps, but doing 400 damage over the course of a fight (EASY 
                      to do with under a bubble of mana if you're wise) is substantial.

                      The main reason that Mages are better than Wizards in a 
                      group is because a large majority of their damage can be 
                      'third person' hyper-efficient damage. Damage shields are 
                      a minimal mana investment and can be extremely profitable 
                      for a group. Elementals are a one time investment and provide 
                      hundreds, if not thousands of points of damage over the 
                      course of a groups progress through a zone. Both of these 
                      are EFFICIENT uses of mana, which means less time spent 
                      meditating, and thus less group downtime. Most often, mana 
                      used during a fight will be restored before that fight is 
                      over. Compare this to a Wizard, who often is stuck meditating 
                      for 3-5 minutes after a tough fight. </font>

                          However, most Magicians (and Wizards) do not understand 
                          that proper use of burn in a group. This was touched 
                          on in Grouping 101 and Grouping 201. </font>

                          Usually enemies like this are higher in level than the 
                          group. For Burn in this case to be effective, the enemy 
                          must still be within about 5 levels of the caster (or 
                          be affected by a 'weakening' spell like Malaise or Tashan). 
                          If an enemy fits these requirements, you burn it to 
                          the group as fast as you can, CALLing out the fact that 
                          you're nuking. Be aware that you're likely going to 
                          draw the creature onto you, so have another caster laying 
                          burn on simultaneously, or expect to get eaten. </font>

                          who are low on health into the dead state. You'll be 
                          much happier, and so will your group. Recovery begins 
                          that much faster. </font>

                          of burn in the midst of a moderate fight to accelerate 
                          the combat. PLEASE be careful to wait until a member 
                          of your party has done equal or greater than the amount 
                          of damage your spell will do, or expect to get jumped. 
                          The reason for this type of burn is simple. The mana 
                          regeneration rate is fixed. If you have max mana, you're 
                          not regenerating mana, and thus are being inefficient. 
                          However, do not do this sort of burn below about 75% 
                          mana. If you do so, you're asking for a situation in 
                          which you'd need that mana to survive. </font>

                    best armor you can possibly have and equip it. Your combat

                    when it's your turn to deliver damage. Armor has two facets 
                    to it. The AC, which modifies how often you get hit, and the 
                    damage reduction (not represented in a statistic), which decreases 
                    the amount of damage from each blow. It is absolutely essential 
                    to improve your armor as much as you can. Once you have outfitted 
                    yourself in full cloth armor try taking it all off for a fight 
                    and see how much more damage you receive during combat. You 
                    will never doubt armor again. </font>

                    they can be VERY effective at taking out a solo opponent. 
                    Because they lack armor, and do not have any extraordinary 
                    attacks, they will quickly be overwhelmed in a melee, and 
                    the elemental is not that much help against an opponent who 
                    knows what's up (ie: smoke the Mage... then deal with the 
                    elemental). Magicians do not have that most abusive of PK 
                    abilities: Root. The only advantage they have is... well... 
                    invisible elementals. And that's just not going to cut it

                    Well, that's it. A full Beta worth of knowledge, observations, 
                    hints, and experiences with the Magician class. I've played 
                    the Magician first and I will likely play one in the final. 
                    They just 'ring' with my idea of a fantasy character. Perhaps 
                    I'll have other classes and characters in the final, but I'll 
                    always have a Magician floating around somewhere. </font>

                      by Pure Powergaming Inc (PPI), a think tank of EQ testers 
                      and players who have taken it upon themselves to try and 
                      inform other denizens of Norrath about ways to enhance their 
                      experience and make the world a better place for all. PPI 
                      has nothing against role-playing and in fact most of the 
                      members of PPI are long-time role-players. PPI feels that 
                      enhancing general mechanical skill in the game allows role-playing 
                      to become easier as people have to concentrate less on the 
                      game mechanics, and more on interacting in character with 
                      other players.</i> </font>
