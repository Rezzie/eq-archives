The sun rises in the east, the crow cakles, and all begins
anew.  The bards fresh to ignore the
wrong notes of last nights concert, the rangers a new chance
to hunt game, without thought of the
kodiak that escaped their grasp the day before.  All may
start fresh, except for one.  The paladin
Banegrivm, lost and returned.  One whose victories were
without number, but with a defeat still so
fresh in his mind.  All the visions return, the triumphant
battle against Murlune, the sickening blackness
that soon folowed, the stinging blade of the vile drow
Vinenae, and the face of the cleric he never saw,
yet haunted him, never fully comming into detail.  His mind
awash with emotions, he knew little more
than to head off to the tavern, completely forgeting to
report to his master.  A seasoned drinker, it
took him little time to fall into the drunken stupor that is
on the verge of utter drunkenness.  Something
in the corner of his eye drew his attention.  He swivled on
his chair, to see the cleric, this time
in full view, with a quizzical look on her face.  Then with
a twist of her fingers, he blacked out,
succumbing to the alchohol that he made his life.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
Out of the blackness, images arrise that cannot be penned
with the complete, vivid nature that comes
from a mind that is not fully awake, yet not asleep by a
long shot.  These visions flashed before him,
then faded to aqua as he burbled in the ocean, then was
yanked out.<br><br>
"What are you doing getting yourself drunk like that?"
The cleric loomed behind him.<br><br>
"Was the last battle nothing more than a chapter torn out
and burnt like a log?  If that is the case, then
Marr's care was misplaced."<br><br>
He turned around, unsteadly as he had never been confronted
on this topic.<br><br>
"I survived didn't I, that means that the chapter is done,
now let me drink in peace!"<br><br>
Annother cold dunk awakened him fully.<br><br>
"But the final word have not been writen, Vinenae is still
alive, therefore the battle is not finished.  She
will come for you, and I cannot protect you from yourself,
only awaken you to the truth."<br><br>
She let go of his tunic, and let him fall to the docks.<br><br>
"Remeber this feeling?  The feeling of falling onto the same
planks just a night before?  This time there
is no blade to sting you, but next time, the blade will not
be denyed."<br><br>
A cold wind made the paladin turn around, to find that she
had vanished.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
"What does Mithaniel have in mind for this boy," Sariah
wondered aloud, atop the same balcony she had
disapeared to before.  "What could he accomplish."
