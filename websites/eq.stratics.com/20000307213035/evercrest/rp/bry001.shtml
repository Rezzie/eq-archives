Taking a big sniff of the air Bryan climbed down the mast of the Storm
Breaker. He was on his way to the land of Faydwer. Never being there he had
only heard storys of Dwarfs, Woodelves, and Gnomes. He did see a wood elf
once in Qeynos but it was rare. He was basically the only one alone on the
boat. Everyone else sat around talking to friends. I ever overheard a guild
talking about Minos. We heard a loud scraping sound as we skidded through
some rocks. Than we heard water rushing. Than.... Blackness.
<br><br>
***<br>
I awoke in a small hut. It seemed as if I was the only one there. I got up
wiping some water out of my bag and checking my drum, lute, flute, and horn
to make sure they were all alright. They were. I heard a loud stomping sound
everywhere. Sticking my head out of the hut I saw Giants EVERYWHERE! I
crouched back into the corner of my hut in fear wondering how the hell i got
so far up the island into the hut... Did someone drag me here? Risking there
life, knowing I was still alive? or did for some strange reason a giant
bring me up here? Looking back down at the beach I saw parts of people I saw
talking on the boat. It was a horrid site. I remember seeing a guild. Was
the whole guild wiped out? Looking out into the distance I saw a faint
reckage sitting in the rocks. I just sat back down in my hut and thought (if
they did get out alive I would be surprised).
<br><br>
As time passed my clothes started to dry and my food supply was going low.
As I stretched my leg I heard a giant booming sound. "Funny looking music
thingy ready to come out?"
Than came a even deeper reply "I don't know! Go check on funny music
thingy!"
Than was the booming "Kay!"
<br><br>
I heard a big fast booming sound come stomping towards me. I crouched in
fear as the hut came up over my head and into the air. Blackness...
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
"Funny music thingy wake up!" I felt a large object tapping my side. I got
up in fear as I found myself sitting on a table. "Funny music thingy! Play
some sounds!". A very load deep definaning sound came about. I pulled out my
lute and started playing a loling tune. At first the giants seemed to resist
it. But soon they were all sleeping about on the tables. I was able to climb
down from the table making sure I kept singing the tune (I put my lute away
to sing) and soon I was walking down the island. As I was looking around I
didn't see any evidence of life or any living thing.
<br><br>
***<br>
Three hours passed. I was still wandering around looking for some kind of
way to escape. At this time of night the water was freezing and I had no
chance of getting away by water. When I ran out of food i did return back to
the large table and replayed my tune and refilled on supplys.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
Sitting town by a tree I heard a loud sound of angry giants. I quickly got
back up again and almost fainted again. I didnt know what to do. I heard
lots of stomping and outta the fog came angry giants. They were surrounding
the island. I quickly started singing a song to get my feet moving faster
and reached the water. I ran down to the water and started doing my best of
singing a song to keep my breath in my lungs fresh. The water was cold and I
felt my skin freeze instantly. I couldnt see any type of image through the
water. It was too dark.
<br><br>
***<br>
About an hour later I saw some sun coming out of the horizin. I saw an image
of giants standing on the island. If i didnt get up to the surface to get
some warmth I would be dead soon.
