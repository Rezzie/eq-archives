This is an ongoing study and your thoughts on the subject are always welcome.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>	</tr></table><br><br><a name="clehea"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>	<tr>		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Section I - Healing Powers of the Cleric</font></b><div>	As a Cleric, your power lies in two main areas.  The first area is in your ability to heal and cure the ailments of others.  The second area is your ability to combat the forces of what we know as the undead.	Let us begin our discussion with the Cleric's healing powers.<blockquote>	<b>Rank I</b>	<div>	Minor Healing - One of the first spells an aspiring Cleric learns.  Minor                               Healing, like all of the spells in the healing group, is                       based on the Cleric's expertise in the arcane skill of                       Alteration.  This spells is a relatively low power spell,                       and as such doesn't require much in the way of mana                       expenditure.  As an Apprentice Cleric (Rank I), Minor                       Healing will be your only healing spell.  At higher levels                       however, you will more choices available to you.  These                       more potent healing spells require a large expenditure of                       mana however, and the Cleric should always remember that                       he or she can fall back upon the basic Minor Healing if                       needed.					  <p>	Cure Poison - A basic spell, but one that should never be forgotten.                        Not much can be said about this useful spell except, do                       not forget you have it.  If you or another should chance                       to be poisoned, the use of this spell as a cure is much                       preferred over the option of letting the poison run its                       course.  Most poisons occurring naturally in Norrath are                       slow acting.  Thus, even if you don't currently have this                       spell memorized, you should have time to do so before the                       poison can cause too much damage to the infected soul.					  <p>	<b>Rank II</b>	<div>	Light Healing - The Cleric's spell of Light Healing is a natural                        progression of skill from the less effective Minor                        Healing.  While Light Healing uses more of the caster's                        mana to perform its task, it is also more effective.                         Speaking strictly mana -vs- effect, Light Healing is                        worth the extra expenditure.  In addition, when you have                        attained the experience of higher ranks, and thus more                        efficient healing spells, never forget that you can fall                        back on Light Healing or Minor Healing in emergency                        situations when mana is critical.					   <p>                       As an addendum - Experience has found Light Healing to be                        the most efficient spell to use to heal party members                            amid battle situations.  Using more experienced spells                        can consume too much mana, leaving the Cleric without the                        ability to aid others.					   <p>	Cure Blindness - This spell is one that most Cleric's do not keep                        memorized, but always remember its there.  It is highly                        unlikely that you will need to do a battlefield cure of                        this obscure disease, but you may find the need to help                        one has recently been stricken.					   <p>	Cure Disease - Most diseases will be caused by disease carrying animals.                       However, since these diseases can very quickly ravage the                        body of the victim, it is best to have this spell pre-                       memorized and ready for use whenever you feel the chances                        of a disease being caught are high.					   <p>	<b>Rank IV</b>	<div>	Healing  - The pinnacle of a Cleric's training into the ability to                          heal others.  This spell, while absorbing a tremondous                        amount of mana, can nearly completely heal most injured                        souls.  However, as a battlefield healing spell it should                        be used with caution.  The use of such a spell will often                        leave the cleric drained of important mana that could be                        used more importantly elsewhere.	</blockquote><div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>	</tr></table><br><br><a name="cleund"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>	<tr>		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Section Ia - The Cleric vs. Undead</font></b><div>	Next, let us deal with the Cleric's ability to combat the undead creatures of Norrath.<blockquote>	<b>Rank I</b>	<div>	Spook the Undead - The first spell in this category that the Cleric                                 learns doesn't really help to combat the undead                                directly, but can still be extremely valuable in                                this fight if properly applied.  When a Cleric is                                amid large numbers of these creatures doing                                battle, he or she can quickly become overwhelmed.                                 Proper application of this spell can help the                                Cleric to scare away extra targets so he or she                                  can concentrate on just one or two.							   <p>	<b>Rank II</b>	<div>	Ward Undead - The Cleric's first step into the ability to                                deliver great damage to the undead.  Ward Undead,                                even as a lower level spell, should not be                                underestimated.  In addition, when mana is low,                                or your target is nearly dead, it is good to be                                able to fall back onto this spell and not waste                                the larger amounts of mana required for the more                                devastating spell Expulse Undead.							   <p>	<b>Rank III</b>	<div>	Sense the Dead - A basic spell for a basic purpose, Sense the Dead                                   makes is easier for the Cleric on such a quest to                                     locate his or her potential targets.							   <p>	<b>Rank IV</b>	<div>	Expulse Undead - The mainstay of a Cleric's fight, Expulse Undead                                can do devastating amounts of damage to these                                creatures.  It should not, however, be over used.                                 With such a large expenditure of mana required,                                     one should always consider whether or not the                                extra firepower is required.  Never be ashamed to                                   fall back on Ward Undead.							   <p>	Invisibility to Undead - This spell can allow the Cleric to wander                                untouched through a sea of undead creatures.                                 This spell is best used to scout out your                                potential targets.  Then through careful use of                                attacks and Spook the Undead you can control the                                pace of the battle.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>	</tr></table><br><br><a name="enc"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>	<tr>		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Section II - The Enchanter</font></b><div>	The true power of an Enchanter lies in control.  Don't let anyone tell you  otherwise.  An experienced Enchanter controls and shapes the very powers around us and delivers them in multiple ways. Although it is rumored that it is possible for the Enchanter to mold these  powers in such a way as to enchant various weapons and armor, I personally have yet to meet one who can so I can offer no information on the subject. 		What I do know about, and what I will discuss with you here, is the Enchanter's ability  to alter the  very behavior, strengths, and weaknesses of those around him or her.  The experienced  Enchanter can not only help to boost the effectiveness of his allies, but can also hinder the efforts of his foes.	So, without further discussion, let us delve into the Enchanter's realm of power and see where best his or her spells are used.<blockquote><b>Rank I</b><div>Strengthen -         This low level spell actually forms the backbone of the Enchanter's ability to shore up his allies' strength. The spell uses very little mana and is in fact the only such spell at your disposal until rank VI where you will learn Berserker Strength.  Considering the amount of mana that higher level spell requires, you will find Strengthen is more often used.<p>Weaken      -        Again, don't underestimate the effectiveness of this spell just because it is low level.  By lowering your opponents strength, he won't be able to deliver as much damage.  As with most lower level spells, don't forget that you can fall back on this one in cases of low mana.<p>Minor Shielding - The first spell most Enchanters are taught can only be used to aid thyself.  However, with its low mana requirement you should never be without its effects.  Once you have learned the spell of Lesser Shielding at Rank III you will want to maintain that spell.  However, if mana is low, or required elsewhere, feel free to forego the use of Lesser Shielding and use Minor Shielding instead.<p>Lull                     - This spell will be very useful up to about Rank III or IV where you will want to start using more effective means.  Until then, knowing how to use this spell is absolutely essential.  As the Enchanter in a party you will be comparable to a God in that proper use of this spell and its later versions can allow you to completely control the pace of the battle. When you are your party find yourselves in situations with too many foes to handle all at once, Lull will allow you to "suggest" to your foes that they want to leave you alone.  This in turn will allow you, and not your enemy, to decide who will fight and who will not.<p><b>Rank II</b><div>Invisibility           - The ultimate form of stealth, this spell allows you or anyone you choose to enchant, the ability to scout deep into enemy territory without being seen.  In addition don't forget this spells usefulness when you or your party simply need to pass through areas unmolested.  A very important note to remember when using this spell however, is that you will remain invisible only so long as you don't perform any actions which would give away your position.  This means you can't use any special skills, attack, or cast any spells if you wish to remain unseen.  In addition, once a foe has located you, you won't be able to evade him or her, so don't waste the mana casting this spell.  You will have to evade them the traditional way.<p>Fear                     - This spell, much more powerful that Lull or even the higher level Soothe, allows you to complete frighten your foe into running.  However, use this spell with caution, as the mana required is great. Often, careful use of Lull or Soothe at the proper times will be adequate and use less mana. <p>Enfeeblement      - A much more powerful version of Weaken, this spell should be used as the first line of defense against your foes.  Once you had hindered them with this, they won't be able to deliver near as much damage.  Also remember that this spell will require larger mana expenditure than Weaken, so don't get too crazy with it.<p>Haze                    - This is one enchantment that you should make sure to keep active on all members of your party at all times.  Party members enchanted with Haze will be much more difficult for foes to hit.  <p><b>Rank III</b><div>Root                     - This spell will allow you to hold a foe in place from afar. This can be extremely useful for your allies for two reason.  The first is it prevents the foe from running to safety or reinforcements when badly injured.  The second reason is it allows your allies to strike out of range or strike and then step back, keeping them out of danger.<p>Lesser Shielding  - Once you have learned this spell, which can only be used on yourself, you should have its effects on you at all times. If, however, you are in a mana critical situation, don't hesitate to fall back on your Minor Shielding instead.<p>Soothe                  - A more effective spell than Lull, Soothe allows you even greater control over the combat situation.  Take heed, however, that you don't overdo its use.  The mana expenditure for this spell is three fold that of Lull, and in some situations Lull will suffice to do the job.  Learn to recognize those situations.  <p><b>Rank IV</b><div>Enduring Breath   - This is a spell that you won't use all that often, but when you do its effects will be much appreciated. There are rumors of hidden cities and temples far under the oceans, and this will allow you and your entire party to reach them. When using this spell with party members however, take heed to pay attention to them.  Be sure you can recast it on anyone who indicates its effects have faded.  It would be most devastating to the reputation of the Enchanter class as a whole should you inadvertently allow a party member to drown because you were not paying attention.<p>Serpent Sight        - The Human members of your party will greatly benefit from your use of this spell.  Its effects will allow them to see perfectly well in the darker areas of Norrath.<p>Languid Pace        - While the mana expenditure for this spell is extremely high, its effects are nothing short of astounding. The effects of this spell, when cast on your foe, will cause him or her to attack much slower, and thereby will reduce the amount of damage your allies receive nearly in half.  For a true massacre, combine the use of this spell with the Rank V spell of Quickness.  You will thereby increase the attack speed of your allies while reducing the attack speed of your foes.<p><b>Rank V</b><div>Quickness             - This spell will allow your allies to attack at a much faster pace, and thereby cause more damage to your foes in less time.  Combine this spell with the Rank IV spell of Languid Pace for a truly devastating melee.<p>Disempower         - While in most cases you will want to use the spell of Enfeeblement to weaken your foes, this spell can be truly devastating to them.  Not only will this cause them to be weakened, but their stamina will be lowered along with their overall Armor Class.  Be forewarned, however, that the mana expenditure of this spell is very high, and should be used with caution.<p>Chase the Moon    - This spell, while requiring large amounts of vital mana, is exceptional at forcing foes to flee should the Rank II spell of Fear fail.<p>Shielding               - A stronger and more effective version of Lesser and Minor Shielding, this spell increases hit points as well as magic resistance.  The mana required is high however, and as such this spell should be used only when mana is not in high demand.<p><b>Rank VI</b><div>Berserker Strength  - When you cast this spell on a warrior, you turn him or her into a virtual killing machine.  The effects of this spell not only make the warrior stronger, but also increase his or her agility in combat and increases maximum hit points. Considering the relatively low mana expenditure in comparison to its level, this spell is a very important one to remember.<p>Calm                        - For situations where Lull or Soothe simply prove ineffective, Calm can usually do the trick. However, it is suggested that you try to learn just what situations call for each, so as to not waste mana on higher level spells when lower levels would work.<p>Reckless Might        - This higher level version of the Rank II spell of Enfeeblement is extremely effective at lowering your foes' strength.  However, due to the large mana requirements, it should only be used in extreme situations or situations where mana levels are not a big concern.</blockquote><div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>	</tr></table><br><br><table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=908070 width=80%>	<tr>		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td align="center"><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;<div>Author: Agathorn<div>&nbsp;</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td bgcolor=f0f0f0><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&copy; Copyright 1999 Stratics.
