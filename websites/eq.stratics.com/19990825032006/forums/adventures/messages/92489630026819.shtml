<br>I am Elyas on the Solusek Ro server and in my travels mainly around Qeynos area have found many problems that need addressing.  I wish to submit a outline of some issues that players are having with the Everquest game that really after month one should be fixed.  I submit this in hopes that it will be posted for its pretty complete with large issues and I wish to see some response and feedback from players and Dev Team alike.<br> <br>1)  Monsters and NPC's in general can still go through housing and boat walls.. <br> <br>eg In qeynos hills zone a wolf attacks someone selling stuff in the Smiths house and Holly Windstalker the NPC Ranger kills him while he is in the house... he could not see either but they can attack him from outside the house<br> <br>eg there is a spot on the Qeynos/ Erudian ferry ride that monsters spawn IN THE WATER and attack people riding absolutely out of range above on the boat from the water.. also the flying sharks in eruding crossing that kill people on the boat.<br> <br>eg standing on top of the gnoll head entrance to Black burrow I can be hit by a person or npc that is on the ground even though I am over a body length above the person.<br> <br>eg In the Black burrow gnoll dungeon the gnolls dont open the door they walk through them especially fustrating when they walk through the fake doors we can open as in the one near the pit with spikes on the lower level.  Yet in Split paw gnoll dungeon they open the doors.<br> <br>2)  In many dungeons monsters have glitches when running away.. <br> <br>eg Permafrost zone.. when  monster runs from the zone area and go to turn around the first corner to the left.. there image freezes where it is unhittable and then 3 seconds later they appear around 30 m down the corridor.<br> <br>eg.  When some player or monster travels in thin corridors,twisting corridors and over hills, you can see ghost images of the player circling on the other side of the hill or the circling running into walls at the bottom of the corridor.<br>There is two spots in Black burrow that this is bad.. one leading to a snake pit on the far side of the bottom level.. and the ajoining corridor from the bottom level to the top level.  The latter happens when people go up from the small open landing with two bridges.<br> <br>eg.  When a player uses the bash talent to strike a running monster.. if the monster is running fast enough its image keeps running straight for approx 2 seconds then the monster falls from the sky back where the bashing took place.<br> <br>3) Guards In qeynos if an npc attacks a player who the guards protect but is evil say a Necromancer..  the player is killed not the npc.  Guards protect necromancer's too in Qeynos and in PVP the agressor is attacked why this isnt true with NPC people I do not know.<br> <br>eg You have struggled to kill a monster down to 10 hp and it is running a guard see's it and kills it doin 80 damage.. you did 300 damage to get them to 10 hp yet the body dissapears and you gain nothing.<br> <br>4) This one is amusing... I jumped on an ogre's back and slide off and took 8 damage from the fall...<p>5)  When a player is two close to a monster the monster can hit him all day and the monster doesnt compensate yet the <br>player cant hit at all.  I agree that a person should have to be farther away with a large weapon that someone beating<br>on it with fists but this could  be a two way street.  <br> <br>6) Several monster can contain the same area.. as in physically inside each other.. so two gnolls for example can look like one and the only way you tell is when there attack movements become out of sync and you can see the two.. I can jump inside a ogre.. I know I have tried ( see number 4 ) <br> <br>7) Possibly address the growing fear that what is left in a game where the only thing to do is combat the computer with others.  The issues that arise when it is impossible to take action on someone that is acting unappropriate, when the only possible fun day to day is fighting a computer... and everything is awarded to the person or group which accomplishes the most damage on a monster no matter what other considerations where present.<br> <br>8) The GM response times.. in all but very slow times.. I usually get from 2 to 4 hours response time.. and this is not what was advertised with the game.<br> <br>Now I have just pushed a lot of problems on the plate.. and I hate to do so with out some imaginative solutions because this game has been said to be player driven..<br> <br>9) I am a level 18 Paladin.. I use consider on a Gnoll commander of Black burrow, a Gnoll Soothsayer of High pass, a Goblin of Permafrost and get Blue message this looks dangerous.  I use Consider on a Griffawn of north Karanas and I get the same message " this looks dangerous " .  I can solo fight all the other things but a Griffawn killed me and  5 other 10 - 14th people and I used my full healing ability Lay Hands which I dont use against the others.  why such a difference doesn't this make the Consider command obsolete and redundant if it doesnt work to show me how hard something is.<br> <br>10) My brother is a magician named Atum... While travelling to the island at Erudian Crossing a fire elemental from the water attacked him on the boat.  He could not escape it even running to the upper decks or see it and COULD NOT CAST SPELLS.  I understand the realism of not casting spells on a boat because it rocks but neither can an fire elemental attack a person through 10 meters of air and 2 or more sets of wooden boat frame.  Unless the boats are totally safe from glitches as such can I ask that spells be reinstated on boats until these bugs are fixed so that mages can protect themselves. This will probably cause less bodies found in the ocean which again would inturn cause less gm assistance needed.  This also saves mages from being at an unfair advantage in a pvp situation on a boat.. we want our mage friends to travel dont we?<br> <br>11) when a container is in the bank it cannot be opened and added stuff to.  You must take the container out of the bank and put in your inventory add stuff to it then put the container back into the bank slot.  Is there a reason for this or can it be adjusted.<br> <br>12) With some of the faster weapons and monk, the swing action cannot keep up to the actual swing.  Many times I have seen the monster fall and myself with my long sword or a monk will still take like 3 swipes at it.<br> <p>1) The problem with kill stealing is the attitude and formula that takes into account who slayed it and damage done to the monster only.<br> <br>eg 4th lvl Landin has struck a fire beetle for 3 damage then 6 damage.. 3rd lvl monk Bloggins hits the beetle for 9 damage and kills it.. although landin was fighting the beetle first and did equal damage, Bloggins killed the beetle and did 9 damage in one strike.<br> <br>This is what I am guessing the formula from this exact experience.<br> <br>Now why isnt the formula changed to that if a person does 9 damage on a monster.. he is rewarded for his damage done.. first of all this is usefull because lower level people do not effect the higher level monsters due to the monsters AC.  I have a 7th level Shadow knight that cannot hit effectively on a elite Gnoll of Black burrow.<br> <br>as for the loot I still feel that the allowing to loot a kill should be awarded to the group or person who did the most with this new formula.  Make experience universal so if you hit for so much damage you get a fraction of the experience but not very much compared to if you overall had the highest rating with the new equation.. I suggest a lump some of say 40% given to the group or person who overall, did the most damage and received the most damage then the other 60% be divied up according to damage done.<br> <br>Also the experience equation can take into account the damage and attack that the monster concentrated on.. This will protect the Lone fighter who takes much of the damage or attack but does little damage with the melee weapon compared to the wizard who roasts the kill from afar. This can be incorperated into Groups as well but I suggest that this effect is diminished if the Taunt skill is used.. for that would allow a taunter a greater " Kill stealing " ability..<br> <br>also the first person to attack a monster and the slayer of the monster should be credited in the new formula with some weight.. therefore a new suggest formula would take into account.. Damage done, Damage taken, who had first dibs, who killed.  But the the entire load of experience would not go to the slayer.. but be spread out between groups or players that do and take damage.  There fore if you had a kill down to 10 hit points and a guard kills it. You do not get loot as always but you get the experience from damage taken and damage given and first attack.  <br> <br>2) I have noticed that Arena's have become a player vs player zone.  I have a suggestion that Dungeons and other fighting zones also become PVP without the annoying repeated " you have entered ( PVP ) zone" tell them once or a few times upon entering and then it is generally known that dungeons are fair game.  This for two reasons:<br> <br>    1.  Most quarrels and selfish " kill stealing " happen around dungeons and other high spawn monster areas.  If it is clear that these area's are PVP then honourable players have the means to protect themselves from the selfish unworthy characters that exploit there means to take kills or monopolize dungeons.  for example the bottom level of Black burrow could be a PVP area.. and signs be put up.  This would allow all the quarrels to be settled as it should be and also promote group play in dungeons.  Also not allowing player vs player out right or allowing it only by choice of both parties promotes a lack of role playin between players and also allows people to get off " scot free " leaving someone with no other option but call a gm.  I understand this might limit the area for single low level players but that is why I suggest parts or levels of dungeons.. or just moderate and high level dungeons all to gether.<br> <br>    2. Do remember the reason the PVP server is popular is because the dynamics of fighting other people is alot more fun and exciting than fighting a computer driven monster.. and EQ is already starting to feel repetitive... Also there is nothing more fustrating than being screwed over with your hands tied by a large group or a single player that has other ablilities that effectively let him over power you in most situations.<br> <p>3) Possibly think of a Counsiller position to aid the gm's in the game... have volunteers to counsel on a server that they do not play on and give them ability to teleport and guide players or report to a gm of misconducts.  Gm's should be able to take the counsillers word for it.. and councillers can approach players acting in misconducts to stop there actions or face actions taken against them.  If I knew the councillors had direct pipelines to the big guys I would listen to what they say.  This would allow a lot of issues to be sorted out real quick and promote good and fair gameplay.  Many of the issues that GM's face are bodies lossed and glitches that a councillor might be able to help with and aid a gm in getting problems fixed quickly.  No one wants to have to wait for three hours not being able to play because there body was lossed in the ocean due to a bug but they cant retrieve it without a gm.. that is not playing a game that is work.<br> <p>I understand that this is quite a lengthy read and a large list.. but I feel that these problems are not meant to be a challenge in the game and were not purposely put there to be a part of the game.  After the first month I would feel I would like to see some of these addressed.. and would rather see these problems addressed quickly and professionally than see new stuff enter the game. Adding new stuff and not completely fixing our main stream things will eventually lead to more problems and errors with no solutions and game play will suffer.  Thank you for reading a concerned gamers issues and remember, the only reason I am writing this and you are reading it.. is because we are all hooked on a very good totally addicting game called Everquest.. Please keep up the initial promise Dev team of being a thoughtful and helpful group that takes care of its people and put my faith back into Everquest... <br> <br>PS my Email Address is S22369@rmc.ca for anyone reading this. I am interested in player feed back and hope that I can also get feedback and comments from the Development team<br> <br>cheers <br> <br>Elyas paladin of LIght ( Solusek Ro )
