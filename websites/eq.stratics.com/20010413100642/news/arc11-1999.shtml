              <blockquote>So often (including your recent post) you and Abashi 
                come in, make a single post and then never come back to it again. 
                <p>I would like you to post on the "hot topics" of your choice 
                  and then -respond- to peoples polite commentary on your positions. 
                <p>Specific hot topics to consider are 
                <p>Why can't melees bind in outdoor zones? How do you feel this 
                  will unbalance the game? <br>
                  Why was feign death changed? I mean - specifically. No "ongoing 
                  game issues" but something blunt like "a group of 3 monks were 
                  observed killing dragons without risk" or "6 necromancers were 
                  using pets to kill dragons without risk." <br>
                  If buffs from level 50 characters are unbalancing the game by 
                  allowing powergaming, why are you not putting some kind of limit 
                  on the levels you can buff? For example, you can't buff someone 
                  more than 20 levels lower than you are. <br>
                  Why do you object to Random spawning treasure? You have tried 
                  it in Paw (so maybe you are changing your position on this). 
                  <br>
                  Why did it take so long for the Alchemy problem to be found 
                  when players were posting on the Shaman boards for 6 months 
                  that it was broken? <br>
                  Why are you creating a group of 'second class' players who don't 
                  get the best items? <br>
                  Why are you rewarding powergamers by setting up quests that 
                  require sitting for 12 hours to get a chance at the quest item 
                  when the same quest could be implemented as six 2 hour parts 
                  which any player could complete. <br>
                  Why are some of these spawns EXACTLY 12 hours apart which allows 
                  kill stealing wizards/druids to teleport in 15 seconds before 
                  the creature spawns and kill it and steal it from the group 
                  that has been sitting there waiting for hours? 
                <p>It doesn't have to be these. It can be ANY topic of your choosing. 
                <p>Folks should ONLY respond to what ever topic you choose to 
                  speak on. And you should make it specific. You can always start 
                  another thread next week on a different issue. But for cripes 
                  sake, RESPOND to peoples counter posts even if it is to disagree 
                  with them. 
                <p>Your habit of 'drive by shooting' style posts is NOT helping 
                  your relations with the players. 
                <p>Don't talk AT the players, instead engage them in a conversation.
                <p>

              Brad's Response:
              <p>
              <blockquote><font color="a00000">I'll start by answering the questions 
                you posed - if players want to break these out into separate threads, 
                please feel free. Gordon and I will attempt to respond to players' 
                responses, but keep in mind that Gordon is semi-unavailable (out 
                of town until Monday) and I have a limited amount of time I can 
                devote to posting (today being an exception). 
                <p>Why can't melees bind in outdoor zones? How do you feel this 
                  will unbalance the game? 
                <p>(I'll repost what I've said about this recently, and add to 
                  it a little). <br>
                  Binding is set up the way it is and always has been for balance.<br>
                  It is part of the death penalty and is there to pace the game. 
                  <br>
                  The idea is that casters are more prone to dying (especially 
                  in group situations, in the depths of dungeons, when something 
                  goes bad) and thus can bind in more places. It still paces the 
                  game, however, because groups need to wait for melee characters 
                  to return. If melee characters could bind anywhere it would 
                  alter the pace of the game, further minimize the death penalty, 
                  and let well balanced efficient groups just scream through dungeons. 
                  <br>
                  I realize some players reading this might think that sounds 
                  great, but there has to be a pace to the game and a penalty 
                  for dying. <br>
                  We are also considering making it such that casters cannot bind 
                  in Expansion dungeons (the fact that they can now is actually 
                  a bug that is too late to fix for the rest of the world). <br>
                  Another aspect of this is that minimizing downtime in general 
                  is PART of the challenge of the game. The better groups work 
                  together, the less downtime there is. This includes not letting 
                  people die so you don't have to wait for their return, but also 
                  includes efficient tactics, mana use, placement, etc. Efficiency, 
                  cooperation, interdependence, etc. are all key to playing EverQuest 
                  effectively. When something goes down wrong (for whatever reason, 
                  i.e. your mistake, someone else's, or random fate) the penalty 
                  is an adverse affect on efficiency, whether it's traveling, 
                  waiting, re-earning experience, etc. This is fundamentally part 
                  of the design as it relates to advancement mechanisms. 
                <p>Why was feign death changed? 
                <p>I will let Abashi re-post his several responses to this question 
                  and clarify and/or give the examples you are looking for. 
                <p>If buffs from level 50 characters are unbalancing the game 
                  by allowing powergaming, why are you not putting some kind of 
                  limit on the levels you can buff? For example, you can't buff 
                  someone more than 20 levels lower than you are. 
                <p>Because when we weighed the pros and cons, considered the long 
                  term effects on the game as well as how the players would react, 
                  we decided not to take action. I brought this up in another 
                  post to illustrate an example of us deciding not to 'nerf'. 
                  (I think the real solution, by the way, would be to scale the 
                  strength of the buff based on the recipient's level relative 
                  to the caster's). 
                <p>Why do you object to Random spawning treasure? You have tried 
                  it in Paw (so maybe you are changing your position on this). 
                <p>We're not against randomness in general, but we are against 
                  implementing randomness to the degree I've seen some players 
                  advocate (Diablo-style random loot). We feel the name and attributes 
                  of an item should have context relative to where and from whom 
                  you obtained it. But I think in general we could use more randomness 
                  and that's why you see more attempts at using the concept in 
                  Paw and elsewhere. I posted a detailed explanation of our position 
                  as it relates to random loot some months ago on alt.games.everquest 
                  - I can try to dig it up if you want more detail. 
                <p>Why did it take so long for the Alchemy problem to be found 
                  when players were posting on the Shaman boards for 6 months 
                  that it was broken? 
                <p>No real legitimate excuse here - we basically screwed up. We 
                  were testing it internally wrong (we were using GM commands 
                  to buff a Shaman to the appropriate level, which DID give alchemy 
                  to the character). We failed to test it properly by leveling 
                  a Shaman naturally which would have exposed the bug. When we 
                  heard people say it needing 'fixing', we'd test it as I described 
                  and when it worked we figured 'fixing' it really meant making 
                  the skill create more useful and effective potions, not that 
                  it was truly broken. 
                <p>Why are you creating a group of 'second class' players who 
                  don't get the best items? 
                <p>With all due respect, that's a pretty loaded and one-sided 
                  question. <br>
                  Sometimes we eliminate items such that they cease to spawn. 
                  We do this for a variety of reasons, from simply doing so to 
                  make the game more dynamic to removing items that proved to 
                  be too powerful to removing items that were bugged. Unless there 
                  is a devastating problem with an item, we tend to leave existing 
                  items in the players' inventories. Regardless of whether one 
                  perceives this as 'fair' or not, it is fundamental to how these 
                  games work. I'd also like to point out that earlier players 
                  didn't have access to all the newer items in the game, for example 
                  items that would have been very useful for them earlier on but 
                  may not be useful to them now that they are higher level. This 
                  too could probably be deemed 'unfair' but is again necessary 
                  if we are to maintain an evolving game with an advancing player 
                  base and if we are to add content on an ongoing basis. <br>
                  I think that the assertion that newer players are 'second class' 
                  is totally false. They have access to more items, better items, 
                  the economy is more mature and items are more accessible/cheaper 
                  to purchase, and there is more general knowledge about the game. 
                  I stand by my earlier statement that the game today is both 
                  generally significantly easier and also more balanced now than 
                  it was when we launched. 
                <p>Why are you rewarding powergamers by setting up quests that 
                  require sitting for 12 hours to get a chance at the quest item 
                  when the same quest could be implemented as six 2 hour parts 
                  which any player could complete. 
                <p>Guilty as charged. As Abashi posted recently, we will slowly 
                  but surely revamp the class specific quests (and other applicable 
                  quests/spawns), making them more balanced not only as they relate 
                  to each other but also in terms of how long it takes to obtain 
                  specific quest components. 
                <p>Why are some of these spawns EXACTLY 12 hours apart which allows 
                  kill stealing wizards/druids to teleport in 15 seconds before 
                  the creature spawns and kill it and steal it from the group 
                  that has been sitting there waiting for hours? 
                <p>This is a tactic that has been rearing its head more and more 
                  recently, and we've started talking about possible ways to address 
                  it in the Tuning Meetings. We are considering randomizing spawn 
                  times (for example, a six hour spawn might spawn every six hours 
                  plus or minus X minutes) as well as some other ideas. Please 
                  feel free to post any ideas you might have that would address 
                  this issue.

              <blockquote>
                <p> I call on all free citizens of Norath of 10 to 20 seasons, 
                  to aid us in a noble quest. The Leaders of the fair city of 
                  Erudin have recently discovered a band of Erudite Heretics on 
                  a small island stronghold located at Kerra Ridge. It is from 
                  this location that information has leaked detailing plans for 
                  the occupation of Odus and the systematic pillage of Erudin 
                  itself. All attempts to reach the stronghold by Erudite forces 
                  have failed due to intevention with the native Kerra. 
                <p> Erudin requests our aid in dealing with this latest threat 
                  to the peace of Norrath and we have responded. We will assemble 
                  our forces on the beaches of Toxxulia forest on Sat. January 
                  8th 2000. The assault will begin at 7pm EST with the swim to

              <blockquote>
                <p>I was hunting for the evil necro Pzyin in Qeynos Hills, when 
                  I heard the cry to my guild that one of us had been slain by 
                  a giant named Grunglephug. I quickly opened a gate to the west 
                  commonlands, his last known location. When I arrived, he immediately 
                  shouted for me to get off his land. I refused, and he summoned 
                  himself to me at the druid ring. A fight ensued, and alone I 
                  was almost slain by his hammer crushing down on me, but I was 
                  saved by the spirit of cheetah that inhibited me. After a sprint 
                  through the commonlands with the giant chasing me, help arrived 
                  from my guild. We rallied our forcesand attacked the giant, 
                  almost slaying him, but he soon healed himself up.
                <p>No one was lost to the cause, thankfully, and we kept at it. 
                  After many more hours of battle, with neither side making much 
                  progress, he called for a halt, and asked to talk to me. He 
                  asked me why I was hunting on his land, and I told him that 
                  I was not, but just passing through. I told him, being a druid, 
                  that I loved his land for the beauty and animals that lived 
                  on it. He said that I loved his land like he loved his land, 
                  and asked me to help him rid the land of the evil pigs that 
                  hunted on it. Not knowing of the pigs he was talking about, 
                  I asked him to show me, and he led me to the camp of orcswhere 
                  he and my guild began to slay them without mercy. He asked us 
                  to kill all of them in his land and bring him proof. We killed 
                  them until well past sunset, and after we could find no more, 
                  we took him the proof that we had.
                <p>(ooc: 20 slashed belts). He bestowed upon me the gift of a 
                  totemic helmet and midnight mallet for ridding the land of the 
                  beasts, and vanished, telling me only to keep the land free 
                  of pigs and inkies.
                <p>OOC: It was a good GM event, made even more interesting on 
                  TZ with dark elves trying to kill the giant while we hunted 
                  the orcs. (their mistake) Nice prize too, although I can't use 
                  either of them.

              <p>Upon hunting in Oasis minding my own business a spirit appeared 
                and was seeking younger people to assist him in avenging his soul. 
                He collected about 12 younger people and would not allow any high 
                people to partake in this evoling story.
              <p>He stated that a long time ago he was sailing on the ship Casiopia 
                and was framed by the captain for a crime he didnt commit. He 
                now seeked our aide to destroy the captain and his crew.
              <p>We followed him down the beach where we found the captain and 
                3 undead pirates. We swarmed them and dropped the captain fast. 
                Then the undead pirates started at us. They cast spells such as 
                Boil Blood and hit for up to 60 points of damage.
              <p>Needless to say many of the those the spirit recruited died, 
                it was a suicide mission and not meant for our levels.
              <p>Upon getting slain by the team of undead pirates and a boil blood 
                spell, I recieved the wonderfull you have lost a level message. 
                The <a href="http://www.arcanecirlce.org" target="_blank">Arcane 
                Circle</a> Guild sent in a few high level players to even the 
                playing field. Upon many nukes it was soon noticed the Undead 
                Pirates had a very high regeneration rate and they were barely 
                defeated by high level players. The Spirit left after they were 
                slain and the <a href="http://www.arcanecirlce.org" target="_blank">Arcane 
                Circle</a> members passed out the loot to low levels in the zone 
                and those who fell in the battle.
              <p>The loot consisted of Combine Scimitar's and Mesh Tunics, hardly 
                the loot worthy of the low levels or the high levels it took to 
                slay them.
              <p>In closing, I appreciated the event however it was directed towards 
                the wrong levels. The spirit stated "I only want those that can 
                solo Deep Waters" Directing it to those in the mid-teens.
              <p>Well off to gain the expierience that I lost in this event, nothing 
                to show but a huge scar in amount of time played.

              <blockquote><font color="a00000">Binding is set up the way it is 
                and always has been for balance. It is part of the death penalty 
                and is there to pace the game.
                <p>The idea is that casters are more prone to dying and thus can 
                  bind in more places. It still paces the game, however, because 
                  groups need to wait for melee characters to return. If melee 
                  characters could bind anywhere it would alter the pace of the 
                  game, further minimize the death penalty, and let well balanced 
                  efficient groups just scream through dungeons. 
                <p>I realize some players reading this might think that sounds 
                  great, but there has to be a pace to the game and a penalty 
                  for dying.
                <p>We are also considering making it such that casters cannot 
                  bind in Expansion dungeons (the fact that they can now is actually 
                  a bug that is too late to fix for the rest of the world).

                their own beasts into the growing database. During the weekend, 
                we have had over 75 new beasts added! Soon users will be able 
                to attach more then one screenshot to every Beast/NPC on our site. 
                The current bestiary allows entry by zone so players can view 
                the beasts by location. Also, many players have added their own 
                thoughts/tips/tricks to the individual beasts.
                <p>For those of you un-familiar with the Everlore website or the 
                  Bestiary section. Everlore is a dynamic website that allows 
                  users to add information to literally any section of the website. 
                  Currently we have over 52,000 documents entered into the database. 
                  We have extensive daily news, spells, equipment, guides and

              reposts his post on the <A HREF=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true>Everquest 
              Forum</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>(I'm reposting this -- it was originally 
                at the end of a long thread and was a response to another post. 
                Some players started to respond to it by breaking down their opinions 
                on the various zones, which I think is a great idea and will help 
                us deal with these issues)I will attempt to address this issue 
                by answering your questions:<BR>
                <BR>
                </font>1) Does Verant think the servers are overcrowded during 
                peak hours?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Some servers are over peak population targets 
                (for example, Fenin Ro). Unfortunately, new players continue to 
                start on Fenin for a variety of reasons. Also, and more importantly, 
                some Zones on all servers are over crowded. To me, this is the 
                more important issue. Why are some Zones less populated? Why do 
                many people prefer the more populated zones, play there, and then 
                complain about over crowded servers? What could we do to attract 
                players to some of the lesser used zones? These are the questions 
                that I think need to be answered, and we'd love some feedback. 
                It is a fact that many zones, even on the more populated servers, 
                are underutilized and have room, while others are more than full. 
                I think we can do some things to help (for example, re-tune dungeons, 
                adjust loot levels/types, etc.) and I think the players can do 
                somethingabout it too (make an effort to explore/use dungeons 
                and other zones that are less populated, even if they are farther 
                away, or you perceive they have less loot, or they are more challenging).<BR>
                <BR>
                </font>2) Is the game playable within their original design ideas 
                based upon REAL WORLD server populations, as opposed to pre-release 
                and design-doc server projections during these peak times?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>The game is extremely playable, even on the 
                more crowded servers, especially IF you make an effort to play 
                in areas that aren't as crowded. I know that's what I and my guild 
                do. Does it take longer? Yes, sometimes. Is it more dangerous? 
                Sure, but we like the challenge. Is the loot not as good? Depends. 
                And again, we (Verant) have been and will continue to tune existing 
                dungeons, especially the underutilized ones, to draw more people 
                to them. (Kerra Ridge is next, btw, after we launch the Plane 
                of Sky. Then we'll launch Paineel, which has newbie areas, and 
                then the Hole, which is a high level dungeon).</font><BR>
                <BR>
                3) If a player feels they are wasting time by playing on an overcrowded 
                server, what options do they have? Start over on a new server? 
                Be transferred? Wait for the expansion?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>We have no intention of allowing general character 
                transfers between servers, and in any case, I don't think that 
                would address the issue people are complaining about at all. I 
                really don't. And even if it were helpful, the problems it would 
                add in my opinion far outweigh the benefits.<BR>
                <BR>
                My answer for a player who feels he or she is wasting time in 
                a crowded area is to MOVE to other zones, wait for us to revamp 
                and re-tune more existing zones, and wait for the Expansion which 
                will increase the size of the world by around a third. Unfortunately, 
                though, if enough players refuse to leave their comfort zone (say, 
                bottom Guk) to head out and explore the Expansion and/or the revamped 
                older zones, the problem won't totally go away.<BR>
                <BR>
                </font>4) Verant has taken steps to lessen the impact of overcrowding 
                (Paw, Rare NPCs in open areas of zones that use to be un-utilized, 
                bumping up Kithicor's Level, and itemizing/populating Kedge Keep). 
                Does Verant think these moves (among others) has<BR>
                <BR>
                A) Fixed the overcrowding issue (assuming there was one)?<BR>
                B) Help alleviate overcrowding?<BR>
                C) Help it a bit, but still hasn't solved the issue?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>I'd choose B - it's helped, but many players 
                continue to stay in their comfort zones, choosing the path of 
                least resistance, and therefore continue to deal with the crowds. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                </font>Basically, I just think the people want to know your straight 
                answer as to whether or not this is the way the game was envisioned 
                and meant to be played in your eyes?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>No, the vision (as it relates to your question) 
                was that people would spread out more and 'do' a dungeon and then 
                move on, as opposed to repeatedly camping spots they are used 
                to camping. We will continue to address this issue as I've detailed 
                in this posting as well as brainstorm on better designs that will 
                hopefully alleviate some of this issue in the future (yes, that's 
                purposely vague).<BR>
                <BR>
                </font>Is Verant waiting to see how the Expansion "helps" overcrowding 
                (assuming there is a problem), and thus, REACT to overcrowding 
                issues, or are you going to PRO-ACTIVELY approach overcrowding 
                as a major issue and put into effect sweeping changes to alleviate 
                these concerns?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>I believe we are both waiting for the Expansion 
                AND pro-actively tweaking zones. We also just launched another 
                server. But as for 'sweeping changes', no, we're not going to 
                make any sweeping changes to EverQuest. While the game has some 
                issues and certainly its share of flaws, on the whole it is both 
                the game we envisioned as well as the most successful online game 
                of all time. Making sweeping changes to a successful game would 
                be foolish at best. That said, you have my commitment that we 
                will continue to address problems such as zone overcrowding (as 
                well as many other problems) both in the EQ of today, the Expansion, 
                and the future beyond.<BR>

              <blockquote>I give up, which one determines how often you hit? When 
                I created my pally I wanted to concentrate on Dex. so he can hit 
                monsters. <---or so I thought. My dex. is currently 140 and I 
                notice I still miss a lot. I have grped with warriors and other 
                pallies and I usually ask them what their dex. is so I can compare 
                how often we hit. Well I was grped with a War and he had 85dex 
                and he hit WAY more than I did!! I asked what he thought about 
                this and he said str. determined how often you hit and dex determined 
                how close the your possible dmg. you could do. Anyways....does 
                anyone know for sure?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Neither. Only your level, offense, and weapons

                <BR>
                STR determines max damage and average damage. Higher STR will 
                raise your damage cap, and will also increase your likelihood 
                of hitting closer to your max. The exception to this is Archery, 
                where Dex determines this.<BR>
                <BR>
                Dex determines how often a weapon will fire a random process, 
                and also figures into critical hits for warriors. It also figures 
                into some of the rogue skills.<BR>

                  of course 'Pus Filled Burgers'. After reading this I promise

                <P>I hear alot of comments concerning EQ's graphics throughout 
                  forums, some good some bad... mostly good. I am aware that you 
                  are a 3D modeler - so I am going to ask you ann unrelated texture 
                  art question. As a texture artist I often refer to EQ as a texture 
                  nightmare. What happened? Not concerning texture memory limitations 
                  -- this is some sloppy work. The character texturing is fair, 
                  but the models could have been unwrapped in a way to reduce 
                  or eliminate texture stretching. Were serious time constraints 
                  placed on the project?

            <div> This idea sent in from Meraxes Glibilskym:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote>OK i've been thinking out this since we tried our first 
                Guild raid on a dungeon and attempted to coordinate our efforts 
                with multiple groups.. As you know we have /say, /groupsay, /guildsay, 
                /ooc, /auction, and /shout...<BR>
                <BR>
                At the time we had taken over the OOC and asked those in the zone 
                to either turn it off, or please deal with it.. Some people understood 
                some didn't and argued for a while..<BR>
                <BR>
                The most recent trend is people removing themseves from a guild, 
                rejoining another for a hunt, then attempting to get reguilded 
                by an officer to reclaim thier guildtag.. This has two disadvantages.. 
                First some guilds don't like to see thier members with Different 
                tags all the time, since it detracts from the unity of the guild 
                (imagine your top 5 people all changing tags every week.. soon 
                the guild recognition would dissappear as would the trust of that 
                guild) 2nd is the simple attempt to get REGUILDED.. many guilds 
                limit the number of officers on at any given time..<BR>
                <BR>
                Here is my proposed idea:<BR>
                <BR>
                What there NEEDS to be in order for MULTIPLE groups to cooperate 
                is some sort of Cross zone channel which ANYONE can join.. something 
                like the current IRC way of making channels.. we'd type /Channel 
                BCK ON/OFF or /channel 3465 ON/OFF This would allow MULTIPLE groups 
                to coordinate thier efforts vs enemies such as Vox, Nagafen, Cazic 
                etc... It would also all for people to simply HELP others more 
                effectively if they are not even grouped..<BR>
                <BR>
                I'm not quite certain how exactly the chat portion of EQ works, 
                but i wouldn't be suprised if it was some sort if inhouse IRC 
                type client, and if so, it should be able to include that function 
                rather easily..<BR>
                <BR>
                Now: Several issues may come up such as:<BR>
                <BR>
                1) Effect of lag with more channels avaiable. I'm sure each channel 
                takes 'some' bandwidth but i can't imagine it being much.. perhaps 
                they limit the channel to a characters name, and automatically 
                removing the channel when they go offline, so long as people use 
                some sort of communication backup plan this shouldn't be a big 
                problem and would reduce the number of channels being left open 
                for no reason..<BR>
                <BR>
                2) Security on channels.. Well though it'd be nice to have to 
                'invite' people this would be more coding which i don't believe 
                is necessary.. all that would need to happen is people can IGNORE 
                the offending person, and POSSIBLY the 'owner' of the channel 
                could have the ability to 'make deaf' anyone who joins without 
                permission.. Again this is only a CONVIENCE and NOT a necessity, 
                the whole reason is to be able to communicate, not create private 
                chat networks..<BR>
                <BR>
                Please pass this along via, EMAIL, word of mouth, or NEWS SITE... 
                to get the word out to EVERY GUILD ON NORATH.. I can't imagine 
                that Verant can ignore such a request if it came from everyone 
                playing thier game.. They'd HAVE to attempt to resolve the communication 
                issue, especially since they created the issue in the first place 
                by requiring certain monsters to ONLY be defeated by the coordinated 
                efforts of MULTIPLE groups.. And in the case of the Plane of Fear, 
                thru multiple ZONES as well...<BR>
                <BR>
                Please contact Verant via: FEEDBACK and EMAIL at <A HREF=mailto:EQMAIL@VERANT.COM>EQMAIL@VERANT.COM</a><BR>

              <blockquote>
                <p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through Crushbone<br>
                  Not an orc was stirring, not even a train to zone;<br>
                  The newbie were camped by the wall with no mana to spare,<br>
                  In hopes that Dvinn would not stop by there;<br>
                  The throne room had filled up at last,<br>
                  While visions of getting a dragoon dirk arose fast;<br>
                  The cleric in her armor, and I in my leather,<br>
                  Had just settled who would go in further,<br>
                  When out in the tower there arose such a shout,<br>
                  I sprang from the table to see what that was about.
                <p>Away to the stairs I ran really fast too see,<br>
                  Tore through the groups and by those that past me.<br>
                  The moon on the chest of the new-fallen pc<br>
                  Gave me less comfort that something was watching me,<br>
                  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
                  But a big train, constisting of ten orcs, feasting on reindeer,<br>
                  And a scary leader, with an evil looking grin,<br>
                  I knew at that moment it must be Dvinn.<br>
                  More rapid than beggers, his orcs they came,
                <p>And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
                <p>Now, Orc Pawn and Centurian! Now, Orc Legionnaire and Oracle!<br>
                  On, Orc Slaver! On, Royal Gaurd! On, Orc Taskmaster <br>
                  On, Warlord! On, Crushbone and Lord Darvish!<br>
                  To the top of the table! to the tree near the wall!<br>
                  Now slash away! cast away! kill them all!
                <p>As dry leaves that before crushed by a foot,<br>
                  When they met with a daring group, they were mounted by root,<br>
                  So upto the helpless group the orcs would slew,<br>
                  With the train full of loot, and Dvinn too.<br>
                  And then, in a split second, I heard each of them repeat anothers 
                  grunts<br>
                  The sound announcing the approach of each of the little runts. 
                  <br>
                  As I drew in my weapon, and was turning around,<br>
                  Down the stairs Dvinn came with a bound.
                <p>He was dressed in maroon clothes, from his head to his feet,<br>
                  And his clothes were deceiving to those he would meet;<br>
                  A dagger he had in his hand, and gold there could be,<br>
                  And he looked just like another dark elf to me.<br>
                  His eyes -- how cold they were! His dimples how scary!<br>
                  His cheeks were like indigo, his nose like a blueberry!<br>
                  His little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
                  And the hair on his head was as white as snow;
                <p>The stump of a player he held tight in his teeth,<br>
                  And the smoke from the torches encircled his head like a wreath;<br>
                  He had a sqaure face and no real belly,<br>
                  When he laughed, only players shook like a bowlfull of jelly.<br>
                  He was skinny and evil, very good at being a dark elf,<br>
                  And I shivered when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>
                  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>
                  Soon gave me to know I had alot to dread;
                <p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to work,<br>
                  And slayed all those behind the throne; then turned with a jerk,<br>
                  And laying his hands to his sides,<br>
                  And to the table he came to remove more people of their hides;<br>
                  He sprang to the door, to his train gave a call,<br>
                  And away they slew all the way down to the wall.<br>
                  And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye,<br>
                  "Merry Cristmas to all - now your all gonna to die"

                around strutting his stuff.<BR>
                <BR>
                In his many seasons, he has slain many a denizen of this dungeon, 
                and his faction has made him most hated...yet he can walk right 
                up to the first mob thats green and stick his tongue out at them 
                and they do...NOTHING<BR>
                <BR>
                Is it me or does this not make sense to anyone else...How can 
                a Stupid MOB be he Orc, Gob or other do one of the following:<BR>
                <BR>
                1. Look at a person entering his HOME and not attack him just 
                because ..ooh..he looks to tough....<BR>
                2. Look at the same person who is a KNOWN MURDERER of his KIN 
                and not attack because..oohh..he looks to tough<BR>
                3. look at the same person again, and all though many of his friends 
                are around to help, not attack because ...oohhh..he looks to tough<BR>
                <BR>
                MOBs aren't that smart, and should attack all people..<BR>
                <BR>
                If Arnold Schwarzinegger <sp>, the Stone Cold dude, Clint Eastwood 
                (in his prime), or Rambo walked into my home with obvious ill 
                intent, there reputation would not stop me from ventilating them 
                with a few 45 .cal holes..<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Back in beta, creatures never considered level 
                when deciding whether or not to attack a given person. This lead 
                to people going into dungeons, and having to slay green creatures 
                up front in order to get to the good stuff at the back. It would 
                also cause a fair number of trains as higher level folk would 
                leave the dungeon and not worry about engaging all of the green 
                stuff attacking them.<BR>
                <BR>
                We changed this to allow the over leveled folk from having to 
                kill creatures that were there for the lower level folk to kill. 
                It also stopped the trains. Keep in mind that this isn't absolute. 
                Some things ignore level and will attack regardless. Others will 
                ignore level and attack anyone who is hasseling one of their friends. 
                Overall, the feedback we've received since this change has been 
                very good, as it has enhanced the gameplay for people of all level.<BR>

                When Abashi made his big long post about removed items, etc, he 
                used the example of Lustrous Russet accidentally being set to 
                all melees and now it was no longer dropping and that Indocolite 
                was correctly installed. Well, guess what? Phoboplasms on the 
                plane of fear can apparently drop any items that used to be on 
                the plane of fear. This means cryosilk, AND LUSTROUS RUSSET. So 
                either he was mis-informed about it, or he's blatantly lying<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Well I'm sure I never mentioned "Indocolite" 
                armor specifically, but I did talk about Lustrous Russet armor

                a quote, I might be able to comment on whatever issue it is that 
                you have. And though I won't comment on any specific item drops 
                by the "Phoboplasms", I will say that your statements concerning 
                its armor drops are incorrect. As for being &#8220;mis-informed&#8221; 
                or &#8220;blatantly lying&#8221;, I&#8217;m afraid I must ask

              Forum</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote>As I advance in levels, I've come to the depressing 
                conclusion that, in EverQuest, there is no measure of class flexibility.<BR>
                <BR>
                You guys at Verant seem to have a certain image planned out for 
                each the classes, and one is hard pressed to maintain this image 
                or else run the risk of being extremely weak and dying repeatedly.<BR>
                <BR>
                For instance, as a Magician, I find I am forced into the common 
                "Wussy caster" role. In battle, my tactic (and that of my fellow 
                magicians) will always be to sic my pet, sit back and do the ol' 
                mana-to-damage conversion.<BR>
                <BR>
                If I were to try to melee the creature myself, it would only weaken 
                my strategy - regardless of what equipment I had. Thus, forever 
                I am locked to the same repetitive pattern, with little to no 
                variation between my levels or between others of my class.<BR>
                <BR>
                I can obtain no equipment or skills which would allow me to take 
                my own path, to differ from my fellow magician without being superior 
                to him.<BR>
                <BR>
                My question is, is this intentional?<BR>
                <BR>
                If so, why?<BR>
                <BR>
                Wouldn't a greater amount of class flexibility give the game more 
                depth and allow for better roleplaying? Allow players to have 
                thier own drastically unique character while still maintaining 
                a class based structure?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Some classes are meant to be more flexible 
                than others, but within limits. Two good examples of classes that 
                aren't very flexible are the warrior and the wizard. One is pure 
                melee, the other is pure damage. Well, the wizard does have a 
                few travel spells thrown in for effect, but that's it.<BR>
                <BR>
                The magician is not much different from the wizard in overall 
                strategy. 1) Don't get hit. 2) Sling spells. All casters are going 
                to be a lot like this, but some have more strategies that they 
                can use.<BR>
                <BR>
                The enchanter and necromancers each have 4 or 5 different ways 
                they can fight, and circumstances in which one method is better 
                than another. There is quite a bit of strategy in playing either.<BR>
                <BR>
                But no, you will never be very good at melee and will probably 
                give it up after a certain level. This is normal, expected, and 
                intended, as strengths and weaknesses are paramount to class interdependencies.<BR>

              <blockquote>I know the GM's are different on each server, but it 
                seems to me the ones on all the other servers are a bit more active 
                in the roleplaying experience than the ones on EMarr, and I know 
                of many others who feel the same way. Just wondering why this 
                may be happening, maybe its just me and the fact i'm never in 
                the right place at the right time. Or maybe its due to a lack 
                of GM's on the server. Who knows? Anyone have any insight on this 
                subject?<font color=#a00000><BR>
                <BR>
                I'm sure EMarr is running the same quests as the other servers, 
                as I'm seeing their quest reports indicating it. One thing to 
                keep in mind is that many times no one will report the event to 
                a news site. I know that back when I was the Senior Guide on Vallon 
                Zek, we ran a ton of quests and events, some of them had over 
                80 people playing in them, and I never saw a post on a news site.<BR>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>There is a bonus to experience given 
                depending on how many in your group, but that bonus is linear. 
                You don't receive an extra kick of XP for having 6 people as opposed 
                to 5, other than the straight linear bonus. <BR>
                <BR>
                But I would like to take this opportunity to see if I can explain 
                exactly how grouping is more efficient. This will take a few assumptions, 
                but I think you'll see that it's valid in the end. My figures 
                here are very round, but are applicable in any situation.<BR>
                <BR>
                Suppose you have a warrior with 100HP, who can deal damage at 
                50HP per minute. Furthermore, you are fighting gnolls with 100HP, 
                who can deal 25HP's damage per minute, and pay 100XP points. Let's 
                say your rule is that you fight until 50% health then heal to 
                full before fighting again.<BR>
                <BR>
                Ok, fight 1. It takes you two minutes to kill the gnoll. After 
                the fight you have 100XP points, and are down to 50HP health. 
                Since you decided to rest to full health when reaching 50%, you'll 
                have to rest 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) before you can kill again. 
                Let's just suppose that you don't heal while in combat to make 
                the math easier. Your total yield is 100XP/4.5 minutes, or 22XP/Min.<BR>
                <BR>
                Now, let's try two warriors, same rules, same level, damage spread 
                equally. <BR>
                <BR>
                Fight 1: <BR>
                <BR>
                You and your partner take down the gnoll in 1 minute instead of 
                two, since there are two of you. The gnoll only was able to deal 
                25 pts of damage during this time, which, spread between the two 
                of you, puts you each at 87 health. Since you are now in a group, 
                the gnoll gave 110 XP instead of 100, but it's split between the 
                two of you, so you get 60 each. Here's the outcome after fight 
                1:<BR>
                <BR>
                Health Remaining: 87 XP Earned: 60 Time Elapsed: 1 Minutes<BR>
                <BR>
                After Fight 2:<BR>
                <BR>
                Health Remaining: 75XP Earned: 120 Time Elapsed: 2 Minutes<BR>
                <BR>
                After Fight 3:<BR>
                <BR>
                Health Remaining: 63 XP Earned: 180 Time Elapsed: 3 Minutes<BR>
                <BR>
                After Fight 4:<BR>
                <BR>
                Health Remaining: 50 XP Earned: 240 Time Elapsed: 4 Minutes<BR>
                <BR>
                Now, since you are both at half health, it will take 2.5 minutes 
                to rest to full health, giving you a total yield of 240XP/6.5 
                minutes, or 37XP/Min.<BR>
                <BR>
                Of course the actual figures will differ according to class and 
                level, but the principle still applies. If you group, you get 
                more experience, providing you take things harder and/or faster 
                than you could solo.<BR>
                <BR>
                All of that said, yes, some people like to group, others don't. 
                Regardless, EQ is and will remain a group-oriented game. Some 
                classes have been made to be more suited to soloing than others, 
                and if you want to get by through soloing exclusively, you'll 
                have to be one of those. <BR>

              <p>
              <blockquote><font color="a00000">Hello Dustin,
                <p>The players in question were not banned, they were suspended 
                  for 3 days for abusing a Guide. Abusing a Guide has always been 
                  against the rules, and the Message of the Day posted a day later 
                  was just to let people know that "Killing a Guide while Linkdead" 
                  fell under that rule.
                <p>As much as we would like to be able to quantify everything 
                  that could ever possibly be construed to be "Abusing a Guide", 
                  it's hard for us to do that until someone comes up with a new 
                  way to do it. In the real world, we've had hundreds of years 
                  to identify and quantify everything "bad" that can be done and 
                  write a specific rule for it. In EverQuest, we have to address 
                  new issues as they come up.

                about a previous statement where I said that the skill cap on 
                tracking was increased. It was. Druids, at release, had a skill 
                cap of 0 in tracking. This means that they could track, but had 
                a very small range. A while after release, the cap was raised 
                to 20, thus extending the range of the tracking skill.The majority 
                of emails that I&#8217;ve received say that tracking isn&#8217;t 
                very useful at the current skill cap, so we are thinking about 
                raising it again. Before we raise the cap, I&#8217;d like to get 
                a feel about what the druids out there think. 
                <p>Increasing the tracking skill cap will not only increase the 
                  range at which tracking is effective, but will also increase 
                  the likelihood that any particular creature will show up. We&#8217;ve 
                  received some input saying that being very good at tracking 
                  is sometimes more of a hindrance than help, because it causes 
                  tons of things to show up. 
                <p>Do any Druids out there care to comment? Should we raise the 
                  skill cap or leave it as is?

                to increase the cap to a level above bards, as to do so would 
                devalue the ranger. The bard cap, to be honest, is set too high, 
                but we'll just live with that. <br>

                the player was banned, those who assisted were suspended for three 
                days. However this rule was not in place at the time. I have recieved 
                many comments about this issue. I ask that you all please use 
                the message boards here and at <a href="http://www.everquest.com/" target="_blank">EverQuest</a> 
                To post your comments. Also please contact Gordon and Brad on 
                this. I can not post many of the comments I have recieved due 
                to the content but here goes:
              <p>
              <blockquote>As much as i love EQ i hate how Verant represents their 
                GMs as GODs and when one of them dies they call it abuse and ban 
                a person. not once have i read anywhere that killing a GM is an 
                abuse. there was NO SUCH RULE.they made it after a guide was killed 
                and banned our people for that. it is so damn rediculous to make 
                a rule and aply it to a situation that happened prior to that 
                rule even existing. it may be "cheesy" killing a link dead guide 
                but till now NO WHERE has it been stated that it was banable offence. 
                hell, when i was talking to that guide i was talking in character 
                to which she responded the same. if a high elf character is in 
                dark team lands they still should fear us. when they role play 
                hating trolls, ogres, and dark elves they should expect to be 
                attacked. i was talking to this guide "wenna" about her errogance 
                of being in lavastorm surrounded by dark elves to whish she laughed 
                in my face. the point is that, that particular guide chose to 
                role play therefore opening herself to our attacks. i dont care 
                if they say guides are not interested in attacking other people, 
                because that is a total BS. they do attack and kill players, only 
                they call it "a GM event", thus justifying it. when it is convinient 
                for them to kill other players they do so and have a justification, 
                when they get killed (and lose nothing btw) they lose their status 
                as GODs and their pride is hurt. then they ban those players involved 
                saying it was an offence. again, how can you aply a rule to a 
                situation that happened prior to such rule existing? i dont care 
                if you post this on eq.stratics or not, if you do it should be 
                in a cleaner format btw, but i want verant to get this message 
                and reply to it. btw, we asked GMs if it was a bannable offence 
                to kill a linkdead person, to which they responded "no". so how 
                is it that killing a linkdead GM any different? if GMs are there 
                to help people and NOT interract with them, then they should be 
                invisible at all times when they are not interracting with them, 
                rather then roleplaying (or at leasts that waht i thought) a character 
                who hated trolls, ogres, and dark elves alike. in the future, 
                you must post a list of rules before something happeneds so people 
                know that it is "wrong" to do such and such. how the hell did 
                we know it was "wrong" to kill a guide? tell me that please? here 
                is the quote from lead GM of vallon zek and please specify where 
                does he say it is wrong to kill a gm? was there a rule before 
                that EVERYONE saw and was made clear it is wrong to attack a GM? 
                i dont think so.
                <p>"...You are being suspended for guide abuse by killing a guidewhile 
                  link dead. I am very sorry I must do things like this but you 
                  all knew you were doing something wrong..."
                <p>i am very pissed at verant's unclear policy here. if you do 
                  not state what it is wrong or right before something happens, 
                  you cant ban our players later saying they supposetly knew it 
                  was wrong.

              <blockquote>The mask/guise allows an exploit in PVP! Evil team (DE,Troll,Ogres) 
                members cannot loot a killed player with the Mask effect on. This 
                has led to Masked pvp in Nektulos with no risk to the Maskers.<BR>
                <BR>
                The bug/exploit has been reported to Verant but no response has 
                been made. Seeing all the latest posts about the Mask makes me 
                wonder if they've read the /report /bug /petitions at all.<BR>
                <BR>
                Verant: Please fix this now!<BR>
                <BR>
                Thanks.<font color=#a00000><BR>
                <BR>
                I know that we are aware of this bug. We discussed it in the last 
                tuning meeting. I believe it will be fixed in the first patch 
                after the New Year, but don't quote me on that yet. I'll verify 
                it on Monday.<BR>

              <blockquote>We cant research the spell like any other spell.Its 
                not THAT great and clerics (who give xps back) dont have to make 
                a 12 hours (or more camp) to get their ressurect spells.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Adding this spell added tremendous value to 
                the necromancer class, in reference to their value to a group. 
                It also gives them the opportunity to make a ton of money and 
                get some good items. Rather than just hand out this extremely 
                useful *added* ability, we thought we'd have you do some work 
                for it. It's certainly no more difficult than some of the class-specific 
                armor quests.</font><BR>
                <BR>
                Summoning corpse is usually guide/GM job. Why do you make it a 
                pain for necro to get the spell while we do your job?<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Summoning corpses is only a GM/Guide job when 
                your corpse is inaccessible (e.g. in a wall) or when you've died 
                to a verifiable bug. It's not their job to summon just because 
                Vox is using your corpse as an armrest.</font><BR>
                <BR>
                Why do we have to carry the coffin? You dont ask any reagents 
                to clerics for ressurect, and ressurect is a much better spell 
                in my own opinion.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>1) We didn't want summoning to become "the 
                norm" and make it an easy way out. 2) It gave us the opportunity 
                to add a money sink.</font><BR>
                <BR>
                Why is it 10 weight??Im a caster and often overloaded due to my 
                70 strength(Im lucky to have 70, 60 is my base)<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>It goes back to not wanting summoning to become 
                "the norm", and no one says that you have to be the one to carry 
                it. I'm sure many people now keep a coffin in the bank just in 
                case. It's not lore, and it's not nodrop, so they can certainly 
                hand it to you.<BR>
                <BR>
                On another note, only 70 str? My necro has 90 or 97 depending 
                on how charismatic he wants to be Sounds like someone dumped all

                feet, modeling trees, more halfling babes that look german(?),

                this or that, at least that's how I try and validate their lack 
                of proficiency in using the English language. =)
                <P>Anyway, here's a direct gank from the page on increasing your 
                  physical size:
                <P>Milo, (note correct spelling on your name...extra credit points 
                  are due I believe) As I was running around the first level of 
                  Befallen, I happened upon a very strange site. A Dark Elf ran 
                  past me, towards the zone. In and of itself, that is not all 
                  together strange, I know, but I realized this particular dark 
                  elf was HUGE. As I also play a Dark Elf character, and was dwarfed 
                  by this giant, I became perplexed. Question: Is there currently 
                  a way to make your physical stature increase? If not, what is 
                  the possibility of this occurring? Would be a very nice option 
                  for something like, oh...off the top of my head, a potion of 
                  giant strength.

            <div> Thanks to Grint for this little tale! WARNING Extreme Length.<FONT color=green face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote>&#8217;Vinn,who lived in the tower, Did NOT!<BR>
                <BR>
                D&#8217;Vinn hated Orc-Mas! The whole Orc-Mas season! Now, please 
                don't ask why.no one quite knows the reason. It could be the campers 
                who camp him allnight. It could be, perhaps, his dagger blade 
                was too bright. But I thinkthat the most likely reason of all 
                may have been his Black Heart was twosizes two small.<BR>
                <BR>
                But, whatever the reason, his heart or his dagger, He stood there 
                onOrc-Mas Eve, hating the Orcs, staring down from his tower with 
                a sour,D&#8217;Vinn frown at the warm lighted windows below in 
                Orc town. For he knewevery Orc down in Crushbone beneath was busy 
                now, hanging a wood-elf-skullwreath.<BR>
                <BR>
                "And they're hanging their war-flags!" he snarled with a sneer, 
                "Tomorrowis Orc-Mas! It's practically here!" Then he growled, 
                with his Teir&#8217;dalfingers nervously drumming, "I MUST find 
                some way to stop Orc-Mas fromcoming!"<BR>
                <BR>
                For, Tomorrow, he knew......All the Orc Cents and Legos would 
                wake brightand early. They'd rush for their weapons! And then! 
                Oh, the noise! Oh, theNoise! Noise! Noise! Noise! That's one thing 
                he hated! The NOISE! NOISE!NOISE! NOISE NOISE! Then the Orcs, 
                young and old, would sit down to afeast. And they'd feast! And 
                they'd feast! And they'd FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!FEAST!<BR>
                <BR>
                They would feast on Elf-pudding, and rare roast Elf breast Which 
                wassomething the Grinch couldn't stand in the least!And THEN They'd 
                do something He liked least of all! Every Orc downCrushbone, the 
                tall and the small, would stand close together, with Orc-Masbells 
                ringing. They'd stand axe to hammer. And the Orcs would startshouting!<BR>
                <BR>
                They'd shout! And they'd shout! And they'd SHOUT! SHOUT! SHOUT! 
                SHOUT! Andthe more D&#8217;Vinn thought of this Orc-Orc-Mas-shout, 
                the more D&#8217;Vinn thought,"I must stop these green louts!" 
                "Why, for fifty-three years I've put upwith it now!" "I MUST stop 
                this Orc-Mas from coming! ...But HOW?"<BR>
                <BR>
                Then he got an idea! An awful idea! D&#8217;Vinn GOT A WONDERFUL, 
                AWFUL IDEA!"I know just what to do!" D&#8217;Vinn laughed in his 
                throat. And he made a quickInnoruk hat and a coat. And he chuckled 
                and clucked, what a great Teir&#8217;daltrick! "With this coat 
                and this hat...hmm...&#8217;aw Orc&#8217;s are dumb as a brick!"<BR>
                <BR>
                "All I need is a Pain-deer..." D&#8217;Vinn looked around. but, 
                since Pain-deerare scarce, there was none to be found. Did that 
                stop dark D&#8217;Vinn...? No!D&#8217;Vinn simply said, "If I 
                can't find a Pain-deer, I'll make one instead!"So he called his 
                pet, Crush. then he took some red thread And he tiedjagged horns 
                on the top of his head.<BR>
                <BR>
                Then he loaded some backpacks And small bags in a rush, on a ramshacklesleigh 
                and he hitched up old Crush.Then D&#8217;Vinn said "Giddap!" and 
                the sleigh started down toward the hutswhere the Orcs lay a snooze 
                in their town.<BR>
                <BR>
                All their windows were dark. Quiet Elf-whimpers filled the air. 
                All theOrcs were all dreaming sweet dreams without care When he 
                came to the firstlittle house on the square. "This is stop number 
                one," D&#8217;Vinn spat andhissed And he climbed to the roof, 
                empty bags in his fist.<BR>
                <BR>
                Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch. But for slender 
                D&#8217;Vinnthe trip was a cinch. He got stuck only once, for 
                a moment or two. Then hestuck his head out of the fireplace flue 
                where the little Orc warbannershung in a row. "These banners," 
                he grinned, "are the first things to go!"Then he Hid and he Sneaked, 
                with a smile most unpleasant, around the wholeroom, and he took 
                every present! Dwarven Axes! And Ring Tunics! Shiny BrassShields! 
                Belts! Screaming Maces! Slave Keys! Shoulderpads! And Whips! Andhe 
                stuffed them in bags. Then D&#8217;Vinn, very nimbly, stuffed 
                all the bags,one by one, up the chimney!<BR>
                <BR>
                Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Orc&#8217;s feast! He 
                took theElf-puddin! He took the Elf-breast! He cleaned out that 
                icebox as quick asa flash. Why, D&#8217;Vinn even took their last 
                jar of Elf-hash!<BR>
                <BR>
                Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee. "And NOW!" 
                grinnedD&#8217;Vinn "I will stuff up the Rack!"And D&#8217;Vinn 
                grabbed the tree, and he started to shove when he heard a smallsound 
                like the shredding of souls.<BR>
                <BR>
                He turned around fast, and he saw a small Orc! Little Trainer-spawn 
                Pawn,who was not more than two.D&#8217;Vinn had been caught by 
                this tiny Orc fodder who'd got out of bed for acup of cold water. 
                It stared at D&#8217;Vinn and said, "Innoruk, why, "Why areyou 
                taking our Orc-Mas Rack? WHY?"But, you know, old D&#8217;Vinn 
                was so smart and so slick he thought up a lie,and he thought it 
                up quick! "Why. My sweek little Pawn, the fake Innoruklied, There&#8217;s 
                an Elf on this Rack that won&#8217;t scream on one side. So I&#8217;mtaking 
                it home to my workshop, my sweet. I&#8217;ll fix it up there. 
                Then I&#8217;llbring it back here."<BR>
                <BR>
                And his fib fooled the Pawn. Then he patted its head And he got 
                it a drinkand he sent it to bed. And when Trainer-spawn Pawn went 
                to bed with itscup, HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree 
                up!<BR>
                <BR>
                Then the last thing he took Was the spit on their fire! Then he 
                went up thechimney, himself, the old liar. On their walls he left 
                nothing but hooksand barbed wire.<BR>
                <BR>
                And the one speck of elf that he left on the mat was a gobbet 
                even toosmall for a plague rat.Then He did the same thing To the 
                other Orc&#8217;s mats leaving gobbets much toosmall for the other 
                Orc&#8217;s rats! It was quarter past dawn... All the Orcs,still 
                a-bed, All the Orcs, still a-snooze when he packed up his sled,Packed 
                it up with their presents! The innards! The entrails! The hides! 
                Andthe bone sculptures! The kidneys! The heads!<BR>
                <BR>
                Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Steamfont, He rode 
                with his loadto the tiptop to dump it! "Pooh-Pooh to the Orcs!" 
                he was D&#8217;Vinn-ish-lyhumming. "They're finding out now that 
                no Orc-Mas is coming!" "They're justwaking up! I know just what 
                they'll do!" "Their mouths will hang open aminute or two Then 
                the Ocrs down in Crushbone will all cry Boo-Hoo"<BR>
                <BR>
                "That's a noise," grinned D&#8217;Vinn, "That I simply MUST hear!" 
                So he paused.And D&#8217;Vinn put his hand to his ear. And he 
                did hear a sound rising over thesnow. It started in low. Then 
                it started to grow...<BR>
                <BR>
                But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded angry! It couldn't 
                be so!But it WAS angry! VERY!He stared down at Crushbone D&#8217;Vinn 
                popped his eyes! Then he shook! What hesaw was a shocking surprise!Every 
                Orc down in Crushbone, the tall and the small, Was shouting! Withoutany 
                entrails at all!He HADN'T stopped Orc-Mas from coming! IT CAME! 
                Somehow or other, it camejust the same!<BR>
                <BR>
                And D&#8217;Vinn, with his Teir&#8217;Dal-feet ice-cold in the 
                snow, Stood puzzling andpuzzling: "How could it be so?" "It came 
                with out innards! It came withouthides!" "It came without bone 
                sculptures, torture or war!" And he puzzledthree hours, till his 
                puzzler was sore. Then D&#8217;Vinn thought of something hehadn't 
                before! &#8220;Maybe Orc-Mas, he thought, Doesn&#8217;t come from 
                a war. "MaybeOrc-mas...perhaps...means a little bit more!"<BR>
                <BR>
                And what happened then...? Well...in Crushbone they say That D&#8217;Vinn&#8217;s 
                Black Heart grew three sizes that day! And the minute his heart 
                didn't feel quite so tight, He whizzed with his load through the 
                bright morning light And he brought back the innards! And the 
                food for the feast! And he... ...HE HIMSELF...! D&#8217;Vinn carved 
                the Elf-breast!</blockquote>

              <blockquote>Sure, like Everquest and Ultima Online are fun, but 
                would you pay real U.S. currency to get imaginary items for the 
                games? Some people apparently have a little too much money for 
                thier own good.<BR>
                <BR>
                Case in poing: the six desperate people who have bid up to $1,500 
                for Ultima Online accounts on eBay.<BR>
                <BR>
                But that isn't all that's being sold for cold, hard cash at online 
                auctions all around the Web. If you're not a big spender, you 
                can buy clothes and other items for your characters at lower prices. 
                But be careful, it adds up really quickly.<BR>
                <BR>
                Just how much can you get for your money? As of October 28:<BR>
                $1 U.S. =<BR>
                0.598 British Pounds<BR>

                <BR>
                That's right, Everquest Platinum has a better exchange rate than

                army of PvP players on the server Prexus, we do not have a official 
                guild yet, but one is in the making. We just need more "|33+" 
                members, if you aply, your skills will be tested if we have a 
                member within 2 levels of you. Alot of the current members are 
                from UO, the Great Lakes shard. We had a guild called the Viet 
                Cong, led by "Ho Chi Minh". We are hoping for this guild to be 
                as feared as the last. Once again, we are not letting any fool's 
                secondary charactor in the game to PK with us once a week for 
                a couple hours. These are the MAIN charactors and will be played 
                3/4 or more of the time. My E-Mail is <A HREF=mailto:showtime@telepath.com>showtime@telepath.com</a>, 
                my in-game name is posted at the top of the message. I myself 
                am a 20th level wizard. Give me a tell or an E-mail if you think 
                you can handle a true PvP guild, and the first PvP guild of the 
                entire server.. </blockquote>

              <blockquote>I've suggested this long ago, but nothing really happened, 
                sure nothing will change but what the hell, might as well try 
                right? Ever notice that when u conn somone it ALWAYS says that 
                they are indiffeent to u when they a PC, even when they are realy 
                a jerk and KS, take loots, and generaly look out for themselves? 
                What if u could alter the way other players are viewed? For example, 
                u are grouped with someone and get a rare spawn and he takes some 
                great loot, disbands and leaves, another case of someone using 
                greed to get ahead right? wrong, u shout out, what happens, everyone 
                looks over, sees it is true, cons u, and it says "Is HIGHLY trustworthy" 
                conns your partner and it says "Might be a jerk" they notice u 
                are probably right and they get to do a "/acted like a jerk" on 
                the guy and now after a while of acting like a jerk if u were 
                to conn this guy it would say "is deffinitly a jerk". I'm sure 
                people would be intelegent enough to tell the difference between 
                roleplaying and really being a jerk. NOw u prefer to group with 
                jenuinly nice people, and motivate people to be nice so that others 
                will group. Maybe have factoin always going down and u will have 
                people always going out of their way to help people to maintain 
                a favoreable faction with other PC's. Wouldn't it be great to 
                have everyone going out of their way to be nice to get a nice 
                bit of faction? I'm sure there are easy ways to make sure this 
                isn't exploited, like only being able to give a factoin command 
                once a day and making it audeable to everyone so that if someone 
                sees 2 people exploiting factoin they could all do a negative 
                factoin on all these people to discurage this behavior, see how 
                nicely it would work to discourage all kinds of bad behavior<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>That's a nice suggestion, somewhat equivalent 
                to how auction sites give feedback options. I like it<BR>
                <BR>
                This is also one of the reasons why we require unique names on 
                the servers. It lets people earn their own reputation and they 
                have to live with it. <BR>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Hello there, I don't have any specific 
                comments right now, but I did want to let you know that there 
                are some very good thoughts here. Yes, I think we did underestimate 
                greed's effect on gameplay. We *hoped* that people would prefer 
                to "do" a dungeon, meaning fight their way through it, not just 
                run in to get ItemX. <BR>
                <BR>
                Many of the changes we are making now are to try and shape the 
                game back into what we (and the majority of the players) wanted 
                it to be at release, removing the influence of greed. Despite 
                some of the short term pain, I think we're making progress for 
                the long term.<BR>

                with people submitting those that they feel are deserving of entering 
                the Cazic-Thule Hall of Fame. Others on the server will vote, 
                thus selecting up to three members per month. (Note: Entries should 
                have nothing to do with time spent in the game. Anyone may be

              <blockquote>This is just a little diddy I wrote after listening 
                to Chris Rock's No Sex while waiting 40 minates for the Orge SK 
                to spawn in the befallen, only to be killed by various undead

                Ladies and Gentlemen of the Norrathian Class of 1999, I have one 
                piece of advice for you. No matter what a cleric tells you, there 
                is no good loot in the befallen. Oh, there's death in the befallen, 
                but you don't want death, you want loot. And there's no good loot 
                in the befallen.<BR>
                <BR>
                Don't go to GM events that are highly publicized. Sure, they may 
                be fun and all that, but think back to all the other big GM events. 
                You're gonna lag and the zones gonna crash.<BR>
                <BR>
                If a wood elf female tells you she's a female, and talks like 
                a male. She's a pubescent teenage boy. If a wood elf female tells 
                you she's a female, and talks like a female; she's a pubescent 
                teenage boy...that's spends entirely too much time in third person 
                view.<BR>
                <BR>
                Young Gnomish Men, if you're truckin' through Oasis and a sand 
                giant steps on your head...let it slide. Sure, they may wear funny 
                hats, but they only have a (1) in sense of humor.<BR>
                <BR>
                SOULFIRE. Ain't nothing wrong with that!<BR>
                <BR>
                No matter what you think of what I'm sayin', remember this one 
                thing-There is no good loot in befallen.<BR>
                <BR>
                (background)No loot in the befallen. No loot in the befallen. 
                No loot in the befallen. There's absolutly, positivly, no loot 
                in the befallen.<BR>
                <BR>
                If a newbie begs for an item that he shouldn't know about, he 
                has a level 50 magician. A real newbie is to dumb to know what 
                a paw of opella is.<BR>

                If a necro has a Dragoon dirk, he'll probably stab you with it. 
                If a rogue has a Dragoon dirk, he'll act nice, then backstab you 
                with it.<BR>

                Here's a horoscope for everyone: Clerics! Ya gonna die. Necros! 
                Your pets gonna die, then you're gonna follow. Warriors! Ya gonna 
                go linkdead. Bards! Ya gonna run the hell away. Druids! Ya gonna

                Some of the things I've sid may not apply to you(ahem-Asheron's 
                Call), some may offend you, but no matter who you are, you must 
                remember this one thing: There is no good loot in the befallen.</blockquote>

              <blockquote>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>>>>If 
                Verant were to let casters bind anyone, anywhere, the gameplay 
                of EQ would be greatly enhanced. For one, casters would not have 
                to wait for their tanks to return to the dungeon, creating much 
                less downtime and adding to the enjoyment of the game. In addition, 
                melee classes would no longer run the very high risk of being 
                killed while returning to the action, and being forced to suffer 
                an even higher XP loss than the caster.<font color="a00000"> 
                <p>This is a very old argument. I could talk about the fact that 
                  death is supposed to be inconveniencing. It&#8217;s supposed 
                  to be something that you really don&#8217;t want to happen. 
                  I could talk about how this design is just as inconveniencing 
                  for the casters as it is the melee types. I could talk about 
                  value added to druids, wizards, clerics, and necromancers who 
                  all provide post-death services to characters. I could talk 
                  about balance issues in regards to having it so anyone can die 
                  and be right back in combat 30 seconds after it happens. I could 
                  talk about a lot of things.
                <font color="a00000"> 
                <p>When it comes down to it, some classes can do things that other 
                  classes can&#8217;t. That is the simplest explanation I can 
                  give without going into how a change in bind would cause a dramatic 
                  shift to many dynamics in the game. Some people don&#8217;t 
                  play melee-types just due to this disadvantage. Other people 
                  don&#8217;t play casters just because of the fact that a caster 
                  can&#8217;t take a hit. It&#8217;s all a matter of personal 
                  preference. Is a given disadvantage too large for you to play 
                  the class? It&#8217;s up to you to choose.
                <p>
                <FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>>>>Second, why 
                can't Verant stick to their deadlines? John Smedley reported that 
                a new server would be up in early November. Of course, after we 
                make demands when the deadline has come and gone
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">We have had a tendency to be overconfident 
                with our estimations, and that is not intentional. Believe me, 
                with the amount of flack we catch when we miss a deadline, it 
                would be much easier to get it right the first time. Sometimes 
                though, schedules must be adjusted, and there is no way around 
                that. I should mention that John Smedley said that a new server 
                would be coming up &#8220;soon&#8221;, not &#8220;in early November&#8221;. 
                In addition to getting a rein on our overconfidence, we need to 
                be a little less free with the term &#8220;soon&#8221;. We are 
                working on this and you should see some definite improvement.
                <p>
                <FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>>>> What makes 
                it even worse is that Verant never bothers to inform us why they 
                have missed the deadline. . It is a known fact among players that 
                Verant consistently lies about their deadlines
                <p>
                <font color="a00000">As far as the new server goes, I told you 
                that we missed it, and I told you why we missed it: Someone that 
                needs to be here cannot. What else would you like to know? Yes, 
                we missed the deadline. I first said it would be up by the end 
                of this week, and had to move it off to early next week. But as 
                to the suggestion that we somehow had some malicious intent in 
                missing the deadline by a day or two at most, that&#8217;s just 
                silly.
                <p>I hope this clears things up.<br>

                mature, imaginative players who desire an alternative to camping 
                and farming. Not an evil guild, so much as a pragmatic one; to 
                be good or evil requires a certain amount of optimism, a belief 
                in theultimate victory of order or chaos. PKD will be a collection 
                of nihilists who sneer at the heady enthusiasm of the worshippers 
                of hate and light; those foolish and eager ones who will ultimately 
                suffer the same fate as the agnostics and atheists. The membersof 
                this guild will not so much worship Bertoxxulous as they obey 
                him with the grim resignation that there is no escaping his clutches.<BR>
                <BR>
                By forming relationships with other RPing guilds, for both teamwork 
                and terror, I hope to see PKD grow into a place for groupers and 
                soloists alike to find companionship and advice and aide, while 
                building a rich and complex roleplaying foundation for ourcharacters. 
                Though likely peopled by a majority of necromancers, all followers 
                of Bertoxxullous are all welcome, as are followers of other Gods 
                who can creatively RP their way out of whatever deities' clutches 
                they come to us in.<BR>
                <BR>
                At younger levels there will not be much contact between the various 
                races that may be members, in time chapters of PKD will be able 
                to unite, and great havoc may be wrought. And who doesn't like 
                wreaking a bit o' havoc now and again? Fellow RPers tend to really 
                enjoy it, and non-RPer's can't stand it... Simple math tells me 
                that the greater the number of RPing players, the greater the 
                havoc to be wrought. A laudable goal, no?<BR>
                <BR>
                A web site is being constructed, but in the meantime if you think 
                this may be a fun way to begin on a fresh server, please send 
                me an email and let me know! I'd like to get everyone up and registered 
                as soon as possible.<BR>

                <BR>
                Come one! Come all! If you are interested in tinkering or want 
                to buy tinkered items be at the Tinkerfest in the steamfonts near 
                the windmills! We will have the largest fireworks display ever 
                and other activities will be planned. December 26th, 1999 11:00 
                AM PST.<BR>
                <BR>
                Fellow gnomes come an hour early to discuss the following:<BR>
                <BR>
                1. Tinkered item prices. I don't wish to undercut my fellow Gnomes 
                when selling tinkered goods. We should discuss setting prices. 
                This should not however prevent us from discounting items for 
                guildmembers.<BR>
                <BR>
                2. Trivial skill items. Most everything is trivial to me now. 
                If I am asked to make items that are trivial I'd rather be able 
                to give the name of a Gnome who might get a skill improve from 
                the tinkering.<BR>
                <BR>
                3. Tinkering help. We could give each other tinkering help and 
                perhaps discuss a tinkering site since Gnomad's site is gone now.</blockquote>

                the game, and a working and obtainable? There are so many misleading 
                things about the FA, no one knows what to believe anymore.<BR>
                <BR>
                If Aradune is a ranger, why did he get to weild the FA, which 
                is suppose to be a paladin holy sword? Does that mean it's not 
                a holysword and open to other classes?<BR>
                <BR>
                Brad has made a couple of comments that say it is in the game, 
                and some GM's and guides have also said the same. <BR>
                <BR>
                Yet some people report smedly saying that its not in the game, 
                and also if you email <A HREF=mailto:eqmail@verant.com>eqmail@verant.com</a> 
                they will tell you that its not in the game.<BR>
                <BR>
                Also, whats with <A HREF=mailto:questhelp@verant.com>questhelp@verant.com</a> 
                Its like a blackhole of email. If you petition for quest help 
                in EQ the gm/guide tells you to send email there but no one has 
                gotten a reply.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>I shall attempt to clarify:<BR>
                <BR>
                1. The Fiery Avenger is currently NOT obtainable -- GZ and I are 
                working the new FA quest and we will announce when it's active 
                (sorry, no ETA).<BR>
                <BR>
                2. Aradune is neither a GM (at least, in the customer service 
                sense), nor a character I play. He is more a dynamic event/RP 
                character, representing the avatar of the god Karana. <BR>
                <BR>
                3. I do play a real character, a half-elf ranger, who is in his 
                mid-20s. No I won't tell you which server <BR>
                <BR>
                4. The Fiery Avenger is a Paladin-only weapon. The Fiery Avenger 
                Aradune wields was altered by Karana such that Aradune could wield 
                it (meaning it is an exception and is unique).<BR>

                Thanks for the game. Whether there is nothing to improve or everything 
                to improve, this has been an exceptional game to be involved in. 
                I have enjoyed every hour in Norrath and have met wonderful people

                Thanks for the increased responses from Brad and Gordon. It's 
                not been all we want to hear, but I have noted that some pretty 
                big questions have been stepped into. Knowing that we're heard 
                helps.<BR>
                <BR>
                Thanks for the efforts to continually improve EQ. There's certainly 
                debate as to which things were good and which were bad, but your 
                effort has been admirable. Everquest has continued to evolve and 
                will continue to, both good and bad. Thanks for the effort to 
                keep improving our world.<BR>

                That's it from me. Hopefully no one will flame through this thread. 
                Also, no rants from me till the next millenium. I'll be too busy 
                enjoying the season, enjoying my friends and family (both real 
                and polygonal), and too busy enjoying life (here and in Norrath).<BR>

              Brad made some responses on the <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EverQuest</a> 
              Message Boards.
              <p>
              <blockquote>Brad do you remember writing this? I wouldn't be surprised 
                if you didn't, considering where the game is going.<br>
                "Here's a key difference that some players are perhaps not seeing 
                since just about everyone is a newbie: it's what you wear that 
                makes you look different. If you want a crimson breastplate, you're 
                going to have to buy one or quest for one. You don't just arbitrarily 
                set yourself to any color. This way, you can have real pride when 
                you appear different, and when a high level player strolls through 
                the streets of Qeynos, people know he's formidable.
                <p>An example would be when I visit Norrath as Aradune - I'm garbed 
                  like a high level warrior (actually a paladin, even though I'm 
                  a ranger). I have emerald platemail and am wielding a Fiery 
                  Avenger 2-Handed Sword. I definitely stand out, and people constantly 
                  ask me "Where did you get that armor?" To which I typically 
                  respond that armor such as I wear is found in the depths of 
                  dungeons."<br>
                  - Brad McQuaid, Producer
                <p>A level 50 enchanter on Tunare recently posted this on our 
                  server message board - it sums up my feelings and observations 
                  nicely. note that these observations are in direct contrast 
                  to your aformentioned comments regarding character appearance.
                <p>"In a continuing trend of lazy coding Verant has added the 
                  Robe of the Ishva to the the new Paw which is IDENTICAL in appearance 
                  to the Insidious Robe (Enchanter robe from Hate). So instead 
                  of the high level enchanters wearing their nice deep blue robes 
                  as a badge of honor we look like level 30 people who have been 
                  to Paw recently of any mage class."
                <p>No one really wants the Crimson Robe (of Alandine from Cazic 
                  Thule - A GOD) anymore because it looks like the Robe of the 
                  Elements from the Solro temple. Monk (Shiverback) plane armor 
                  looked nice and retro newbie guild tunic until raw silk was 
                  added so every monk from 1-25 now looks like Wally (a level 
                  50 monk on our server). Druid green chain (Vermiculated) became 
                  the quest armor for rangers.
                <p>Whats next? Put Ykesha graphics on a rusty dagger? Put Purple 
                  cleric platemail graphics on some level 5 quest items? I guess 
                  I'll switch back to the Robe of the Kedge when I start seeing 
                  level 5's in Insidious Robes.
                <p>Qhue Oculorum, Master Scholar and High Enchanter of Tunare" 
                  Qhue is not alone. I'm a level 50 druid with full vermiculated 
                  armor (one of only 2 on our server) and I worked VERY hard, 
                  spent an *obscene* amount of time in the Fearplane and died 
                  incessantly (even losing almost 3 levels in one day) trying 
                  to get that armor *so I could look different*. Sure the stats 
                  are nice but the appearance was what really drove me. 2 weeks 
                  after I get my final peice (took me 4 months) I begin to see 
                  level 20-ish rangers running around in armor with identical 
                  appearance. People used to ask me "Where did you get that armor?" 
                  Not anymore. Everyone just assumes I'm a mid-level ranger now 
                  (even guides LOL!). So whatever happened to "it's what you wear 
                  that makes you look different ... This way, you can have real 
                  pride when you appear different." I never really had any complaints 
                  about EQ until now. Sure, there are lots of ways the game can 
                  improve and it has its faults but for the most part you guys 
                  are doing a terrific job. And given the depth and complexity 
                  of the game, a few faults and mistakes made are understandable. 
                  However, stating one thing and doing the opposite, or stating 
                  something that is completely false is not understandable. Yes, 
                  I realize your comments were primarily addressing the ability 
                  to dye clothing and obtain high level armor ala UO, but I don't 
                  think it takes a rocket scientist to see that the principle 
                  applies in exactly the same fashion.
                <p>As for saying something that is completely false? Both you 
                  and Gordon *explicitly* stated that "Druid tracking has had 
                  it's skill cap increased." uhm ... no. Better check on that 
                  one again. Sorry if i sound a bit harsh but this has been bugging 
                  me (and a ton of other people) for quite some time.

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> I think you have some very legitimate 
                points there, and our overall goal is to add more distinction 
                and variety to the graphics, not less, such that you can tell 
                even more about a player by his or her appearance. I'll bring

              <p>
              <blockquote>Can someone from Verant make a public and thorough explanation 
                on what exactly is happening with the supposed most powerful weapon 
                in the game... Fiery Avenger? The quest was too difficult to find, 
                as per Brad, so it is being rewritten by him personally. Any idea 
                when it will be available? Is the old quest still functional? 
                Do we know for a *fact* that it was never broken before and once 
                it is reimplemented can we please have it brutally tested first?The 
                reason I want a public expanation is because I've played a paladin 
                for the last 9 months and have not obtained our one true, allpowerful, 
                holy sword. It is the ultimate addition to the grandeur of the 
                paladin class and has yet to be obtained almost 9 months after 
                release! Yes, we do have the SoulFire, but mine has been banked 
                for the last 10 levels due to many other items (more easily attainable 
                I may add) being available for me to use. Quite frankly, I'm tired 
                of walking around with a Sprinkler that looks like a rusty mace. 
                I'm not a gardener for Smedley's sake, I'm a paladin! I want the 
                looks of my SoulFire in a weapon that is actually worth using!
                <p>Seriously though, please take a look at the Fiery Avenger quest 
                  and post something on its status. Us level 50 paladins don't 
                  have much left in this game other than questing. Give us the 
                  sword that was promised to us many many moons ago during beta.

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Back before the game was released, 
                the general consensus on the boards was that people shouldn't 
                generally be able to get from one corner of the world to the other 
                in a blink of the eye. It basically comes down to a fundamental 
                design decision, just like many other things in the game. Many 
                people think travel is still too fast. I guess it comes down to 
                personal preference and the delicate balance between game-play 
                and realism.

                them out?<BR>
                <BR>
                I get the feeling that it&#8217;s not the amount of time that 
                it takes that people find unacceptable, but the level of frustration 
                that comes from camping. Would that be correct?</font><BR>
                <BR>
                Because they're not the one's who have to do it, you are, that's 
                why<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Actually you&#8217;d be surprised how many 
                people we have here that are serious EQ addicts. If you walk around 
                at lunch or after work you&#8217;ll see a bunch of people playing 
                the game. I have a high level character on one of the Zek&#8217;s 
                that I built from the ground up, and he has a bunch of &#8220;cool 
                loot&#8221; that he ran across through the course of his journeys.

                I have seen time and time again where " GZ " has given advice 
                to the casters, allowing them to modify their stats to enhance 
                their playing abilities. What do I mean? Thanks to GZ judiciously 
                answering emails about magic in EverQuest, we have been able to 
                determine exactly how say, Charisma effects players. [ Higher 
                Cha = better pricing and more resistance to the charm lines as 
                well as better ability to charm/make factions increase ( harmonize 
                ).. etc al ]. What is lacking is the same information for melee 
                characters.</font><BR>

                <font color=#a00000>Geoffrey has done a very good job of keeping 
                the casting community informed. Maybe we should consider getting 
                our melee guy to get involved in an answer column himself? <BR>
                <BR>
                I'll wait until the melee guy gets well (he's sick... the plague 
                is going around here) before attempting to answer these. I will 
                say though that melee is really a bit easier to figure out than 
                the magic side, so many of the fan sites have pretty good descriptions.<BR>

                spell, which was introduced to the live servers yesterday. Therefore, 
                we have temporarily removed the Summon Corpse functionality from

              <blockquote>I don't know how many of you have had trouble with this 
                heavy fog, but I've got to admit its a bother to me, not to mention 
                the low level players. Now sure, Verant wants the game to a be 
                a challenge, but I would like to kindly request that the fog be 
                lifted in the Freeport and commons areas. I have stopped many 
                times to help a new player find something in Freeport, not that 
                I mind, but still, I know there are many others that do not find 
                a person to help guide them. Also, having the fog in West commons, 
                is very difficult for the lower teen players, especially those 
                still fairly new to the game. It is very difficult to avoid the 
                hill giants, and other dangerous creatures, since you are unable 
                to see them. Finding corpses, even more difficult. So please, 
                Gordon, if you read this, talk to Verant and see about removing 
                the fog where new and lower level players are common.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>There will be a patch to the Test Server soon

                in hearing how that works out.<BR>
                <BR>
                We still have the subject of weather effects on the table, we'll 
                talk more about it after we see how the changes to fog go. My 
                understanding is that people are more displeased with the fog 
                than the weather effects themselves.<BR>

              <blockquote>OK, this differs from server to server and GM to GM. 
                We need an answer as to what your official stand on this is. A 
                player notices his guards are getting killed by other players. 
                He decides to defend his homeland and goes and tags some more 
                guards and trains them out to where the others are being killed 
                in order to help them. What is it Verant? Is it ok to defend your 
                homeland like this or is this against the anti-training rule? 
                I never guard killed or trained guards but this topic is debated 
                a lot and wanted to know.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>The official word is that intentional training 
                is, in all cases, illegal. It constitutes subversion of the PvP 
                Switch (on the normal servers) and intentional infliction of XP 
                loss on the PvP servers. It is up to the witnessing GMs and Guides 
                to determine whether or not a specific instance is intentional. 
                I hope that answers everyone's questions.<BR>

              <blockquote>Abashi/Brad, please explain why it must be rare..<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Items must be rare for the same reason that 
                advancement is meant to be challenging. It is to provide a sense 
                of accomplishment and pride that comes from achieving a goal. 
                If everyone has an item, the importance and feeling of pride that 
                comes with owning an item is severely diminished. <BR>
                <BR>
                Imagine if you will, a server where everyone starts at level 50, 
                every creature has 1 hitpoint, all items are sold on vendors for 
                1 copper, and nothing attacks you unless you attack it first&#8230; 
                I really can&#8217;t see people playing EverQuest if we remove 
                all of the challenge. If powerful or cool items weren&#8217;t 
                rare, you&#8217;d never again here &#8220;Cool! Where&#8217;d 
                you get that?&#8221;<BR>
                <BR>
                Item rarity, and a large number of different items, has its roots 
                deep within EQ&#8217;s text-based predecessors (MUDs). It&#8217;s 
                fairly integral to the game.</font><BR>
                <BR>
                But now you have made the MOB that carries the item be a very 
                rare spawn as well! <BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>The way in which rarity is handled varies 
                by game designer. Either the spawn is common and the drop is rare, 
                the spawn and drop are semi-rare, or the spawn is rare and the 
                drop is 100%. People have commented at problems with camping, 
                so we&#8217;ve moved further in the direction of rare roaming 
                spawns with 100% drops. I guess it&#8217;s a matter of preference.</font> 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                Why not make it spawn every 5 minutes, always carry the tiem, 
                and make special items no-drop? This way the deciding factor in 
                my obtaining an item will be my level, my skill, and my ability 
                to play the game.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Some things are done this way, when we want 
                something to be very common, but require some time to go get. 
                One example would be the ice comet quest, which requires wizards 
                to run around and collect things. Certainly some of this is dangerous, 
                but the things they need to collect spawn very quickly and are 
                just lying on the ground.<BR>
                <BR>
                It&#8217;s all a question of whether we want the item to be rare 
                (e.g. attach a sense of accomplishment to obtaining it) or want 
                it to be common, but just require a little time on behalf of the 
                people who want it. We listen and make adjustments in the spawn/drop 
                rates to make people happy without removing that sense of accomplishment. 
                We have a tendency to make some items too rare, and we work to 
                correct it when it&#8217;s brought to our attention.<BR>

                Paw Enhancements, Patch Message and the Guise of The Deceiver. 
                Also, be sure to check out my thoughts on the Paw of Opolla- and 
                the High Keep Staff Segments quests.<BR>
                <BR>
                Here is a snippet of my discussion, regarding Class Specific Armor:<BR>
                <BR>
                Shamans have it bad where they'll have to kill the glacier bear 
                which is a very rare spawn (so rare people just log out there 
                characters in the cave and wait for a server reset to make it 
                pop again), not to mention Grizzleknot, in order to get their 
                totemic parts. Clerics have it bad as well, and as you all probably 
                know they made a demonstration on Fennin Ro (go Clerics!!!).<BR>
                <BR>
                Verant is probably looking over this right now, but I don't think 
                they know how to address it. Personally, I think that the level 
                of a mob should decide whether you will be able to get an item, 
                in this case being armor, or not. As it is right now, pure luck 
                determines your chances of getting that and that armor piece. 
                It's right down stupid, and it's so unfair to the players. Here 
                you'll have Bob camping a spawn for hours just to see Bill happening 
                upon a spawn and get the item imediately (just take the Paw Of 
                Opolla quest as a VERY good example).<BR>
                <BR>
                This is probably to reduce the amount of each item on a server, 
                but that serves no real purpose, does it? What's wrong with having 
                all, let's say, Shamans above 30+ wearing totemic armor? Sure, 
                all 30+ people were not wearing rubicite before the patch, but 
                I believe that all Shamans (or any other class for that matter) 
                should have an equal chance of getting an item, and having rare 
                spawns with strange randomizers does not lead to equality (the 
                person with the most luck/time gets the item). Sure, we're all 
                playing by the same rules, but people who can play more than the 
                average player should not have an upper hand against those who 
                can't. And, seriously, no one should need to camp something for 
                more than 30 minutes to get what they are looking for. Right now 
                it's like if I can't load off a good 8 hour haul of EverQuesting 
                I'll never get to see any of that armor.<BR>

                to demand respect and admiration from their fellow Norrathians, 
                and have done just that. There aren't many travelers on the Fennin 
                Ro District that don't know of the Sisters, and what they stand 
                for. This is likely what pains me the most to bring you this announcement.

                The Mistress of the Guild, Iolanthe Demonblade has journeyed on 
                toanother plane. Her last and most triumphant battle was fought 
                againstthe one thing that had pained her most in her life. Having 
                accomplished that final goal, her deeds in Norrath are done. She 
                has moved on.<BR>
                <BR>
                It is in Memory of her and her Sisters accomplishments that we 
                inviteyou to celebrate a night of nostalgic sharing and emotion. 
                Iolanthe,will be remembered for her strong leadership of the guild 
                and herunconditional support for her sisters. Lillith, will be 
                remembered for her incomparable passion and love for all living 
                things and her bright spirit. Another Sister has fallen as well 
                in these dark days, a Daughter of Officer, Kestra; Her dear sweet 
                daughter Sileas was slain before Iolanthe could stop the nemesis 
                that brought such terrifying danger to the guild. <BR>
                <BR>
                It is now that we ask you to join us in a celebration of these 
                greatwomen. Their strengths, passion and love for the lands of 
                Norrath.<BR>

                <A HREF=http://geocities.com/~brightblades/guildrules.html>The 
                Blade and Stars</a> is a young and energetic guild on the Karana 
                server looking to expand itsroster and have some fun while doing 
                so. We have several items we wish to raffle away. Here is a short 
                list with prices per ticket. We will raffle these items away even 
                if we lose money!<BR>
                <BR>
                Charred Boots: AC 6. Classes: B, C, P, SK, Wr. AGI+3, Fire resistance+5,poison

                <BR>
                We will also have wrestling competitions (hand to hand combat 
                with no armour or weapons), spell casting while looking good (basically 
                a fashion show to show off that cool armor you have), and LOTS 
                of FREE drinks. Larian will be giving away random items and platinum 
                whenever the mood strikes him. Other members of the guild may 
                also be in a wild and crazy mood too.<BR>
                <BR>
                Some of the things we will be giving away are Elm bows (rough, 
                smooth, hemp and linen string), Purple Sr. Apprentice Robe, Rune 
                of the Catalyst, Clay Totem, and whatever else we can gather between 
                now and then.<BR>
                <BR>
                We will also be handing out initiation tests to all interested 
                applicants. These initiation tests will be in the form of quests 
                based on your level. After you complete the quests, you will be 
                expected to complete one last quest while totally drunk (this 
                one is a secret!). It should be fun, and hopefully you will get 
                to know the members of the guild.<BR>
                <BR>
                If you need an escort to the gathering, Larian will be on line 
                an hourbefore the event is to start, so give him a tell. This 
                location should be easy for anyone on Faydwer to reach, and is 
                even practical for residents of Freeport. If you have any questions, 
                please feel free to contact me at my e-mail address or by ICQ 
                at 3437303. Also, visit the guild web page and fill out an application 
                (especially if you can't make it). Our web page is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/~brightblades/guildrules.html">http://www.geocities.com/~brightblades/guildrules.html</a>

                What was meant here is that there is an XP bonus for grouping,

                the amount of the bonus is dependent upon the number of people

                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>I feel like I am being blatantly quoted out 
                of context here. I have never said (nor will I ever say) that 
                there would be no further changes made to classes. What I have 
                said that all of the classes were essentially &#8220;done,&#8221; 
                AND that there would be no further large scale changes made to 
                any class. This was in response to individuals asking if we could 
                do things like redesign Bards so that they got double attack (while 
                taking away some of their song power), or make it so that all 
                robed classes needed focus objects to cast their spells. There 
                should not be any sweeping changes made to classes in the future 
                &#8211; no changes that fundamentally shift what each class is 
                good at, poor at, etc.<BR>
                <BR>
                We will continue to add new spells and items. No class will ever 
                be done, because we will always be adding things to them. Tweaking 
                is part of the game &#8211; and part of a dynamic world. We will 
                not announce when we put in NEW items and/or spells/song. Part 
                of the EverQuest is discovering new things. We will, however, 
                announce when we change existing things &#8211; something we try 
                not to if we can help it. <BR>
                <BR>
                A good example of this was the Guise of the Deceiver / Mask of 
                Deception. The Guise of the Deceiver no longer drops. All existing 
                Guises were unaffected &#8211; nobody who had one had anything 
                change for them. The Mask of Deception is a new item &#8211; all 
                future masks dropped will be of this type. Should the Assassin 
                have sent out a press release saying that he had a new item? Probably 
                not. If we had changed the existing Guise, should we have told 
                the players? Definitely.<BR>

              <blockquote>I've been a Designer/Producer for nearly 16 years, and 
                have five titles in Computer Gaming World's list of the "Top 150 
                Computer Games of All Time". I even designed and produced an RPG 
                a few years ago called "Betrayal at Krondor". (I'm not trying 
                to be boastful, I merely wanted to illustrate that I know a little 
                about games, and the industry.)<BR>
                <BR>
                EQ is an amazing accomplishment, and I would personally like to 
                congratulate the entire Verant team. You folks have done what 
                I always dreamed about: create a game that is so compelling the 
                mere anticipation of playing it makes people's day just a little 
                bit brighter. I know it has mine. (Like having a good book to 
                look forward to.) <BR>
                <BR>
                I won't deny that there are problems, things I would change, things 
                I would do different. But over the years I've learned that programming 
                and design are sometimes like changing the windshield wipers in 
                your car... and suddenly the engine won't start. It's more complicated 
                than many would ever imagine, so I, for one, am going to focus 
                on all the things I enjoy about EQ, and not worry too much about 
                the other stuff.<BR>
                <BR>
                Anyway, you have created something special here, and I just wanted 
                to say that I recognize your achievements. Thank you for the many 
                hours of enjoyment that I have had, and will continue to have, 
                with your excellent product.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>Wow! Thanks John -- I'll pass your message 
                on to the team.<BR>

                500 REAL dollars to be at the same powerlevel as the people that 
                happened to level a bit faster then me? God, this will teach me 
                to roleplay. My question is, Verant, why do you try and make this 
                a RP game at all.. Obviously its catered to the Quake player.

              <blockquote>What is the theory justifying removal of items from 
                the game in the name of "game imbalance" but allowing those items 
                to remain in the game for those who have already obtained the 
                item? <BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>We learned that except in the cases of extreme 
                imbalance, we shouldn&#8217;t take away items people have already 
                earned. You mentioned below how you were looking forward to getting 
                some items, and are now upset that you no longer have the chance 
                to obtain them. I understand that, but imagine if you one day 
                logged in and found an item that you worked for gone or no longer 
                usable. <BR>
                <BR>
                It&#8217;s really a question of the scope of the imbalance. We 
                tried twice before to remove/modify items that people already 
                had in game, and realized shortly afterwards that that was a mistake. 
                In short, these items are imbalancing enough that they had to 
                be removed. They were not imbalancing enough to justify removing 
                them from thousands of people who had already earned them.</font></blockquote>

                15 minutes later, they still had not respawned. Again, I know 
                this is much, MUCH slower spawning than ever before, because I 
                have taken my characters there as well. What is up with this Abashi?

                <font color=#a00000>Well, quite frankly it hasn&#8217;t happened. 
                Spawn delays of normal creatures have generally gone down to respond 
                to increased player load, not up. Sure, it&#8217;s possible that 
                some specific normal NPCs may have been upped slightly from time 
                to time, but overall, they are lower (read: spawn more often).<BR>
                <BR>
                The only time spawn delays are adjusted up (read: more rare) is 
                when an NPC has a special item that is coming into the world too 
                frequently, but this is rare. Our tendency, as I&#8217;m sure 
                many players will confirm, has been to error on the side of making 
                something too rare, then we have to go back and make it more common 
                later.</font><BR>

                Everywhere I turn in this game, Verant is screwing it up. I'm 
                getting tired of this crap that Verant pulls, seemingly at every 
                turn. It appears to me that Verant is doing EVERYTHING it can 
                to stop people from advancing characters, and for what? Like a 
                hundred other people have said, so they can hold the people's 
                credit cards hostage for as long as possible! <BR>

                <font color=#a00000>As I mentioned in another thread, there seems 
                to be this idea going around that the level of a player is somehow 
                correlated to their likelihood to quit. This just isn&#8217;t 
                true. Now we certainly want people to keep playing the game, to 
                say otherwise would crazy. However we feel that keeping our players 
                happy is the way to do this. It&#8217;s that whole honey/vinegar 
                thing.<BR>

              <blockquote>The time has come for Eala Tuathanas and Sunmoon Solusterra 
                to be wed!*cheers* We have chosen the beautiful Surefall Glade 
                as our venue. It is a short hike from Qeynos and should present 
                no problems as far as enemies along the way. The wedding will 
                be held at 7PM EST. We realize that may be a little late for our 
                european friends, but with the impending holidays, it is tough 
                to schedule convenient for everyone. Tunare has blessed me in 
                my travels through Norrath and I in turn will shower those blessings 
                upon my wife. That meaning, we do not really need, nor expect 
                gifts for us. *grins* Of course, any booze would be welcomed and 
                dealt with! So, I hope you all can share in our happiness and 
                join us this Saturday. As with the last Ranger event on Veeshan 
                (which gathered more than 100 of us) you can simply make a new 
                character on Veeshan if you are not already there. I have 5 excellent 
                Druid brethren available to whisk us around the world so that 
                you all may join us. Much as last time we will also try to organize 
                some fun events for us all as well! I encourage one and all to 
                attend this grand event. <BR>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> I certainly understand where you 
                are coming from. There are many dynamics involved in moving characters, 
                with or without equipment, and we've discussed both. If we allow 
                them to move with equipment, we run the risk of messing up the 
                economy of the destination server. If we allow them to move without 
                equipment, we run the risk of messing up the economy of the old 
                server (as they give away all their gear). 
                <p>In addition, there is also the subject of unique names. 
                <p>These are not necessarily insurmountable problems, and it's 
                  possible that it might be tackled in the future. However we'll 
                  have to see how our resources look after the expansion.

                thing. Killed all the goblins and waited. AND waited. AND waited. 
                15 minutes later, they still had not respawned. Again, I know 
                this is much, MUCH slower spawning than ever before, because I 
                have taken my characters there as well. What is up with this Abashi?

              <p>Gordon Responds:
              <p>
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Well, quite frankly it hasn&#8217;t 
                happened. Spawn delays of normal creatures have generally gone 
                down to respond to increased player load, not up. Sure, it&#8217;s 
                possible that some specific normal NPCs may have been upped slightly 
                from time to time, but overall, they are lower (read: spawn more 
                often). 
                <p>The only time spawn delays are adjusted up (read: more rare) 
                  is when an NPC has a special item that is coming into the world 
                  too frequently, but this is rare. Our tendency, as I&#8217;m 
                  sure many players will confirm, has been to error on the side 
                  of making something too rare, then we have to go back and make 
                  it more common later.

              <blockquote>Everywhere I turn in this game, Verant is screwing it 
                up. I'm getting tired of this crap that Verant pulls, seemingly 
                at every turn. It appears to me that Verant is doing EVERYTHING 
                it can to stop people from advancing characters, and for what? 
                Like a hundred other people have said, so they can hold the people's 
                credit cards hostage for as long as possible! </blockquote>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> As I mentioned in another thread, 
                there seems to be this idea going around that the level of a player 
                is somehow correlated to their likelihood to quit. This just isn&#8217;t 
                true. Now we certainly want people to keep playing the game, to 
                say otherwise would crazy. However we feel that keeping our players 
                happy is the way to do this. It&#8217;s that whole honey/vinegar 
                thing.

                If they aren&#8217;t available, I&#8217;ll find one of a few people

                on our server. It has been the general opinion of the this team 
                PvP community that PvP servers are neglected when it comes to 
                game play issues. I believe that Vallon Zek probably is dealing 
                with these same issues. So, we would like to get the broadest 
                opinion of both team PvP player servers through our informal poll. 
                So, if you play on either Tallon Zek or Vallon Zek (Not Ralloz 
                Zek). Please help us to complete this pole and give it a broad 
                sampling of public opinion. Come cast your vote on these issues!!<BR>
                <BR>
                When the poll is finished in one week from now, we will be forwarding 
                these results for the public to see. Hopefully EQvault will publish 
                these so the Team PvP community can feel that they have stated 
                their case.<BR>

                Loot on lowever level creatures is much higher than it was in 
                beta, and hasn't been negativly adjusted across the board since 
                then. Sure, maybe some individual creatures may have been changed, 
                but over all there is much more loot at those levels. 
                <p>Back in beta, come level 16 my character still didn't have 
                  all of his 12th level spells. When my current play character 
                  hit 16, he had more than enough money for all of his level 16 
                  spells, plus some items he bought. 
                <p>Yes, there is a drive to reduce the amount of cash in the economy. 
                  But most of this is at the higher levels. This is why you see 
                  new items added to the game, such as the weightless bags and 
                  gate potions, that cost a good deal of money. These have reduced 
                  the amount of cash in the world and the economy is getting better.

                My question then is, why did GZ blatantly and publically lie to 
                everyone when he said there would be no further changes to classes 
                - that they were essentially "balanced"? I mean, these are just 
                the nerfs we /KNOW/ about - it doesn't include all the masterfully 
                hidden nerfs that totally change the useage of skills/spells that 
                we don't know about until we get killed trying to use it.<BR>

                Lemme ask you Gord, if I may call you Gord, why do you guys feel 
                you can change a spell/ability from under our noses and feel somehow 
                justified that you don't need to tell us? Now the rumours of this 
                bard nerf just prompted this message because it got me thinking 
                of the justification behind my argument that we should be informed 
                of patch changes (all of them). I'm fairly certain that if this 
                nerf is in production, we wouldn't have been informed anyway.

                possession. It is not our practice to inform people about changes 
                to things that they don&#8217;t have. This is to be discovered 
                by the players over the course of their adventures.<BR>

                Though I know this question was spawned by the thought of changes 
                to some bard songs, and is moot since those changes didn&#8217;t 
                happen, I&#8217;d like to remind everyone that there is no guarantee

                We try to create an environment where people can feel free to 
                play the role they desire. The entire concept of role-playing 
                in a massively multi-player game has to be player driven, in the 
                same fashion as pen-and-paper games. We provide the rules, the 
                dice, and the history, and it&#8217;s the players that need to 
                decide what they want to do with it. If they want to go to MM 
                to get some XP and cool loot, that&#8217;s fine. If they want 
                to infiltrate the Castle of Mistmoore and lay those motherless 
                undead beasts back in the ground where they belong, even better.<BR>

                As for spoiler sites, and people who patronize them, they exist, 
                and can play the game how they wish. Use of spoiler sites is certainly 
                not necessary to complete the quests in the game, after all, someone 
                had to give those sites their information in the first place, 
                right? Some people get enjoyment out of solving the quest on their 
                own regardless of the reward, valuing the means over the end. 
                Others prefer the destination to the journey, and use those sites.

                <BR>
                Back in pre-beta, Brad published that the per-server target would 
                be around 1500. In late beta, this figure was revised to be 1500-1800 
                simultaneous users at peak times, though it should be stressed 
                that this number was for optimal server health. <BR>
                <BR>
                When we have less than 1500 at peak, game-play during off-peak 
                hours begins to degrade as there aren't enough people of given 
                level and race/class mix for everyone to enjoy the game to its 
                fullest. At over 1800, there are too many people on at peak for 
                the people there to enjoy the game to its fullest during peak 
                hours. But these are not hard limits, as the degradation in game-play 
                is gradual on both sides of that range. This is not to say that 
                some of the servers are not overcrowded (e.g. Fennin Ro), but 
                most of them fall within the target for optimal game-play.<BR>

                To do this would be very unrealistic. Each new server that comes 
                online doesn&#8217;t take an equal number of people at peak off 
                of the other servers. Look again at Fennin Ro, which hits around 
                2200 during peak hours. This server&#8217;s load at peak really 
                hasn&#8217;t changed since about 2 weeks after release. We could 
                add 20 more servers and I really don&#8217;t think Fennin Ro&#8217;s 
                load at peak would change drastically. Sure, it would decrease 
                a bit, but when we have a world where people are happy with their 
                characters and friend, people tend to want to keep them. <BR>

                When is Verant going to lock servers to people who don't already

                people trying to join friends online (word of mouth gets Verant

                Some excellent points indeed. I&#8217;ve seen many posts saying 
                that we should just lock down the servers so that no one else 
                can join after X number of people are online. That&#8217;s a fine 
                idea, until the person posting the suggestion tries to log in 
                as user X+1.<BR>
                <BR>
                Other people say that we should allow only so many characters/unique 
                accounts to join the server. Again, that&#8217;s a fine idea, 
                until we take into account that 5 times the number of people who 
                will ever play on a new server log in as soon as it comes up to 
                reserve their names or to just try the server for a few weeks.<BR>
                <BR>
                Finally, as you mentioned above, there&#8217;s the idea of locking 
                off existing servers to new accounts, and there are the problems 
                with doing that as you mentioned. Also, let&#8217;s not forget 
                that there is a certain amount of turnover on the servers as it 
                is, as people decide to leave the game and as new people join. 
                This is necessary to maintain a healthy environment. <BR>
                <BR>
                Even the idea of letting people transfer characters is no magic 
                bullet. There are many consequences to allowing this to happen. 
                One, and not the least of these is turning a bunch of server economies 
                to a huge artificial economy the likes of which the world has 
                never seen. <BR>
                <BR>
                Now back to the underlying question at hand, I should have information 
                based upon the next new server by early next week. <BR>

              <blockquote>There will be an event on the Povar sever December 18th 
                1999 from 5pm to 7pm pacific time. The event is being run by the 
                guild Enchanted Circle. The event is, Adopt-A-Newbie. Members 
                of our guild will adopt 3 to 5 players levels 1-8 and help them 
                form hunting parties. The mentor of each hunting party will provide 
                buffs, and protection. All the members of this guild are enchanters. 
                This is an excellent opportunity for young enchanters to learn 
                from those who have some experience in the arts. This event will 
                cover four zones. Qeynos Hills, East Commons, Greater Faydark, 
                and Nektulos Forest. Any and all races and classes are welcome 
                to come out and join in with the others that might benefit from 
                this event. The Povar guild master is Danil. If you type /who 
                all Enchanted you will get a list of all the members that are 
                currently on and what zones they are in. Contact one of us to 
                sign up for the event. Good hunting, and good gaming.</blockquote>

                ARCH MAGE REVEALS THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE<BR>
                <BR>
                One of the most popular new features of the EverQuest Web site 
                is the "ARCH MAGE ANSWERS" column, where the Arch Mage Geoffrey 
                (a high-level character and one of the game designers at Verant 
                Interactive) answers EverQuestions.<BR>
                <BR>
                Here are some examples:<BR>
                <BR>
                Q: When I party, how much experience does a pet take from my group?<BR>
                <BR>
                A: When you group, the pet takes a minimal to zero experience 
                share from your party. This is different from soloing - when you 
                solo, your pet does take a percent of the experience that you 
                would ordinarily have gotten.<BR>
                <BR>
                On average, a pet will take about a .5 to 1 (out of 100) percent 
                party experience share. From personal summoning experience, a 
                pet is always worth having in a group if you are in an environment 
                that is pet friendly.<BR>
                <BR>
                Q: Why are there no Bard Songs for Bard levels 39, 45, 47 and 
                49?<BR>
                <BR>
                A: When we were finishing up the Bard class, we wanted to leave 
                some room for expansion during the evolution of EverQuest. Because 
                Bards get one song per level, if we had given them all fifty songs 
                there would have been no room for expansion - aside from taking 
                away older songs.<BR>
                <BR>
                Expect to see new songs coming soon. These songs will not be anything 
                that radically redefines the Bard class - but they will be additions 
                that help keep the Bard interesting at high levels.<BR>
                <BR>
                CHRON X SPECIAL OFFER FOR EQ PLAYERS<BR>
                <BR>
                A new Antarctic trainer mission has been added to Chron X. It 
                may be the most challenging mission yet. Few have successfully 
                completed it. If you want to be successful, you'll need a great 
                collection of cards and all the information you can pull out of 
                the "Core," the Chron X chat room.<BR>
                <BR>
                Think you're up to the challenge? Now's the time to find out. 
                The Station is currently offering FREE Chron X Registration to 
                all EverQuest players. That gets you 120 Chron X cards, access 
                to tournament play with CASH prizes and the ability to buy, sell 
                and trade your cards online with other players. Normally a $9.95 
                value, we are offering this to EverQuest players for free until 
                December 31st, 1999.<BR>
                <BR>
                The futuristic world of Chron X is a dark urban battle zone. You 
                lead your elite cadre of uniquely powerful agents into virtual 
                combat with powerful enemies worldwide. Like other collectible 
                card games, your movements are determined by the cards you hold... 
                but Chron X cards are digital property, so you can purchase, sell 
                and trade cards online, any time of the day...or night.<BR>
                <BR>
                Chron X has no monthly or per game charges, and with this special 
                offer you can get started with a complement of 120 deadly cards. 
                If you love EverQuest, you should try the game that has been nominated 
                for ONLINE GAME OF THE YEAR two years in a row by The Duelist 
                Magazine. Don't forget, this free offer ends with the millennium!<BR>

                is ONLY wearable -- and thus usable -- by Bards and Rogues. That 
                wouldn't affect me, as I am what some people call a Rogue (personally, 
                I prefer the term Adventurer). I would be able to wear it and 
                use it without problem, except for one thing: IT'S NOT WEARABLE 
                BY GNOMES!WHY were Gnomes excluded from being able to wear the 
                mask? It's not a size issue, as Dwarven and Halfling Rogues can 
                wear it -- both small races. It's not a profession issue as Gnomes 
                can be Rogues.<BR>
                <BR>
                I just don't understand the logic behind excluding an otherwise

                our professional... *ahem* activities with greater ease.<BR>

              <blockquote>To make a greater statement and to emphasize the completion 
                of the petition regarding the spell effectiveness cap there will 
                be a sit-in this Saturday (December, 11 1999) from 7-10PM PST 
                on the Mithaniel Marr. All wizards and people who support this 
                petition and wizards in general are invited to create a Human 
                (the face with the eye-patch) in Freeport and attend the sit-in 
                at West Freeport Gate. We will talk about exactly what it is that 
                has upset us so much as well as the petition and other issues. 
                The leaders of this sit-in will be very apparent and I will personally 
                be there as the first of us comes to the gates. I ask that because 
                there is the possibility of there being so many of us that everyone 
                speaks as little as possible and that those attending keep the 
                OOC, auction, and shout channels clutter free as much as possible. 
                There will be times when the leader may ask you to voice your 
                opinions or for specific persons to relate something that happened 
                to them regarding the cap or other problems. Please follow our 
                instructions. I may ask that we all cast our shield spell a time 
                or two so have it memorized. Things may get a bit choppy so hang 
                in there. I hope this will be a good demonstration of our resolve. 
                We like our Wizards. We just don't want to useless to a group, 
                or accepted in out of pity which seems to be more and more the 
                case. Following are some of the complaints voiced by a majority 
                of wizards.<BR>
                <BR>
                1. Change the level modifier/resistance cap from 1.2 to 1.5 or 
                remove it all together (this would assist ALL spell casting classes).<BR>
                <BR>
                2. We should not have to depend completely on having an enchanter 
                in the party every time we group in order for our spells to land 
                on things. Possibly wizards should have some way of lowering resistance, 
                whether that be a VIABLE item or a line of spells. Ultimately 
                enchanters are the best at this and therefore because the Wizard 
                studies destructive forces and travel so single-mindedly they 
                should not be quite as effective. Perhaps a slight reduction of 
                the curve by which things higher than us are more resistant regardless 
                of their resistance scores is in order. Or, perhaps better personal 
                protection spells.<BR>
                <BR>
                3. Lastly remove the lower level nerf. You all know that low monsters 
                resist is meant to prevent kill stealing. Verant has treated this 
                concern with the group damage patch and as such it has out stayed 
                its viability. <BR>
                <BR>
                PS. As a side note many would also like to see three verities 
                of DD every level analogous to mage elemental pets. This again 
                though is wishful thinking, I must say if we are to push for this 
                or any other auspices it must come after we address our initial 
                concerns.<BR>
                <BR>
                Remember, these are merely points that will be brought up for 
                discussion at the sit-in. The main point of this rally is to put 
                a little force behind the petition. The other items are important 
                as well. We want Verant to notice.</blockquote>

                Have you always wondered about all those guilds out there? Ever 
                wondered how difficult it would be to become a member but were 
                afraid to ask? Now is your chance. Maybe you just want to get 
                to know more of your neighbors? Now is your chance! <BR>
                <BR>
                There are many great guilds out there and many players that are 
                unaware how to call on these guilds for either help or membership. 
                The Druid Council is sponsoring a Guild Fair where all guilds 
                can come together and either recruit new members or just make 
                themselves known. We are asking for all Rathe Guilds to attend 
                and during the fair will ! be asked to announce their charter, 
                membership requirements, web address and perhaps share some of 
                their activities. If a guild would like to sponsor a newbie event 
                or a contest of sorts, this would be very welcome. Our follow 
                up fairs over the next month will be in Misty Thicket and Greater 
                Fey. <BR>
                <BR>
                Guild Representatives should be ready to provide these things, 
                please either have them macro'd or be ready to type it quickly: 
                <BR>
                Your guild's charter, <BR>
                Whether or not you are actively recruiting, <BR>
                How you recruit (quests and such), <BR>
                Any Guild web links, <BR>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> My use of the term 'vocal minority' 
                was not meant to be negative -- in context it was simply my attempt 
                to explain that the players who post on the internet don't necessarily 
                represent everyone (but, of course, many times they do). 
                <p>Clearly, posters are 'vocal', and clearly based on the volume 
                  of posts related to EverQuest when compared to the now 160,000 
                  players, only a minority post. 
                <p>But, as players on this thread have noted, the various EQ message 
                  boards on the Internet are VERY important to us and we get a 
                  LOT of our feedback, suggestions, etc. from all of you. It's 
                  also where we post and is one of our key means by which to communicate

                <BR>
                If you are a cable modem user, you probably notice times when 
                you are unable to access web sites, receive email or use instant 
                messaging. These service interruptions sometimes develop from 
                problems with downstream routers and websites, and may also be 
                due to problems in the cable lines, or perhaps even network congestion 
                because of high utilization in your region. Calling your cable 
                service provider may help, but you will almost certainly have 
                to wait on hold for a long time. Your service provider may also 
                request that you submit a "log" of times your service was out. 
                That's where <A HREF=http://www.cabletraffic.com/>CableTraffic&#8482;</a> 
                comes in!<A HREF=http://www.cabletraffic.com/>CableTraffic&#8482;</a> 
                automatically maintains the log, and will verify its accuracy 
                in 2 directions*. This log may even help you to obtain refunds 
                for service you are not receiving, and lead to improved cable 
                modem service.</blockquote>

                at Verant, yourself included, that have ranged from Smedley's 
                "a new server will be brought up here very soon" a month ago, 
                to your "a new server is on order" yesterday.One server will do 
                nothing to address the huge problem of server overcrowding, and 
                with Christmas coming soon, the servers will definitely be overcrowded 
                even more.<BR>
                <BR>
                Does Verant care enough to address this issue properly, with 3-5 
                new servers before Christmas, (and then one per month until server 
                load has stabilized at acceptable levels), will Verant continue 
                to ignore this issue as they have so far, or will Verant simply 
                try to gloss over the issue because they don't want to spend the 
                money to return the servers to acceptable levels?<BR>

                Congrats on your new position. I am glad to see Verant has put 
                a person in charge of bringing user issues before the dev team 
                / management team, etc. I hope this will go far to improve communication 
                with Verant and the players.<BR>
                <BR>
                There are a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but the one 
                I'd like to bring to your attention in this thread is the new 
                class quest armor. For the record, I play a Dark Elf Cleric, and 
                I was thrilled to see that new quests would be available to me 
                (DE Clerics don't have a lot of quests - actually zero for them 
                specifically). I'm sure a lot of other classes have the similar 
                complaints, so I'm not just talking about the Cleric armor (and 
                Caduceus) quests, but it is the only class armor I can comment 
                on in specifics.<BR>
                <BR>
                When Brad talked about removing Rubicite from the game, one of 
                the reasons mentioned was to reduce camping. Herein is the problem 
                I'd like to address. The Cleric armor (and others) requires a 
                lot of camping! Two items in Kithicor spawn once every 7-8 hours 
                and require you to sit and watch one spot for it to appear. I 
                have to admit a bit of luck in that I logged out near the item 
                and logged in right after the servers came back up from a patch 
                to get these items. This isn't really questing, it's more finding 
                the loophole in the system! Also, many of the other items require 
                camping a rare spawn in order to get the item. These creatures 
                (Babinsport, Bilge, Gull for some) spawn once every 7-8 hours, 
                and also have placeholders! So what happens is that you end up 
                sitting in an area camping, waiting for the rare spawn to appear. 
                To make matters worse, some quest NPCs are also dropping good 
                non-quest items, or quest items for other classes, making them 
                very heavily camped. Also, they tend to appear in areas where 
                there isn't a whole lot else to do. Babinsport for one, spawns 
                in Befallen, and there's not a lot to do for a 35th level character 
                in Befallen.<BR>
                <BR>
                So, My point is that camping hasn't really been reduced, just 
                spread out. What would I like to see? I would like to see someone 
                address and comment on this issue. If the intent was to spread 
                out the camps so that everyone isn't sitting in Cazic Thule, that's 
                one thing. But a lot of people (myself included) were under the 
                impression that the quests were suppose to reduce camping entirely. 
                Could you or someone else comment on the rare spawns in the class 
                armor quests? Were they intentional? Were they supposed to reduce 
                camping times or just spread it out? Will they be changed? Are 
                we just being stupid and doing something wrong? <BR>
                <BR>
                All the classes have issues with the stats for the armor, and 
                I personally don't want to go there. I just want to know what 
                is the theory behind the camping for these items. I sat and camped 
                the Troll SK in befallen to get a BBC and I really hated camping! 
                I would love to get my class armor, but I know I won't, because 
                of the camping involved. Thank you for your time and attention.<BR>
                <BR>
                <font color=#a00000>We are aware of some disparities regarding 
                the difficulty of obtaining some of the class specific armor.

                I wanted to make a short post in regards to my role here at Verant. 
                My focus here is to keep the public informed as to the state of 
                EverQuest and address issues as they arise in the public forum.<BR>
                <BR>
                As a result of this I can expect to get a lot of email with concerns 
                and suggestions about the game. Though I do read and appreciate 
                this mail and take issues contained in them to the development 
                team, I'm not going to be able to respond to everyone individually. 
                As much as I would like to be able to answer everyone, I can be 
                more effective when addressing these issues publicly.<BR>
                <BR>
                Thank you for understanding.<BR>

                I apologize for the delay. Below you&#8217;ll find the updated 
                &#8220;Change List Since Release&#8221; based upon your replies 
                to the first draft. Before we get into that though, I&#8217;d 
                like to talk a bit about the types of things that you can expect 
                to see on it. <BR>
                <BR>
                I think that Brad fairly well established in his last post the 
                need for change in a game such as this. In fact, nearly every 
                publication relating to EverQuest makes reference to Norrath being 
                a dynamic (read: changing) world. Changes have to happen in a 
                game like this to keep things working correctly. Rather than debate 
                the merits of changes in general, I&#8217;d like to discuss some 
                of the issues posted in the thread in reference to the way this 
                list is compiled:<BR>
                <BR>
                Bug Fixes Listed as Enhancements<BR>
                <BR>
                Rather than leaving this list a true &#8220;Enhancement vs. Nerf&#8221; 
                list, we&#8217;ve modified it to consist of &#8220;Changes to 
                the game and their effect on gameplay from the player&#8217;s 
                perspective.&#8221; The main reason behind this is that many bug 
                fixes that have been done have been called &#8220;nerfs&#8221; 
                if they result in the player no longer being able to do something 
                they once were able to do. A good example of this is when high 
                level pets (39+) were weakened. This change was made because the 
                original data entered into the system was entered incorrectly. 
                It was in every sense a bug, but when fixed, it was deemed a nerf. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                Item and NPC Changes<BR>
                <BR>
                New items come into the game and old items are taken out. Some 
                items might come out to make room for a new one, while others 
                might come out due to a balance issue associated with it. We&#8217;ve 
                learned that it&#8217;s not right to change existing items in 
                a negative manner. Some of you might remember Lustrous Russet 
                Armor, and how we made the mistake of changing the class restrictions 
                on that existing item. These particular items were always meant 
                to be &#8220;Warrior only&#8221;, however it was wrong for us 
                to take it away from those who had it. Another example would be 
                the change to the weight reduction on the Box of Abu&#8217;kar. 
                Even though the weight reduction on this box was a bug, it was 
                wrong for us to change an item that people already had. <BR>
                <BR>
                Even though we try very hard not to change existing items, sometimes 
                it&#8217;s necessary due to a large imbalance. One example would 
                be the stat increases made to the Armor of Ro, and another would 
                be the problem with the Treant Fists that contained unlimited 
                charges of Complete Heal. But this is a rare occurrence. Our preference 
                when changing these items is to replace them with a new item of 
                a different name. That way everyone who worked for the old item 
                does not lose anything due to the change. <BR>
                <BR>
                NPCs are much like items in that they change constantly. They 
                are routinely added and removed from the world, their stats are 
                adjusted, and their loot pool changes. <BR>
                <BR>
                In both cases, we typically will not be announcing it. Norrath 
                is a world where people are meant to figure things out on their 
                own. Just because &#8220;Bob the Paladin&#8221; was level 20 and 
                dropped the Holy Sword of Reverence yesterday in East Commons 
                doesn&#8217;t mean that he won&#8217;t be level 40 and drop the 
                Shield of Holy Protection tomorrow in Lesser Faydark. I&#8217;ve 
                seen people ask, &#8220;How do we know that the loot/the NPC has 
                changed?&#8221;, and I&#8217;m forced to ask, &#8220;How did you 
                know what it was in the first place?&#8221;. <BR>
                <BR>
                In the list below, we noted the removals of Rubicite, the Manastone, 
                and the Box of Abu&#8217;Kar. In the future, it will really be 
                atypical for these types of things to be announced in advance. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                &#8220;Change X is listed as a plus, it&#8217;s obviously a minus&#8221;<BR>
                <BR>
                There will no doubt be some disagreement as to the effect of a 
                particular change on gameplay in general. For instance, I&#8217;m 
                looking at the list now, and I see &#8220;Boil Blood replaced 
                with Dooming Darkness&#8221; listed as a minus under the Shadowknight 
                class. I personally disagree greatly with this especially considering 
                the recent upgrades to Dooming Darkness. <BR>
                <BR>
                Of course this disagreement is inevitable. It&#8217;s nearly impossible 
                to get a group of 150,000+ people to agree unanimously with a 
                change. Perhaps the closest thing we&#8217;ve seen as far as a 
                change in the game would be the addition of Clarity, though I 
                imagine some people think this spell should have been added to 
                more classes. <BR>
                <BR>
                Missing Changes<BR>
                <BR>
                There is actually a number of changes that are noted in the thread 
                that did not end up in this list. Many of them just didn&#8217;t 
                occur, or didn&#8217;t occur during release. For instance, I&#8217;ve 
                seen several comments in regards to Corpse Bomb and Umbral Messenger 
                being removed from the game. These were both taken out during 
                beta. Some of the other things, such as &#8220;Meditation speed 
                reduced&#8221; are just plain false. The effect of meditation 
                and the amount of time that it takes to regenerate mana has been 
                changed or enhanced a few times, but in no direction but up. I 
                imagine what may have happened is that some people may have gotten 
                some new gear and forgot to take that into account. When my necromancer 
                puts on his +INT gear, he&#8217;s got to meditate nearly 2 bubbles 
                before being at full mana again. <BR>
                <BR>
                This is not to say I didn&#8217;t genuinely miss a change or two 
                while compiling the list. It is very possible that I may have 
                missed some, and will add them as I become aware of them.<BR>
                <BR>
                Plans for the Future<BR>
                <BR>
                One of my first goals here at Verant is to increase the amount 
                of information provided to the public as part of the patch message. 
                It&#8217;s not just the patch message either, it&#8217;s all communications 
                that come from us. In the near future, I plan on bringing a list 
                of goals to the public, goals that we here at Verant will strive 
                to reach. No one here will try to tell you that there is no room 
                for improvement in our communications. If the level of our communications 
                were perfect, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t have been brought on. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                But these changes will not happen overnight, and for those of 
                you are willing to hang in there with us we are very appreciative, 
                and we sincerely apologize to those we&#8217;ve missed.<BR>
                <BR>
                Thank you,<BR>

            <div> Marckus FyreStryke of the Full Circle wrote to us:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote>Hello, all! We are the Full Circle, known far and wide 
                for our heroic and unselfish deeds. We have been in existence 
                since shortly after the Beta Era, when we were founded by the 
                legendary rangers Alendar and Yores. The Full Circle was Norrath's 
                first purely altruist guild of its kind.<BR>
                <BR>
                Now, the Full Circle is in a crisis. Like many other guilds, we 
                havesuffered from infighting and attrition. Alendar and Yores 
                are M.I.A. Many members have left the guild out of anger, sadness, 
                and confusion. Morale has drastically fallen, and we are seriously 
                underpowered. However, the remaining members have chosen not to 
                allow the Full Circle to die the lingering death of abandonment 
                and neglect. In a world that grows more cynical by the day, we 
                will continue to light the halls of Norrath with our altruistic 
                ways. We will fight to rebuild the guild and to ensure that it 
                lives on to greatness.<BR>
                <BR>
                To help the guild survive and to improve the worsening condition 
                of the planet, we urge all interested citizens to join the Full 
                Circle. We are now in the middle of a serious reformation plan.<BR>
                <BR>
                All levels, classes, races, and religions are welcome. Help make 
                Norrath a better place. Help the Full Circle achieve the status 
                and reputation it had in its glory days. Help your common brothers!<BR>
                <BR>
                As acting leader of The Full Circle, I have led a campaign to 
                fix many of the problems of the past that the guild had. We have 
                a better ranking system, more organization, better communication 
                (which in turn, rebuilds unity), new and tougher recruitment standards 
                (which have been enforced), and a new system to weed out "undesirables" 
                that only cause trouble. The remaining members of the guild have 
                had much to do with this, and we are currently fixing all other 
                problems.<BR>

              <blockquote>The night started as many of us gathered at the temple 
                in Sro. Calledtogether by one man and our need to create a new 
                way for Ec'i to jointogether and vanquish the evil that resides 
                among us.<BR>
                <BR>
                Over 100 adventurers gathered, levels ranging from low twenties, 
                all the way to level 50. We listened and discussed as Shangra 
                Kai de Idyllic talked about how to bring together the powers that 
                be on the Ec'i server, to make a better future for our adventures. 
                Many good ideas were given, and many points were made. Together 
                we laid the seeds for a new way for Ec'i to be more proactive 
                and productive with it's future raids against the the likes of 
                Nagafen, Cazic Thule, and others.<BR>
                <BR>
                After the meeting we gathered our forces and began the charge 
                againstLord Nagafen himself. Many adventurers came to the call, 
                we formedgroups and began the charge. Shangra took the reins as 
                leader andtogether we made our way down to Nagafen's realm and 
                knocked on hisdoor. The battle was big, but everyone did a wonderful 
                job, and Nagafen fell in under 10 minutes, with very few deaths 
                on our side.<BR>
                <BR>
                I would like to thank Shangra, everyone involved in the meeting 
                and the raid, for a wonderful time and a very memorable night!</blockquote>

                clear WHAT kind of information we should be communicating via 
                patch messages.
                <p>It is indeed our intent to become much better at writing patch 
                  messages and including more detail.
                <p>It is NOT our intent to document changes to specific NPCs and 
                  item spawns, nor quests. We might say something like "quests 
                  in this area have been improved" but we're not going to say 
                  "quest x now gives you y experience and a z instead of the previous 
                  item."
                <p>The fact that new NPCs will appear and old ones dissappear, 
                  and the fact that items will change will typically NOT be documented. 
                <p>There is a fine line here, and you will get more information 
                  from us, but the patch message is not going to turn into EQ'Lizer 
                <p>Also, changing a treasure table is NOT punishing people. The 
                  game changes. Treasure changes. You can never expect it to be 
                  the same. There are many powerful items in the game now that 
                  were not available earlier -- is that 'punishing' players who 
                  started playing EQ earlier? 
                <p>The 'punishment' rationale is simply incompatible with this 
                  genre of game.<br>

            <div> 
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> Hello there,<br>
                I just got done going around and talking to people about the way 
                Feign Death was, and how it is now.
                <p>Before:<br>
                  When someone would feign death and later stand, the creatures 
                  they feigned on would remember them, but would not come hunting 
                  for them until they engaged in combat with something else. As 
                  an example, if a monk pulled a guard, feigned, and stood back 
                  up when the guard started returning to his post (assuming the 
                  guard was far enough away not to be triggered normally), the 
                  guard would continue to his post and seemingly ignore the monk. 
                  The guard would not return to pursue the monk unless it engaged 
                  something else in combat. For instance, if this guard later 
                  ran out and killed a moss snake, it would then remember it was 
                  mad at the monk and take off after him (assuming the monk was 
                  still in zone). This was a bug.
                <p>I can understand how some people perceive this as better than 
                  it is now. Since the creature would not remember the monk unless 
                  it fought something else, it gave monks the impression that 
                  they were forgotten, even though this was not the case.
                <p>In addition, if the monk feigned enough times, the MOB would 
                  forget him regardless. This was also a bug.
                <p>First Change:<br>
                  When these bugs were first fixed, so that Feign Death operated 
                  as designed, the creature would ALWAYS remember the monk. This 
                  certainly did cause trains, and is the reason why it was changed 
                  to what it is currently.
                <p>Now:<br>
                  When a monk successfully feigns, any creatures under level 32 
                  will forget him. In addition, any creatures that have returned 
                  to their spawn point will also forget him when he finally stands 
                  up. However, if the monk stands up before the creature has returned 
                  to their spawn point, there is a chance that it will remember 
                  him. Of course, it is now possible that some creatures will 
                  never have a 100% chance of forgetting you (roamers), since 
                  they have no spawn point to return to. However they still have 
                  the same chance to forget as static creatures that have not 
                  yet returned.
                <p>Feign Death is now an all around better spell than it was before, 
                  since the creatures do have a chance (up to 100%) to forget 
                  the feigner entirely. This is why you see it listed as a positive 
                  change on the game. However, it does become less effective with 
                  the addition of each roaming NPC. 
                <p>I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing from some people who&#8217;ve 
                  tried it at length since the change.<br>

                <p>I think that Brad fairly well established in his last post 
                  the need for change in a game such as this. In fact, nearly 
                  every publication relating to EverQuest makes reference to Norrath 
                  being a dynamic (read: changing) world. Changes have to happen 
                  in a game like this to keep things working correctly. Rather 
                  than debate the merits of changes in general, I&#8217;d like 
                  to discuss some of the issues posted in the thread in reference 
                  to the way this list is compiled:
                <p>Bug Fixes Listed as Enhancements<br>
                  Rather than leaving this list a true &#8220;Enhancement vs. 
                  Nerf&#8221; list, we&#8217;ve modified it to consist of &#8220;Changes 
                  to the game and their effect on gameplay from the player&#8217;s 
                  perspective.&#8221; The main reason behind this is that many 
                  bug fixes that have been done have been called &#8220;nerfs&#8221; 
                  if they result in the player no longer being able to do something 
                  they once were able to do. A good example of this is when high 
                  level pets (39+) were weakened. This change was made because 
                  the original data entered into the system was entered incorrectly. 
                  It was in every sense a bug, but when fixed, it was deemed a 
                  nerf. 
                <p>Item and NPC Changes<br>
                  New items come into the game and old items are taken out. Some 
                  items might come out to make room for a new one, while others 
                  might come out due to a balance issue associated with it. We&#8217;ve 
                  learned that it&#8217;s not right to change existing items in 
                  a negative manner. Some of you might remember Lustrous Russet 
                  Armor, and how we made the mistake of changing the class restrictions 
                  on that existing item. These particular items were always meant 
                  to be &#8220;Warrior only&#8221;, however it was wrong for us 
                  to take it away from those who had it. Another example would 
                  be the change to the weight reduction on the Box of Abu&#8217;kar. 
                  Even though the weight reduction on this box was a bug, it was 
                  wrong for us to change an item that people already had. 
                <p>Even though we try very hard not to change existing items, 
                  sometimes it&#8217;s necessary due to a large imbalance. One 
                  example would be the stat increases made to the Armor of Ro, 
                  and another would be the problem with the Treant Fists that 
                  contained unlimited charges of Complete Heal. But this is a 
                  rare occurrence. Our preference when changing these items is 
                  to replace them with a new item of a different name. That way 
                  everyone who worked for the old item does not lose anything 
                  due to the change. 
                <p>NPCs are much like items in that they change constantly. They 
                  are routinely added and removed from the world, their stats 
                  are adjusted, and their loot pool changes. 
                <p>In both cases, we typically will not be announcing it. Norrath 
                  is a world where people are meant to figure things out on their 
                  own. Just because &#8220;Bob the Paladin&#8221; was level 20 
                  and dropped the Holy Sword of Reverence yesterday in East Commons 
                  doesn&#8217;t mean that he won&#8217;t be level 40 and drop 
                  the Shield of Holy Protection tomorrow in Lesser Faydark. I&#8217;ve 
                  seen people ask, &#8220;How do we know that the loot/the NPC 
                  has changed?&#8221;, and I&#8217;m forced to ask, &#8220;How 
                  did you know what it was in the first place?&#8221;. 
                <p>In the list below, we noted the removals of Rubicite, the Manastone, 
                  and the Box of Abu&#8217;Kar. In the future, it will really 
                  be atypical for these types of things to be announced in advance. 
                <p>&#8220;Change X is listed as a plus, it&#8217;s obviously a 
                  minus&#8221;
                <p>There will no doubt be some disagreement as to the effect of 
                  a particular change on gameplay in general. For instance, I&#8217;m 
                  looking at the list now, and I see &#8220;Boil Blood replaced 
                  with Dooming Darkness&#8221; listed as a minus under the Shadowknight 
                  class. I personally disagree greatly with this especially considering 
                  the recent upgrades to Dooming Darkness. 
                <p>Of course this disagreement is inevitable. It&#8217;s nearly 
                  impossible to get a group of 150,000+ people to agree unanimously 
                  with a change. Perhaps the closest thing we&#8217;ve seen as 
                  far as a change in the game would be the addition of Clarity, 
                  though I imagine some people think this spell should have been 
                  added to more classes. 
                <p>Missing Changes<br>
                  There is actually a number of changes that are noted in the 
                  thread that did not end up in this list. Many of them just didn&#8217;t 
                  occur, or didn&#8217;t occur during release. For instance, I&#8217;ve 
                  seen several comments in regards to Corpse Bomb and Umbral Messenger 
                  being removed from the game. These were both taken out during 
                  beta. Some of the other things, such as &#8220;Meditation speed 
                  reduced&#8221; are just plain false. The effect of meditation 
                  and the amount of time that it takes to regenerate mana has 
                  been changed or enhanced a few times, but in no direction but 
                  up. I imagine what may have happened is that some people may 
                  have gotten some new gear and forgot to take that into account. 
                  When my necromancer puts on his +INT gear, he&#8217;s got to 
                  meditate nearly 2 bubbles before being at full mana again. 
                <p>This is not to say I didn&#8217;t genuinely miss a change or 
                  two while compiling the list. It is very possible that I may 
                  have missed some, and will add them as I become aware of them.
                <p>Plans for the Future<br>
                  One of my first goals here at Verant is to increase the amount 
                  of information provided to the public as part of the patch message. 
                  It&#8217;s not just the patch message either, it&#8217;s all 
                  communications that come from us. In the near future, I plan 
                  on bringing a list of goals to the public, goals that we here 
                  at Verant will strive to reach. No one here will try to tell 
                  you that there is no room for improvement in our communications. 
                  If the level of our communications were perfect, I certainly 
                  wouldn&#8217;t have been brought on. 
                <p>But these changes will not happen overnight, and for those 
                  of you are willing to hang in there with us we are very appreciative, 
                  and we sincerely apologize to those we&#8217;ve missed.
                <p>Thank you,<br>

            <div> Here are his posts:
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Hello there,<br>
                To try and answer the majority of the questions here:
                <p>>#1 When are Hole and Paineel coming "online"?
                <p>Paineel and the Hole are tentatively scheduled for January 
                  and March respectivly. On a side note, I had a chance to take 
                  a look at Paineel today, and it's coming along very nicely.
                <p>>#2 When is this new server, per Brad, coming "online"?
                <p>The hardware for the new server is on order. After we receive 
                  it there is of course configuration that needs to be done to 
                  get the server live. In addition, CS personnel (GMs and Guides) 
                  need to be acquired and assigned to the server. The entire process 
                  is fairly complicated, but we are working to get this new server 
                  up. I'll keep everyone informed as we get more information on 
                  it's availability.
                <p>>Why does it rain so much?
                <p>I guess "so much" is a matter of perspective. In any case, 
                  some places receive more rain than others. Take the Plains of 
                  Karana for instance. As I recall, Karana isn't the God of Warm 
                  and Sunny Weather 
                <p>>What are Verant's thoughts on twinking?
                <p>We really don't support or condemn twinking, as long as overall 
                  game balance can be maintained. If balance is harmed, we then 
                  take steps to restore it. An example would be how spell effects 
                  on some weapons require a certain level to "go off", or how 
                  other items are NODROP.
                <p>>Do you use a mouse or a trackball?
                <p>I'm a mouse-guy, all the way.
                <p>>Are you still playing regularly?
                <p>Absolutly. Though for about the past 3 weeks I haven't had 
                  the opportunity to get on much due to moving. I'll be back in 
                  there shortly 
                <p>>What level are your characters?
                <p>I have a high-level necro (Over 40) on one of the Zek's, and 
                  I have over 30 days /played on him. He's my only character since 
                  I returned to EQ in August. 
                <p>>I'm sure you've tried them all to a respectable level right?
                <p>Most of them, sure. Shaman and Magician come to mind as ones 
                  I could probably use more experience in.
                <p>>My question is how often will any questions be answered ? 
                <p>I'm going to be around a lot. Right now I'm still trying to 
                  get my brain around everything that is going on here 
                <p>Well that should cover most of the questions raised. If I haven't 
                  addressed your issue here it probably means that I'm still trying 
                  to learn my way around, meet everyone, and try to figure out 
                  what it is they do sometime before I forget their name. 
                <p>Rest assured that I'll be a regular fixture around here <br>

              <font color=#a00000><br>
              </font>Another Post:<br>
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> There's actually several different 
                types of dynamic quests that run in EverQuest, however they could 
                be broken up into two main groups: Minor and Major.
                <p>Minor quests do not run across all servers simultaneously. 
                  They are scheduled based upon availability of actors and petition 
                  load. They actually run quite frequently, but have a relatively 
                  short duration and typically don't show up on the news sites 
                  since they are such a common occurance.
                <p>Major quests run across all servers. They are likewise scheduled 
                  into a window of time where they must run. This is to minimize 
                  the chance that people find out about the quest in advance and 
                  just "show up" at the place where it starts (or ends). 
                <p>The weakness in this system is that the majority of quests 
                  tend to run during peak hours. The reason behind this is that 
                  more people tend to be available to run the quest during that 
                  time, as much as there are more people available to play. We're 
                  certainly interested in running more quests during off-peak 
                  hours and are working to bring more people into the Guide Program 
                  who can guide at those times. In fact, if you have the strong 
                  customer service skills, the knowledge of the game that we need, 
                  and the ability to guide during off-peak hours, I invite you 
                  to fill out the Guide Program application at <a href="http://guideapp.989studios.com" target="_blank">http://guideapp.989studios.com</a>
                <p>As to the schedule for when these quests run, I'm sorry but 
                  that will never be publicized in advance, as the whole server 
                  would show up to participate. As much as we'd like to involve 
                  everyone on the server at one time, that usually doesn't work 
                  out well for the participants.<br>

              <br>
              And another:<br>
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000> 
                <p>To answer the original question, that particular line of the 
                  GM/Guide FAQ is poorly worded. As I recall it was first put 
                  in due to a certain type of bug that existed in beta, but really 
                  doesn't apply any longer. 
                <p>One of the things on my plate is the update of the FAQ. <br>

            <div> This letter from Brad posted on the <A HREF=http://eq.castersrealm.com/>Casters 
              Realm</a>, refering to the previous posts entitled <A HREF=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/009312.html>'Nerfs' 
              vs Enhancements</a>:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>First, I want to thank everyone 
                for continuing to offer feedback and for your help in compiling 
                this list. I think it's a great step in bettering our relationship 
                with many customers as well as increasing the effectiveness of 
                communications between Verant and our player base, both ways. 
                And as Abashi mentioned, we will have the first revision to this 
                document up soon. I believe it will continue to show that we've 
                both been very busy enhancing EverQuest since launch and that 
                while some changes might be perceived negatively from one perspective 
                that all in all EverQuest is a better game now than when we launched. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                I also want to further clarify that we are looking for additions, 
                changes, and subtractions to the game in terms of content and 
                functionality, and whether you believe it was a good or bad change, 
                or whether it affected you and the game positively or negatively. 
                Some posts appear to be lists of negatives that are complaints 
                about the game in general, and while we appreciate your feedback 
                and opinions, these are neither nerfs nor enhancements and won't 
                become part of this growing document. <BR>
                <BR>
                Lastly, I'd like to address what I perceive to be a common theme 
                throughout this thread, and that's a resistance to change. I think 
                some players, while they want the game to change in general, and 
                for new and exciting things to be added, don't want change that 
                affects their character, especially if they perceive that change 
                to be negative. I understand this and have been victim to 'nerf's 
                playing MUDs and other similar games. Some players also don't 
                like the fact that earlier players were able to use tactics, exploits, 
                etc. to progress in the game, but by the time they would have 
                had the opportunity to use similar means, we'd changed the game. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                I understand this, and this is why this thread has grown with 
                many long and passionate posts. <BR>
                <BR>
                I must submit to you, however, that the administrators and keepers 
                of an online, persistent game MUST continue to make changes to 
                the game in order to preserve balance and to address areas of 
                the game that become contrary to design, balance or intent. There 
                is no way one can launch a game like EverQuest and then simply 
                sit back and let it go. The game changes on its own, the knowledge 
                base increases, the average player advances from low level areas, 
                to mid, and then to high -- the entire game dynamic is altered 
                through natural evolution. And it is our responsibility to protect 
                the long-term health of the game and unfortunately this is at 
                times at the perceived expense of a group of players. Unfortunately, 
                sometimes the good of the many must outweigh the good of the few.

                We definitely don't like making 'nerfs' - in fact, we hate it! 
                It pains me personally to see players upset with the game and 
                team behind the game. I'm sitting here writing this post after 
                midnight at home on my own time not because I was told to, or 
                because I'm afraid if I don't I'll have less money in my pocket, 
                but because I and my team have poured our hearts into EverQuest 
                the past three and a half years and it hurts me to have some people 
                think poorly of us. This game is and has been our baby whom we 
                released to the world nine months ago, and we all care deeply 
                about it. Yes, Verant and Sony are out to make money with this 
                game, but this doesn't mean the team behind the game only looks 
                at everything as business. It's my opinion that great games can 
                ONLY be products of passionate, creative teams who think of their 
                creation as art and as a labor of love. And I'm sure the majority 
                of you, regardless of how upset you are, agree that EQ is a great 
                game. And I really believe this document as it grows will show 
                that we don't make significant 'nerfs' often and that most changes 
                we make not only help the game as a whole but individual players 
                perceive them positively as well. <BR>
                <BR>
                But the fact is, if the game is to continue to evolve (and it 
                must), tweaks need to be made. Just about ANY change could be 
                construed by a player as negative. For example, the upcoming change 
                to Paw. Most people are excited about this, because it's pretty 
                clear we need more mid level content. But how about those lower 
                level players who hang out in Paw regularly because it's not so 
                crowded... while most players might consider the changes to Paw 
                a positive, the few who have consistently hunted there might consider 
                it a negative. But we will go ahead and make the change in the 
                interest of the greater good and the game as a whole. <BR>
                <BR>
                A single player game is different for many reasons, and I really 
                think quite a bit of the negative feelings in this thread result 
                from some players not being used to a game like EverQuest and 
                making assumptions that are simply not valid in this new and emerging 
                genre. In a single player game two things are usually true: 1. 
                you can assume the game will continue to be the same game you 
                paid for, for as long as you play it (barring the occasional patch, 
                which you the player choose whether to apply or not) and 2. the 
                vast majority of single player games you don't play for month 
                after month after month, developing a character you feel very 
                attached to, becoming very passionate about your time in the game 
                and the relationships you've made, and consuming more and more 
                content, becoming very familiar with the feature set of the game. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                The benefits of a persistent online game are pretty clear... you 
                can play for much, much longer... you can interact with friends... 
                you can watch a world change and be added to. I think most players 
                appreciate this and that's why so many people are flocking to 
                games like EverQuest. Yet some players feel, clearly by many of 
                the posts in this thread, very upset when they find out over time 
                that many of the tenets they are accustomed to in single player 
                games don't exist in massively multiplayer online games. The games 
                do NOT stay the same, and hence I've seen EQ called EverBeta and 
                the post-release period called Beta 5 J. Some people just want 
                us to leave the game alone, or at least leave it alone as it pertains 
                to what they're used to in-game. <BR>
                <BR>
                But we can't. <BR>
                <BR>
                We are constantly adding new content and features. Sometimes, 
                though, a change (even though we thought about it in-depth and 
                tested it) doesn't work out the way we'd intended. Sometimes it 
                takes time to realize this. Sometimes it takes time before players 
                expose a flaw in our thinking, or find a way to take advantage 
                of a change that is contrary to both our intent and to the balance 
                of the game. And I don't blame the players one bit for this. But 
                when situations like this are discovered, we must address it lest 
                the long term health of the game and its balance be harmed and 
                the game as a whole become worse, affecting everyone. <BR>
                <BR>
                For example, the Plane of Fear. We launched it, thinking it would 
                be a very hard zone. We even posted a message reminding people 
                of its high difficulty and of the peril they might involve themselves 
                in should they travel there. And since it was to be such a difficult 
                zone, we populated it with very powerful items. It turned out, 
                however, that we were wrong. Players found better tactics than 
                we had, and were able to hunt in and conquer the zone far more 
                easily than we expected. What could we then do? One of three things, 
                I suppose: 1. leave it be, 2. downgrade the items, or 3. upgrade 
                the difficulty of the zone. I imagine some players would have 
                preferred we'd chosen option 1 or even 2, but we chose 3. Option 
                1 would negatively affect the whole game, because the items found 
                in Fear are significantly better than elsewhere (thereby rendering 
                other parts of the world unattractive to hunt in). Option 2 would 
                not only upset the players who've already earned the item, but 
                would also be going against the intent of the zone (that it would 
                be very hard, and that the treasure would be very powerful). So 
                we chose 3, and I continue to believe that was the right choice. 
                Certainly, the best case scenario would have been we launched 
                the zone perfectly, and certainly were we all perfect you all 
                would probably be much happier. But we aren't, and as long as 
                we continue to add to this game both in terms of content and features 
                we WILL make mistakes and we WILL underestimate the ingenuity 
                of some players. <BR>
                <BR>
                Another example, but of a slightly different variety, is kiting. 
                We knew about kiting for quite some time. It was never our intent 
                that spells like SoW would be used in combat, rather the intent 
                was for it to be a travel spell. But at first kiting didn't seem 
                to be a problem and so we left it alone. Then, as the game continued 
                to evolve and as tactics became more effective, we looked at the 
                situation again and found that kiting had turned into a means 
                of advancement NOT in synch with the many other ways to advance 
                in the game. In fact, it was so effective that on some of our 
                newer servers the number of druids and other classes that could 
                kite alarmingly outnumbered other classes being chosen. This is 
                another example of when we MUST take action. A key part of balance 
                in an online game like EverQuest is that means of advancement 
                are at least relatively in synch in terms of how long it takes 
                to advance. Clearly if a, b, c, and d are all ways to earn experience, 
                but d is significantly more efficient, players will be compelled 
                to choose d more often than a, b and c. Unfortunately, some people 
                perceive these sorts of 'nerfs' as an attempt by us to slow advancement 
                down in general, or that we are alarmed at the rate at which some 
                hard-core powergamers advance. But this couldn't be further from 
                the truth, and another purpose of the document I posted was to 
                illustrate that many of the changes we've made have rather made 
                the game much EASIER than it was at launch. The 'nerfs' are rather 
                to bring means of advancement as close as possible in terms of 
                efficiency, not to slow down all means of advancement in general. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                In summary, I think much of this turmoil simply stems from the 
                fact that this is a relatively new genre and that games like EverQuest 
                have brought online persistent gaming to a lot more people (several 
                orders of magnitude more people than, say, MUDs) who are both 
                very interested in the new genre but also unaccustomed to how 
                they often vary significantly from single player games. Yes, in 
                some sense games like EQ are and always will be in 'beta'. Yes, 
                the game you bought will NOT be the same game in three months, 
                or in six, and you cannot depend on the status quo to remain the 
                same. No, the designers aren't perfect and as long as they add 
                content and features they will make mistakes and add new bugs 
                and problems. Yes, they will often have to address these issues 
                and some players won't like it. Yes, players will almost always 
                outsmart the designers and find new and unexpected means by which 
                to play the game. No, these new tactics and/or exploits aren't 
                always in the best interest of the game's overall balance and 
                might have to be addressed. Yes, the players who 'get there first' 
                will have some advantages over those that don't (but then there 
                are many advantages to 'getting there later'; for example, more 
                knowledge, easier accessibility to more powerful items, etc.) 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                These are simply the facts. Maybe we're wrong (and maybe our competitors, 
                and all the MUDs that have existed for years were wrong), and 
                maybe someone will come along and create a massively multiplayer 
                online persistent RPG that has none of these 'problems' but all 
                of the 'benefits' single player games have. Certainly, even though 
                MUDs have existed for years, this genre in particular is in its 
                infancy. I'm quite confident that we've only collectively touched 
                on the tip of the iceberg so far. Heck, until we have 'Holodeck' 
                technology, the sky's the limit. But in all fairness, the EverQuest 
                team here at Verant has quite simply created and designed the 
                most popular, successful (and in my not so humble opinion the 
                BEST) MMORPG to date. It continues to grow (yes, we'll be launching 
                another server soon), and it continues to sell like crazy over 
                9 months after its release (mostly by word of mouth, by the way), 
                and honestly if all of you were not so addicted to this game and 
                overall having a blast, you'd not be so passionate, playing hours 
                and hours a day, and responding to this thread's original post 
                with over 200 detailed responses in 24 hours. You have my pledge 
                that the game will continue to overall get better, and I really 
                believe that as the game matures we will need to do fewer and 
                fewer 'nerfs'. And you also have my pledge that our communication 
                to our players will improve radically. We are very guilty of not 
                explaining adequately why we do things, or what we've changed, 
                and I apologize for this. We WILL do better (go Abashi, go!). 
                If we have to make a hard decision and make a change that negatively 
                impacts a class or some such, the very least we can do is let 
                you all know the details and the how and the why. <BR>
                <BR>
                Thanks for listening, <BR>

                Having just got done with a few internal test tests ;) im ready 
                to start getting real things done. My first goal is to find out 
                how stamina works on hit points, per specific class and levels. 
                My hypothesis is that either it is a strict Stamina devided by 
                some number that is class specific plus perhaps a specific class 
                variable. Or Stamina devided by some number that is class specific 
                plus some random number like 1 die 6. In any event what is like 
                from you guys is stats, class, and level of a character you may 
                have. This will <b>greatly</b> help me. Otherwise it could take 
                me a long time to do anything.</blockquote>

                this apprentice, and only recently discovered the sad news that 
                the poor boy was mercilessly slaughtered while adventuring in 
                Befallen. What's more, the vile necromancers have raised his corpse, 
                as a servant of their own dark agendas.<BR>
                <BR>
                The Soldiers of Tunare seek adventurers to come to Befallen and 
                assist us in releasing the soul of this poor and unfortunate brother. 
                With the simple task of fighting your way into Befallen and vanquishing 
                his elven skeleton remains. Only then may his spirit be free to 
                return to Tunare's Plane of Life and be at peace.<BR>
                <BR>
                This adventure is for players level 6 thru 20. Under 6 is to risky 
                since the deeper dungeon areas will be tough, and also after 6 
                your corpse will stay longer than 30 minutes, just in case.<BR>
                <BR>
                There will be a few higher level people there (myself included) 
                to host the event and provide occasional healing and help with 
                locked doors, but no fighting, we leave that up to the kids who 
                can get experience there.<BR>
                <BR>
                Prizes (and very good ones for people 20 and under) will be awarded 
                for people who stay in character (roleplay), people that work 
                together, and whoever gets the first killing blow on an elven 
                skeleton, and more.. However only those under level 20 will be 
                eligible for the rewards.<BR>

            <div> 
              <p>After Brad's long post and the many responses it received, he 
                added some comments.</p>
              <font color=#a00000> A few items I'd like to address right now:
              <p></p>
              1. Lay on Hands has ALWAYS had an extremely unlikely chance of fizzling. 
              There was no change to this.
              <p></p>
              2. We've made no sweeping across the board increase to fizzling.
              <p></p>
              3. Meditation time was never increased (it was decreased at least 
              once in beta, though).
              <p></p>
              Also, there were a few items posted that from the perspective of 
              the document are not valid. For example, '(Shadow Knights) - Increased 
              mana cost for lifetap line of spells.' SKs didn't have that line 
              of spell, and we gave it to them, but with an increased mana cost 
              relative to necros. This is NOT a nerf. You may have prefered that 
              the spells were identical to the necro line, but the fact is you 
              didn't have the line previously, and so this was an addition. Debating 
              the merit of an addition is not what this list is about, rather 
              it is to document in general what we've added and taken away since 
              launch.<br>

              <p>Furthermore there was a posting by Gordon regarding this thread:</p>
              <font color=#a00000> 
              <p>Hello all,
              <p>Just wanted to drop a note and let you all know that the updated 
                "Changes List" won't be up until mid-day on Wednesday. There's 
                been quite a bit of response to it all, and I'm still trying to 
                compile and verify things. 
              <p>One note I would like to make is that the purpose of this thread 
                is to compile a comprehensive list of changes that have been made 
                to the game since release, and whether those changes benefited 
                or harmed your characters from your point of view. Though we certainly 
                do care about your overall feelings about the game and its various 
                issues, this is not the thread in which to post bugs or to discuss 
                how beneficial or harmful a particular change was. 
              <p>What we are looking for is:<br>
              <p>1. What was changed
              <p>2. Whether that change represents a positive effect, or negative 
                effect on the game.

            <div> Brad wrote and told us that the newest <A HREF=http://everquest.station.sony.com/n_letter.html>Producer 
              Letter</a> is now up. The letter, written by guest author and Verant 
              Internet Relations Manager Gordon Wrinn, is reprinted below:
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Hello everyone!
                <p>My name is Gordon Wrinn, and I am the Internet Relations Manager 
                  at Verant Interactive, Inc. Some of you who participated in 
                  the EverQuest Beta, or followed EverQuest during the beta period 
                  may remember me as Guide Abashi. 
                <p>I discovered EverQuest quite by accident in December of 1997 
                  while perusing a message board for another game. The concept 
                  of playing a 3D role-playing game in a dynamic and persistent 
                  world immediately intrigued me. With the beta for the game still 
                  being some months away, I, like everyone else, was relegated 
                  to discussing ideas about the game on the public boards. Come 
                  June of 1998, I was quite excited when I received an invitation 
                  to the earliest phase of the EverQuest beta. In late 1998, I 
                  was invited to join the EverQuest Guide Program.
                <p>Due to some "real life" issues that took me out-of-town, I 
                  had to leave the Guide Program behind shortly prior to release. 
                  However, some five months later, I returned to EverQuest and 
                  my role in the Guide Program, and not to mention, my role as 
                  a player J I was quite pleased a month or so ago when I was 
                  offered my current position. 
                <p>My job at Verant is to improve the quality and quantity of 
                  the information passing between Verant Interactive, Inc. and 
                  the player-base of EverQuest as a whole. Up until now, public 
                  posts made by Brad and other members of the EverQuest Team have 
                  been made during their ample (*grin*) free time. The Management 
                  Team here decided that their customers deserved more than this, 
                  and hence my position was created. No, I am not here to replace 
                  announcements made by Brad and other members of the EverQuest 
                  team, but to supplement and add to them. My job here is to know 
                  everything there is to know about EverQuest, represent the player-base 
                  in our meetings, and keep in touch with the public. 
                <p>I&#8217;ll be honest with you. I&#8217;m not a "PR Guy" or 
                  "Spin Doctor". My professional background is in mission-critical 
                  subscriber systems management and development. EverQuest, being 
                  a subscriber-based service maintained in a mission-critical 
                  manner, is directly in my area of technical expertise. This 
                  experience, and my experience with EverQuest both as a player 
                  and a former Guide gives me the necessary skills to understand 
                  what EverQuest and Verant are all about, and keep a two-way 
                  dialogue going between the development team and the EverQuest 
                  player-base. I&#8217;m not fond of beating around the bush about 
                  issues, and tend to speak my mind. Though I won&#8217;t always 
                  be able to tell you what you would like to hear, I hope you&#8217;ll 
                  at least appreciate my candor. 
                <p>In closing, I&#8217;d like to say that I am looking forward 
                  to giving you, the customers, the attention and information 
                  that you deserve. I&#8217;d also like to thank Brad for giving 
                  me the opportunity to hijack his letter, as it will hopefully 
                  cut down on the number of "Who is this guy???" posts on the 
                  public boards and newsgroups when I begin to make my appearances 
                  there in the near future. :)

              WARNING EXTREMELY LONG ;)
              <blockquote><FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2><font color=#a00000>Several 
                members of the EQ team, with some initial help from a player's 
                email, put the following document together listing both enhancements 
                and 'nerfs' we've made to the game since launch. And while we 
                probably forgot some things, both negative and positive (please 
                let us know and I'll update the document), I think it puts in 
                perspective the ratio of positive vs. negative changes to the 
                game we've made. I also feel it heartily invalidates the assertion 
                that we are out to make the game harder or to have players advance 
                slower overall, or that 'all we do is nerf'. The following is 
                broken down by class, and then addresses those changes made that 
                affect the whole game. Changes we feel are positive from just 
                about any perspective are denoted with a '+', and those some players 
                might consider a 'nerf', but that we felt were important for the 
                long term health of the game, are denoted with a '-'.<BR>

                  <BR>
                  i was wondering ... its not somthing i know alot about but i 
                  was wondering does everquest use sprites or polygons for its 
                  characters. and if you could inform me of the diffrence. Im 
                  thinking of taking some programing classes and maybe 3d rendering 
                  type stuff, so this could be useful later. if this is a stupid 
                  question just disregard it, im sure there are better questions 
                  to answer.

            <div> From Korath:
              <blockquote><FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>On 
                Saturday night, the Swords of Truth hosted a large-scale tournament 
                in the Lake Rathe arena. It took almost 5 hours to complete, due 
                to the excessively long battles between Paladins (Korath vs Cyrus 
                took 45 minutes!). The Swords of Truth, led by Tristadorn, awarded 
                prizes to the top three placers. First place was awarded a Blackened 
                Iron Bastard Sword, and Aeadian walked home with a brand-new two 
                handed sword. Second place won a full suit of medium bronze and 
                a Bloodstained Tunic. Korath quickly sold his tunic and half of 
                the bronze (I know this because I am Korath.) Third place got 
                a free 100 pp, and an honorable mention. She was a human Paladin 
                who defeated Cyrus in a long battle (I'm sorry but I cannot remember 
                her name.) But the best thing wasn't the prizes. It was Disumboul, 
                a Troll twink, who after slaughtering all of his opponents, honorably 
                stepped out of the contest due to the unfairness of his equipment, 
                out of his own will. Hats off to the Swords of Truth for hosting 
                such a great event, and all the contestants (especially Disumboul) 
                for being such good sports!</font></blockquote>

            <div> The moment we've been waiting for since the dawn of the pen

              Isle, mastermind studio behind Baldur's Gate and the upcoming Icewind 
              Dale has for several months now been developing an online version 
              of their hit concept, due to release some time in late 2000, <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com"target="_blank">Neverwinter 
              Nights</a>. <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com" target="_blank">Neverwinter 
              Nights</a> is an online version of a classic AD&amp;D game where 
              every match has a designer (custom worlds &amp; servers will exist), 
              a Dungeon Master (runs the game), and a party of two or more adventurers 
              trying to solve the DM's quest.

                Nights Stratics web site. At this time it is our privilege to 
                offer a select few of you positions on the staff that will produce 
                this miraculous new site that will be supported by over 30 CGI 
                programmers and will evolve with the game to bring you the single 
                most comprehensive out of game resource for <a href="http://www.neverwinternights.com" target="_blank">Neverwinter 
                Nights</a> in the world. People interested in any of the following 
                tasks should send an e-mail to<A HREF="mailto:nwnadmin@stratics.com">nwnadmin@stratics.com</A> 
                stating what you would bring to the site team, relevant experience, 
                and if possible samples of your work.</P>
              <OL>
                <LI>NWN Stratics needs one or more experts who know the AD&amp;D 
                  version tworule set like they know their sibling's names. Preferably 
                  you have followedsome of the news concerning the upcoming third 
                  version of these rules -since documenting them in an intuitive 
                  and easily referenced format will beyour job.</LI>
                <LI>Experienced Dungeon Masters (this means you have several years 
                  of penand paper experience with role playing), we will need 
                  you to help work onthe world building section of NWN Stratics. 
                  While this section will not bevery active until the version 
                  three rules are completed by TSR (the enginewill not be released 
                  until that time), you will still have your work cut outfor you 
                  documenting the best way to design a traditional campaign - 
                  thenmodifying those documents to fit the game's evolution in 
                  the future.</LI>
                <LI>Technical Writers, not every researcher and expert can write 
                  as well asyou. You will be the ones with the editorial jobs, 
                  ensuring that spelling,grammar, and composition on the site 
                  are up to par - all final submissionsgo through you before they 
                  are published. This position also requires strongpeople &amp; 
                  managerial skills.</LI>
                <LI>Fantasy Writers, the history of the Sword Coast and all of 
                  it's lore isyours to reproduce through documents, stories, and 
                  adventurer'sjournals.</LI>
                <LI>HTML'ers - yep, we need some HTML grunts on this site. Who 
                  else is goingto convert this mass of data into an understandable 
                  format for us? You'llbasically receive a lot of word documents 
                  then work with templates anddesigners to get those docs ready 
                  for press.</LI>
                <LI>Graphic Designers - Not only do we need a couple of you on 
                  the technicalteam, we're actually going to be holding a contest 
                  to see who can submit thebest Neverwinter Nights Stratics design. 
                  Credit to you will be given at thebase of the front page and 
                  in the staff section, and this site would be oneheck of a r&eacute;sum&eacute; 
                  piece for you now wouldn't it?</LI>
              </OL>
              <P>Some of you will end up in managerial positions, others in content 
                developer positions - and some of you will miss the cut for this 
                site and may be asked to work on other projects around the network. 
                Either way, if you have some time to volunteer, we'd love to hear 
                from you.</P>

              <blockquote><FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>Druid 
                Council's Guild Fair a great success!<BR>
                <BR>
                Our first Guild Fair in Qeynos Hills went well. We had representatives 
                from many guilds there. New members were recruited, newbie events 
                were held and much fun was had by all. There is always some delay 
                in these things as the speakers must take the time to convey their 
                thoughts, but things got rolling pretty well. Everyone presented 
                their charter, recruitment policies and presented their web address 
                too if they had one. I will be adding links to these from the 
                Druid Council's Web Page this week.<BR>
                <BR>
                To encouraging worldwide respect and civility the Druid Council 
                asked that all guilds assist by blacklisting those on the Druid 
                Council's Beware list, just as most responsible Druids already 
                do. It is a shame to see people behaving as jerks in Norrath and 
                only through our combined pressures can we hope to effect some 
                change.<BR>
                <BR>
                Our next Guild Fair will be at the Ro Tunnel in West Commons next 
                Sunday at 9:00 PM EST, and we hope it is an even bigger success.</font></blockquote>

              <blockquote><FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>It 
                bothers me that Verant has spent so much time on this new release 
                before they even bother to fix the current EQ. Currently there 
                are very many bugs that exist, BIG ones, that Verant has been 
                aware of and has not fixed. In fact they are so well known that 
                I won't even post any. Just ask you local high level guild. Verant 
                needs to listen to their people rather then try and drum up some 
                extra revenue. Also, why is it that no one ever gets disconnected 
                from Verants "competition" during game play. I'm sorry but if 
                the internet is causing all of your connection problems and disconnects, 
                why doesn't it affect other online games? I'm sure you know why.<BR>

                <BR>
                1. We have fixed many bugs and continue to do so.<BR>
                <BR>
                2. Fixing bugs and working on the Expansion are not mutually exclusive 
                activities (they involve different people).<BR>
                <BR>
                3. The majority of players want more EverQuest. They want more 
                to do, more to see, more to obtain. That's why we're making the 
                Expansion.<BR>
                <BR>
                4. Some players, depending on their connection, ISP, and other 
                factors related to the internet, will lose connection to Internet 
                games period -- EQ is no exception.<BR>

            <div> From Meoleni:
              <blockquote><FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>
                <p>The Farewell of the Noble Paladin<br>
                  Time: 8pm EST, 12/6/99<br>
                  Server: Xegony<br>
                  Place: Freeport, starting in West Freeport.
                <p> Rumors have spread that a nameless warrior, later to be found 
                  out as Lady Meoleni, Paladin of Erollisi Marr, has been giving 
                  away to the needy. Giving away items such as pieces of armor 
                  or a stack of real platinum. More and more, voices in the Hogcaller's 
                  Inn speak frequently of these selfless acts of kindness. One 
                  evening, the Lady Paladin steps into the very same inn to have 
                  a small drink to warm her blood.
                <p> Gathering around, Meoleni says in few words that for her to 
                  grow in her faith and duty to her god, she must travel to an 
                  isle that is fabled in myths to progress in her pious journey 
                  to become a better knight of the people. Continuing on, she 
                  tells that her money, armor and weapons will be no use to her 
                  on her upcoming journey, and believes giving them to other adventurers 
                  will put them better to use than leave them in the hands of 
                  her Paladin brethren. Standing up, she says before her final 
                  day in this land, that the rest of her possessions will be given 
                  away. Smiling crookedly, she notes that even she likes to give 
                  people a good challenge, and her items will not be won so easily. 
                  She steps through the door, back into the night that will one 
                  of her last in the known regions of Antonica.
                <p> OOC: Since I'm not going to play this character anymore (due 
                  to lack of time), I would like to give away the things gained 
                  by Meoleni in her travels. Maybe bronze armor, maybe other things 
                  of value.. it wouldn't be fun to give it away. I will be at 
                  West Freeport at 8pm EST, December 2nd, then I will start with 
                  easy games for easy stuff then harder ones for the best items 
                  I have. It should be fun. I would like to thank Dragon's Claw 
                  of Xegony for having me as a guildmate, and farewell to all 
                  the friends I made during my time. Thanks for all the good and 
                  bad times.. and I will be seeing you during Freeport. I encourage 
                  people rank 5 to 15 to participate, since my paladin only reached 
                  level 23. Till then, see ya there!

                  youth thwarted by the calm visage of the veteran paladin, but 
                  Laarthik&#8217;s soul would not allow him to relent, he bore 
                  down on Galeth, laughing when he was struck gravely across the 
                  side, the white bone of his ribcage and hip slashed open, Galeth&#8217;s 
                  eyes opened in near horror as Laarthik never even flinched and 
                  he took several startled streps back, but continued on stoically

              <blockquote>Hail citizens of Norrath.
                <p>On the 5th date of April 3179 a wedding took place between 
                  Tannel, son of Urso and Icemaid, daughter of Blackheart. Presiding 
                  over the ceremony was the cleric Elara Aedbrynger, preistess 
                  if Quellious. Notcet, a fellow member of the bride in the Clan 
                  Icefist presented her for matrimony.
                <P>Both the Tannel and Icemaid were charged to honor each other 
                  and to protect each other with there lives. Each also expressed 
                  there love and devotion, exchanging tokens of thier pledge. 
                  Elara then pronounced them man and wife in the name of Quellious.
                <P>True to barbarian form the site of the blessed event was in 
                  the Field of Slaughter. Guests started the festivities, drinking 
                  before the exchange of vows even started. But they are not a 
                  race without honor and held off from imbibbing once the ceremony 
                  commenced. Of course after the couple were wed, the drinking 
                  resumed, to great and glad effect.
                <p>While the water in Halas is the coldest found in all Norrath, 
                  the blood flows the hottest if these two are an example of barbarian 
                  love. May the couple be happy and prosper.

                --------------------
                <p>*Nameless Server Update*
                <p>As many of you know, the Nameless server encountered a catastrophichardware 
                  failure with the Raid 5 hard drive controller. The Raid 5 hardware 
                  has worked flawlessly in the past nine months in safeguarding 
                  against data loss in the event of a hard drive crash. However, 
                  last night, we had a severe crash on the Nameless server, which 
                  resulted in a complete loss of all current data on the server. 
                  Unfortunately, the most recent off-site character backups are 
                  from about 11am yesterday morning (December 3rd). This means 
                  that if you played a character on the Nameless server after 
                  11am pacific yesterday, once the server comes back on-line, 
                  that character's stats, items, etc. will be reverted to what 
                  they were previous to that time. Due to these unfortunate circumstances, 
                  which were beyond our control, no reimbursements will be given 
                  whatsoever. Our technicians are now investigating a way to improve 
                  upon this near flawless form of data backup, to insure that 
                  an event such as this NEVER happens again. We apologize for 
                  the inconvenience this has caused.

            <div> Here's a story from a traveler, who describes his encounter 
              with an interesting elf:
              <blockquote>You are surprised to see a fat greasy looking elf standing 
                in the road before you. He is pacing back and forth and seems 
                to be deep in thought.
                <p>Suddenly he notices you.
                <p>"Oh, great one!" he exclaims. "Please pardon this poor old 
                  elf, but we have a terrible problem. Someone has discovered 
                  the way to Sanctuary."
                <p>"When we opened the EQ Marketplace, we had no idea that some 
                  rube would stumble onto the passageway. The competition will 
                  kill us!"
                <p>You wait for the elf to pause for a moment and then ask, "What 
                  is Sanctuary?"
                <p>"What is Sanctuary? Ha! Why it's only the sleeziest, most run 
                  down, evil infested area in the entire world of Norrath! They 
                  say you can buy and sell anything in Sanctuary." The elf seems 
                  to shiver at the very thought.
                <p>"Of course the evil ones should have a marketplace of their 
                  own." he says. "Keeps 'em away from us decent folk."
                <p>"Uh! What do you mean how do you get there? Well of course 
                  I know the way, not that I've ever been there myself mind you."
                <p>It's located at
                <p><a href="http://www.gamingauctions.com/everquest/markets/eqmarkets.cfm">http://www.gamingauctions.com/everquest/markets/eqmarkets.cfm</a>
                <p>The little elf looks up at you with a sly grin. "But Mighty 
                  One, you wouldn't want to go to Sanctuary! Would you?"
                <p>He bows slightly and then turns and walks away into the teeming 
                  mass of people shopping in the Marketplace.

            <div> This in from Tomasi Akimeta Jr:
              <blockquote>Greetings, all.
                <p>Keung Lo, member of the Ruby Knights guild, here.
                <p>Just a reminder to everyone! We, the Ruby Knights, are hosting 
                  a Trade Fair in The Arena, located just west of Lake Rathetear, 
                  today, Saturday the 4th of December. The fair will start at 
                  around 12pm afternoon, PST, and end whenever people stop trading! 
                  =)
                <p>Directions:
                <P>From Qeynos:<br>
                  - Take the West Karana trail pass and head to North Karana.<br>
                  - Head past the Gypsie camp and follow the trail right until 
                  you seethe Granite Bridge.<br>
                  - Cross over the Granite Bridge and zone into South Karana. 
                  Keepheading South.<br>
                  - You'll run past the Splitpaw Den and eventually past the AviakVillage, 
                  and into the Lake Rathetear zone.<br>
                  - The Arena zone entrance is on an island that's directly South 
                  West,which is inhabitted by some Aviaks. The cave on the island 
                  will zonedirectly to The Arena.<br>
                <P>From Freeport:<br>
                  - From West Karana, head West to Kithicor Woods (I'd highly 
                  suggestgetting SoW if you're travelling by night).<br>
                  - From Kithicor, you could either:
                <p>A) Zone into Highpass Hold and make your way to East Karanaor<br>
                  B) Zone into Rivervale, and zone through Misty Thicket, through 
                  RunnyEye Citadel (you'd want to hug the RIGHT wall all the way 
                  until youzone), then through King Xorbb's Gorge (after exitting 
                  Runny Eye, hugthe LEFT wall... the wall will eventually force 
                  you to take a Leftturn... Stay on that path), which will lead 
                  you to East Karana
                <P>From East Karana, zone into North Karana, and follow the instructionabove.
                <p>Hope to see everyone there!

                    are nothing but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere 
                    in the middle, and they are capable of both. They are quite 
                    skilled with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to toe 
                    with a Warrior and prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack 
                    from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. They would

                would like to announce the creation of a new guild on the Rathe

                guild for those who follow the path of good and enjoy helping 
                others. If you like healing or buffing other players, bailing 
                them out of tight spots, being assistance to lower-level characters, 
                and otherwise being helpful, and don't killsteal, call names, 
                or otherwise antagonize other players, you are the type of person 
                we're looking for. At this point we're pretty informal and don't 
                have sections or divisions. Since we're a new guild, members who 
                join early can help shape the personality of the guild, so now's 
                your chance to be in on the ground floor! For information, visit

                <BR>
                Followers of the light...I call you to arms. The time has come 
                to unify all of the factions of light into the greatest army ever 
                known to man.<BR>
                <BR>
                Our mission? To rip the souls of our fallen brethren from the 
                suffocating grasp of Innoruk and return them to the loving arms 
                of the gods of the light. In order to accomplish this task, we 
                must first recover the "Book of Turmoil", which is heavily guarded 
                and carried by the Avatar of Hate herself, Kathia Angst'Shatten, 
                The Fallen One.<BR>
                <BR>
                I have faith in each and every one of you. You are the strong, 
                the chosen...we shall sing victory. I have seen what the future 
                holds, my children...and the future is a bright one.<BR>
                <BR>
                Together we shall call upon the oceans to rise up and wash away 
                the filth from the land of Norrath, leaving only the righteous 
                to tread upon her fruitful planes.<BR>
                <BR>
                Beware, pawns of deciet and hate...you will be brought to trial 
                before the Avatars of the Light. The innocent will be saved...the 
                guilty will be severly punished.<BR>
                <BR>
                ooc: I will also be in the East Commons this evening, along with 
                my counterpart, Kathia, for questions you may have regarding this 
                event, or to be added to the rosters/guilds of the army of your 
                choice. Thus far, the response for this event has been tremendous! 
                Get in on it while you still can, for one the war begins, we cannot 
                add any new participants.<BR>

                Have you always wondered about all those guilds out there? Ever 
                wondered how difficult it would be to become a member but were 
                afraid to ask? Now is your chance. There are many great guilds 
                out there and many players that are unaware how to call on these 
                guilds for either help or membership. The Druid Council is sponsoring 
                a Guild Fair where all guilds can come together and either recruit 
                new members or just make themselves known. We are asking for all 
                Rathe Guilds to attend and during the fair will be asked to announce 
                their charter, membership requirements, web address and perhaps 
                share some of their activities. If a guild would like to sponsor 
                a newbie event or a contest of sorts, this would be very welcome. 
                Our first Guild Fair will be in Qeynos Hills at the Cottage. Our 
                follow up fairs over the next month will be in East Commons, Misty 
                Thicket and Greater Fey.<BR>

              <blockquote><FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>Hello, 
                all! We are the Full Circle, known far and wide for our heroic 
                and unselfish deeds. We have been in existence since shortly after 
                the Beta Era, when we were founded by the legendary rangers Alendar 
                and Yores. The Full Circle was Norrath's first purely altruist 
                guild of its kind.<BR>
                <BR>
                Now, the Full Circle is in a crisis. Like many other guilds, we 
                have suffered from infighting and attrition. Alendar and Yores 
                are M.I.A. Many members have left the guild out of anger, sadness, 
                and confusion. Morale has drastically fallen, and we are seriously 
                underpowered. However, the remaining members have chosen not to 
                allow the Full Circle to die the lingering death of abandonment 
                and neglect. In a world that grows more cynical by the day, we 
                will continue to light the halls of Norrath with our altruistic 
                ways. We will fight to rebuild the guild and to ensure that it 
                lives on to greatness.<BR>
                <BR>
                To help the guild survive and to improve the worsening condition 
                of the planet, we urge all interested citizens to join the Full 
                Circle. We are now in the middle of a serious reformation plan.<BR>
                <BR>
                All levels, classes, races, and religions are welcome. Help make 
                Norrath a better place. Help the Full Circle achieve the status 
                and reputation it had in its glory days. Help your common brothers!<BR>
                <BR>
                As acting leader of The Full Circle, I have led a campaign to 
                fix many of the problems of the past that the guild had. We have 
                a better ranking system, more organization, better communication 
                (which in turn, rebuilds unity), new and tougher recruitment standards 
                (which have been enforced), and a new system to weed out "undesirables" 
                that only cause trouble. The remaining members of the guild have 
                had much to do with this, and we are currently fixing all other 
                problems.<BR>
                <BR>

                OOC : This is part of a continuing storyline on our server. We 
                invite all who would join the Army of Innoruuk or the Army of 
                Light to contact its officers tonight. They are only temporary 
                guilds, created for the purpose of allowing PvP between the two 
                Armies. As soon as the guilds are created, we will begin to assign 
                guildtags. You may contact any of the officers of the guilds, 
                or Kathia for the Army of Innoruuk, and Damali for the Army of 
                Light. I cannot speak for the Army of Light, but I personally 
                will be in the Eastern Commonlands near Freeport to hand out the 
                guildtags for the dark side. Let's make this an event to be remembered

                just came back to EQ after 2 months abscence. Installed the game, 
                downloaded the patch,and discovered that I'm unable to hear any 
                sounds or music in game.(Yes sound and music are "ON" inside the 
                game) When I load up eq, I can hear the sound in the movie alright, 
                but no sounds past that stage what so ever. I've tired reinstalling 
                EQ, I got the latest drivers from Creative for my sound card and 
                installed them, I got DirectX 7.0 from MS and intalled it. It 
                didn't help. However If I minimize the game by pressing Alt+TAB 
                the sounds are there. Most peculiar.Problem number two: I play 
                off a networked computer. The network has a cable modem, and a 
                software called "Lan Bridge" is used to share internet between 
                the computers on the network. Yesterday, when I logged into Terew 
                Marr I was greeted with the nasties packet LOSS, fluctuating wildly 
                between 40-80%. It would come and go without any pattern that 
                I could notice. However when It came the game became utterly unplayable.</font></blockquote>

                  After playing EQ almost since its public debut, I have seen 
                  your responses to several posts and have read your annoucements. 
                  However you seem to 'skirt' around some very key issues. Please 
                  take the time to answer these questions. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I don't intend 
                to 'skirt' issues, but I do often purposely fail to reply to issues 
                that I've addressed before and/or are addressed by other players 
                as well if not better than I could have addressed them :) 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> #1 - Why is 
                there patch after patch dealing with supposed 'game/class balance' 
                issues any very few dealing with game engine bugs? There are game 
                bugs out there that have been there since I purchased the game 
                last April (i.e. Zoning bugs, group bugs where people can't invite 
                or disband w/o logging off and back on, MOB pathing bugs). 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I assure you 
                we continue to fix probably 100 times as many bugs than we implement 
                negative 'nerfs'. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> #2 - In reference 
                to question #1, why are the vast majority of class balance patches 
                negative in their effect and why is there no discussion of these 
                patches before they come out? 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>The vast majority 
                of class balance patches as well as patches in general are not 
                negative (if you really want me to post a list of enhancements 
                we've made to the game since release, I can or someone else can). 
                I'm not sure what you mean by no discussion... just about everything 
                related to EQ is discussed both internally and all over the internet. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> You have stated 
                that you have a vison for EQ but the fact is that you have released 
                your vision to the world and you're having people pay you for 
                it. As such, you have created a community of players and I think 
                as a community we should have some say in changes to the game. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>Sure, and you 
                do. We read newsgroups and message boards all of the time and 
                have received great feedback and ideas, and have also been made 
                aware of problems in the game and areas where we've made mistakes. 
                I think we have a great track record of both listening to our 
                customers and making a big effort to communicate with our customers. 
                Is the process perfect? Heck no, but it's good, and it's getting 
                better. 
                <p>I think the huge success of EverQuest is indicative of both 
                  the fact that we made the game a lot of people wanted, and that 
                  we continue to maintain and update a game that a lot of people 
                  want. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> I.E. The Feign 
                Death changes: I do not have a monk but the numerous posts by 
                monk players that I have read lead me to believe (can that many 
                people be wrong?) that the unannouced changes (meaning no one 
                saw them coming) adversly affected the monk class and that there 
                was nothing wrong with Feign Death to begin with. Such sweeping 
                changes should be brought to the EQ community at large. This should 
                not be done via poll but rather an 'email discussion'.
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I don't think 
                an 'email discussion' with 150,000 people is practical. I do feel 
                polls can be very valuable, but not always -- it is our job to 
                safeguard the game as a whole and often players will look at an 
                issue only from their perspective (and they should -- this isn't 
                necessarily a criticism). 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> You make these 
                changes based on what you would like to see done but seem to forget 
                that you and your staff are not the only players of EQ out there. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>Of course we 
                aren't, but we are also responsible for the short and long term 
                overall health of the game.
                <p> 
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> I believe that 
                you would have a *much* happier player base if you involved us 
                in some way in the decision making process (and i'm not talking 
                about polls, I mean in some way where we know we *are* effecting 
                the outcome). It starts to ruin the enjoyment of the game if large 
                effect changes are made simply because of a disgruntled vocal 
                minority or because "verant just thinks it should be this way" 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I hate to break 
                it to you, but the message boards and newsgroups are the epitome 
                of a vocal minority :)
                <p>The "Verant just thinks it should be this way" almost implies 
                  we are making arbitrary decisions for the heck of it, and I 
                  assure you that this couldn't be farther from the truth. We 
                  have tuning meetings in which controversial issues are discussed 
                  and debated in detail, and hard decisions are often made, and 
                  never lightly.
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> #3 - Several 
                times I have seen patches added without comments in the patch 
                text file. Can we have it where *all* patches small or large are 
                commented? I understand that if new items or quests are added 
                you may not want to advertise what/where they are for roleplaying 
                reasons but simply saying 'added new items/quests'would be nice 
                so we're not wondering is something now gone or added or did they 
                fix a bug, etc. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I agree -- we 
                need to do a better job at communicating changes via the patch 
                messages, even if we do have to be vague as per your example. 
                You have my commitment that we will improve in this area. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> #4 - When are 
                more quests going to be added and when are the broken ones going 
                to be fixed? 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>All the time. 
                There are always new quests being added and we fix broken quests 
                whenever we are made aware of them. I'd venture to say the number 
                of quests in the game now relative to when we released has probably 
                increased by 25%. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> I feel that 
                it detracts from the enjoyment of the game when you take real 
                time to run your character from one place to another and back 
                again only to find that there is no 'end result'. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I agree. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> Also, there 
                are some quests out there that seem to yield squat in relation 
                to the time/level of difficulty it takes to complete the quest. 
                Can this be fixed as well? 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>They are -- 
                many if not most of the quests that people felt yielded too little 
                of a reward, whether it was in terms of items and/or experience, 
                have been 'fixed'. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> #5 - Events. 
                Several questions here. I have been on when some events have occured 
                and read about others and they all seem to start around 11pm or 
                later eastern time. For those people that have to work or go to 
                school the next morning or are just not nite owls, this time frame 
                is not acceptable. Can more events be schedule for early evening 
                eastern time? 
                <p>
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>We can try, 
                but the larger events require many GMs and Guides and therefore 
                often have to be scheduled around when a large body of these people 
                can be online at the same time. 
                <p>
                <FONT color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> When there are 
                events, again the ones I have seen and read about, they all appear 
                to be geared to high level characters. Are there plans to have 
                events where low or mid level characters have a chance to survive 
                and 'win'?
                <p> 
                <FONT color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman" size=2>I don't think 
                that's entirely accurate -- there have been and continue to be 
                quests that are geared toward all sorts of level ranges, and given 
                that the majority of our player base is approaching what I'd call 
                mid-level, most quests and events should be focussed in that area.

                Have you always wondered about all those guilds out there? Ever 
                wondered how difficult it would be to become a member but were 
                afraid to ask? Now is your chance.<BR>
                <BR>
                There are many great guilds out there and many players that are 
                unaware how to call on these guilds for either help or membership. 
                The Druid Council is sponsoring a Guild Fair where all guilds 
                can come together and either recruit new members or just make 
                themselves known. We are asking for all Rathe Guilds to attend 
                and during the fair will be asked to announce their charter, membership 
                requirements, web address and perhaps share some of their activities. 
                If a guild would like to sponsor a newbie event or a contest of 
                sorts, this would be very welcome. Our first Guild Fair will be 
                in Qeynos Hills at the Cottage. Our follow up fairs over the next 
                month will be in East Commons, Misty Thicket and Greater Fey.</font></blockquote>

                  -------------------- 
                <p>The following changes and enhancements have been introduced 
                  with the latest patch: 
                <p>*Monk Enhancements* 
                <p>The Feign Death changes which were mentioned on November 16th 
                  are now live. 
                <p>*Spell Enhancements* 
                <p>Tishan (Enchanter) and Malise (Magician/Shaman) spells now 
                  stack. 
                <p>The Pet bug (where if you have a pet, certain monsters can 
                  attack its owner anywhere in the zone) has been fixed. 
                <p>Alenia`s Disenchanting Melody (Bard) should now work 
                <p>Screaming Terror (Necromancer) has changed. It is no longer 
                  a "Run Away" Fear spell - instead the targeted creature will 
                  cower in terror until it takes damage (similar to the Enchanter's 
                  Mesmerize spell). The Environment limit (Dungeons only) has 
                  been removed. 
                <p>Pact of Shadow (Necromancer) now has a 12 second recast time 
                <p>Summon Waterstone (Magician) has been added to the game.

                <p>I was chatting with another person who plays a high level Cleric 
                  and weboth thought that Diety-Spells would be a neat idea for 
                  spells in thehigher cleric levels.
                <p> (On a side note, you *could* do this for all the spell classes 
                  but someclasses have the choice of being Agnostic, so they get 
                  nothing whichmight annoy players who created their chars a while 
                  ago with thethought that Diety didnt matter. But ALL clerics 
                  have a diety, so thisdoesn't apply)
                <p> Some possibilities? (I didn't give these much thought, but 
                  here goes.)
                <p> Tunare: Summon an animal pet/familiar?<br>
                  Bertoxx: A Disease DoT?<br>
                  Prexus: Walk on water?<br>
                  Innorruk: A (kind of) charm spell that makes a mob attack other 
                  mobs at random. (A Werebat has been overcome by hate! A werebat 
                  hits a festering hag for 44 points of damage!)<br>
                  Cazic Thule: A better AE fear spell?<br>
                  Bristlebane: A stun via laughter effect? (An Ice Giant bursts 
                  into laughter!)<br>
                  Solusek Ro: A fire based DD?<br>
                <p> Another neat idea might be a sanctuary spell that evacs the 
                  group to theclerics home temple. This might be VERY cool to 
                  encourage RP, since if aRodcet Nife Human cleric is grouped 
                  up with a Troll and DE, there willbe insta-death for the Troll 
                  and DE. (Why would a nice Rodcet Nifecleric team with a DE of 
                  Innoruuk or a Troll?)
                <p>Other classes get these evac spells at lower levels, it might 
                  be nice ifthe Cleric had a 'limited' evac, only to his temple 
                  at a higher level,as a back up to the Wizzie or Druid. 
                <p> Just my 2 copper of ideas.<br>

                <p>No promises, of course, but I like the idea in general.
