Murlune held a pile of bones from slain skeletons. He crossed the
femur making a circle in the sand of the Northern Desert of Ro. The bones
shimmered in mid-air and animated into a blood stained skeleton, leering off
in the distance as it awaited it's orders. Murlune, silently handed the
undead spawn of Rallos Zek a club. The skeleton cackled with glee, and held
it in it's right hand, ready to do battle.
<br><br>
"Patience my pet, for I sense one of us has been slain by Light. He
will soon know the thick blood between Ogres and Trolls, especially us Shadow
Knights. He will soon learn what this thick blood bond means."
The skeleton, obviously confused, just stared at it's master. It
hissed questioningly, waiting for orders. Murlune just indicated with a hand
gesture for it to follow him.
<br><br>
Murlune found Banegrivm standing stoically near the docks in the
Oasis of Marr. Banegrivm didn't flinch as Murlune walked up and sniffed him.
Murlune, speaking fluent common, which was very surprising for a Troll, said,
"Banegrivm, I challenge you to a duel. No intereferance from outsiders,
nothing tricky, just a match of force and wit."
<br><br>
Banegrivm accepted, and winced at a slap in the cheek. The skeleton
knew it's cue, and attacked. Banegrivm easily slew the skeleton, to turn
around and find nothing. Suddenly chanting from under the docks flooded
around him, and dark green bubbled flew in all directions. Banegrivm dropped
to his knees, struck to the ground by the force of Darkness.
<br><br>
A sword burst through the wooden docks, slicing Banegrivm's left
hand. Blood spurted, but was quickly mended with some alien, Light magic.
Murlune emerged from the mutilated docks, and touch Banegrivm with a
withered, charred index finger. Banegrivm's screams ripped through the
deserts, and, once again, a white glow circled him, as he was filled with
vigor. Banegrivm's sword ripped through Murlune, slicing him from the groin
to the neck.
<br><br>
Murlune dropped to the ground, dying slowly, as an evil smile spread
across his bloody face. His last breath was a cryptic enchant, spoken in the
tongue of Old Erudian. He had been slain, but the battle was not over.
Murlune suddenly gasped in, then, as he let out his final breath of life,
instead of exhaling the clean air he had inhaled, a green gas spewed from his
inner core, and Banegrivm collapsed to the ground, blacking out. If Murlune
couldn't kill him, one of his brothers would soon.
