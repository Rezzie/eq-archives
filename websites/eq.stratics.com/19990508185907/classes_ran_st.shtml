Rangers are the protectors of the forest and the defenders of nature.
And as Rangers, we can forage for food, track our prey and hide from our
enemies and sneak through their defenses. We can learn magic and survive
for long periods of time without ever going to a city to re-supply. Most
importantly however, we are combatants! And as such, we can hold our own
in melee combat. We are the tanks that protect our party and we are
capable of beefing up our defenses via magic. At higher levels, we can
even heal ourselves when we are wounded. A very self-sufficient class
that can hold it's own.

Rangers are one of the most well rounded character classes in the land
of Norrath. With a wide variety of weapons and armor to choose from,
spell casting ability, a wide variety of skills and the unique skill of
tracking. Rangers are one of the few classes that can do it all. Maybe
not all, but they have the skills that several of the other classes
specialize in. They aren't the masters that they are, but they are
effective none-the-less.

Rangers can be one of three races: Humans, Half Elves and Wood Elves.
Each race has it's own advantages and disadvantages, so it's up to you
on what you want to play. Half Elves and Wood Elves, get Infravision,
Humans don't. However I would advise choosing your race on your own
style and personal preference over stat limitations or things like
infravision.

I would advise buying up your Strength first. As one of the fighter
types you will need strength to dish out the damage and wear all that
heavy armor while still having enough space for things such as weapons
and equipment. Stamina gives you your HP, but I would advise getting
your Agility up second. Agility is important because it adjusts your
armor class and prevents you from taking hits. Your Wisdom determines
your mana when you get magic at level 9. So if you want more mana later,
you can increase this. (I didn't and I have sufficient mana for my
needs).

<div>
Wood Elves start in Kelethin and Humans & Half Elves start in Surefall
Glade (near Qeynos). I'm not sure why half Elves cannot start in either
location, but that is the way it is right now.
<blockquote>
<b>Surefall Glade</b>
<p>
Located near Qeynos, it is a beautiful forest with vast caves to
explore. The Rangers and Druid's of the land have set up their
settlement away from the big city here in the forest. Note that all the
animals are under the protection of the NPC's. I would advise against
hunting any animals you find there. However it is open season on any
poachers you may encounter. It shouldn't take you very long to find the
Ranger's Guild. Hint: It's that cabin on the lake.
<p>
<b>Kelethin</b>
<p>
Kelethin lies deep within the Greater Faydark Forest. Kelethin does not
have a path or maker to guide visitors. (Er, that is until Beta 3.5 came
out. There is now a path from Felwithe to Kelethin). The Wood Elf City
of Kelethin stands proudly in the treetops, keeping it's inhabitants
safe from the creatures that lurk below. To enter the city you will need
to use one of the three "Lifts" they have constructed around the city.
You will want to watch your step once in Kelethin, many adventurers have
fallen to their deaths from the heights. The Ranger's Guild is difficult
to find so I will provide you with directions.
<p>
You will need to find the city's main lift. You can't miss it, it's the
only lift with guards and a fire burning by it. (That and the path now
leads you straight to it). Once there (and you are in the city), you
will want to run straight across the first platform to a suspension
bridge. On the next platform you will see a sturdy wood ramp on your
left, go up that ramp. This platform has the bank (remember that, you
will want to know where it is later), Run across the platform, you will
see another wooden ramp going up. Once you have gone up that platform,
you won't see any other platforms...don't look down if you are afraid of
heights, you are at the top of the city, (falling from here will kill
most characters). On your right side you will see a small fire burning.
This marks where the ramp going down is. CAREFULLY find the edge of the
ramp and go down, I stress that because I've seen MANY foolish
adventurers fall, and it's not pretty. On this platform you will see a
large building in front of you with the sign "Faydark's Champions." You
have arrived. Now don't fall on your way back to the lift.

<div>
You will start with several skills you will want to hotkey right away.
Tracking, Sense Direction, Kick, Taunt (and if you are a Wood Elf you
get Hide and Forage at lvl 1). Here is a list of some of the skills you
will learn. So unless I say otherwise you will want to only spend ONE
practice point to learn the skill. Save up all the points you can for
later levels. You will never know when you will find a need for a skill
you haven't practiced.
<blockquote>
Tracking - The trademark of the Ranger class. This skill is unique to the Ranger and Druid Classes (Druids get it a much higher levels). It lets you find specific creatures around you. You can track everything.
From other players, guards and NPC's to all the creatures in your
general location. This is an invaluable skill, which you should quickly
master with practice. Think of it as your own personal Radar.
<p>
Kick - An extra attack available at the fifth level.
<p>
Taunting - An invaluable skill of the warrior. This allows you to get
creatures to attack you. When a comrade is low on health or needs to
cast a spell, use this skill to get whatever is hitting them to hit you
instead.
<p>
Sense Direction - Keep this maxed out. You will want to know which
direction you are running while guiding a group around, looking for
somebody, simple navigation or running for your life.
<p>
Forage - (lvl 3) Once you have this skill, practice it as much as
possible. You should never have to buy food again once you get good at
it.
<p>
Dodge - (lvl 8) Once you spend one practice point on this skill, combat
will do the rest.
<p>
Magic - (lvl 9) You must learn all five magic skills: Abjure, Alter,
Conjure, Divinate & Evoke to cast spells.
<p>
Sneak - (lvl 10) This skill allows you to walk right past guards and
other creatures without them noticing you. Practice this as much as
possible.
<p>
Meditate - (lvl 15) You can memorize spells and recover mana faster.
<p>
Bind Wound - (lvl 15) If you have bandages, you can heal yourself and
others.
<p>
Dual Wield - (lvl 17) Put away that shield, you can carry two weapons at
once now.
<p>
Parry - (lvl 18) Same as dodge, works automatically when in combat.
<p>
Double Attack - (lvl 20) I'll let you figure this one out.
<p>
Hide - (lvl 25) Makes you "disappear" where you are standing, but you
become visible once you move. This is invaluable when you are low on
health and need to rest. Creatures tend to attack a helpless sitting
target. However, they can't attack you if they can't see you. Doesn't
always work, so keep practicing it.
</blockquote>
You will get more skills at higher levels, so just ask your guild
trainer what they are.

Rangers finally get to learn magic at level 9 and it's important to
spend your 5 practice points on the 5 new spell skills you can now learn
(see the skill section). If you don't, you might find it difficult to
use your newly acquired ability. As for your spells, you don't get
nearly as many as your Druid counterpart. You do get some very effective
combat oriented spells along with some nice backup spells you will not
want to be without, such as Skin Like Wood. When you reach level 15 you
will be able to learn the second level of spells. You will receive your
first offensive spell "flame lick" and one you will have been waiting a
long time to get "minor healing."
<p>
At level 9 you will memorize all 5 of your spells, but at 15 you will
have to start making choices since you can have only 8 memorized. I
suggest you do the following: Replace "snare" with "root," They do
effectively the same thing, but Root is better. You shouldn't need "true
north" because your sense direction skill should be good now. Memorize
the other new spells and you should be good to go.

		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Ranger's Role in a Group</font></b>
<div>
Rangers get many useful skills that make them not only versatile, but a
value to any group. From personal experience, I have found many
adventurers feel better having a Ranger in their group. The reason being
Rangers make not only a great tank, but are great at finding opponents
to fight. Some of the roles a Ranger plays in the group are:
The Scout - While the group rests and meditates, the ranger can wander
off and use his tracking skill to find out what is in the area. Also the
ranger can go out farther than most PC's and still make it back to the
group without getting lost.
<blockquote>
Tracker - You will be assigned the duty of finding creatures to bring
back to the rest of the party to kill. There really is no escaping this
fate. But that is why I love this class, because everyone follows your
lead. I have seen more groups than I can possibility count following a
Ranger tracking down something for them.
<p>
Lookout - Some might argue me calling tracking, "radar", but if you have
ever played a Ranger this describes exactly what Tracking is. There are
times in Norrath when you will find yourself in a zone where there are
creatures lurking about that can single handedly kill all the Players
(and sometimes NPC Guards) that are around. You will learn who those
creatures are quickly (trust me), and you can then keep tracking to see
if they are around. Of course a good Ranger would then WARN other PC's
of his findings.
<p>
Tank - Rangers are front line combatants, there is no question about it.
You are the one keeping the mobs off of the cleric and mages. Be sure to
keep your taunt skill up so you can keep the entire melee directed at
you instead of the spellcasters and your wounded companions.
If you want an active role in any group, a Ranger is a good choice. You
will find yourself leading groups all over Norrath. You will be sought
out by PC's to Find their lost pets, find certain NPC's (for Quests),
locate a certain monster. This is not an antisocial class, much like the
bard, you are a great support character with many aspects to add to a
group.

<div>
As one of the most versatile classes in the game, you will slowly find
it easier to go solo in this dangerous world. Although your
effectiveness increases dramatically with a group to back you up.
Rangers are lucky in that they can "pick" their targets when soloing.
You can track down what you can handle and then kill it off while others
are forced to sit and wait for something to walk by them or respawn. You
will find you are always moving as you solo, so be careful not to get
lost! The down side of soloing is that you will get beat up a lot and
you WILL find yourself sitting and waiting for your HP to slowly heal.
Then again, on a positive note: at level 15 you get the spell "minor
healing," this will cut your sit time in half maybe more. Something to
look foreword to!

<div>
Of course we aren't as effective as a Warrior or Monk when it comes to
melee, but I would rank Rangers as a close third. As for magic, we have
to wait for level 9 to learn how to use it, and level 15 to get our
first attack and healing spells. We also lack a large reserve of mana,
so we will have to know when to use what we have, or run out in a bad
situation. Also we get few spells. However, I feel they are sufficient
for a warrior. Other cons are that since we are the protectors of
nature, we lose status with our guild if we go and hunt many of the
natural creatures of the land... be careful about what you kill.

<div>
Memorize the zones you are in. As a Ranger you are "expected" to know
where everything is and you can make many friends by being a guide. This
is a typical stereotype, one that you will have to get used to.
Practice your Tracking skill all the time! Keep it maxed out at each
level. Also keep your "Sense Heading" skill at maximum. These are two
extremely useful skills for getting around the lands of Norrath.
Always know where you are! There is nothing more embarrassing than
getting lost, especially for the Ranger class. Use your tracking and
sense direction to get "un-lost".
<p>
Be careful about killing animals. Some animals you kill will lower your
standing with your guild. And trust me, you don't want your Guild Master
to refuse to train you. I've seen it happen.
<p>
Learn to use your spells effectively. Many of the magic using classes
get so many spells they don't have time to learn all the subtle uses of
their powers. They tend to just memorize a different one.
Lastly
<p>
Read the <a href="classes_war.shtml">Warrior</a> and <a href="classes_dru.shtml">Druid</a> player guides. Since Rangers are a hybrid
of the two, they cover many good points that I did not cover here.
<p>
By order of the Gods! Leave the bears of Surefall Glade undisturbed!
