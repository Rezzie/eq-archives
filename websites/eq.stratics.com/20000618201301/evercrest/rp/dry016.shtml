The journey to Neriak was quite dangerous on its own.  At several points
through the Nektulos Forest, Megaera, Barishi, and Drysart were forced to
change their path to avoid a guard barely visible in the forest ahead.
In fact, its a wonder they weren't discovered as its well known that dark
elves can see much better in the dark than high elves and halflings. Of
the three, the halfling Barishi seemed most comfortable in the dark forest,
and he led the way around the guards and in the general direction
Megaera had pointed that the entrance to Neriak lay.
<br><br>
Megaera was right, Drysart would never have found the entrance on his own.
Even as they approached the cave in the mountainside and stood within
feet of it, Drysart didn't notice it until Megaera stepped up to it and
pointed it out specifically. It was only a small crack in the side of
the mountain, barely enough to squeeze through.
<br><br>
The cave inside had much more space than the tight entrance. In the dark,
it could be seen that the cave continued back and down into the mountain,
presumably into Neriak itself. Before they continued on, they sat and
prepared for what might be waiting for them deeper in the caves.
<br><br>
Drysart and Barishi each had only the stated goals, to recover the boy
and to bring back the body of Vinalrii that it might find a place to
rest in honor. Megaera wished for those things, as well that she might
somehow help her sister Sithiya.
<br><br>
With little conversation, they began their slow descent into the mountain.
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
Inside Neriak proper, the scene was quite different. The dark elves were
quite active, more than usual. They were, in fact, preparing for a
ceremony. Their spirits were high and they were totally unaware of the
party that was beginning to breach their city.
<br><br>
Lord Garish watched the elves scurry around with a muted sense of
amazement. Quite easily the brightest thing in Neriak, Lord Garish carried
a torch since orcs can't see in the dark nearly as well as dark elves can.
He knew what matters were afoot in Neriak that day and he actually quite
bothered with them. He never told any of the elves about his hesitance.
<br><br>
Instead, he found a quiet corner and pulled a scrap of parchment from his
vest. A page.  A page that his loyal goblins had stolen from the wizard
Drysart many months past. Drysart never did find out what was written on
the page in the strange language, but Garish knew. He was hired by
Rubicant to recover the page, but Rubicant's extreme desire for it had
piqued Garish's curiousity about the page, and he didn't turn it over. In
fact, Rubicant still thought Drysart had it.
<br><br>
If Drysart had learned what was on the page, it could most certainly have
led to the total extermination of the dark elves from Norrath. Garish
realized the power of what he had, and he kept it with him at all times.
Because with that same power, the dark elves could easily overtake all of
Norrath.
<br><br>
He folded the page back up and placed it in his vest pocket. The ceremony
was about to begin, and he was quite interested to see it. He headed down
the now quiet streets in the direction of the Hall.
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
By the time Megaera, Barishi and Drysart made their way to the city itself,
they were quite surprised to see how deserted it was. Even the guards who
routinely patrolled the streets were conspicuously absent. Slightly set
aback by the quiet city, they nevertheless used extreme caution in moving
about. Perhaps, they figured, the dark elves knew they were coming and
prepared a trap.
<br><br>
Their caution in moving about the streets was actually quite unnecessary,
since it was no trap at all. Every dark elf in Neriak was in attendance at
the ceremony taking place in the large red-bricked building that the party
approached.
<br><br>
The building was immense, larger than anything in any of the cities on
the surface of Norrath. It stood out in the city as not only the largest
structure, but because of its color. It seemed to almost glow red.
<br><br>
Still being quite cautious, instead of entering through a door, the three
managed to scale the building to a ledge and peer in through a window to
the ceremony taking place within.  Rubicant was standing and addressing
the crowd. Behind him was a closed coffin. Drysart could only assume
what was inside it.
<br><br>
"What are they saying?" Drysart whispered. The ceremony was in dark speech,
of which Drysart only had rudimentary knowledge. Fortunately, Megaera
was much more fluent in the language and she began a running translation
of what was happening below.
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
"Brothers and sisters of Innoruuk," Rubicant began, "I've brought you all
here for a matter of great importance.  Allow me to introduce myself to
the younger among us as I have been away from the city for quite a
length of time. I am Rubicant N'Ariqi, crown prince of Neriak, and High
Priest of Innoruuk."
<br><br>
Slight cheers washed over the crowed but quickly dissipated as Rubicant
continued to speak.
<br><br>
"Behind me is the only daughter of our King Erist and the late Queen
Poranni (long live the Queen), Vinalrii.  She was slain by the treacherous
high elves, namely one called Drysart Pennoble."
<br><br>
At this point it might be a good time to remind the reader that Neriak is
ruled by Matriarchy. The Queen is the primary sovereign of her people, and
the heir to the throne is the Queen's eldest daughter. It is for this
reason, and the reason that Vinalrii was the only daughter of the Queen,
that a worried murmur began to spread through the crowd.
<br><br>
Drysart was quite stunned to hear it as Megaera translated. Vinalrii had
never mentioned anything of the sort to him.
<br><br>
"And obviously attempting to make a point, the dastardly high elf mutilated
her body after slaying her. Our best clerics were unable to bring life back
to her body as a result of its mangled condition."
<br><br>
The murmur in the crowd began to sound angry.
<br><br>
"However," Rubicant paused and smiled, "as she is the only heir to the
throne, we did what we could. Our clerics were able to almost totally
repair her body. It was at that point that we turned to our best
Necromancers for help."
<br><br>
The crowd fell silent. Drysart's jaw fell open. Barishi's eyes grew wider
and Megaera's voice cracked.
<br><br>
Rubicant turned and opened the coffin. Inside it was Vinalrii laying
peacefully. She was dressed in a magnificant gown. The clerics had done
quite a job and she looked almost alive.
<br><br>
Another dark elf walked onto the stage. Drysart vaguely recognized him, but
could not place a name. He was carrying a cup formed from a half-skull. He
slowly approached the coffin, chanted quietly and poured the dust from the
skull onto Vinalrii.
<br><br>
Rubicant watched, then turned back to address the crowd. "My brothers and
sisters. Witness the rebirth of Vinalrii, the undead Queen of Neriak."
<br><br>
As if on queue, Vinalrii slowly sat up in her coffin. She brushed the dust
away from her eyes and opened them. Her eyes had changed. They were no
longer the beautiful purple eyes Drysart had known. Instead they were
entirely red save for a small black pupil in the center of each.
<br><br>
The crowd erupted into cheers.  Rubicant went on speaking and Megaera
began to translate, but Drysart had been worked into a fury and leaped
from the ledge to the ground and headed toward a door to the Hall. Startled,
Barishi and Megaera both leaped down and tried to stop Drysart.
<br><br>
The fury of what they had done.... nothing was going to stop him.
<br><br>
Nothing that is, except for the fact he had ran right into the orc Lord
Garish who was storming from the Hall with the same fury. It was the first
time the two had seen each other since Garish resurrected Drysart on the
Ocean of Tears months before.
<br><br>
Both seemed slightly startled to see the other. Megaera and Barishi stopped
in their tracks, neither knowing what to expect.
<br><br>
"Come with me, Drysart...  I have something that may interest you."
<br><br>
Garish took Drysart's hand and led him away from the Hall.  Megaera and
Barishi followed. Neither Drysart, nor Megaera or Barishi quite knew
what was to happen next.
