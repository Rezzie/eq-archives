<font face="Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica"><em>Fiction by <a href="mailto:specterx@cc.gatech.edu">Megaera</a></em></font><br>
</center><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size=-1>
Darkness and rock surrounded her. Neriak, she was kneeling in the city of Innoruuk's children, the Dark Elves. Her head swam as if fog blocked out all feeling. She tried to move her arm, and pain shot through her body. What am I doing here, she asked herself. An image appeared in mind, clear and crisp. She knew exactly why she was here in the dungeons. 
<br><br>
She had lead friends on a spy mission into the depths of the city. As they had passed into the lower city, they had met a troop of guards. The guards had not been a problem, but they had been spotted, and as the group ran for the secret passageways, she had been knocked off of a thin bridge, and had fallen into darkness. 
<br><br>
And now she knelt in a dungeon, deep below the surface of the terra above. She had placed what the enemy wanted, directly in their grasp. "Again, I kneel in defeat, Father, as I did when I lost our kingdom." 
<br><br>
A familiar high-pitched laugh drew her attention; she had heard that laugh so many times before. Sithiya. Her green eyes caught the dark elf standing on the granite steps behind her. 
<br><br>
"Of all the life in the universe, Megaera, I least expected you to be standing here before me." The dark elf stepped forward. "Ye and your friends have caused me a great deal of trouble, but that will soon change, won't it, sister." 
<br><br>
Sithiya's red eyes narrowed in the darkness as the clicking of her heels echoed within the black chamber. Megaera glanced to her sides where guards stood watching, deadly as the heat of fire. 
<br><br>
"Ye won't find a soul, Sithiya. I entered the city, solely on finding yerself. I have no fellowship." Megaera felt the binds at her wrists, they were tight, but hope grew in the wizard for they had used rope of hemp. 
<br><br>
Sithiya sneered and gently pressed her fingers under Megaera's chin. "Is that so, Meg. I'd believe ye if I didn't know for a fact that I saw our cousin try to levitate ye to safety. Now, if ye would be kind, please explain why ye are in Neriak, this place is not the palace we grew up in. I don't think ye understand mine intentions here in Norrath, do ye." 
<br><br>
"Your intentions are dark and evil as they usually are, Sithiya. What else could they be," Meg spoke quitely. Time, she thought. I need just a little bit more time. "Remember Father. Do ye remember what he said to us before he left for the battle? Do ye remember the song he use to sing ye, as we use to lie in bed awaiting for sleep to take us? Ye reminded him of mother, Sithiya. What ye did to our nation would have murdered him a hundred times over. Do ye remember what happened to Cais?" A blow took her to the floor, blood broke and flowed from her nose and mouth. Megaera's hands flared at her fingertips so softly and silently. 
<br><br>
Sithiya stood above her, tears flowing from her eyes. She looked different than she had moments ago, standing as if a great weight had released hold of her body. 
<br><br>
Megaera could not breath. Sithiya had undergone a change, one that she hadn't seen since the days of old. Sithiya looked into her eyes and whispered hope into her elder sister. "Help me, Meggie. He .. he won't let me go. Meggie.. I am so sorry.." 
<br><br>
And as quickly as the change had occured, a shadow appeared in the windows of her eyes, and laugh, different than that of before broke forth loudly. 
<br><br>
"Forget thy past, Megaera. Ye will soon join Father in the Darkness." 
<br><br>
As Sithiya turned and walked up the stairs, Megaera whispered a promise to her fallen sister, "I promise to free ye, Sithiya, should it cost me mine life. I will return and find ye, and destroy who controls ye." 
<br><br>
And as Megaera spoke the words, she broke her binds, and destroyed the two guards to either side of herself. Megaera turned to see Sithiya watching her from the top of the stairs. Megaera grinned, opened a portal, and stepped through to safety. 
<br><br>
-------- 
<br><br>
"I have not seen this sigil before," Megaera said as she eyed the black dagger that had recently embedded itself into the headboard above the door to the study. "Drysart, would ye care to see?" 
<br><br>
"Of course, Meg, I'd be delighted," he spoke as he took the black dagger from the wizard. 
<br><br>
Megaera frowned to herself as she turned to toward the kitchen. She had definitely seen the sigil before, and its coming gave her a feeling of sickness. The Sigil of the Damned, it was called; a mark of death to who it was given to. 
<br><br>
Mystiana stood in shock, looking from the dagger to Megaera, and then to the headboard. "Are ye really ok, Meggie?" she asked again. "That happened so fast!" 
<br><br>
"Aye, sister," she replied with a smile, "I feel quite fine. Would ye like a glass of wine. I feel like I could use a new glass, meself." 
<br><br>
Mystiana nodded graciously, and Megaera poured three glasses. The day had been very strange. Megaera had felt a presence following her for most of the day, but she did not expect this presence to be an assassin from the Order of the Damned. 
<br><br>
The wine was relaxing as usual, and Megaera soon found herself engrossed in an interesting tome on the magic arts surrounding the particularities of enchanting metal. Mystiana had left for bed minutes past, for when the hours grew late, did Megaera finally look up from the tome. 
<br><br>
Drysart the wizard sat in a chair near the fireplace, lost in deep thought. He stood slowly and stepped nearer to the billowing flames, and slowly reached into the fireplace as one would reach for a precious object. 
<br><br>
Megaera watched the pain on the wizard's face, and immediately stood, and spoke. "Drysart? What are you doing?" 
<br><br>
The wizard pulled away, and clutched his hand to him, as a child would after being caught reaching into a cookie jar. He didn't speak, but a horror hung in his eyes. A chill took Megaera as she stared into the soul of the wizard, and she spoke again, "Drysart, are ye all right? What is wrong?" 
<br><br>
The words acted as a key, and the horror that hung within the wizard's eyes burst from his body. Drysart collapsed upon the couch, and Megaera sat with him. The wizard shook with a fury, and Megaera watched in silence until the wizard lie still. 
<br><br>
"Meg," he spoke quietly, "Vinalrii is dead. I killed her. I didn't know it was her." 
<br><br>
The words shocked her to the core. She had just spoken with the exiled dark elf only nights before. Megaera remembered the promise she had made to the soon-to-be mother. 
<br><br>
"Drysart, how? When did this happen?" Megaera asked in haste. 
<br><br>
"Two days ago, he ... he stole her mind, and forced her to attack me. I didn't know, Megaeara. I could see her, and I killed her." 
<br><br>
Megaera's mind slowly computed what Drysart had just said. He had stolen her mind. Not sweet Vinalrii, she had been so kind. She would have been a mother soon, and as soon as the thought entered her mind, the horror hit her like a wave. 
<br><br>
"Drysart!" Megaera pleaded, "What of the child in her womb?" 
<br><br>
"He lives, Meg" whispered the wizard, "he took the babe." 
<br><br>
The words echoed in her mind again, and the image of Sithiya whispering in her mind flooded back. "He ... he won't let me go, Meggie.. I'm so sorry." Megaera knew those words. She had heard them before, and now Vinalrii had been taken from the only family that had ever cared for her. He had taken her mind, and used it against her, just as Sithiya had been used against a young Queen in the Wind Kingdoms a long trek away. 
<br><br>
Megaera watched the pained wizard. Drysart had been quiet as of late; he had been pondering his situation for fallen in love with the enemy of his race. Vinalrii captured his heart, she had been kind and beautiful, and she had left her homeland knowing that their actions would bring strict consequences. 
<br><br>
In a voice, hurt and under her strict command, Megaera asked, "Who is He, Wizard? Who would do something like this?" 
<br><br>
"Rubicant is his name, Megaera," replied Drysart. "He is Vinalrii's brother. He stole her mind to attack me, and I struck not knowing who or why they were attacking. Rubicant took them, Megaera, he has mine child and the body of mine love, and he takes them to the only place I can not step foot in, the dreaded city of Neriak! I have lost them, Meg." 
<br><br>
"Oh Tunare," whispered the fire headed wizard as she stared into the eyes of one who had given up hope. Turning and moving away from the couch, Megaera slowly calmed herself, and turned to see little Barishi standing and watching from the stairs near the study door. A mask of sadness marked his features as well. 
<br><br>
"Bari, would ye join Drysart and I since thee seem to have heard our words." Megaera dreaded what she would say. She had made a promise just nights before right here in the tavern. Drysart had left to sleep early that night, and Vinalrii had joined her near the fire. She had spoken of her past, and her feelings, and at the end, she had graciously asked the wizard to watch over her child, a request that Megaera felt as if her own sister had made that request. 
<br><br>
Head low, the halfling walked purposely over to the couch and sat down next to Drysart. Megaera turned and looked at her two companions; she looked deep into their eyes and their souls. Would they have the heart to do what she would ask? 
<br><br>
"I have a question for both of ye two," Megaera spoke slowly and forcefully. "Would ye give up all of thy posessions, including your life and possibly your soul to save the child? Ask yourselves and answer, I wish to know." 
<br><br>
"I'd do anything, Megaera. I would walk to the ends of the universe, should hope of seeing them safe be possible. But its not; there is nothing we can do, and even the High Elves have ever been able to attack the city of Neriak without enormous casualties." Drysart spoke with reason, and as far as he knew, the truth. 
<br><br>
Megaera paused, then asked, "What if I told ye that hope was not lost, that there was a way that we could rescue the child and Vinalrii's body at a great risk." 
<br><br>
Drysart's eyes narrowed and he sat forward. "What are you saying, Megaera? How could this possibly be?" 
<br><br>
Megaera sat down across from the two, and spoke, "There is a secret entrace into Neriak, Drysart, though I do not know if it is guarded. Let me tell ye a story, a story of mine past, and how it may be possible to move undetected in the place that seems impossible to breech." 
<br><br>
"Some time ago, a lead a group of friends into the dark city of Neriak. We had come on a mission of secrecy, a mission where we sought to find answers to unanswered questions. The question I sought was why had mine sister come to Norrath?" 
<br><br>
"A longtime friend entered the city through the main gates, cloaked in the form of a dark one. I watched through his eyes with a powerful spell. We walked downwards into Norrath's crust, and after a week of hidding and searching, we found a secret and unguarded entrance. A day later, I lead the rest of mine companions through this entrance." 
<br><br>
"We made our way to the lower city, where we were set upon by guards. We slew the guards quickly, but one of mine party was captured." Megaera takes a sip of wine, and ponders her words. Should I tell them it was I? "Mine companions and I did escape, however, and all turned out well. I do not know if the enterance still exists." 
<br><br>
"I did see mine sister, however. An evil presence resides within the husk that I use to share my most secret thoughts with. She hurt me so bad, many years ago, but on this meeting, I found my hope within her. As I left Neriak behind, I knew I'd return again." 
<br><br>
Megaera looks up and sighs. "And there is where our hope lies. Do ye have the heart to do what must be done? If we do this, we leave others unprotected for a time." 
<br><br>
Drysart looked at Megaera, unsure of what he had heard. Barishi nodded surely, a calm smile lie upon his face. The halfling had loved Vinalrii and would do anything for her. He had visited her while she had been a captive, and had been one of her closest friends. 
<br><br>
"Megaera, is what ye say, true? Is there really an entrance where we may enter? Please, say tis' true." 
<br><br>
"Aye Drysart, I would not lie to ye in a situation as serious as this. Relax Drysart," Megaera smiled, "Hope does exist." 
<br><br>
Megaera turned suddenly and walked over to the wine rack. Scanning for a few seconds, she chose a very rich wine, and walked back to the other two. 
<br><br>
"I have set before ye a choice. Do we risk all that we have to enter the city of Neriak? Do we have the courage to do so." Megaera pours three glasses of wine and sets them in front of her friends. 
<br><br>
"Choose a glass if ye choose to rescue the child and Vinalrii's body. I hereby charge who ever drinks the wine of the color of blood, that they be bound to their word and their promises." "If ye drink from the cup of binding, be you bound into our fellowship, for we will not leave the city of Neriak without accomplishing what we set ourselves to do." 
<br><br>
Picking up her glass, the wizard Megaera threw back her head and drank. Her thoughts were not only of Vinalrii and the child that she bore, but of the image of her sister, pleading for help upon the steps of the dungeon. 
<br><br>
Barishi picked up his glass and eyed it warily. A strange look crossed his face as he stared at the wine. 
<br><br>
Drysart eyed Megaera and Barishi. The shadow of total dispair had left his eyes renewed by a new hope. "Meg, I will go alone." 
<br><br>
This brought a smile from Megaera's face. 
<br><br>
"Nay, Drysart. Only I know where the entrance lies, and ye would not live long on your own in the dark city. We only travel as companions. Ye must agree to mine request. It will be our only chance." 
<br><br>
Drysart frowned, and in a swift motion, he picked up his glass and drank. Barishi watched and again looked at the wine in the glass. 
<br><br>
"Will ye come with us, Barishi. If so ye must drink from the glass," said the wizard Megaera. "It will bind us closely for we must not be broken where we go." 
<br><br>
"I will go, Megaera, but I promised Desire that I would not partake of alkeyhol," Barishi said as he looked at the glass. 
<br><br>
Megaera smiled and spoke, "Barishi, I don't think Desire would mind ye drinking wine for this purpose. We drink not to enjoy its taste, but to charge ourselves with a task that is important in our hearts." 
<br><br>
And with that Barishi drank, and the Fellowship of the Grey Child was bound. A silence was in the tavern that night, while the three drank a binding of honor and courage. 
<br><br>
Megaera watched her companions closely, a weight had been lifted from their features with a charge so dangerous that many in the realms would quaff at the idea. "We are a fellowship of like hearts, my friends. We will triumph against what we fear, and I truely believe that we shall see the light of day again once we enter the darkness." 
<br><br>
Megaera turned to leave. "Now if ye excuse me, I must get packed. We have much to do before we are ready." 
<br><br>
And with the words, Megaera turned and walked towards the stairs. Drysart spoke from behind just as she stepped upon the first step. 
<br><br>
"Megaera," the wizard spoke,"Thank you." 
<br><br>
Megaera smiled and replied,"Drysart, thank ye as well. We both hope to rescue a loved one whom has been used against us. Sleep well, Wizard, we leave when ye are ready." 
<br><br>
--- The Fellowship of the Grey Child formed this day, a day that two wizards and a halfling would remember for all their days.
