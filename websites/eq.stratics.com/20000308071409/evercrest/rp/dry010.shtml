Days turned into weeks, which in turn passed into months.  The guild all
learned of Drysart and Vinalrii.  Instead of being cold and unaccepting,
as Drysart had originally feared, they accepted the dark elf with open
arms, allowing her to sit in their tavern.
<br><br>
Drysart was happy that she was accepted. Being among the guild was the
safest place for her to be. But, at the same time, he was deeply concerned.
Vinalrii had fallen in love with the wizard, but his feelings were not
the same for her. He would take care of both the forthcoming child and it's
mother, but would he love her? He could never love a dark elf. It was just
a matter of time before the issue came to a head...
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Rubicant sat alone in his bedchamber.  Neither Drysart nor the page he
carried were in his thoughts at the time. It was late, and he was preparing
to retire for the evening when there was a knock at his door.
<br><br>
Vinalrii stepped through the door and into his bedchamber. By this time,
her pregnancy was quite apparent. She spoke in an almost reverential
tone, "Good evening, m'lord."
<br><br>
Rubicant glanced up at her and smiled warmly. He wrapped his arms around
her and held her in a warm embrace. "How is the little one?" he asked,
pulling himself away to look at Vinalrii's growing stomach.
<br><br>
She laughed slightly, "she's doing well, although I wish she would walk
herself around at times, she's getting rather heavy."
<br><br>
Rubicant kneeled down and pressed his ear up to the child. He listened for
a moment before standing. "What of the father? When will you bring him
here?"
<br><br>
Vinalrii smiled devilishly, "soon enough."
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Drysart sat with Vinalrii at a table in the tavern. She looked at him, her
eyes filling with tears, and a shocked expression on her face. He had just
told her that he didn't share the love that she had for him. He knew what
was coming.
<br><br>
She stood and stepped back. Drysart stood as well. The other patrons of the
tavern took notice. He stepped forward and put his hand on her arm, trying
to comfort her, "I will still take care of you. I've promised that,
haven't I?"
<br><br>
Her eyes filled with anger. She felt cheated. Her voice raised to a yell
as she pushed him to the ground, "Don't touch me! Leave me alone!" she
stormed out the tavern door and ran right into the armored elves who
had been about the enter the tavern.
<br><br>
*****
<br><br>
Drysart stood up from the floor and sat back down at the table. He put his
head in his hands and wondered what he had just done.
<br><br>
Four high elves, outfitted in platemail, burst into the tavern. One of
them held Vinalrii who was struggling fruitlessly to get away. Another one
stepped forward and addressed the tavern.
<br><br>
"Good people, we are from the Royal Guard of the great city of Felwithe. It
has come to our attention that one of you, Drysart Pennoble, has begat a
child with this dark elf." He gestured to Vinalrii and looked over everyone
in the tavern. "I suggest, Drysart, that you step forward."
<br><br>
Drysart looked over at the guard. Taking a deep breath, he stood and stepped
toward the guard.
<br><br>
The guard looked at Drysart for a moment, then turned to two of the other
guards. "Seize him."
<br><br>
The guards moved forward and grabbed Drysart. The guards with Drysart and
Vinalrii left the tavern as the last guard apologized to the tavern for
the disturbance, before returning with their prisoners to Felwithe.
