     Darter Elfgard turned away from his friend and faced the lich, ignoring the moisture in his eyes.  Back to back to back, the barbarian warriors and the ranger fought for their lives.  Shouting warcries, firing arrows and swinging with all their might, the trio created a pile of snow orc bodies around them.  Huntra cut the ice giant down like a huge oak, and, like an oak, its downfall caused the earth to tremble. Suddenly, they were engulfed in crimson flames.   Everything went dark, dark, dark...<p>
     "....Dart, Dart, Darter!  I know you can hear me!  Drink some of this."  Darter croaked a question and instinctively swallowed the warm liquid placed to his lips.  Volgar sighed sadly as he looked at his bandaged comrade.  "Ah, Dart, you have a lion's courage, but you are barely strong enough to survive this harsh land of ours.  You'll do, though.  Aye, you'll do just fine."<p>
     Huntra placed her hand on her clanmate's arm and said, "Lets leave him be for now.  He still needs much rest."  Volgar nodded.  They turned, arm in arm, and left their new friend in the hospice to heal and recover his strength.   After they left Darter stared at the ceiling, blinking his eyes.<p>
     Two weeks later, The ranger had his bandages removed and was allowed out of the bed to recover his strength.  Volgar and Huntra took him on long walks around their home village, helping him get his muscles back in tone.  As he grew stronger, they extended the walks into day hikes and finally mountain climbing to restore his confidence and agility.  After a month they judged he was ready for his first big hunt.<p>
     "Well, Dart," said Huntra, "Ye been layin' around here eatin' up our food and drinkin' our ale long enough.  Time ye earned yer keep!  We're going on a mammoth hunt today and you're invited.  We could use your trackin' skills, believe it or not.  For bein' so big, they can be fearsome hard to find sometimes."<p>
     "Mammoth hunt, eh?  Aye, and I will be glad to join ye.  I am gettin' a rash on me tail from sittin' around here so much, heh."  Darter walked over and grabbed his bow and quiver from the corner.  The trio packed a trail lunch, gathered their weapons, and set out on their venture.<p>
     Volgar picked up mammoth sign within the hour, and Darter took the lead.  Suddenly he stopped and looked around, wearing a puzzled frown.  <p>
     "What's up, Dart?" asked Volgar.<p>
     The ranger sighed and said, "I don't know, but I have lost the trail.  I can't seem to find any sign anywhere."<p>
     Huntra carefully searched the area, walked over to a low bush and picked up a coarse hair.  "Here,"  she said, "looks like one passed near this bush."<p>
     Darter blanched as he rushed over and inspected the hair.  "There is something very wrong here.  I never should have missed that."  He looked at his new friends.  "What's wrong with me?"  he asked plaintively.  "Why can't I track like I used to?"<p>
     Not knowing what to say, Hunta and Volgar shrugged their shoulders and looked away in embarrassment.<p>
     "Tell ye what, Darter," said Huntra, "We'll all track together and see if your skills come back to you after some practice.  Maybe that lich weakened your abilities in some way.  Time and practice may help you recover them."<p>
     "Aye, my friend,"  said Volgar, "don't give up hope yet."  He gave Darter a friendly slap on the back, nearly propelling him off the mountain trail into the ravine below.<p>
     The hunters moved on, taking their time and searching for sign.  As the day wore on, Darter grew more and more quiet and withdrawn.<p>
     In the early afternoon they found themselves on the edge of a mountain meadow.  They halted at the treeline and thoroughly inspected the open area.  There on the opposite edge, they spotted a mammoth grazing.<p>
    "Dart, ye stay here and make good use of your bow.  Volgar and I will work our way down wind.  When you see us charge the mammoth, let fly with your arrows."  Darter nodded grimly and unslung his bow.<p>
     Volgar and Huntra slipped into the forest.  Darter grinned at how quiet they were, in spite of being such big brutes.  He settled back to wait and caught himself worrying over his lost tracking skills.  He almost missed the initial charge on the mammoth, but noticed in time and let fly with his arrows.  He gasped in dismay as his arrow flew wide of the mark, almost hitting Volgar instead.  He ran closer to the fray and let fly again.  He overshot his mark.  Growling in rage, he broke his bow over a boulder and pulled out his hunting knife.  He charged the mammoth.<p>
     Shouting and running, Volgar and Huntra advanced on the mammoth and jabbed it with their spears.  Darter literally ran up the mammoth's trunk and stabbed it in the eye with his knife.  The mammoth screamed in pain and tossed his mighty head, sending Darter somersaulting into the meadow.  Bellowing in rage, the mammoth turned and thundered into the forest.  The three hunters gave chase.  They managed to flank the huge creature and herded it over a cliff into the ravine below.<p>
    "Well, " panted Volgar, "there's more'n one way to kill a mammoth, eh Dart?"  Huntra laughed out loud and gave out a whoop of victory.  Everyone smiled in triumph, recovering their breath and thrilling in the excitement of the hunt.  Then Darter grew somber as he remembered his missed shots.<p>
     "I don't understand it.  First my tracking, and now my archery is gone.  What am I going to do?  I can't be a ranger without those skills."  The elf frowned and turned from the others, working his way down to the carcass.<p>
     Huntra and Volgar looked at each other sadly, then followed him down.<p>
     They spent the night at the kill site, cleaning the carcass and making a cache so they could come back for what they couldn't carry with them.  That evening Darter sat and stared into the fire, saying nothing.<p>
     The next day they hiked back to their village.  As they approached, Huntra and Volgar yelled and whooped joyfully, letting their clan mates know their hunt was a success.  The clan chief organized a pack train to fetch the rest of the kill.  He grinned broadly and engulfed the trio in a great bear hug.  "Tonight we celebrate!  Tunare must be thanked for providing us with such a great store of food!"          <p>
That evening the entire clan gathered round a huge bonfire, eating mammoth steaks and drinking Halas heaters.  After the meal, Volgar got up and acted out their hunt for the enjoyment of the clan.  "Then Darter grabbed his hunting knife and ran right up the mammoth's trunk!  He stabbed it right in the eye!"<p>
    "In the eye?" they shouted.<p>
    "Aye, in the eye!"  Volgar replied.<p>
     The barbarians rolled on the ground laughing.  Darter beamed at the clan, a broad smile on his face.<p>
     "Someone should write a song about that," said a voice from the crowd.<p>
     "Aye, 'tis a shame we have no bard," Huntra commented.<p>
     "Well," said Darter, "I don't claim to be a bard, but then I haven't been much of a ranger lately, either.  But I can tune a lute and sing ye a song ye might enjoy, if ye'll bear with me rusty voice."<p>
     "Aye, a song, a song!" they all shouted.<p>
     "Arvan!  Go fetch Darter's lute, and take care ye don't break it!"  the clan chief roared good naturedly.  The boy beamed with pride and ran off to do his chief's bidding.  Before long he returned, carrying the lute as though it were precious crystal.<p>
    "Thankee, me lad."  Darter grinned and winked at the boy,  who puffed up his chest and strutted back to his place by the fire.  He then smiled at all the ladies as he tuned the sapphire blue lute.  His eyes sparkled as he sung:
	<blockquote>
             I'm tellin' ye now, dear ladies, sweet ladies<div>
             Don't make the mistake o' lovin' a bard.
<p>
             For a bard will ramble an' a bard will roam<div>
             Ladies, you know, he'll never stay home!<div>
             Aye, a bard will ramble an' a bard will roam<div>
             Destined to live his life out alone!
</blockquote>
     Darter grinned broadly and strummed a catchy tune:
	 <blockquote>
             Not meanin' ta hurt ye, dear ladies, sweet ladies,<div>
             But only a fool would fall fer a bard.
			 <p>
             'Cause a bard's gotta ramble an' a bard's gotta roam,<div>
             No way in this world could a bard stay at home.<div>
             His fate is to ramble an' his fate is to roam,<div>
             Far from the warmpth o' a hearth or a home!.
</blockquote>
     The barbarians took up the rhythm, clapping and drumming:
	 <blockquote>
             Please take my advice, dear ladies, sweet ladies<div>
             A bard will only play wit' yer heart.
<p>
             'Cause a bard must ramble an' a bard must roam<div>
             No way could a bard stay in one home!<div>
             Aye, a bard must ramble an' a bard must roam<div>
             The open road is his only home
</blockquote>
     Darter laid his sapphire blue lute to the side and bowed.  The clan clapped and cheered, then went on celebrating deep into the night.  Exhausted and even somewhat content, Darter finally made his way to his bed. <p>
     That night he had a dream.  He dreamed that Tunare, the mother of all, came to him and took him for a walk in the wilderness.<p>
     "Look around you, my child, and tell me what you see."<p>
     Darter looked around and replied, "I see trees and animals, I see the wind blowing the leaves and the rain making circles in the pond."<p>
     "Now tell me, what would you see if there was no wind, no rain?"<p>
     He thought about it for a moment.  "Nothing."<p>
     Tunare beamed and hugged him.  "You are right, for without the wind and the rain, there would be no life.  I want you to meet someone."  She gestured at the storm clouds and the formless took on shape and substance, descended and stood before Tunare and <p>
Darter.
     "Karana, I leave Darter in your charge, guide him and show him the value of the wandering wind and the power of the falling rain.  Teach him well and show him wisdom."<p>
     Karana bowed and smiled.  "That I shall m'lady.  I will be with you always,  Darter, for I see within you the wandering spirit.  I shall show you the power of lightning, the nurturing of rain and the strength of wind.  Then, someday, ye shall be as quick as lighting, as gentle as mist, and as swift as wind.  Ye shall wander this world and sow knowledge and understanding as the wind spreads seeds and sows new life upon the land."  Then Karana did become as mist and rise back into the rolling clouds.<p>
     Tunare guided Darter back to his room and hugged him once more.  "Remember, Darter,  without the forces of Karana, my world would be as barren and lifeless as yon moon.  Those who follow Karana have much to offer this land."<p>
     Somehow suddenly shy, Darter hung his head and nodded silently.  When he raised his eyes, Tunare was gone.<p>
     The following afternoon  (everyone overslept after the previous night's revelries)  Darter gingerly walked around with an aching head and a thoughtful manner.<p>
    Volgar laughed to see Darter in such a state and said, "I'm thinkin' ya need a little fur of the wolf that bit ya, my friend, what say we go to an inn I like to visit now and then?"<p>
     Darter shrugged his shoulders and replied, "Why not, can't be any worse off then I am right now, eh?"<p>
     Huntra and Volgar grinned at each other,  took him by his elbows and marched him off along a mountain trail.  Soon they arrived at an out of the way inn,  apparently not often frequented.  A sign above the door said Everflowing Keg.<p>
     "Mind yer manners, now, Darter, for its not everyone who is welcome here," said Huntra.<p>
     Darter nodded and smiled, a secret sparkle in his eyes.<p>
     Volgar burst into the tavern and roared,  "Now just where is the good fer nothin' owner of this rat hole, and why isn't there an ale in me hand yet?"<p>
     Alerik, a fellow barbarian, roared back as he leaped over the bar and grabbed Volgar, pulling him off his feet, "By the shadow of Rallos Zek!  There must be frost giants at yer heels, to chase the likes of you into me fair establishment!"  He dropped Volgar and grabbed Huntra, kissing her soundly.  "Aiyee!  Ye gets more beautiful every time I see ye, darlin!  When ye gonna sell thisn' and come work for me?"  Alerik jerked a thumb in Volgar's direction and gave Darter a broad wink. <p>
     Huntra laughed heartily and said, "Oh, I guess I'll keep him for awhile yet!"  She began to make introductions.  "Alerik, this is..."<p>
     "Darter Elfgard, aye, we've met, and he has made himself welcome.  Why, even that shadow hangin' sourpuss has accepted his presence summat, heh."  Alerik glanced into a dark corner at Grymm Umbra, the solitary drow.<p>
     Huntra and Volgar looked at Darter with raised eyebrows.  "Ye've been here before, have ye?"<p>
     "Aye, once, on the night we camped on our way to the frigid wastes.  I needed to clear me thoughts about that smelly troll, Trukk, and found this place quite by accident."<p>
     Volgar said, "Maybe it was an accident, maybe not.  I find very little happens by accident.  However that may be, ya found a good place, and that is truth!"<p>
     Alerik led them to a table near the fire and brought them all a round of drinks.  For hours they sat and talked of adventures they had shared in the past, laughing and joking.  As the night grew on, they bragged more and more of their prowess with sword and knife.<p>
Up against a far wall was a throwing target, and the barbarians began a contest to test their range and accuracy.<p>
     Alerik turned to Darter and held out the throwing daggers to him.  "Come try yer hand, Darter,  let's see what ye can do!"<p>
     Darter shook his head ruefully and tried to decline.  "I'm not much fer thrown weapons, friend Alerik,  the bow is my weapon, or was, until recently."<p>
    Alerik urged him on, "Ye never know, lessn ye try,  besides, 'tis all in fun."<p>
    Darter sighed in resignation and accepted the knives.  Without rising from his seat, he quickly threw the first knife toward the target.  Bullseye.  Astonished, he looked from the target to the knives in his hand, then up at Alerik.<p>
     "Aiyee!  Was that a lucky shot, or were ye just funnin' me about not throwing knives?"<p>
     "No, really, my friend, I have never made it a practice to handle thrown weapons!  I don't understand..."<p>
     "Finish out yer round, Darter,  we'll see if it was luck or talent that was behind the first throw," said Huntra.<p>
     Darter threw, then threw again.  Bullseye, and bullseye again.  Amazed, he looked at his friends and helplessly shrugged his shoulders.<p>
     A gravelly voice spoke from the shadows.  Grymm.  "I don't know what class ye profess to be,  but I know what I have seen with my eyes.  And I know what I have heard<p>
with my ears.  I have seen your skills and I have heard your songs.  I say ye are worthy of the name....bard.  In my eyes, so shall ye be.  Bard."  He fell silent.<p>
     "Bard, eh?" Darter pondered, half to himself. He thought back to the past weeks;  his loss of his ranger abilities,  Tunare's visit,  his bond with Karana, the feelings he saw reflected in the faces of his listeners when he sang his songs, his unexplained talents.  They all pointed to the way of the bard.  "Ye may be right, friend Grymm, ye may be right, at that."
