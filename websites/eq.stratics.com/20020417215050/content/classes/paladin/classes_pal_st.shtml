                    When we think of Paladins, we think of Holy Warriors, of mighty 
                    fighters, sworn to use their whole lives to serve the sacred 
                    ideal of their God. We think of these blessed heroes who fight 
                    to protect the weak and the innocent, these fearless soldiers 
                    of Light. In EverQuest however, not every Paladin has chosen 
                    to live only for these Sacred Ideals. But no matter if you 
                    choose to be the Holier of the Holiest or if you decided to 
                    role-play your character in a more conservative manner, this 
                    paladin overview will let you understand better the way of 
                    the sacred knights. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses 
                    is an important step in mastering your character and knowing 
                    how to play it optimally, and playing your character optimally 
                    is a small part of the greater objective you seek to achieve: 
                    having fun while fighting and role-playing your way through 
                    the lands of Norrath. </font>

                  Benefits and Disadvantages</font></b> </font> 
                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please 
                    sit down friends, grab ale, and listen. The noble path of 
                    the paladins is indeed a rewarding one. There are some hardships 
                    to be met along the way, but the rewards are great. First, 
                    let me explain to you what our strengths and weaknesses are. 
                    First of all, the paladin is a fighter before all, and his 
                    sword is often his best bet to overcome his enemies. But after 
                    level 9, he is also endowed with clerical magic, which can 
                    often be a life saviour for him. Like if it wasn't enough, 
                    the paladin is blessed with the ability to heal by laying 
                    hands once an EverQuest day (90 minutes in real time), and 
                    we get this power in the beginning of the game, at level one. 
                    This ability is a great one for sure. It allows the paladin 
                    to heal an enormous amount of hit points and can be used either 
                    on himself or on a friend in need. It can often save one's 
                    life, especially when the healers are low on mana and when 
                    there is no other way to refill your health bar. But of course, 
                    it should be used carefully since you must wait quite some 
                    time before using this precious skill again. Our ability to 
                    heal and use white magic makes us a lot more versatile and 
                    self-sufficient than regular fighters, not only when soloing, 
                    but also in groups, where we can save the day when the 'regular' 
                    healers are low on mana. And finally, we also have a last 
                    big advantage that can make us mightier than most warriors 
                    even without using our magic: our artefacts. Paladins can 
                    use some mighty magical weapons that are restricted to the 
                    paladin class only: the Holy Swords. These are undoubtedly 
                    the most powerful weapons in Norrath. The mighty Fiery Avenger 
                    is an example of these weapons. However do not expect to find 
                    of these easily, as only the mightiest and the purest of the 
                    Holy Knights manage to get one, someday. They are one of our 
                    long term advantages. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
                      of course, there is also downsides to our class. We get 
                      a small but noticeable experience penalty, which makes it 
                      about 20% longer for us to gain levels. Human Paladins can 
                      partly compensate this with the human ability to gain levels 
                      faster, but the other races may notice that paladins are 
                      harder to level than other non-hybrid classes. And of course, 
                      we do not possess all the abilities of warriors and clerics. 
                      Let me explain: in pure melee, which doesn't involve any 
                      magic, we aren't as good as warriors on the battlefield. 
                      They have about 20-25% more hit points (don't get me wrong, 
                      we still have a lot) and they get double attack sooner than 
                      we do (level 15 instead of level 20). They also have dual 
                      wield and kick; two battle skills that we do not have access 
                      to. Dual Wield allows warriors to use 2 weapons simultaneously, 
                      and kick gives them the opportunity to kick their enemies 
                      to inflict additional damage. Although very useful, these 
                      abilities aren't vital, and we can still fare very well 
                      without them. And finally, we do not have access to the 
                      archery skill, while others do. But don't get discouraged 
                      yet, we are still very powerful in close combat, and except 
                      the warriors and the monks, very few can match our melee 
                      skill. We still have others very important advantages. We 
                      can use all weapons (except bows) and all armours available 
                      in Norrath. Also, as soon as we reach level 9, we gain several 
                      clerical spells that can be life saviour more than once. 
                      And since we have access to our special ability to lay hands 
                      at the very beginning, we don't have to worry about staying 
                      alive as much as a warrior does. And, as I said before, 
                      we have the ability to use the Holy Swords. Their superior 
                      power gives to the few paladins that get them the possibility 
                      to inflict much more damage to their opponents than a warrior 
                      of the same level would do, even if he is using his dual 
                      wield ability. Not only that, but these swords are enhanced 
                      with great abilities like randomly casting expulse undead 
                      when using them against undead opponents. It's of course 
                      a simple example and any relation to the actual powers of 
                      an existing weapon is a pure coincidence or is it? :) </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                      have heard too often that Paladins were warriors wanna-be 
                      or weak fighters with ridiculously weak magic. For some 
                      time, I even believed these foolish rumours. But one day 
                      I understood the truth: we are generally stronger than warriors 
                      are. Why? Because of the complementarily of our magic. The 
                      powers our God grants us focus in three domains. Healing, 
                      buffing and anti-undead. The first category allows us to 
                      remain alive in battles were warriors would often die or 
                      have to wait a long time to regenerate their life after 
                      the battle. This gives us one advantage: versatility. When 
                      warriors need a Cleric to be efficient, we can solo pretty 
                      well without any danger of dying from disease or poison. 
                      Our healing skills reduce greatly our 'downtimes' as we 
                      can heal ourselves. Not only during battle to survive, but 
                      also after battle to be ready to fight again immediately, 
                      when a twenty minute break is often needed for the soloing 
                      high level warrior. In parties, we can also act as emergency 
                      healers when the healers are out of mana, this is one of 
                      the big advantages of our class. Our second category, the 
                      buffing spells are the ones that destroy this 'weak warriors 
                      with weak magic' myth. They allow paladins to increase their 
                      strength, armour class and hit points on the battlefield. 
                      They make a critical difference on the battlefield, as they 
                      allow you to take on significantly harder monsters more 
                      safely. A paladin using a spell such as 'center' can easily 
                      be more powerful in melee than a warrior of the same level 
                      who doesn't. And finally, the 'undead' category allows us 
                      to take on undead monsters of levels that would make a regular 
                      warrior of the same level to flee in terror, and make us 
                      very useful in undead dungeons. So here is the point: the 
                      magic of a paladin is the perfect complement of its fighting 
                      abilities. So its not true to say that paladins are weaker 
                      later on because they can't specialise or that their spells 
                      are useless. They make a big difference in battle and increase 
                      the paladin's power greatly. At higher levels, the paladins 
                      gets stronger comparatively to the other classes, and the 
                      rumours saying the opposite are false. In higher levels, 
                      we get powerful magic, which, although weaker than the magic 
                      of a Cleric of the same level, make us a lot more efficient, 
                      especially if we consider our always useful lay hands skill. 
                      Of course, we shouldn't forget that in these high levels, 
                      they could get these Holy Swords I've been talking about</font>

                    that you know what makes us strong and efficient, let's see 
                    what await us in our travels. When creating your paladin, 
                    you'll have to choose between many interesting races. They 
                    are well balanced and all the possibilities allow you to create 
                    a good paladin. I advise to choose your race according to 
                    your role-playing interests instead of their statistics, but 
                    there are still things that are important to consider. First, 
                    night vision is very useful, even if it's not essential. Small 
                    races get an AC bonus that can be very useful. Once you'll 
                    have decided what you prefer, you'll have 20 points to assign 
                    to your various statistics. Strength, Stamina, Wisdom and 
                    Charisma are your primary statistics. Strength and Wisdom, 
                    in my opinion are the most important ones. Stamina also plays 
                    an important role, since you need high hit points to be able 
                    to melee effectively. However, always remember that other 
                    statistics also play a role. Intelligence makes you learn 
                    skills faster. Agility and dexterity can affect significantly 
                    your efficiency in battle. Once you'll have distributed your 
                    points in the way that you see fit; your adventure will begin. 
                    You start with the regular newbie equipment. As always, find 
                    your guildhall and give your guildnote to your master, train 
                    your first melee weapon and you are ready to begin. At this 
                    point your struggle for the 9th level begins, the level where 
                    you leave your relative weakness behind and finally fully 
                    access the great status of paladinhood. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm 
                      not here to tell you what to do step by step in your journeys, 
                      but I'll give you a few pointers to help you to advance 
                      safely and quickly. The golden rule is to take your time, 
                      as patience is a virtue. When travelling, you must be careful 
                      to do not attack stronger monsters. Using the /con command 
                      will tell you who you can fight. You must be careful, especially 
                      when you are alone, as monsters are strong, fast, and they 
                      can gang up on you easily. The smarter monsters will often 
                      group quickly, try to surround you or even call for reinforcements. 
                      Always remember that bravery isn't always the best choice: 
                      running back to the guards when overwhelmed can often save 
                      your life. So, should you ever be outmatched or in a bad 
                      posture, try to run to the nearest town or guard tower to 
                      get help from the mighty soldiers. Another important thing 
                      is to make reliable friends. While in Norrath, be a nice 
                      guy, since a jerks have a hard time making any friends, 
                      and friends are the most precious weapon and armor at the 
                      same time. When you begin in Norrath, try to behave like 
                      a real paladin. Begging for weaponry and gold isn't a good 
                      idea. Others found their precious gear by themselves, and 
                      you should try to do so as well. And you probably know there 
                      is nothing more annoying than a newbie broadcasting that 
                      he needs help, and it's certainly not the best way to build 
                      your reputation. If you really need help, asking in a role-playing 
                      manner is almost always the best choice to obtain a quick 
                      and helpful answer. After all everyone prefers an 'Excuse 
                      me, kind sir, I am lost in this magnificent city and I would 
                      appreciate if you could tell me where I can find to Guild 
                      of the Paladins, as I have to go there imperatively' than 
                      a 'Hey, man, I'm a newbeez and I want you to tell em where 
                      I can find my !@#$%?&*! Guild Hall!' And after all, EverQuest 
                      is a role playing game. Also, when you are soloing, don't 
                      steal kills, help whoever you can, and let be assured that 
                      it'll pay back someday. And when you group with other people, 
                      don't hesitate to take risks to help them when needed. You 
                      are a part of the team, and it's your duty to protect your 
                      companions at all costs, as they should protect you. Remember 
                      who is reliable and who isn't, and the next time you'll 
                      know who you can trust and who you can't. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking 
                      of grouping, around level 3 or 4, you should really think 
                      of grouping to increase your experience faster. Soloing 
                      is possible, but grouping is so much more effective, especially 
                      before you get your healing powers. In general, remember 
                      to take your time and you'll advance little by little. If 
                      you are in trouble, remember that you can use lay hands, 
                      it'll surely save your life more than once. Setting it as 
                      a macro for critical situations is also a good idea. Should 
                      you die, do not panic, as long as you can get back to your 
                      corpse, it'll be okay. But be sure to not die in places 
                      where you cannot retrieve it, or you could lose a lot, and 
                      I mean it. Should you die in an enemy camp or another very 
                      dangerous place, make sure to gather a few friends quickly 
                      to retrieve your belongings before they decay and get lost 
                      forever. And remember that if you die before level 5, it's 
                      not very important since you don't lose any experience and 
                      restart with supplies. After that point, however, you incur 
                      more important penalties. Finally, always be careful when 
                      planning your budget, money is very important in Norrath. 
                      Especially for a paladin as your money situation doesn't 
                      shine a lot, since you have to afford weapons, armor and 
                      also spells. Even if they doesn't cost much initially, you 
                      could have a few problems with more advanced ones if you 
                      don't plan ahead to get some money in advance. If you need 
                      money, here are a few tips. Never waste a single copper, 
                      bank every penny that you can spare. Instead of paying for 
                      items, try to find them while adventuring. Sometimes it's 
                      not possible, but I already paid quite a lot for a chainmail 
                      and found an enchanted one that was much better only a few 
                      minutes after, so plan your important expenses in advance 
                      too. If you really need money in early levels, fishing may 
                      help you a lot. You can get some fish to sell for quite 
                      a nice amount of money, and if you are lucky, you may even 
                      find some rusty weapons or such in the water. Fishing is 
                      easy to build up and after all, a skill point gained anywhere 
                      is gained forever. Well, if you follow these small pieces 
                      of advice, I guarantee that you will progress smoothly and 
                      that soon you'll be reach the 9th level and receive your 
                      first spells. For a young paladin, patience is everything.</font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, 
                    you did it, you have your magic, and a new life begins for 
                    you. You are now a real paladin. Since it's not trained, your 
                    magic will indeed be weak at first, but don't worry, spare 
                    a few points in early levels to train your magic and then 
                    use it a lot, soon you'll find that your powers are much more 
                    useful than you could have hoped for. And now the world lies 
                    before you. But don't get excited too fast, young one, as 
                    a little magic doesn't make you invincible. And remember to 
                    watch your mana gauge. Always save at least 30-40% of it in 
                    case of a very important emergency. At level 15 and 22 you 
                    will receive new spells and they will help you a lot more. 
                    By then you will slowly acquire enough money to buy chainmail 
                    armor. And for you powergamers out there, don't get discouraged 
                    at level 15 to see your warriors friends with dual wield and 
                    double attack, you'll get double attack yourself at level 
                    20 and you will laugh at their double attack once you'll hold 
                    a Holy Sword in your hands. And these are only a few of the 
                    great prospects that lie before you. By the time you reach 
                    level 22 and gain access to the 3rd circle of spells, you'll 
                    have developed your magical skills and you'll be a great fighter 
                    who'll know how to dodge, parry, riposte, taunt, bash and 
                    double attack. These are the battle skills that you gain access 
                    to, and don't worry, you can use them quite efficiently. To 
                    be able to use double attack effectively, however, I recommend 
                    that you save about 20 to 30 practices and throw them on that 
                    skill as you gain it at level 20. At that point, teamwork 
                    becomes essential. You really cannot advance in high levels 
                    in EverQuest all by yourself. And even at level 3 or 4, teamwork 
                    often pays much more than soloing. So here are a few pointers 
                    about the role of a paladin in a group. Before I begin, note 
                    that teamwork is generally considered as the most important 
                    aspect of EverQuest, no matter what. </font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                    a group, the Paladin plays mainly the role of a warrior. He 
                    is a tank that must protect the weaker spellcasters by taunting 
                    the monsters and taking the majority of the blows and inflicting 
                    damage upon them. But, of course, you are more than a warrior 
                    is. First of all, never forget to use your magic to boost 
                    yourself before an important battle, spells like courage and 
                    center makes a big difference. If the healers of your party 
                    are low on mana or if there isn't any healer with you, use 
                    your powers sparingly, as your mana reserve isn't unlimited. 
                    Heal only when it is very necessary, and remember those handy 
                    Lay Hands if you got nothing else to protect your friends 
                    and yourself. Often, you will be the difference between life 
                    and death for your party. But knowing how to fight isn't all 
                    you have to do, remember that there is other people fighting 
                    with you. Know how they operate and work with them. Taunting 
                    is also very important; it's used to increase the level of 
                    hate of your enemies toward you. The point is to prevent the 
                    enemies from attacking the weaker spellcasters too much and 
                    instead concentrating their power on you. You'll learn quickly 
                    that the best way to win a battle is to protect the casters 
                    efficiently. After all, if there is a healer keeping the tanks 
                    alive and a wizard destroying the monsters that try to flee 
                    or cause you too much trouble, how could you lose? As you 
                    spent time exploring Norrath with your friends, you'll undoubtedly 
                    get to create your own battle strategies, the only thing that 
                    is important is to remember to know how your friends operate 
                    and support them as much as possible. Finally, remember that 
                    you aren't in direct competition with the other members of 
                    your party to do the biggest amount of damage to the enemy; 
                    you all receive the same share of experience no matter who 
                    does the more damage to the enemy (Well as long as you are 
                    of the same level or a close level). Following the directives 
                    of the group leader is always the best way to optimise the 
                    gain and the fun your party can have. And if you are the leader 
                    then be sure to lead well, know where you are going and be 
                    fair with everyone. That is how you'll forge a successful 
                    group to destroy the forces of evil that plague the lands. 
                    Grouping efficiently is an important skill to master, and 
                    it's one of the most important ones in EverQuest. </font>

                    that you have a better understanding of the paladin class 
                    (well, at least, I hope so), I'd like to remind you that fighting 
                    isn't everything in a role-playing game. There is a reason 
                    why EverQuest is group oriented: it is to allow you to have 
                    fun and share and explore the lands with your friends. Having 
                    a good role-playing experience can be as much fun for you 
                    and your friends as slaying the strongest monsters of the 
                    land. In fact it can be much more fun, even if you don't consider 
                    yourself as a role-player, you should give it a try someday, 
                    and you may get to like it. As you noticed, this overview 
                    was mainly based on technical details, since it's purpose 
                    was to explain who are the paladins, what they can do and 
                    what they can't do. My advice may help you, but remember that 
                    you alone will never be able to slay a dragon. Making reliable 
                    friends is, I will never say it too much, more important than 
                    any sword you could ever find. Now have fun my friends, and
