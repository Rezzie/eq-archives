                    WHAT IS A GUILD, REALLY?</b> </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      the beginning, I didn't entire see the big picture. I thought, 
                      "Cool, we will have a unified presence in a game - making 
                      life in that game easier and more enjoyable. Common cause, 
                      common theme. The months turned to years, and we were actually 
                      doing a damn good job with running a guild, and attracting 
                      people who fit our mold. As with many guilds, we did a lot 
                      of growing and had our share of heartaches, successes, fame, 
                      etc. Through it all, one thing became quite evident: Our 
                      members really, really cared about each other - like a true 
                      family. We offered real world advice, a shoulder to lean 
                      on (and sometimes, cry upon) - and many other things common 
                      with 'REAL WORLD' friendships. All of a sudden, our "Guild" 
                      became a family of friends who will ALWAYS support each 
                      other in good times and bad. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, 
                      what is a guild, really? A guild is a place to hang your 
                      hat, a group that makes you smile and knows when you are 
                      doing well, or if you are not. A unity that is so great, 
                      that trust and respect are a given in most cases, and reciprocated 
                      often. A guild not only has the potential to do great things 
                      in the "Virtual" sense, it also has GREAT opportunity to 
                      do things in the "Real World" sense as well. As guilds grow, 
                      they become a melting pot of talent, creativity, professionalism, 
                      diversity, experience, and more. You will find that if you 
                      solicit information from your members, that you are no different 
                      than a large company, organization, 'club' or 'family'. 
                      If 'member x' loses his job from the Engineering Firm, odds 
                      are, 'member y' knows of someone hiring for that position. 
                      If 'member z' is now going through a divorce, odds are, 
                      'member b' has been there and can offer advice or support. 
                      Additionally, we all feel pride for the accomplishments 
                      of others - at least our guild does. If 'member c' has been 
                      hired by a new company, or perhaps promoted to a senior 
                      support role in a game, or 'whatever', we all feel equally 
                      excited about it. It is not uncommon for our members to 
                      communicate such things openly, and receive praise from 
                      others. It is this unity and camaraderie that keeps us growing 
                      and keeps us interested in the guild. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Really, 
                      a guild is a family, and if managed properly, it can be 
                      a family of friends for the rest of your life. Why not? 
                      Some of you are shaking your head, saying, "I think you 
                      are taking this just a little bit too far." I of course 
                      would beg to differ. It is this 'family' and 'community' 
                      vision that has kept us growing and introduced us to many, 
                      many wonderful people, as well as opened the doors for many 
                      opportunities - both in online gaming and in the real world. 
                      If I were a prospective recruit and had the choice of joining 
                      a 'guild' that was a loose bunch of people that didn't really 
                      'care' about unity, real life friendship, etc., or a guild 
                      that had a vision of things GREATER THAN simply playing 
                      games - I would choose the latter. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Consider 
                      the following:</b> I can go just about anywhere in the world 
                      and always be within 100 miles of a guildmate. This includes 
                      such places as: Ireland, Australia, Norway, Germany, Panama, 
                      Canada and ALL over the United States. I have already met 
                      several dozens of members, and never been disappointed with 
                      them. They are just as mature and friendly as their online 
                      persona. Now, keep in mind that I would NEVER meet someone 
                      from the guild, alone, in a non-public place. Trust is a 
                      good thing, but it is always better to take little steps 
                      and meet people in the safety of a public place, preferably 
                      with other friends/guildmates. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>II. 
                      VIRTUAL AND NON-VIRTUAL PRESENCE</b> </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No 
                      matter what game you are playing, you should try to get 
                      your members into the mindset of, "Teamwork, Unity, Brotherhood". 
                      Events are so much better and impressive when you are all 
                      together. Three people adventuring/hunting is NOTHING compared 
                      to a host of adventurers ready for battle! Imagine the surprise 
                      of those people on the Veeshan server (EverQuest) when the 
                      LOA hosted a night that consisted of "Running around the 
                      world as a 'pack of wolves'". Thirty people in wolf-form, 
                      running - flying - attacking. What do you think gets the 
                      most attention and respect? Keep this in mind, and always, 
                      ALWAYS push the limits of your imagination. Just make sure 
                      you push those limits as a TEAM, and support each other. 
                      Additionally, our AC faction now hosts "Akalabethian Tales" 
                      night in a guildhall. Imagine walking into a dimly lit chamber, 
                      greeted by 30 to 40 people, then enjoying a night of story-telling 
                      and bragging about past adventures and mysteries. It simply 
                      wouldn't be the same if two or three people did the same 
                      thing. Again, the presence you build as a guild is KEY. 
                      Use your numbers wisely, and PUSH events that require team 
                      involvement. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
                      for non-virtual presence, this simply means that at least 
                      once a year, you should TRY to host a REAL LIFE gathering 
                      of your members. Pick a place that is centrally located 
                      (if possible), or pick a place that is near the person initiating 
                      this gathering. If your guild is large enough, odds are, 
                      many will make a huge effort to attend. To date, we have 
                      hosted about 10 gatherings. Some large-scale, others were 
                      considered "mini-gatherings" that had 5 to 15 people in 
                      attendance. Either way, this is SUCH a great way to boost 
                      guild moral, friendship and the unity. When everyone returns 
                      home, gets online and enters the game or chat room - it 
                      is never the same again, but better. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About 
                      five months ago, the LOA decided to donate money to a charity 
                      (Salvation Army) as a guild. We collected about $500+ dollars 
                      and sent the payment to the charity in the name of our guild. 
                      Needless to say, we felt SO INCREDIBLE and so proud, it 
                      was immeasurable. Other guilds learned of this, game developers, 
                      other players, etc. - and everyone commented about it. The 
                      greatest part is that we affected the lives of many, many 
                      children who received Christmas presents due to our donation 
                      - something that we hope to do again and again. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>III. 
                      UNITY AND COMRADERIE</b> </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Up 
                      until this point, I have mentioned this aspect a few times 
                      already. I wanted to again stress the importance of this 
                      topic. The fact remains that as a large group of friends, 
                      or accomplices, we will fight. It happens. People disagree, 
                      people argue, people threaten to quit (or really DO quit), 
                      etc. We need to realize that this is normal, and we should 
                      use our arguments and differing opinions to foster a better 
                      guild environment. Quitting never helps anyone, it only 
                      leaves a problem unresolved. I would instead challenge guild 
                      members to stick around and TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE if 
                      you feel that your ideas are in the best interest of the 
                      "GUILD MAJORITY". Quitting lacks so much effort, it lacks 
                      involvement, it screams out, "I can't handle being in a 
                      guild environment, so instead, I will quit and take the 
                      path of least resistance." Well guess what? As soon as you 
                      find a NEW guild, you will again face those challenges again 
                      and again. It is LIFE. It is NORMAL. It is unavoidable, 
                      unless you choose to be a solo player... </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, 
                      as they say for married couples, "never go to bed angry 
                      with each other". Try to keep your arguments respectful 
                      and mindful of the other persons feelings. "TALK" to each 
                      other, don't scream or become abusive. Keep your mind open 
                      to new opinions and try to list the GOOD and BAD points 
                      of BOTH sides of the coin. Player X and Player Y may have 
                      different opinions, but perhaps a nice blend of both will 
                      EQUAL a superb guild enhancement. </font>

                      future for guilds looks promising. Here is my prediction,

                      will become so sought after and so powerful (their presence) 
                      that GAME COMPANIES will seek them for advice, ideas, and 
                      "MASS BETA SUPPORT". How nice would it be to get a group 
                      of players to test my game, knowing that they get along 
                      and would work collectively to address the real issues affecting 
                      the game design, balance, player support, etc. A 'group 
                      of friends' would make a better attempt at supporting a 
                      game in beta, knowing that their efforts were unified and 
                      appreciated by the company who owned the game. I think that 
                      oftentimes, beta-testers play the beta and expect to have 
                      FUN FUN FUN, without the WORK that is behind it all. I remember 
                      people in beta CURSING because of design changes, big patches, 
                      their characters being wiped, etc. Why? Beta testing is 
                      mostly about reporting issues about the game and HOPEFULLY 
                      having some fun while at it. Guilds (in my opinion) would 
                      do this MUCH better than your 'average' solo player/tester. 
                      (I expect people to disagree with me on this point) </font>

                      will pursue patents for conceptual ideas that are SO GREAT 
                      that companies will PAY to use their patents in their own 
                      games, web sites, etc. If you have a CONCEPT that is good, 
                      people WILL PAY to use it. Just make sure you get the patent 
                      first, THEN go blabbing about it. </font>

                      realize this topic is corny, some of you are laughing or 
                      shaking your head. If that is you, you are in DENIAL! ;) 
                      But seriously, while some of these things SEEM far-fetched, 
                      they really aren't. Many of the ideas I covered here have 
                      been discussed wholly or in part by the members of the Lost 
                      Order of Akalabeth. We realize that some things may never 
                      happen with OUR guild, but that doesn't mean that they aren't 
                      feasible. Somewhere, someday, somehow, someway... guilds 
                      WILL do the things I mentioned. I belong to a few organizations, 
                      such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Disabled 
                      American Veterans, Freemasons, National Adobe Photoshop 
                      Professionals, etc. I consider my guild to be no different 
                      than any of those other 'clubs'. They own property. They 
                      publish magazines. They have a large membership all over 
                      the world. See my point? Do you see my vision now? </font>
