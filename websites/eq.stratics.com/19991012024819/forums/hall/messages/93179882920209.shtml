It is very unfortunate that you have cancelled your account already, especially over what, in my opinion, is a relatively minor incedent.  Now I realize I am leaving myself open to flames here, but is a level 5 character really that hard to re-equip?  No.  Not unless he was extremely twinked by a higher level character.  As for the attitude of the GM?  Well, I agree that he could have responded a bit more rapidly to your inquiry as to whether or not he was responding to your petition.  As for the 'tough luck' part, ( and I don't know, obviously I wasn't there ) I highly doubt these were his exact words.  I can see him saying something like "You must have died before your character dropped out.  It stinks, but there really isn't anything we can do."  Like I said, I wasn't there, he could have just said 'tough luck', but all my experiences with GM's have been very pleasant.  As for not stating the policy, it was my impression that not restoring items lost due to internet or connectivity problems was a generally known policy.  It's not specifically stated anywhere to my knowledge, but it has been said in news posts and on message boards. They can not restore items lost due to internet related issues for a simple reason:  dishonesty.  Dishonest players could claim to have had better items than they really did, and if the corpse is decayed, the GM would have no way of knowing.  That is not to say you are dishonest in any way, I'm just saying that is the reason why they can not do this.  I am truly sorry you found this incident to be too much, for it sounds as though you truly enjoyed the game.  I am assuming you still have the software and would highly encourage you to reopen your account and perhaps try a different server.<p>-Gaelrond<br>Wood Elven Ranger,<br>Xegony
