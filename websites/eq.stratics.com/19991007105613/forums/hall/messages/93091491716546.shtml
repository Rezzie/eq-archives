Ok, I have heard a lot a junk over the months about "______ class isnt balanced and we need______" this is generaly a waste a time and if you stoped to read this post im truly suprised.  I will quickly list two things that i have read incase you havent had the misfortune of wasesting your time like i have.  One was that Rangers need "gate".  Rangers need gate like i need gate in real life.  Yes it would be nice,  but its about as "needed" as another hole in the head.  We would all like "gate" but you want to call it unbalancing? Right.  second one i read said that Bards need backstab...what the heck can i say here folks?  The guy should have asked for gate, he would have had a better chance.  <p>  These being as silly as they are, im going to try to get to the game and how i see the class balance with a emphasis on the rogue.  There went the everyone that stoped to read this but ill continue typing anyway.  (and if you dont think that you are going to like my post just read the very last paragraph.<p>First a look at the Druid and the bard.  Thats right, you read it corectly, Druid and the Bard.  What do these classes have in common you might ask.  One thing,  that of all the Rpgs I have played, books ive read, movies i have seen, and stories i have heard NO ONE IS A SILLY DRUID OR A BARD. NO! ONE! HEAR ME?  Ok, sorry about that.  You get my point here?  Shure 989 and verant wanted to make this a viable class for those that wanted to play that class,  but we all know, and will always know that 90% of the druids and bards in this game would have played lumps a dirt if they had "SoW" "DD" "healing" and some mele after they hit a certain level.  Am i wrong here folks?  If ya said yes im wrong i want you to know that you spell and type as bad as i do,  and you idea about backstab will never happen.<p>  Next is the "pure caster class".  These clowns generaly think that they really are powerfull "casters" in real life.  With the exception of the enchanter,  witch i will always say is by far the most under rated and under appriciated class in the game,  most casters think that they are "the best" ... HARDY HAR HAR HAR HAR, ROFL, HAHA...you guys are Masters OF Dieing,  you can be killed in all of about 6 seconds  after 5th level.   Next time you hear a mage start to lie about how great they are,  just wait about 2 miniutes.  They will be sitting there and some froglok tad will hit them while there meding and you will see a Carl Lewis impression that cant be beat.  Man can they move fast!  Run like there on fire, i swear!<p>  Next you got the hybrids,  and folks i got to tell you, these people generaly are very cool.  I appologize to all you who are enjoying my work here,  but most all of the rangers, paladins, and yes even the shadowknights, are cool.  They really seem to be the people that knew what class they wated to play 2 months before beta started.  They enjoy the class and the way if was put together.  To you all i sa Congrats!<p>  Now for the the ones that got screwed.  Warriors and Rogues,  man did you guys get the shaft.  I know, I know, many of you rogues and Warriors have exceled a great deal and i commend you for that,  the game is put together very well over all and there is no "broken" class.  This i will admit.  But in the over all picture, you guys got shorted.  I dont think that i need to spend much time on the warrior class, but ill explain a bit just for you out there who dont know.  At the moment Warriors are Rangers, paladins, ext without spells.... oh!  at 40th they start to break away a little, not by much, but a little.  If ya dont believe me check it out, its true.  They might have sligtly better Hp, or Ac but its due to there stats, you can make one the same if you spend your points in the right places in character creation.  Good news here though, warriors are getting redone a bit.  Like i said there really is no "broken" class, and i know that many of you ahve done well as one, but so far you would have done better as another class.  :(  I still love you guys though,  you guys run IN to save that tough guy as he runs like a 9 year old girl.  He flees, you fight.. whos the tough guy again?  Oh i can hear it now "well i can lay down yak yak yak" ya, as long as someone is holding him down and watching your back.  I got a 11 year old niece that can kick your tail if i hold ya down, so what?<p>  Now for the poor saps that 989 has let wither on the vine, totaly let out to dry and rot in the field.  Anyone want to chalenge me on this?  Ill prove ya wrong quick.  Its the Rogue.  Now this i just dont get at all, the best people ever were rogues period.  Luke Skywalker, ya he was a pilot, but he was a rogue first and he is called it once too and doest deny it.  Robin hood was a archer right? Nope, rogue!  And how about our founding fathers of the USA? ( NO DISRESPECT HERE, READ YOUR HISTORY BOOKS, they were Han, robin, and all the best rolled into one.  Winning the war of the colonys with steath instead of force, the tea party you name it..thank you God for every last one of em.  i could go on here forever but i just heard the 5th back button get hit so...)  The rogue class will always be played because people like the "rogue" always have always will :)  So what in he world happend to em?  Yes, once again,  i know, some of you have reached such and such goal, i know, i know.  The class and the game are NOT "broken"  they are however shorted.  Lets just take a qucik look.  <p>  Casters have spell levels where they get better at what they were doing and new toys that are even better with something to work at.  Rogues after 17th or so get, DAT DA DA DA.. NADA.  They backstab for 3 more poits a damage.  Oh, wait, you say backstab is great?  Well it is,  unless that fist backstab got the monsters attention then you might have a problem because you got about the same Hit Points as a mele class 4 lvls lower than you, did i mention that you cant wear the best armor, unless you manage to get a hold of a full set a rubicite or better.  On the luckiest day EVER you might find a guy who just had a electrolite problem and decided to sell his for the bargan basment price of about 30,000 plat, start saving those coppers guys.  Solo you say?  Did you just not pay attention to me in he last 2 sentences?  How about "just plain cool stuff" things that they can do that no other can.  Lets start with "hide" sorry :) all wood elves, halflings, and dark elves can.  "Sneak"? bards can(and can go invis along with there whole party, so whats the point) and did i mention that all it did was shut off the sound of you waking or running?  well i guess that is cool eh?:)  How about picklocks?  Ya, great, 3 doors in befallen, they dont work in Najena, you have to have the keys, thanks 989.  Maby there are more in the 45-50 lvl dungens, i just dont know.  "Find traps"? "disarm traps"?  There are NONE, NONE, ZERO, ZILTCH, NADA, KA-PUT.  Yes there are floor traps and false walls, but it doesnt work on those and never will, that is a fact and even if its not always going to be true you learn those after the first time you go to a dungen. Have i mentiond that most everything costs more for a rogue do to faction?  never mind that, i think rogues like it that way really.  Pick pockets,  now there is one that is kida cool,  Balancing?  far from it!  If you ever see a pile of 1200 copper find the backstaber that keeps talking to himself would ya.  And last but not least the 2 most intresting skillis of ALL;  Making poison and Applying Poison,  they do not exist anywhere but on the guild leaders training list.  Boy i bet thats fun and helpfull just looking at that everytime you see it.  Wow!  i can train something that i cant do!  how nifty!   All in all the rogue is a lesser fighter that can backstab with nothing to look forward to that the underprivledged warrior wont get more of (i.e. more Hp and Ac) and that is that. <p>   Ok, final thoughts.  The game still ROCKS.  WOW WHAT A JOB,  I AM NOT BEING SARCASTIC HERE.  All-in-all this is by FAR the best game i hav eever seen or heard of.  The graphics are great for a online game with no real lag to speak of.  The monster AI is AWSOME compared to most if not all single player games i have played.  (try beating the tar out of a Froglok in guk then letting him get away, you can hear him talking to Fred and Bill in the next room, asking them the come help and then they bring there biker club)  monsters really to have "S^&* lists" they might come back 10 miniutes later, change there targets,  wont let a hurt player escape easy,  go after healers and casters for just being themselves, you name it.  The chat version in the game is great with the /who all whatever, tells, group, emmotes, ect.  The great items are valued and not easy to get.  You can never have enough money!  You might say " i have no need for money"  BS, you would sell you rubicite breast plate for 7k, why? because you miht be able to buy another and some other little trimings that you mihgt come acsross.  Not to mention that you will never have enough to outfit that second character you have been wanting to start the same way you are now(though some she have tried) no matter how hard you try.  Show we someone with 2 sets a rubicite and ill show ya a GM.  The faction system is great,  Pking has been put in its rightfull place ( a realisic world is not a world with 99% mass murderers and 1% newbies)  a name filter that makes "you" you.  /ignore, /anon, /roleplay,  AND GETTING DRUNK IN THE GAME IS FUN AS HELL! (for a game, dont come close to the real thing.  But then again i drank 25 short beers and went hunting 20 miniuts later, not to the hospital.)  EQ is not "Broken" no class is "broken".  i just hope this draws a  little attention to the places that need it.  Yes i know they say they are working on it, i just want to keep the heat up.  thanks for your time and good huting to you :)
