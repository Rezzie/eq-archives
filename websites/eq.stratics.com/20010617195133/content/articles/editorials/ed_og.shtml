                  <div> Well, as the days get longer and longer and the final 
                    release of EverQuest gets nearer and nearer, I can't help 
                    but look back at my nine years as a participant in the online 
                    gaming industry. For me, it all started playing a game known 
                    as "Lords" on a local BBS. I remember the old ANSI graphics; 
                    long scrolling and unclear. I remember the text as the game 
                    loaded up my character at the Inn, and watching as the host 
                    server informed me, in the same text-based chatter, of the 
                    crowd drinking in the Inn's common room. Due to the way Lords 
                    was set up on the BBS, only one person could be logged on 
                    at a time, and you would use keyboard shortcuts to choose 
                    options from an ANSI menu of what you wanted to do. There 
                    were quite a number of options, as I remember it, ranging 
                    from going to the Fair and playing a guessing game to going 
                    to the Fields of Challenge in the town center and taking on 
                    Dreaded Knight, the BBS host's unbeatable character. 
                    <p> In total, there were only about 25 people who played the 
                      game, but the same interaction between players was present 
                      even then... the surprise when you logged expecting the 
                      daily routine of killing monsters and gaining experience 
                      and gold, only to find the message, "Angel has broken into 
                      your room at the Inn and killed you!". But the real thrill 
                      of online gaming was missing, the direct player-to player-interaction, 
                      not blocked by a computer host. This type of game held some 
                      thrill over a single player adventure in those days, but 
                      it was not truly an online game in the sense that we now 
                      use the word. Still, I look at "Lords" and see the roots 
                      of the same player archetypes I often see today: the powergamer, 
                      the die-hard roleplayer, and the player killer. 
                    <p> After I got bored playing BBS role playing games, It was 
                      time to move on to something on a larger scale. I had recently 
                      received an AOL disk in the mail, and, lacking an online 
                      service, decided to try it. I signed on to AOL and discovered, 
                      hidden behind its many inefficient employees and vaults 
                      of boring and perverse chatrooms, an online AD&D game called 
                      "Neverwinter Nights" (Or "NWN" as it was more colloquially 
                      named). NWN was my first true multiplayer online experience. 
                      The 500 person server was small in comparison to the ones 
                      that are now hosting thousands simultaneously, but then 
                      again the game was not all that large in itself, comprised 
                      of perhaps 20 areas of 124 screens each (very small when 
                      compared to today's games). The EGA graphics weren't all 
                      that stunning, but they didn't need to be. NWN had what 
                      every online game must have but that none can guarantee: 
                      a sense of community. When a newbie got into a fight out 
                      of his range of power, passing players would see it and 
                      inquire if he needed help. Why? Because they cared about 
                      the game and felt like they identified with the people who 
                      played it. 
                    <p> Neverwinter Nights was not all that challenging, but it 
                      was fun to play with others, and that is what made it outstanding 
                      as an online game. I joined my first guild there, and am 
                      with it to this day, waiting to expand into the waiting 
                      world of Norrath. I have to say that what made NWN a great 
                      game made the people I game with a great guild, the sense 
                      of friendliness beyond greed that makes a guild hold fast 
                      through hard times during which many fall apart. 
                    <p> Unfortunately, NWN eventually fell apart. There were several 
                      reasons for this. First and foremost, the way NWN was designed, 
                      your character and all the game data were stored on your 
                      computer, not the host. This made hacking rampant. I would 
                      have to say that nearly half the population of Neverwinter 
                      Nights, however friendly, used a cheating program called 
                      XGM which made the game quite easy. Second, the graphics 
                      and sound in NWN were definitely not state of the art. They 
                      were EGA, which only allows 16 colors. Anyone who has played 
                      any of the gold box series of games from TSR knows the engine 
                      which ran NWN quite well, and the quality of the graphics 
                      therein. Third, NWN was a game on AOL, which anyone who 
                      has used AOL extensively knows is a major flaw in itself. 
                      This was a major contributor to the cheating factor within 
                      the game, I think, because the people who played NWN were 
                      AOL customers, and as is commonly known, AOL is fraught 
                      with hackers and such to no end. 
                    <p> Sufficed to say, NWN was taken down by AOL in 1994. Apparently 
                      the staff had grown tired of all the endless cheating and 
                      the game itself brought in when compared to actual revenue, 
                      as it was free to play as long as one paid the $20 a month 
                      for AOL. So, with my guild looking for a place to go and 
                      wondering what would come to replace NWN, I started looking 
                      for a new thrill. What I found was Darksun Online, yet another 
                      online AD&D game. This game ran on a overhead view rather 
                      than a first-person one like NWN, and ran with a full and 
                      whopping 256 colors. Composed of a somewhat larger landscape 
                      than NWN, Darksun Online also had, on some level, a great 
                      sense of community. 
                    <p> But the reason for this community was a flawed one; the 
                      game itself was not all that difficult. Players would get 
                      together and stand, up to 50 in number, around a statue 
                      and building in the center of the main city and chat out 
                      of boredom. The game was quite simple in fact, once you 
                      had a max'ed-out character (which took about a week and 
                      a half or so if you knew the game) you could take on any 
                      quest or beastie in the land without a problem. This was, 
                      for me, the downfall of Darksun Online. Though the staff 
                      and people were great, and would get together about once 
                      a week and make a great quest, between these quests there 
                      really was not much to do. 
                    <p> So, having communicated with some of my guild brothers 
                      who had migrated to the land of Britannia, I canceled my 
                      DSO account and went on, as so many did, to play Ultima 
                      Online, having heard the media hype on how great it was 
                      going to be. 
                    <p> UO was not so much a bad time to me as a learning experience. 
                      I think this is the way it was for many people. The ideas 
                      about working for your money in ways other than adventuring, 
                      and in this way creating a player-driven economy were not 
                      bad, but they had never been properly tested, as a game 
                      of this type had never been attempted. the UO engine was 
                      fun to play with, and the combat system worked, but I think 
                      UO put too much trust in the players. They expected, indeed 
                      gambled, on the fact that the players would want to work 
                      to create a sense of community. This was the error of Ultima 
                      Online. Gamers as a whole did not want to work for two hours 
                      before going out for a few hours of adventuring. Most did 
                      not want to work hard to form a community with other players. 
                      They wanted these things provided for them, so they could 
                      simply hook up with some friends and go adventuring, and 
                      become rich doing it. When UO players found that they could 
                      not do this, they turned to bug-exploiting and player killing 
                      as a quick fix for their fun. While this may have worked 
                      for the individual player on a small scale, when everyone 
                      started doing it, it destroyed the overall sense of fun 
                      present in the game. Britannia quickly became more of a 
                      bug exploiting free-for-all than a fantasy environment. 
                      And so, looking at that world in dismay as a lost opportunity, 
                      I left. 
                    <p> Now I sit at 11 o'clock on this quiet, snowy Monday night 
                      writing this very editorial. All I can think as I close 
                      it is that for our brave new world of Norrath to gain that 
                      intangible sense of community, players, designers, guides, 
                      bug-exploiters and powergamers must work together with open 
                      minds and a spirit of adventure in order to make EverQuest 
                      the best that it can be. If everyone who will participate 
                      in the game does so with the goal of having good, constructive 
                      fun toward the ultimate goal of creating the best ORPG on 
                      the market, that is exactly what EQ will become. Remember 
                      that we all have a piece of the power within our grasp to 
                      make or break this game.
