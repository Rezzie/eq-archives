Many are the trolls who seek to establish themselves amongst the Knights of Darkness, but few last long enough to attainthe true power which is present at higher levels.  This guide is written for the beginning troll, to help ease the initial periodof advancement, and to keep them from making mistakes which might stunt their character's growth.  My own troll has just come into the first rank of a true troll's power, attaining 9th level, and gaining access to his spells, so my knowledge of the levels beyond is limited.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>       </tr></table><br><br><a name="2"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Why Troll?</font></b><div>One word:  Regeneration.  Trolls heal inhumanly quick.  A troll typically takes half the time to recover that a non-troll melee character might.  When you have 300 hit points, it still feels like it takes hours to recover, but the downtime is far less than that which other, lesser races have to face.  Many times, I have fled from superior numbers, regenerated on my way to the guards, and turned and fought off my attackers.  Considering that ShadowKnights don't get any sort of healing spell for a long time, (I believe we get the necromantic spell "lifedrain" in our late teens or early 20s), regeneration is a huge advantageover other ShadowKnights.<p>Add to this passable infravision, well-developed strength and stamina, and a reputation so fearsome that most other races will attack you on sight, and the Troll ShadowKnight clearly becomes an interesting class to play.  Finally, all trolls get the "slam" racial ability.  At low levels, this does only 1 damage when it hits successfully, but, after 12th level, it works like bash, increasing in damage and sometimes stunning the opponent.  Best of all, unlike bash, you don't need a shield to use it!  Thus, a 13th level troll could wield a 2-handed sword, and still use slam on his/her opponent.  It's an enormous advantage reserved for the larger races; barbarians, ogres, and, naturally, trolls.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>    </tr></table><br><br><a name="3"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Cons of Troll Life</font></b><div>Unfortunately, there are downsides to being a troll shadowknight as well.<p>First, your intelligence is naturally low.  This hinders skilllearning and vastly restricts the amount of mana (referred to by some of thetroll SK's on Karana as "mojo") available to a troll. With a 62intelligence, my troll has roughly 25 mana at 9th level. Seem like plenty?Think again: the first SK "pet" spell, "Leering Corpse", costs us 40 manato cast. While most of the other spells are more reasonable, (costingbetween 5 and 10), "Invisibility to Undead" also costs 40 mana. This isdefinitely something to keep in mind when creating your character,(described in detail below). <p>Furthermore, the ShadowKnight is a hybrid class, and thus gains experience relatively slowly.  Trolls also have an experience penalty associated with them, (perhaps to offset the regenerative ability), and higher levels will be a long time in coming.  To some extent, however, this is the lot of Shadow Knights in general, and should be accepted as a given if you're planning on becoming one.<p>The final downside is the fact that Troll ShadowKnights are perhaps the most hated race-class combinations anywhere.  The "good" races will likely try and kill you on sight.  I've even met my demise in the ogre city of Oggok, where, as mentioned in the brief description of a Troll Shadowknight which you are given when you first create the character, the warriors guild hates troll SK's, despite our general racial alliance.  However, I see this as a positive as much as a negative.  Yes, it does make things harder when everything is trying to kill you, but, from a roleplaying perspective, you can take it as a sign of how much they fear you.  If I were a human guard, or a smelly elf, and saw a big wall of regenerating, spellcasting, green flesh rolling toward me with an attitude and a big sword.... well, I'd probably be motivated to try and kill it off too.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>       </tr></table><br><br><a name="4"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Creating your Troll Shadow Knight</font></b><div>How you create your character is up to you, but here are a few thoughts on your attributes:<ul type="square"><li>Your strength and stamina start out really high even unmodified.  Think twice about dumping all of your points here.<li>Agility is always a nice attribute to increase, but your troll will never be very fast, even if you dump all your points into this attribute, and there are several other attributes which will help out a lot more.  An 83 agility should suffice.<li>Intelligence starts out at 62.  What this generally means is that you'll rarely have maxxed out skill progression before advancing to the next level, (at higher levels especially).  In essence, this makes you weaker; a level 9 troll sk with a 43 offense will fight worse than a level 9 troll sk with a 50 offense.   I'd strongly suggest putting points into intelligence so your character fulfills his maximum potential each level.  You only have 20 points to spare, so you'll never be a genius, but every point helps.<p>Remember that intelligence is a prime requisite for a reason. If you want to be able to cast spells when you get access to them, and not 3 or 4 levels later when you've accrued the mana, put some points into intelligence. :) </ul><p>Obviously, this is all just my own opinion, and you should feel free to do what you wish.  Others might advise you to stick with the "big 3 (or 4)" of being a melee-type: str, sta, agi, dex.  But having good skills levels for your overall level is invaluable, and, if you're anything like I was, you want to have the mana to actually cast your spells upon reaching 9th level.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>  </tr></table><br><br><a name="5"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Adventuring in the Swamp: Newbie Levels (1-3)</font></b><div>The majority of your early career will be spent in Innothule (sp?) Swamp.  The swamp can be a difficult place to navigate, particularly because it is composed of many "islands" of land amidst the murky waters.  Get your swimming skill up fast or you'll regret it later when, chased by an angry mob, you find yourself trying to dogpaddle through the water.  When facing into the swamp from the pathway which leads to Grobb, takea left and move along the wall there until you reach a solitary Basher.  Although difficult mobs can be encountered anywhere within the swamp, the region in this direction normally hosts easier targets like froglok tads, decaying skeletons, large rats, snakes and lesser kobolds.  If you speak with Hukkulk in the Night Keep, (our guild in Grobb), you will likely have received a quest by now.  Complete that as soon as possible.  As shadowknights never get dual wield, you will probably be best off with a two-handed weapon.  Hitting enemies for 18+ a blow really brightens up the day.  Other than that, try and spend your time relatively close to the lone basher.  You can run to him whenever you need assistance.  Both froglok tads and lesser kobolds attack you on sight, so be wary.  Your harm touch skill will only work once a 'day' in Everquest-time, so hold on to it until you need it.  It can be invaluable when you find yourself in an unexpected situation, surrounded or outnumbered.<p>Things to kill:<ul type="square"><li>Froglok tads, (giant, hopping tadpoles, essentially, and are different from the tads found in Guk)<li>Decaying skeletons (great sources of rusty weaponry)<li>Large Rats (Kill only at 1st or 2nd level... after that, stick to les. kobolds and dec. skeletons)<li>Lesser Kobolds (pretty good xp.. sometimes have containers on them)</ul><div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>       </tr></table><br><br><a name="6"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Adventuring in the Swamp: Early Levels (4-7)</font></b><div>Once you have reached 4th or 5th level, it's time to seek out the older brothers of the tads you've been killing: the frogloks.  From the entrance to Grobb, facing out into the swamp, turn to the right (instead of the left, where you've already gone now), and run along the wall.  You should know when you've reached the right place, because a number of troll corpses usually litter the ground.  If that's not a sign of the possible dangers here, I don't know what is.  If there are no corpses, look for two trees which connect at their base, making a sort of "doorway" shape which you can walk through.  (looking sort of like a () shape.)  I always used this as a landmark before I had learned my way around.  <p>Deeper into the swamp from here, (that is, in the direction away from the wall), there's an island which generally has at least 2 or 3 visible frogloks on it.  Wade through the water to them, and try and draw one off away from the others.  Remember, like the tads, frogloks do group together, so you can quickly be outmatched.  As you get better, take on multiple frogloks.  By 5th or 6th level, you should be capable of killing froglok fishermen, but it will still be very easy for a fight to turn on you.  Just keep track of where the 'wall' is, because you can follow that back to the guards, if need be.<p>Things to kill:<ul type="square"><li>Frogloks (sometimes have rusty weapons or netted armour [magical armour which weighs very little])<li>Froglok Fishermen (At first, these guys are tough.  Later on, they're pretty great xp)<li>Fungus Man Trackers (like frogloks, these normally have some money, and may have a rusty weapon) </ul><div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>        </tr></table><br><br><a name="7"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Adventuring in the Swamp: Coming into Power (Levels 7-9)</font></b><div>By 7th level, frogloks are giving you marginal xp at best.  The occasional froglok fisherman may be worthwhile, but you generally want to start looking for something new to kill.  This is when you really may explore the swamp in earnest.  If you continue along the wall (past the froglok island mentioned in last section, and continuing away from the guards), you'll find a little cave, guarded by two froglok Guards.  This is the entrance to Guk, and should be avoided unless you have a strong party.  (Although there are several killable froglok types inside; "older" tads and sentries, there aren't enough of them to make up for having to load the new zone.  You'll get more xp faster by staying in the swamp)  Following the wall some more, you may see an island with a tower on it, separated from you by just a bit of water.  This is near the corner of the zone, and is where I spent most of my time between levels 7-9.  The tower is the home of Jojo, a kobold whose true name is damn hard to remember (Jojojunga or something similar).  He hits for between 40-60 points of damage.  In other words, don't go up into the tower.  The antechamber is fair game though, and normally houses a skeleton (normal skeleton, as opposed to a decaying skeleton).  Froglok foragers, kobold hunters, water moccasins (giant and otherwise), giant rats and all types of alligators abound.  Foragers, in particular, should be your target of choice, as they can carry up to 1 gold in coins on them, and sometimes even have "Woven" armour... a step up in magical armour from the Netted stuff you've seen already.  Kobold hunters can be very challenging, and both they and foragers can be deadly if more than one of them stumbles into you.  As always, be ready to run if you have to.  While water moccasins are plentiful, they're normally not worth the trouble to kill, as they have a poison attack which is annoying, (thanks to our regeneration, we can still actually heal fairly quickly when sitting down, as opposed to losing health like the other races, but it's at a much slower rate than usual).  Foragers, hunters, and skeletons should comprise the bulk of your prey.<p>Things to kill:<ul type="square"><li>Froglok foragers (rusty weapons, good xp, good money, and woven armour)<li>Kobold hunters (good money and xp, but they pack a punch, doing hand-to-hand damage of 10-16)<li>Skeletons (a great "filler" when you can't find any foragers or hunters.  Save the bone chips for your spells!)</ul>Miscellaneous (what I did):<ul type="square"><li>Skills:  Since level 1, I have been using a 2-handed sword, and haven't spared much of a thought for other weapon skills.  I'm slowly putting extra points into the smithing trade skill, so that when I do finally start making use of it, it won't be as costly as it might otherwise, (ie. I'll succeed more, and therefore waste less resources).  My intelligence is not very high, so I continue to use extra points to keep my skills to their max per level.  I put only 1 point into each of the spell categories; they've gone up plenty fast on their own since then.<li>Equipment:  Try not to buy any armour, if you don't have to.  You can find a full complement of netted armour on the various frogloks, which serves its purpose well enough.  Finding woven armour on foragers is a little less common, but serves as a good replacement for your netted equipment.  Save up to buy a decent weapon, and, if possible, purchase banded armour from other players.  Banded armour is much cheaper than store-bought chainmail, is just as good, and has the added benefit of being lighter.  You can really see a difference between banded and netted/woven/leather armour.</ul><div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>   </tr></table><br><br><a name="8"></a><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Epilogue</font></b><div>Upon reaching 9th level, you will have taken the first big step towards becoming a real ShadowKnight.
