        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><font face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056>Wednesday night around 8:00pm CST on E'ci, a few members of our guild (Crimson Legacy) informed the rest of the guild that a GM-controlled druid and two Pegasi had come to the defense of the treants, which are always being slaughtered.  Fortunately at the time, my close wizard friend Vandna and I, a bard, were not busy, so we immediately teleported to North Karana and started running towards the treants to help protect them.  When we got there, we found an unkempt druid (sorry but I forgot his name) and the two pegasi, named <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/news/screenshots/PEGASI.jpg" target="_blank">Varrsselle and Terrevelle</a>.  The druid told us that he had been sent by Karana and that an 500 year old treant, Jival`Tos had been awakened from his centuries-old slumber to protect his younger bretheren.<br><br>The few evil-races that showed up were warned to leave or be killed.  Some left willingly, but others raised arms against these guardians of the treants and were swiftly killed.<br><br>We were told to protect the treants from those who would kill them and we would be rewarded for our efforts.  A few evil persons managed to kill a treant or two, but we tried to protect them as well as we were able by healing the treants or by helping the druid and the two Pegasi chase them off.<br><br>Eventually I was called forth by the druid and given a Serrated Bone Dirk for my efforts.  A druid, (I forget his name also, sorry) recieved a scimitar from the elder treant, <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/news/screenshots/JivalTos.jpg" target="_blank">Jival`Tos</a>.  The treant was then called back by Karana to return to his slumber.  The pegasi then flew around and gave a few items to some of those who had participated in helping protect the treants, as well as nuzzling the participants.  My partner Vandna received a Mithril Breastplate.  Briandaj, another guildmate, hit the jackpot when she received a Cloak of Shadows.  I was also given an Enamelled Black Mace from one of the pegasi before they were also called back to Karana.<br><br>/ooc All in all a fun GM event...  It was the first one that I had been to where I wasn't killed in the first 5 minutes... hehe  For the most part everyone role-played very well and I was glad to see that we didn't get a horde of level 50+ players all try to kill off all the NPC's.  A few evil characters did attack the NPC's, but with the possible exception of the druid that attacked the elder Treant, it was pretty appropriate as the attackers were evil races.<br><br>I've attached a couple of screenshots of the NPC's (minus the druid, I think I was in shock when he called me first to give me the dirk, so I didn't get a screenshot of him).</font></blockquote> </font>

Please note that this ability is subject to the range to the target.<br>- EverQuest will now write the original default colors when creating the EQCLIENT.INI file, rather than the new colors that were put in a few weeks ago.<br>- The @-character can be used in emotes to indicate a target.  For instance, if you target "a gnoll" and type "/emote laughs cruelly at @", the output will be, "Playername laughs cruelly at a gnoll".<br>- People with the /LFG (Looking for Group) flag set will now have their over-head name prefixed with an asterisk.  Remember that you can search for people looking for a group by using the "/who" and "/who all" commands.  Typing "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg" will return a list of all rangers between 40 and 50 that are looking for a group.<br>- The "Sense" series (Undead, Animal, and Summoned) will no longer point you towards people's pets.<br><br>*Note on Voice Recognition*<br><br>Last week we implemented voice recognition technology in EverQuest.  To use this new feature, please refer to the EQROKManualSupplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory.  Please note that you must already have a voice recognition engine that is compliant with the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4.0.  The voice recognition technology was tested with Dragon NaturallySpeaking(r) v4.0.  Check with the developer of your software to find out if it is SAPI 4.0 compliant.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote><br>Discussion on today's patch can be found <a href=http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=377683&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5 target="_blank">here!</a> </font>

It happens to me often, even on a cable modem. Some classes are not terribly bothered by it, other than the frustation of having to log back in, but other classes are terribly wronged by a design feature of the game that punishes certain players whose connections are not as good as others. <br><br>When a player goes linkdead, or logs out, any summoned items or pets the player has disappear. I remember playing as a Magician, summoning my best pet, getting all my food and water, starting out on my adventure, and going linkdead. I'd log back in, and literally have to spend another 15 minutes summoning my things. 15 minutes lost to something that I am sure was never a "balance" issue in the game. (How can you punish a player if his connection is not as stable as another player's?)<br><br><font color="#a00000">I appreciate the time that you took to write this up. Let me see if I can explain the current technology is as much detail.<br><br>Pets can only exist in the world when their owner also exists in the world, meaning that once the owner disappears, so does the pet. At the same time, the character goes linkdead, that character cannot reenter the game until they are removed from the world.<br><br>Once a character is removed from the world, the world has no knowledge of the existence of the character. As such, the world no longer processes data relative to the characater, since the character does not exist. That is why NORENT objects are removed as the character is being removed, since the world has no knowledge of the character once they are gone.<br><br>Certain parts of the description above are core system mechanics for EverQuest that it wouldn't make sense to change after several years of getting them operating just right. That said, we do have some plans to improve the current situation in the works. I can't comment specifically on them until we have some new things implemented and tested on the Test Server.<br><br>-Gordon</font></font></blockquote> </font>

There will be no teleport locations for either druids or wizards. There will be a boat from Erudin and maybe Kaladim or Ak'anon (since on the map there are two boats going towards Velious place, one from Odus and one from Faydwer). <br><br>Erudin already has a sign on the Port Authority that says to Qeynos and Velious. Hopefully there will be a god in Velious. Maybe Rallos Zek who has been recouperating from the invasion of earth (read the story if you don't know what I am talking about) with his creations. There is going to be high ice giants and dragons, don't know anything else.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="a00000" size=2>It's still a bit early to say too much about Velious, but I did want to dispell some rumors:<br>1. There WILL be teleports into various locations in Velious (rumor has it they may work differently, however).<br><br>2. There is NO starting city in Velious.<br><br>3. There is NOT a barbarian city in Velious.<br><br>4.

Tales of your incredible deeds and great actions have reached my council, and to be honest, we are impressed with what we have learned. We watched in the shadows as you showed your bravery by defeating the evil dragons. We saw from a distance your unequal skill and courage when you banished gods from their own planes. Even Tunare herself has mentioned your name when she talks of the heroes of the Plane of Mortals.<br><br>We have heard of others who have similar accomplishments, and the gods have begun debate amongst themselves on who has created the ultimate champion. Of course, the dreaded Rallos Zek claims that his warriors would crush any that oppose his followers, but there are many that disagree. <br><br>Mithaniel Marr, in the plane of Valor, a place where the greatest tournaments are held, decreed that he would solve this dispute by holding a tournament of mortals that would forever answer the question on whose creation was superior. Those not in good standing with Mithaniel objected, stated that the event would be biased in his plane, and that neutral ground would be the only answer. <br><br>Being the Avatar of Truth, and bound by my code of honor to be forever unbiased regardless of race or profession, was summoned to this council and given this honorable quest to fulfill.<br><br>&#8220;Bring together the Myrmidons and Warlords, to a single place and a single time, and find the champion of mortals. Those that compete at the regional level and emerge victorious, grant them the title of &#8220;the Champion&#8221; by authorization of Rallos Zek. In the final event, where the heroes are brought together from all realms of the mortals, those that place 4th through 2nd shall be awarded the title of &#8220;the Myrmidon&#8221;, by authorization of the Tribunal. The winner of the final match, who has not lost to another mortal, under Authorization of Mithaniel Marr shall be awarded the title &#8220;the Warlord&#8221; and crowned the champion of Norrath.&#8221;<br><br>It had been many ages since I had been requested to accomplish such a quest.  Rules would have to be fair, for even Cazic Thule, in his blindness, would be able to see if the event would be biased twords one of the gods creations. From Gnome to Ogre, and Human to Iksar, all would have to be equal.<br><br>Some gods had given artifacts to faithful followers, that placed them above most mortals, clearly an advantage that would need to be dismissed. Therefore, let it be known that all Artifacts will be banished from this event.<br><br>Several of the gods had blessed their children into riches with great armies, which could afford the wealth of many items and equipment. This would advantage some races over others, which could not be involved in the event. Therefore, let it be known that all activatable items will be banished from this event. Of course, great warrior, you may wear the items that have the special abilities imbedded into them, just not use those items against another player in the forms of spells or potions or pumice or effects.<br><br>Finally the use of weapons was agreed upon, and weapons based of trickery and deceit were banished from the event by Mithaniel. Rallos disagreed stating that a true warrior uses any weapon or equipment to his advantage, and they argued.  Finally my recommendation pleased them both, and these weapons were banished from the primary hand of the warrior, only to be used in the offhand. Therefore, let it be known, that all weapons of deceit (weapons with a delay value of 15 or lower) shall only be allowed in the offhand of the competitors.<br><br>Leave your gold pouch in the bank, for no entry fee shall be requested or accepted in this event. Seek the knowledge of the gods for the time and place of regiona (Server) tournaments before the greatest are gathered to one spot (test server) for the final event.  This is my quest, and my message to you my champion. I hope you accept this quest as well as a personal goal to come and compete at the event of the gods. If the challenge is too great, I assure you that your god shall forgive you, for only the bravest and best need step forward.<br><br>Fare well, I hope we meet again.<br><br><br>Server Tournaments<br><br>Fri Sept 1st, 2000<br>Xegony 6pm PST<br>E Marr 6pm PST<br>Quellious 6pm PST<br><br>Sat Sept 2nd, 2000<br>Vallon Zek 4pm PST<br>Innoruuk 8pm PST<br>The Rathe 7pm PST<br>7th Hammer 5pm PST<br><br>Sun Sept 3rd, 2000<br>T Thule 6pm PST<br>Lanys 430pm PST<br>Veeshan 6pm PST<br>T Marr 3pm PST<br><br>Tue Sept 5th, 2000<br>Bertox 7pm PST<br>Fennin 5pm PST<br>E`Ci 4pm PST<br>Sol Ro 5pm PST<br>Rodcet 6pm PST<br><br>Wed Sept 6th, 2000<br>Rallos 5pm PST<br>Karana 4pm PST<br>Nameless 6pm PST<br><br>Thur Sept 7th, 2000<br>Luclin 7pm PST<br>Torv 6pm PST<br>Saryrn 5pm PST<br>Tribunal 4pm PST<br><br>Fri Sept 8th, 2000<br>Brell 7pm PST<br>M Marr 4pm PST<br>M Thule 5pm PST<br><br>Sat Sept 9th, 2000<br>Prexus 5pm PST<br><br>TBA<br>Tallon Zek<br>Tunare<br>Bristle<br>Druzzil<br>Povar<br>C Thule<br><br>Sun Sept 10, 2000<br>Final Event - Test Server<br><br>All TBA's will be announced shortly<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</font></blockquote> </font>

At no point have we agreed that there is a problem. The screenshots that were posted only show that the when the rain turns off, the fog moves out past the max clipping plane for an instant, then back in. This isn't indicative of there being any problem with the way that the plane works. Many zones have clips that are determined by the area. For instance, Toxxulia Forrest has a max clipping plane that is pretty close because we wanted the zone to appear eerie. <br><br>We're still looking into the issue, but it's not the highest of priorities at this time. The most likely "fix" will be for us to make it so that the plane doesn't extend beyond max when the rain turns off. The net result of this fix is basically nothing, which is why it's not a high priority at the moment. We have already confirmed that the min/max clipping plane boundaries are indeed set to the appropriate limits.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Then Aradune followed up with:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">Here's the deal:<br><br>The bug with the rain is very low priority.<br><br>Slightly higher priority is having a game designer to through ALL outdoor zones and revisit the max clipping distance associated with the zone. <br><br>IF the zone doesn't have an artifically limited clip for effect (eg. Toxxulia Forest), the game designer will make the max clip the farthest it can be based on the max distance used when exporting the zone (it can't go farther, else things will cease to draw correctly).<br><br>As stated before, several months ago when I posted on the subject, this is low priority (getting FA style quests in the game, revamping lesser used dungeons, working on Velious, etc. are all higher priority).<br><br>Other than the wierd rain bug and the fact that apparently several zones could indeed have their max clip increased, I do NOT believe there is any 'bug'.<br><br>-Brad </font></blockquote><br><br>And lastly he said:<br><br><blockquote><Font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">We DID, in my opinion, get to the bottom of it: for some reason, either in code or in data, many of the zones' max clipping planes were apparently reduced at some point.<br><br>I think your problem is with the priority we are assigning this issue, and I apologize that it's not high enough for some of you.<br><br>The plan is to have a game designer go into the data for each zone and move the clipping plane maximum out as appropriate.<br><br>If that fails, we'll look at it in code (which would involve a programmer). But my inclination is that the data change will solve the problem.<br><br>Again, it's not very high on the priority list. The FA style quests are (and are near being ready for testing, btw.), as are the dungeon revamps (which will be focussed on after the FA style quests).<br><br>-Brad</font></blockquote> </font>

Apologies if they have been mentioned before.<br><br>1. If you have a wheel-mouse, how about enabling the wheel so that it can be used to scroll the text window? It would need to be pretty speedy, so I would suggest scrolling by page, not by line.<br><br>2. When healing yourself, would it be possible to stop your health bar shooting up and then settling back down to a lower value?<br><br>3. Could there be an 'exchange and bank' button on the bank screen that automatically transfers all your money to your bank vault and changes it into the highest value coin, so avoiding the rather laborious multiple-clicking. I would not consider this to be anti-roleplay because it is what you would ask a bank cashier to do anyway.<br><br>4. It would be really really good if there was an option to switch off the ability to right-click on a player to examine them. It is useful and fast to right-click to con MOBs, and when a player is in the way it is both annoying and time consuming, especially in a battle situation.<br><br>5. Pretty low priority, but it would be nice if containers remembered where they opened on screen. I would imagine the simplest solution to implement would be to store a location for each inventory slot, rather than for each container. If a container is in a particular inventory slot, that container uses the slots stored position when it opens. If another container is switched into that same slot, then it would use the same location.  Locations would be updated when a container is moved around the screen.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I will look into 1, 2, 4, and 5, I doubt number 3 is going to happen.<br><br>-Rowyl</font></font></blockquote> </font>

Camping. Why couldn't the "long portion" of the camp be put at the OTHER end of the camp? Perhaps the NPC needs time to "craft" the quest item and changes in some way to show that they are ready to give the reward. Let the other items spawn almost continuously, and people would NEED to camp anything but the reward PC. <br><br><font color="#a00000">It's a doable idea, but wouldn't this be just a camp by another name? Whether I'm camping a creature that I want to kill, or one I want to talk to, it's still a camp. In this case, I can see 20 people standing around an NPC waiting for him to "be ready" and<br>fighting over who can hand him the items fastest. <br><br><font color="#050056">2. Are there currently any suits of armor that give some "hidden" effect or bonus by virtue of wearing the entire suit? <br><br><font color="#a00000">No, there are not. It's a good idea though that might have some application for later implementation or future products.<br><br><font color="#050056">3. Are there currently any weapons in the game that have any "hidden" effect? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Not really. What an item can do is expressly stated upon it. We do have some plans for more cursed weaponry in the future, of course we just might have to be creative to "hide" the effect of the curse.<br><br><font color="#050056">4. If the answer to 2 and/or 3 is "no", are there any plans to add this feature to the game? <br><br><font color="#a00000">See above.<br><br><font color="#050056">5. You once said that GZ was going to conduct some tests with the wizard's spells vs. the other caster classes. Have these been completed? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Actually I believe that Brad said that, and it is indeed our opinion that offensive power is appropriate for the class.<br><br><font color="#050056">6. Why, exactly, was the definition of the wizard class changed on the everquest.com page under the classes section? <br><br><font color="#a00000">What change and when was it made? To my knowledge, it has read what it reads now since release. I believe that there was a change at one time in the beta period where it was changed from "damage" to "magical damage", but that's all I believe happened. Was there something else?<br><br><font color="#050056">7. Are there any plans to introduce items that directly influence/enhance trade skills? (Gnomish Jeweler's Loupe, Dwarven Smith's Hammer, Elven Sewing Needle, etc.) <br><br><font color="#a00000">Do you mean items that allow you to make better items with trades? It's a good idea, but we no firm plans in that direction. <br><br><font color="#050056">8. Why, since dwarves in fantasy literature (and even in EQ) are the finest smiths in all the realms, is there no ore in Kaladim? It even has a mine. <br><br><font color="#a00000">Good question. There's no ore in Kaladim? Hmmm, I'll check into that to see if it was a design or an oversight.<br><br><font color="#050056">9. Why can't enchanters be given a high-level illusion that allows them to change into the nearest ANIMATE object? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Races are a component of faction, and you adopt whatever race-faction you emulate.  There's a lot of special case-coding to handle the animate races that players currently emulate. Opening that up to nearly everything else would be extremely problematic, if not impossible.<br><br><font color="#050056">10. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that absorbs magic directed at the wielder, perhaps converting it directly into mana/hit points? <br><br><font color="#a00000">There is already a bard song that has a damage shield that absorbs magical damage.  There's also a cleric "reverse damage shield" that heals anyone that hits the target.  That's the extent of what we have, and nothing new along these lines are planned.<br><br><font color="#050056">11. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that REFLECTS spells back at the caster? <br><br><font color="#a00000">No.<br><br><font color="#050056">12. Why can't the monk-only weapons that look like gloves be worn on the hands, and add directly to the ATTACK stat instead of requiring them to be 1h blunt? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Items cannot be set to use hand-to-hand skill, and combat can't go to an "equipment" slot to get combat statistics.<br><br><font color="#050056">13. If Verant doesn't like "spoiler sites", then why are there no spell descriptions anywhere in the game?<br><br><font color="#a00000">I think that you've answered your own question. We don't like spoilers. We'd prefer people figure these things out on their own and maintain their own knowledge-base. <br><br><font color="#050056">14. Will players ever be able to construct golems? (A.k.a. summon a temporary "golem-type" pet through some complicated quest) <br><br><font color="#a00000">We could certainly, by use of trade skill or quest, award an item that summoned a pet of any particular type, however we have no plans to do that at present.<br><br><font color="#050056">15. Necros can charm the undead; enchanters can charm...well...everything. Will Magicians ever have the ability/spell to charm elementals or other summoned creatures?<br><br><font color="#a00000">No, we have no plans along these lines at present.<br><br><font color="#050056">16. Are there any plans for an expansion geared toward the 10 - 30 range of player rather than the higher levels? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Velious is geared towards a higher level-range, however Kunark has support for all level ranges. <br><br>With Velious, the thinking is that there is already plenty of content to support the continually migrating portion of the customer-base that is in the 10-30 range. <br><br>I'm unable to talk about any post-Velious plans at this time.<br><br><font color="#050056">17. The Trackers' Water Extractor - This is currently broken, is it not? The purification tablets do not seem to exist, and the NPC that mentions them won't respond.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I inquired about this time time back, when Kunark first launched, and it was verified at the time that the tablets do exist. If I need to check into it further, please let me know.<br><br><font color="#050056">18. Bandages vs. Aloe Swatches vs. Maneater Plant Salve vs. Tailored Silk Bandages: Is there any difference other than price i.e. More healing, faster healing, etc.<br><br><font color="#a00000">No difference at this time.<br><br><font color="#050056">19. Are there any plans to give clerics any type of special ability that is tied to whatever deity they worship?<br><br><font color="#a00000">No, there are currently no plans along these lines. However, there are plans and implemented pieces of deity-specific quests that return deity-specific rewards.<br><br><font color="#050056">20. Are there any races and/or classes that you, personally, would like to see added to the game?<br><br><font color="#a00000">If we added a warrior/wizard hybrid, could we call him a "fire fighter"?<br><br>-Gordon</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=376828&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

Though the number of different responses was almost as great as the number of posts, many of them dealt with fun, or with concepts related to fun.<br><br>I think that it can generally be agreed that EQ&#8217;s customer base is very diverse, and with that diversity comes many different types of players. EQ strives to provide as many different avenues for &#8220;fun&#8221; as possible, leaving it up to the player to make decisions regarding what avenues they wish to pursue. Some find the social aspect of the game to be the most fun, while others have a good time by advancing in levels.<br><br>Some measure it in items, while others prefer character development along the lines of mastering trade skills or languages. Still others want to personally witness as much as possible within game.<br><br>Our goal with EverQuest is to entertain you for the greatest amount of time possible, and to do this we must provide activities that the players consider &#8220;fun&#8221; in nature.  I&#8217;ve spoken many times about the concepts of risk and reward, but those concepts can be broken down to the perception of fun. Setting pure socialization aside, as it is one way of having &#8220;fun&#8221; that does not require a challenge, the goal is that &#8220;rewards&#8221; provide excitement, entertainment, etc. (cf. Fun), to the players that overcome challenges. <br><br>Last week we discussed camping, how it impacts the game, and what the driving forces behind it are. I think that from the responses to that thread, we can agree that camping relates to the concept of &#8220;fun&#8221; in one way or another. Players either enjoy camping itself, or enjoy something that camping will provide, if not the process itself. The social gamer might enjoy camping because of the opportunities for socialization provided in the downtime between kills. The leveling gamer might enjoy the prospect of raising in level. The item gamer looks forward to the items. More indirectly, perhaps the exploring gamer doesn&#8217;t enjoy camping for experience or loot, but gets fun out of exploring new situations, for which they need the levels and items to do, without explicitly caring for those levels or items.<br><br>The questions I&#8217;d like to pose are:<br><br>What is it about EverQuest that entertains you? If you had to label yourself as a particular type of gamer, what would that type be? Though I&#8217;m sure that everyone has particular issues that they feel could use improvement, everyone either has fun in game, or foresees the prospect of having fun sometime in the future. For instance, there are players that feel that once they reach their particular goal (whether it is one of items or levels), they *then* can go have fun.<br><br>If you are of the type that does not feel they are having fun now, and foresees fun once reaching a specific goal, what is that goal? What is it about that goal that makes you feel you can only have fun once you reach it? Internally, we refer to it as a &#8220;comfort-level&#8221;. What defines that comfort-level to you? What do you foresee will be &#8220;fun&#8221; once you&#8217;ve reached that comfort-level?<br><br>When Kunark came out, we raised the level cap. If you define yourself as one who must achieve a comfort level prior to having &#8220;fun&#8221;, did the raising of the level limit also &#8220;raise the bar&#8221; of your comfort level, effectively putting you far below it? Or did you enjoy the level-cap increase? I ask because before the level cap was raised there were thousands of people who were out having &#8220;fun&#8221; in game. Once the cap was raised, the focus for these people quickly shifted back to the &#8220;must-level-fast&#8221; philosophy.<br><br>Assuming that you have &#8220;fun&#8221; outside the tangible effects of levels and items, do you feel that &#8220;fun&#8221; is a just and suitable reward for a risk? Do you have fun outside of the scope of items and levels? Will you give some examples of where you&#8217;ve had fun without a tangible reward? While I understand that players who value only items and levels typically do not have fun outside of the acquisition of those rewards, I would imagine that most fall somewhere in between one player-type an another rather than directly in the middle of one of the ones I&#8217;ve defined. <br><br>If you could make any change to the game, feasible or otherwise, to increase the amount of entertainment you get or fun you have in the game given your particular gaming style, what would that change be? Other thoughts? I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing discussions between the players on their various perceptions of fun. <br><br>This should make for a pretty good discussion. Often here on the boards, we fail to get a good impression of the different types of gamers out there. It&#8217;s not unusual to see two posts on the opposite side of an issue related to &#8220;fun&#8221; claim to both represent the majority. I really doubt there is a &#8220;majority&#8221; for most issues in EverQuest, because as in life, very few things are black and white. <br><br>This is an opportunity to jump in and be heard. <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=376734&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

I wanted to separate out the two issues and discuss them individually. I've started a separate thread on the issue concerning the unannounced change of the partisan pack, which is a bag given by an NPC for the purpose of completing a quest. <br><br>In this thread I'd like to discuss my comments where I said:<br><br>"Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then."<br><br>After reviewing this post that I made earlier, I do agree that it appears to be a threat when viewed out-of-context, and understand the general reaction that followed. The point of the post was to respond to multiple posts from people earlier in the thread who had no idea that they shouldn't use combinable containers, particularly free bags given by NPCs to complete quests, for general item storage.<br><br>I'd thought that the number of people using the bags for this purpose were the exception rather than the rule, an observation that was apparently mistaken given public response to my post. Given that public response, we won't be taking any steps to "destroy" items in combinable containers upon logout or linkdeath.<br><br>I do apologize for the way my response was phrased and hope everyone understands that neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult. <br><br>-Gordon<br></font></font></blockquote><br><br> </font>

All this past month, on each Friday, we planned and held an event and for this last one we decided it was time for our Elder Paladin in the guild, Braxus Silverhand, to receive the second of the Paladin Holy Swords, Soulfire.<br><br>The call went out at 7pm CST for friends to come and join us in the northern portion of the Newbie Area in West Freeport. Within the hour we had almost 20 people there to help take Sir Lucan down. The pull was made, the battle was joined, and within a minute, Lucan, both his human and skeletal form, fell. The Testimony of Truth was looted and the Brilliant Sword of Faith was brought forth out of Northern Freeport.<br><br>We made haste to Southern Karana and found our way into the dungeon of<br>Infected Paw. Many a gnoll sought to prevent us from attaining our goal but not a single one succeeded. Finally, we found ourselves in the jail area of the dungeon, where we stood in front of Brother Hayle and handed him all the items he requested in order to bless Braxus with Soulfire. In the end, Braxus stood before us, the firey blade in hand, and smile as wide as the world of Norrath on his face.<br><br>But we did not stop there no. The next morning we sought Soulfire once again for another Paladin in our guild, Sanain Fyrestarr. While we did not have as many people there for this Lucan slaying, we did manage to kill him and Sanain received his Soulfire as well.<br><br>For a guild as small as the Heroes of Valor this is truly a magnificent feat and I wish to thank everyone who participated in both slayings. A special thanks goes out to Azoth and Lile, both of whom were there for both slayings, even though they were not part of our guild.<br></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><br><br>Wow! What a great accomplishment for a small guild!<br></FONT> </font>
