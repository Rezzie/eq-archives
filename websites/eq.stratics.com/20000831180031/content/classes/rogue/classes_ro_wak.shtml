                    So you've decided to play a rogue. Backstabs are cool, and 
                    so are sneak and hide, and it's generally a fun class to play. 
                    Personally, I don't find the casting classes fun. I've started 
                    several caster characters, and become board by level 10. So 
                    melee it is, and I already have a warrior. <br>
                    <br>
                    My rogue is currently level 11, so this guide cannot be totally 
                    accurate past that level. Also, this is the way *I* chose 
                    to play, and is only a general guidline for this class/race 
                    combination. So, without further ado: <br>

                    <br>
                    As a rogue, you are able to wear wear most non-plate armor. 
                    You can use slashing and piercing weapons, but if single wielding, 
                    use a piercing weapon. With Dual Wield, always keep a piercing 
                    weaponin your primary (left) weapon slot. You cannot backstab 
                    without piercing, and it works off of your primary slot. Feel 
                    free to use any kind of weapon you want in the off hand, just 
                    keep your piercing skill high. <br>
                    <br>
                    Your job as a Rogue is to be a damage dealer. You are not 
                    really a tank, as the lack of plate shows. You do not have 
                    Taunt either. You may be asked to tank, but if possible, leave 
                    it to the Warriors, Paladins, and Shadow Knights. Concentrate 
                    on your offence, but try to keep your AC up too. Important 
                    Stats <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Stength</b> - How much you can carry, also how hard you 
                    hit. Especially affects your backstabs. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Agility</b> - How often you get hit, how often enemies 
                    miss. However, given a choice between agility and AC, go with 
                    the AC, you'll take less damage. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Dexterity</b> - The most important Rogue stat. It controls 
                    how fast you learn all of your rogue specific skills. It also 
                    determines how often you hit, and how often magical weapon 
                    effects go off. <br>
                    <br>
                    Stamina is not too important, because you are not a tank. 
                    Intelligence and wisdom aren't important either, and charisma 
                    may not be important because you can always get an indifferent 
                    /con from an NPC with sneak (see below) <br>
                    <br>
                    Stats seem to go in quarters, meaning you'll see your ATK 
                    rating go up more if you raise your strength from 74 to 75, 
                    than from 79 to 80. So aim to get your stats to the 75, 100, 
                    and 125 milestones. Remember, at later levels, items will 
                    make everyone have near the same stats. <br>

                    <b>Halfling</b>: <br>
                    Pros - Traditionally, the race with rogueish tendencies, best 
                    starting agility and dexterity. Good starting zone. Twinkers' 
                    favorite. <br>
                    Cons - Everyone and their brother plays a halfling rogue, 
                    it's the most popular race. Low starting strength. <br>
                    Reccomendations - Put all the bonus points you can into strength. 
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Cons - Being big can sometimes be a problem. Low starting

                    <br>
                    <b>Dark Elf</b>: <br>
                    Pros - Looks very cool. Fits, if you are a roleplayer. Good 
                    agility and dexterity. Racial Nightvision. <br>
                    Cons - Tied for lowest strength with Wood Elves, and Gnomes. 
                    Evil race. Bad starting zone, with a convenient location. 
                    Kill on sight many places. <br>
                    Reccomendations - Beef up the strength. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Wood Elf</b>: <br>
                    Pros - Very good dexterity and agility. Short 'n' Cute. Racial 
                    nightvision. Popular starting zone. Racial Forage ability. 
                    <br>
                    Cons - Low strength. Starting zone has the most public chat 
                    usage in the entire game. Getting hit on if you play a female. 
                    <br>
                    Reccomendations - Lay on the strength, go play in Butcherblock. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Dwarf</b>: <br>
                    Pros - Great stength, stamina, and dexterity. Racial Infravision, 
                    Sense Heading. One of the best starting zones. <br>
                    Cons - Low agility. The women have beards. <br>
                    Reccomendations - Lay on the agility. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Half Elf</b>: <br>
                    Pros - No stat is incredibly low, agility and dexterity are 
                    very good. <br>
                    Cons - Somewhat low strength. <br>
                    Reccomendations - I think you know what I'm going to say. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Human</b>: <br>
                    Pros - Very average <br>
                    Cons - Very average <br>
                    Reccomendations - Split points equally between strength, agility, 
                    and dexterity. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Gnome</b>: <br>
                    Pros - Very good agility and dexterity. With a helmet, looks 
                    like a little ninja. Very rare class/race combo. Racial Infravision, 
                    and Tinkering is a gnome only trade skill. <br>
                    Cons - Lowest starting strength. Starting zone is awful. <br>
                    Reccomendations - Put all the points you can into strength, 
                    and go to play in Faydark or Butcher <br>
                    <br>
                    I decided to play Gnome, because the combination was so unique, 
                    and you really can play any race to 50 relatively easily.

                    <br>
                    <b>Sneak</b>: You get this at level 3. What it does is lower 
                    the agro of NPCs and mobs you stand behind. Your speed slows 
                    to a crawl when doing this, but you can move. This can be 
                    used in conjunction with Hide, so you can move while invisible. 
                    With this, you can move in cites where you are kill on sight, 
                    and by and sell to NPCs because they will now /con indifferent 
                    to you. Put one training point into it, and then practice 
                    alot. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Hide</b>: You get this at level 4. Makes you invisible 
                    to living *and* undead. Does not work on a few high level 
                    NPCs. Looting a corpse, attacking, and getting a spell cast 
                    on you (including Bard songs) will make you visible. Only 
                    works while standing still, unless used in conjunction with 
                    Sneak. You can use the /corpse command to pull your corpse 
                    to a safe location while staying invisible. Put one training 
                    point into it, and practice alot. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Evade</b>: A new skill rogues were given to balance the 
                    fact that the lockpicking and trap skills are near useless. 
                    It is available once you get hide. Evade is not a trainable 
                    skill per se. As your sneak/hide skills get better, it becomes 
                    more effective. The way to use it is to turn off your attack, 
                    and press hide. If it works, you are lowered on the NPC's 
                    "hate list", and if there is someone else around, the monster 
                    will go attack them. This is very usefull if you do too much 
                    damage, and the tank can't taunt the monster off of you. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Pickpocket</b>: This skill becomes available at level 7. 
                    This is a very cool skill, it allows you to steal money from 
                    the your enemies. It is accomplished by pressing the pickpocket 
                    button when not attacking. This can be practiced on all mobs, 
                    but will only give money from the vaguely humanoid ones, such 
                    as orcs and gnolls (i.e. those that might have pockets on 
                    them). Using this skill will make the NPC attack you, which 
                    is why it is unwise to use it on townspeople and guards. Make 
                    sure you can beat whatever mob you are PPing from, unless 
                    of course you are stealing from someone elses kill. If that 
                    is the case, watch out for NPCs that can speak, like guards 
                    other people are fighting, and dervishes, because the will 
                    alert that you are trying to steal. This skill does take from 
                    the pool of possible loot the enemy, drops, so it is considered 
                    bad form to loot while in a group. However, if someone steals 
                    your kill, follow them and pick the monster clean. Put one 
                    training point into it, and practice it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Backstab</b>: This is your defining skill, achieved at 
                    level 10. You may want to save up the majority of your practice 
                    points up till now, and then blow them all here. It is worth 
                    it, for your backstab is typically five or six times your 
                    weapon damage. Backstab is a piercing only attack that can 
                    only be done from behind the enemy. You will spend most of 
                    your group life opposite the group's main tank/taunter. In 
                    groups, try to make all the tanks stand on one side, so you 
                    do not have to keep turning. The three things that most affect 
                    how much you backstab for are you skill in it, your strength, 
                    and your weapon damage. As you achieve higher levels, you 
                    will find your self looking for strength items more than anything, 
                    and higher damage weapons. A level 50 rogue with 200 or so 
                    strength, and a 13 damage weapon can hit for over 300 per 
                    backstab. It should be noted that monsters hate to be backstabbed, 
                    even if you miss. It is one of the most effective taunts in 
                    the game, even if you don't want it to be. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safe Fall</b>: Level 12. This skill can help you survive 
                    those nasty accidental falls (Dagnor's Cauldron...). While 
                    the skill cap is lower than the one on monks, this is still 
                    a usefull skill. The best way to train it is to find one of 
                    those steep hills, that you can fall down and repeatedly get 
                    hit for 1 damage five times on the way down. Just keep falling 
                    down the hill, and the skill should go up fairly quickly. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Dual Wield</b>: Level 13. This allows you to wield a second 
                    weapon in place of a shield. This will not quite double you 
                    damage output. You hit more as your skill goes up. You can 
                    one hand weapon you want in the second slot, it doesn't have 
                    to be piercing. Many higher level rogues use a procing (effect) 
                    weapon in this slot. Put only in one point to start this skill, 
                    and it will go up on its own. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Double Attack</b>: Level 16. This skill gives you the chance 
                    of hitting a second time each round, per weapon. This leads 
                    to a possible (but rare) four attack round. This skill will 
                    rise on its own, after the starting point. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Throwing</b>: This is an under-utilized skill. While other 
                    classes get throwing, and they all can get critical throws, 
                    only a rogue can get a Deadly Strike. A Deadly Strike has 
                    a chance of occuring when you throw something at a monsters 
                    back. It does much more damage than a critical hit. Criticals 
                    and DS's have more chance of happening with a high dexterity 
                    and throwing skill. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Pick Locks/Disarm Traps/Sense Traps</b>: I do not know 
                    much of these skills, as they are generally broken. Verant 
                    decided they couldn't implement traps way back before they 
                    released the game, and pre-expansion, there are less than 
                    ten pickable doors in the entire game. One of the only zones 
                    where this skill is usefull is Befallen, which has three locked 
                    doors. You need a lockpicking kit from a vendor to accomplish 
                    the skill. It will go up with practice. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Instill Doubt</b>: I do not know much about this skill, 
                    except that it works like a Fear spell. <br>

                    <font color="#000066"><b>The Mask of Deception </b></font><br>
                    <br>
                    I thought I'd put something about this item in this guide. 
                    This mask is a Bard and Rogue only No Drop item. It is the 
                    common dropp off the Froglok Assassin in Lower Guk, which 
                    also drops the Serrated Bone Dirk (one of the best rogue weapons). 
                    The mask adds 13 to your charisma, and, starting at level 
                    15, lets you cast Illusion: Dark Elf. This will make you Gnomes 
                    and Halflings taller, you Barbarians more manageable, and 
                    lets everyone vacation is Neriak. Or any evil city. Of course, 
                    you should always /con guards and NPC's, because the illusion 
                    changes your faction with good and bad cities. Most of the 
                    dark elf rogues you see around are that in name only. The 
                    reason that I put this in, is that while Lower Guk is a high 
                    level (40-50) dungeon, this mask can be achieves as low as 
                    level 4. If you have never killed a froglok, this is very 
                    simple. Put all your equipment and money in the bank, and 
                    run down to Innothule. Go into Upper Guk, and you should be 
                    able to run around with impunity (assuming you haven't killed 
                    a froglok). Always /con, to be safe. <br>
                    <br>
                    Once in Upper Guk, find the live side entrance to Lower Guk, 
                    and zone in. Nothing on the live side except gargoyles will 
                    attack you, but watch for wandering undead frogs, which will. 
                    find the exit to the dead side, and go into sneak/hide mode. 
                    Ask directions to the supply room, where the Assassin spawns. 
                    This being Lower Guk, he is perpetually camped. Since the 
                    mask is No Drop, and bard and rogue only, the groups usually 
                    destroy it. Ask if you can loot it if it drops, and sit down 
                    and wait. I got my mask at level 10, and the Assassin spawned 
                    within five minutes of me getting there. This was pure luck; 
                    you may have to wait hours. Backtrack to leave, once you have 
                    you mask. I'd reccomend you wait untill a peak time to try 
                    this. <br>
                    <br>
                    With sneak/hide, and the mask, a Rogue can go near anywhere.

                    Ravenscale Armor <br>
                    <br>
                    Rogue class-specific mid-level armor is not made of quest 
                    items, like for most classes. It drops off named spawns in 
                    the Cazic-Thule dungeon. Most are very hard, especially the 
                    Chest Guard, which is dropped off the Avatar of Fear himself. 
                    The zone itself should not be attemped by anyone below 20, 
                    preferably 25. <br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Levels 1-6</b>: <br>
                    <br>
                    Don't leave your starting zone, unless you are going to another 
                    one. Kill low level enemies, and loot everything that is stackable. 
                    At your level, 20 of anything is decent money. Solo, you really 
                    don't get much from a group at this level. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Levels 7-14</b>: <br>
                    <br>
                    Find you local low level dungeon. These are usually Blackburrow, 
                    Befallen, and Crushbone. You could also hunt wisps at around 
                    level ten, but you need a magic weapon to hit them. Starting 
                    at level ten, you really need to be in a group, especially 
                    since you get backstab. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Levels 14-17</b>: <br>
                    <br>
                    You can do the castle in Crushbone, or most anywhere in Oasis. 
                    I know Oasis is overcrowded, but it's a huge zone. The "orc 
                    highway" alone can easily support 3 groups. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Levels 18-20</b>: <br>
                    <br>
                    You have many choices. You can stretch the Crushbone throne 
                    room for a few more levels, as it's good money. You can go 
                    to Lavastorm. You can hunt crocs and caimans in Oasis. You 
                    can try the yard in Unrest. My personal favorite was the orc 
                    spawn in Highpass. It is usually camped by two groups, but 
                    if you can get in at an off-peak time, there is only one. 
                    It is one of the fastest spawns in the game, and usually spawns 
                    at least two orcs at a time. Loot is money up to and including 
                    some platinum, bronze weapons, and ring armor. I made 3 levels 
                    in as many days there. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Levels 20-</b> : <br>
                    <br>
                    From now on, you can hunt most zones in the game. Go where 
                    ever you feel like. I like Unrest, at low twenties with my 
                    main character, but go explore some other zones. <br>
                    <br>
                    Well, there's my meager guide on playing a rogue. I'd like 
                    to thank all the high level rogues, and rogue message boards 
                    which I've pestered for knowledge. I hope this guide is usefull 
                    to you, and you have fun with the class. Remember that a warrior, 
                    cleric and rogue group is a very effective three-man group, 
                    and don't let anyone know that you are pickpocketing. Remember 
                    that with sneak/hide you can do corpse retrievals for other 
                    people, and that you are not a tank. <br>
                    <br>
                    Have fun. <br>
