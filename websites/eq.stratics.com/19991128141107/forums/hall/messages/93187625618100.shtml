In Reply to: <a href="9318059863858.shtml">Mature roleplayers? you must be kidding!</a> posted by Mastic on July 12, 1999 at 2:59:46 PM CDT:<p>
OK, a few quick questions. <p>--This should be rich.<p>          1. When the fuck were roleplayer's Mature? And if you know some please realize that they are the exception, not the rule. I have GM'd and roleplayed since the late 70's and in no way would I consider most roleplayer's mature in any way shape or form.<p>--So your personal experiences, probably with a small group of people, are to be the standard by which the rest of the world operates?  I seriously doubt that.  Too, one who is actually playing a role is probably not someone who is going to have a problem with immaturity.  It takes quit a bit of self-confidence to abandon your own personality and take on another.  However, one who is insecure might very well label others as immature just for kicks...<p>          2. Why are you upset that your Homoerotic guild is being flamed? This was NOT a IRL event, it was a online event. RL is irrelevant in this. I don't know why you brought RL up.<p>--Why is he upset?  Perhaps because the GUILD, not the two players involved, is being attacked.  Just as you wouldn't hold a school responsible for something two of its students had done, you do not hold a guild responsible for its members actions - unless, of course, the guild ordered those actions taken.  Too, you are labeling the entire guild as being homosexual.  Did you stop to consider that some guild members might also have had reservations about this event?  Do you even KNOW the rest of the members of the guild?  I thought not.<p>--Oh, and real life does matter for this.  Real life is what forms the opinions being expressed here and is also what spawns whatever desires, fantasies, and dramas are played out in Norrath.  Never underestimate how much effect you real life has on these in-game events.<p>          3. How are we smearing your guilds name? I have encountered your Homoerotic guild on Xegony and have seen your Homo emotes. You people should really change your guild name to Cram McCrevice.<p>--Let's see.  You just smeared the name right at the end.  You gave no examples of what these alleged emotes were, and even if the great majority of the MacLears knew of them.  In this post alone are several cases of you calling the entire guild a bunch of homoerotic mutants.  But I suppose that's not smearing their name, since you only insulted them all without even knowing the great majority of the guild.<p>          4. You posted that they wanted a marriage not a lesbian event. Well what the hell else are you going to call two women making a homoerotic commitment to each other? Romper Room? Sesame Street? get real.<p>--Actually, you could call it a marriage, but that's obviously not going to penetrate your head if your other statements are any indication.  However, let me lay something out for you.  The phrase "lesbian event" would refer to something that includes sexual activity between two females.  If that occurs, then that's what the event is.  However, if it is the exchange of a commitment of love between two females, it is still a marriage.<p>          Finally, You clowns wanted us to know! Apparrently this was designed as one big "outing" for your entire guild! Homoerotica may be your own private hell, but don't drag me into it! <p>--Of course they wanted people to know.  This is something new and unique, and those involved probably believed that it would be good for the community.  However, intolerant and - this is an assumption based on personal experiences throughout my life - arrogant Christian wretches like yourself have decided to go off on a useless crusade in order to cleanse the virtual world of people who are different.  You may refer to this marriage as being private and not wanting to be dragged into it, but I have news for you.<p>--You dragged yourself into it.<p>--You did not even have to pay attention to it.  You didn't have to say a word to Nosferum.  You didn't even need to be a rude, abusive coward in this post.  None of your problems with this are the fault of the MacLears.  It's all on your shoulders.<p>Leera, Bard of the Tenth Measure<br>Solusek Ro
