<div>
    It was a rainy day in Qeynos. The docks were nearly deserted, except
for a singe woman, a slim red-haired cleric. She sat on the edge of the
docks, casting. The fish, however, were not biting, and all she had
managed to catch was an old sandal. Wrinkling her nose at the smell, she
tucked it away in her backpack, it wasn’t worth much, but it was better
to carry it around than toss it back into the bay.<p>
    As the day wore on, the weather finally broke, and with the sun
peeking out of the clouds, a stranger approached her. He was a small,
dark man, wearing a blue cloak, and carrying armor. He sized her up,
sitting on the pier with a broken rod, and said, “Kaila?”<p>
    She was so startled that she dropped the rod. Jumping to her feet,
she looked at the stranger and demanded, “Sir? How do you know of me?”<p>
    He smiled, and bowed before her, “Ah, my name is Bauhaus. I am a
servant of Rodcet Nife, like yourself.”<p>
    The girl blinked, “You are a priest?”<p>
    Bauhaus appeared startled, “No, I am a paladin in his service.” He
shook his head, “I have come to ask you a favor. The temple said you may
be able to help me.”<p>
    Kaila ran her hands through her hair nervously, “Um… How may I be of
service to you, sir?”<p>
    Bauhaus shook his head, “No need to be so formal, I am not superior
to you. I was on a small island between here and Erudin, when I fled a
small army of undead. I left a few important things there…” He cleared
his throat, “Ah… temple property. At any rate, I must retrieve it, and I
was hoping… maybe you could help me?”<p>
    The young cleric gazed apprehensively at the dark skinned paladin,
“Ah… I’ve never traveled at sea before, and I have little money…”<p>
    He shook his head, “I can take care of that. Are you willing to
help?”<p>
    Kaila smiled at Bauhaus, “Of course. My duty or not, I am always
willing to help.”<p>
    The man smiled back warmly, “I’ll meet you back here tomorrow, then,
at nine o’clock sharp. Is there anything you need to take care of?”<p>
    Kaila’s mind whirled, “Yes, but I will meet you here. I can take
care of them in time.”<p>
    The pair shook hands, and parted.<p>
<p>
Kaila was dazed, and more than a little confused. She packed her most
important belongings, said farewell to her friends, and promised to
return soon. The dawn of the new journey saw Kaila waiting at the docks
well before the appointed time, eager, but still worried about what
might come.<p>
    Bauhaus showed up at nine o’clock sharp, and they boarded a small
ship, the Sea King. The ship pulled out of the harbor, and they were on
their way. Kaila’s anticipation quickly turned to boredom, as Bauhaus
was not a very social person, and the sailors were seldom to be seen.
    Midway across the sea, trouble struck. Kaila sat near the side of
the ship, fishing, when something happened.<p>
    There was no warning, and no preamble; nothing to say that what was
going to happen other than a swiftly growing feeling in the pit of her
stomach. She was sitting on the gently rising deck of the ship, when…
nothing. The ship was gone, and all was blackness… She opened her mouth
to scream, but no sound was heard. There was nothing to see, feel, or
hear… She couldn’t even tell where she was, it was as though nothing
ever was.<p>
    Kaila’s heart pounded, and she franticly tried to think of what to
do. It seemed as though hours passed, and then, as though the darkness
had never been, she was back. She opened her eyes, and found herself
under the sea, slowly sinking, with no sign of the ship. She swam until
she thought her lungs would burst, and finally reached the surface. But
once she was on the surface, there was no ship…  no land… and no clouds
in the sky.<p>
    The cleric cried and screamed, “Great lord Rodcet, help me! Have
mercy, show me the way back to your temple! Take me home!” But, it
seemed, to no avail…<p>
    At last, growing tired, and hungry, she swam. She swam in what she
was sure had to be the same, steady direction. The day was nearly over,
and her strength nearing its end when she saw land… a single, small
island in the distance. She swam like mad, refusing to let go, panting
to herself, “Thank you lord Rodcet, Rodcet is merciful, and guides those
who are worthy, and protects the weak and wounded. Rodcet guides his
lost children, lest they fail their duties…”<p>
    Finally, she had reached land. Her strength sapped, she fell to the
ground, and slept.<p>
<p>
    The next morning, she awoke in a small hut. A large, humanoid
creature with short, soft fur all over it’s body, and the head of a cat
looked down on her and barred its teeth. Kaila fainted at the sight, and
awoke a few hours later. Climbing up from the mat she found herself on,
she looked around. The cat-man was sitting on the ground outside,
cooking something over a small fire between three huts.<p>
     Kaila sat back down anxiously, but the smell of the food finally
overcame her fear. She emerged from the hut and approached the creature.
It looked up from across the fire and barred its teeth at her again.
Kaila halted, and realized that it was only smiling.<p>
Kaila smiled back, and the creature made a purring, growling noise at
her. She frowned, and scratched he head.<p>
    The creature shook its head, and handed her a chunk of the meat it
was roasting, along with a strange tropical fruit, and a small gourd of
water. Kaila looked through the belongings that she still had left with
her, and offered the creature her savings, a few gold coins.<p>
The small furry being shook its head again, and pushed the food into
Kaila’s hands. Kaila wasted no more time being polite, and tore into the
meal with zest. Her host looked on approvingly, and ate some of the meat
itself. After the meal, Kaila became a swift friend with her savior,
even though she could not understand its speech, nor it hers.<p>
    Kaila spent a few days recovering from her ordeal at sea, but
eventually parted ways, amid much paw shaking, and a tearful hug
goodbye. Kaila managed to return to Qeynos soon after, despite an ordeal
with a shark that managed to get onto the deck of the ship.
She returned to Qeynos, and stays away from ships, though she still
likes to fish in the rain. Of her companion Bauhaus, she has heard
nothing, and fears that he has been lost at sea, in the bizarre accident
that nearly took her own life, but she goes on, greeting travelers who
come from across the sea, and showing them the town.
