You NEED armor, trust me.  <br>you can get cloth first, then leather, then damask or woven, then netted.  <br>I don't know if monks can wear rubicite armor, which is better than plate and extremely light.<br>I think monks can wear green splinted armor, which is also extremely light, and is almost twice as good as plate, and offer additional stat scores such as +intelligence, +strength and such.<br>However, don't dream about rubicite until lv 30 when you and a huge group can go to cazic thule to obtain the armor.  <br>Don't ever, ever, ever fight without armor.<br>To give you an example of how much armor affect fights at really high levels (30+) I will give you an example of a test my lv 36 cleric friend Hafez and a lv 34 monk Obal did in Phase 4.<br>They went to fight a cyclopse, lv 30'ish mob who hits in the 70's.  Being a monk, Obal went up and started to tank the cyclopse, and Obal did major, major damage.  He punched in the 40's with duel weild/double attack and occasionally kicking in the 80's.  But there was one problem.  Obal the poor monk could not wear any armor that's chain class or highter, so he was hit by the cyclopse for FULL damage almost EVERY round.  So, being the wise cleric Hafez was, he went up and tanked the cyclopse for Obal.  And contrary to what most people believe, Hafez tanked 4 times better than Obal, all because Hafez was wearing plate while Obal was wearing chain class equivelent armor.<p>Now, this might seem unfair to the monk, since monks are supposed to be a better melee class than clerics.  But truth hurts, monks really got gimped in phase 3.5 when Verant redid the ac factor.  <br>Don't be discouraged, however, because a lv 50 monk with his bear hands can do 50% more damage than a lv 50 warrior with the Warrior Master Weapon. (I won't tell you what it is but let's just say a lv 50 warrior will slash for 250 with it.)<br>Now you get the picture of what a monk can do at that level.<p>Yet another problem arises.  At level 50, you need a full party of lv 50 players to kill even a lv 48 mob.  two lv 46 mobs means death to your whole lv 50 group.  So, if you the monk is doing more damage to the mob than your fellow warrior, who is the mob gonna hit???<br>Of course, the mob will not even get off you!  Your fellow warrior can taunt, kick, bash, do whatever, but the mob will stick to you throughout the whole fight.  You are twice the offensive tank your fellow warrior is, but you are but not even half the defensive tank your warrior friend is, all because of the ac factor.  He has got better armor, and that's all there is to it.  Plus you get way less hp.<br>Also, lv 40+ mobs have extremely high intelligence ratings, meaning they are not stupid enough to let you deal so much damage to them while they focus on hitting the warrior.  Chances are, even if you are not doing as much damage as the warrior, the mob will still focus on wasting you because it sees you as a greater risk.<p>So, in conclusion, wear armor.  Yes even that stinky cat tail you looted off some plains cat, wrap it around your neck. <p>Espacia<p>
