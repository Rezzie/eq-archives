<tr><td><b>Solist</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Yes, players will have the option of choosing to see either all of the new models or all of the old ones as a customization feature. Unfortunately you won't be able to see new gnomes and old trolls for example, but we figured we'd give people the option for sentimental and subjective purposes.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Thundolfe</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>Excellent, thank you. :)</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>NickyD</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Jerrith* Can we expect high level content for Beastlords (planar armor, thurg, kael, and SS armor quest npcs), to be in place right away on SoL's release, or will we face a long delay? (Similar to the iksar planar armor.)</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>N0chulus</b></td><td><font color="#000000">We have already created several sets of Armor for the Beastlords that will match the planar, Kunark, Velios, and Quest armors that the other classes currently have. We will also be putting together new armors and equipment for them in Luclin as well. You can expect these to be in place on release.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Abashi</b></td><td><font color="#000000">It's too early for us to put a price tag on them.  To tell you the truth, we probably won't announce it prior to the first people discovering where they might be purchasable in game.  We do like to save *some* stuff for those who go exploring :)</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Anci</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Tuuv* There are reports from test server that epics have not been subject to the 2hs enhancements. This could mean that the hard earned epics, specially paladins, could at the end be sub-par when compared to those receiving the upgrade. Are the epics not going to be subject to the 2hs dly/dmg ratio enhancements? and if not, why not? or are there going to be quest in SOL to furhter enhance our epics that will place them above the ones now being enhanced?,/b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">While it's true that epic two-handed weapons won't be receiving an increase in damage and delay stats with this melee balance patch, it's not accurate to say they weren't enhanced.  We made a change to the way two-handed weapon damage is calculated after level 50, which is going to mean a significant increase in damage done by two-handers.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">All epic two-handers will benefit from this change, and I think you'll find they compare quite well to epic one-handers.  Only the very highest end, post-epic two-handers really needed a change in stats in addition to this new damage formula.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>AnnaT</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>Playing a ranger, I was wondering if any of the new spells would help to define the ranger class more, such as archery related spells or maybe something to do with tracking</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>N0chulus</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Indeed, we will be introducing a new line of Birds eye spells in Luclin, these spells will modify your chance to hit with Archery. Currently there are three spells in the line, which will start at the lower levels and run to the post 50 levels.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Reijas</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Bihlbo* Are they [bird's eye spells] self-only?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>N0chulus</b></td><td><font color="#000000">The Ranger Birds eye spells will be self only</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Reijas</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Espio_Terris* Question for the devs:  Most of the other spell classes have gotten a hint, albit unoffical, as to what thier new spells are going to be like, but bards are currently hanging dry.  Any chance you could give us a little hint as to what new songs we might be getting, if any?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>N0chulus</b></td><td><font color="#000000">ok, in response to the bard question posted above, first let me apologize for not getting songs in sooner, but please don't feel like you have been forgotten, I assure you, you haven't. I'm still waiting on coding for some of the new effects, though I do hope to add some of the bard songs later this week. Some of the things that are being considered are area (not group) Resistance songs, and haste songs that will exceed the normal haste cap. Going beyond the current haste cap will only be possible using one of these bard songs.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>NickyD</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Tuuv* Can you explain the reason for horses if it is true as rumored that they will provide no speed advantage over sow/selo's perhaps not to upset those classes that view those abilities as "defining"? Just eye candy to keep people around? I mean besides being able to say hey I had 14k to burn on a horse; what good would they be vs. the much cheaper and available jboots for example?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aradune</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Well, there are several reasons really. First, both the players and the dev team has always wanted horses in the game, ever since pre-beta really. So we've always wanted to add them, but needed both the time and opportunity to do so. But we also needed to figure out a way that wouldn't be unbalancing, and that wouldn't require re-working combat or other major systems in the game. So we dicided on a way to add them that hopefully won't interfere much, and it's really our desire that they do the following:</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aradune</b></td><td><font color="#000000">1. provide an alternate means of transportation -- as the EQ universe grows and grows, this becomes more and more important</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aradune</b></td><td><font color="#000000">2. provide for a new way to look -- I think being mounted on a horse is pretty impressive visually</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aradune</b></td><td><font color="#000000">and 3. provide a solid money sink, to help keep platinum valuable within the player driven economy</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aradune</b></td><td><font color="#000000">and we were able to do all of that with the current design for horses without risking changing too much else in the game</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aradune</b></td><td><font color="#000000">as for the prices, as mentioned, it's too early to announce them, but while they'll be expensive, they won't be unobtainable, or only obtainable by the very few -- that's not the point at all. Nor do I think they'll interfere much with druids and rangers being asked for SOWs and such.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Anci</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Elena* my question: Will you be able to see the new models in the new world as well as the old?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solist</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Anyone who owns Luclin will be able to see all of the new character models in every zone, old ones included.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Moonshadow</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Lyron* I don't meet the miinimum system requirements for Luclin.  Obviously, I can't play a Kerran or visit the new zones.  Will I still be able to buy a copy and take advantage of some of the other content, like non-Kerran Beasmasters, for example?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Yakatizma</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Even if you can't visit the new zones due to graphical requirements you can still choose to display old world character models and play a non-Vah Shir Beastlord. There are four other races besides the Vah Shir that can be beastlords. Admittedly some of the beastlord content such as quests and no drop items that are found in the new zones will be unavailable.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Yakatizma</b></td><td><font color="#000000">You will also still be able to take advantage of the horse feature and the post 50 alternative advancement.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Anci</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Nanaki_Ikanan* Here is my question: Will there be any new high end zones like Temple of Veeshan in SoL? New planes, or the like? Or will it be more focused on smaller encounters?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Abashi</b></td><td><font color="#000000">There will be a good deal of high end content, as well as raid encounters.  However Luclin focuses *primarily* on content aimed at at single, to two-to-three groups working together.  So we're not including entire zones geared to raids-only as was present with a few zones in Velious.  Don't worry though, there will still be tons of things to do :)</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>AnnaT</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>Jahaar: You're new to the team.. what role are you filling and what kind of experience do you have in everquest. Have you played a play character all the way to the top?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">I joined the live team a few months ago, and have been working in the game industry for about 9 years now.  My role on the live team is working as a content designer for new zones and expansions, mostly.  I've recently been heavily involved in re-vamping Chardok, and working on the melee changes on the test server.  As far as my knowledge of the game, I've been playing EQ for about 2 and a half years now, and I have levelled 5 characters over level 52 on a play server, including one level 60 character.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Reijas</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*HuweyII* Could you give some clues about the, "Additional non-level-based advancement options for those at level 60</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Solist</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Basically, high level players will be able to use experience gained towards new skills and traits rather than leveling...which of course isn't important once you've reached 60. These traits will contain many options from reduced casting time for wizards to the ability for a paladin to increase his lay on hands skill to heal completely. We're still playing around with the finalized list, but I'm sure it'll be a much desired feature for all.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Moonshadow</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Ikeya|Graffes* While riding on our ponies, will 2 handed weapons suffer an increased dely on them, since from a roleplay point, you need to swing it with one arm while using the other to keep from following off the pony?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Abashi</b></td><td><font color="#000000">We're not planning on including any advantages or disadvantages to gameplay based upon being mounted with possible exception to giving the horse some "mass" from a physics perspective.  Adding another balance component of that magnitude (e.g. affecting all of melee) would have made doing horses difficult in the first place.  As Brad said earlier, Horses are being included primarily for Travel, and the players desire to futher differentiate themselves from others. :)</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">As part of this melee balancing patch, I'm looking over the quality of post-epic items and trying to guarantee each class has equal quality weapons available across the board.  I'll be looking over the items on Vulak, along with the rest of Temple of Veeshan and I think it's safe to say a few items will be getting some stat changes.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>AnnaT</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>Are beastlord casters, tanks, meele casters?  What are their stregths?</b></font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Yakatizma</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Beastlords are a melee/shaman hybrid with the melee aspect leaning more towards a monk than a warrior. They have some of the special properties of a monk such as an unencumbered armor class bonus, better ac bonus for high agility and are second only to monks in unarmed combat damage. Like a monk they will have to rely on tanks or their pet to soak up a large percentage of the damage that would otherwise be directed at them.. In addition to their pet enhancement spells they will also receive some unique non-pet oriented beastlord spells and spells from their Shaman parent class.  You can think of them as primitive spiritual warriors with close ties to the wild and the shamanistic cultures they emerge from.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>NickyD</b></td><td><font color="#000000"><b>*Vino-TMO* Question: As a wizard, i've often been concerned by the relative decline in spell damage vs. melee damage over time (melee tend to get faster weapons, while damage spell damage is basically static).

<tr><td colspan=2><b>* Supercow has udders to cross</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">As a class, the warrior is incredibly useful in both group and raid situations, and in fact is often thought of as crucial to making an efficient group.  The warrior does have a lot of things going for him now - the highest quality armor, excellent damage output, a large advantage in hit points and actual tanking ability, taunts, stuns & slams, a vast selection of weapons with interesting and useful procs, as well as many useful disciplines. We're quite happy with the role a warrior currently plays in EverQuest, happy enough that we used the warrior as a baseline to measure the performance of other classes as we were balancing.  With this round of changes, we will be upping the warrior's taunt skill at level 60 to a cap of 230, to help deal with other classes gain in melee damage. We'll keep an eye on future changes, to guarantee a warrior always has an important role in the game, but there aren't any immediate class changes we feel are needed to make warriors more effective than they are.</font></td></tr>

They will zone with the Wizards, and be there waiting for them when they log in (they do not stay in the world when the wizard is gone though)... They will grant added resistances to the Wizard, as well as some other benefits that will aid in casting efficiency, as well their mana pool, and mana regen. That being said, they currently have not gone through final balancing and are still very much in the process of being worked on.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">We've already made one pass through some high end quests, making the top level Velious quest armor un-sneakable in most cases, as an example.  We're likely to go through again to make sure we're happy with the faction requirements of high end quests, and will be keeping that in mind as we develop the Luclin quests.</font></td></tr>

People would go there to raid the Royals for epic pieces, and occasionally you'd see a group camping the zone in, but overall it just wasn't getting many people coming in.  I've always been impressed with the architecture of the zone, and it seemed like a perfect zone to get a bit of a revamp.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">The amount of roaming mobs has come down quite a bit, things still roam but they don't wander from the very back of the dungeon to the front.  You'll find a higher amount of named mobs in the zone, some very interesting new treasures dropping, some quests and conveniences for people with good Sarnak faction, as well as a lot of fun encounters there.</font></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Jahaar</b></td><td><font color="#000000">Another guy on the team, Azaliil, has worked in some incredible story elements and flavor that really make the zone stand out.
