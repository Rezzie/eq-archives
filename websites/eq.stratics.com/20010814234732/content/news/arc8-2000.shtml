        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <font face="Verdana" size=2>While the router outages were occuring last night, Lady Daegarmo stopped by in chat, and talked to us about how upcoming Best of the Best tournaments are going to work.  Note:  This story is composed from notes taken during the conversation, due to the inability to log text in the EQ Chat room.<br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">After the Rogue Best of the Best Tournament, a random number will be rolled to determine the next class that is up.  In the interm between the end of the Rogue BotB Tournament, and the next one, there will be a new event, called the Test of Tactics. More Info Below..<br><br><B>Test of Tactics</B><br><br>The test of tactics is the first kind of major event Lady Daegarmo ran, way back when she was the server GM of Xenogy.  The rules for this event are simple, and listed below:<br><br><ul><li>One 6 man team versus another 6 man team</li><br><li>No fear, charm, or gravity spells allowed</li><br><li>You start out the battle with no pets or buffs.  Though buffs can be applied, and pets summoned after the fight starts</li><br><li>Last team standing wins</li></ul><br><br>This tournament will be conducted in the Best of the Best style, with the winners of each server going on to fight on the test server in a two day event.  The level limits of this event will be 3 55+ members, and 3 49+ members.  Also Lady Daegarmo is working with the EQ Operations team to devise a way to simulcast this event on the internet for all to watch.  More will be released on this upcoming event next week.<br><br><B>Best of the Best</b><br><br>For some classes, a pure PvP fight is not the best way to determine whom is the best in their class, both due to time constraints, and the role of the class.  For these classes an alternative type of tournament has been developed:<br><br><B>Cleric</B><br><br>As anyone on a PvP server knows, a cleric on cleric fight can last for hours, and almost always comes down to melee to finish it off.  The cleric BotB will consist of the cleric against a certian number of higher level undead monsters.  The cleric who keeps his cool and deals with the most monsters, wins.<br><br><B>Enchanter</B><br><br>Since the enchanters primary function is crowd control, lets see whom is the best at it.  I will spawn 6 level 35 monsters within 15 seconds, and the enchanter who stays alive the longest wins.  </font></blockquote><br><br>It was a fun chat session, during an aggrivating time in the game, due to the router outages.  I look forward to talking to you again Lady Daegarmo.

When walking through a narrow hall/tunnel in Dalnir the monk at the head of our party agroed three MOBS, which started pounding him. I start fighting one and taunting, trying to pull them off. As the monk starts to drop in HPs the cleric at the BACK of the group cures him, causing all THREE to pass magically through ALL of us to the rear where the start attacking the cleric. One is a caster, so it conveniently parks itself in the hallway casting at the cleric and keeping the rest of us from getting at the other two MOBS.<br><br>Things like this happen to me ALL THE TIME. The code REALLY should be fixed on this. Not only could tanks actually "tank" and hold off MOBS by standing in the front line protecting casters (their job, right?), but it would fix the "trapped in place" bug caused by MOBS moving someplace they shouldn't be able to get to and then blocking PLAYERS movements.<br></font><br><font face="Verdana" color="a00000" size=2>NPCs do not not collide with PCs due to AI limitations and potential balance problems.

It would be another matter entirely for them to try to also calculate the way around dynamic objects within the world. <br><br>So, as foreseen by Lostalus, NPCs can do things that PCs cannot.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><font size=2 face="verdana" color=#a00000>September 28th, 7:00am <br>  - ----------------------------- <br>  ***Patch Day*** <br><br>  The following changes have been implemented on the production servers as part of today's patch: <br><br>  *General Changes* <br><br>  - NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before decaying. This should help those on large multi-group encounters who need some prep-time before looting items.<br>  - The item "Woe" has been repaired. If you receive the "Item out of charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please contact a GM to trade out the item.<br>  - The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed. The recast-time has been reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely based upon the delay of the weapon. In addition, a hitpoint return will only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or the primary hand if you are unarmed.<br>  - Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.<br>  - "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads. <br><br>  *Fleeing NPCs* <br><br>  Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug that was fixed. After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before. NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been. <br><br>  As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on health. We've determined that this is not a good situation for the players. As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per player request. <br><br>  *Level 1 Character Purge* <br><br>  The Level 1 character purge has been completed. All level 1 characters that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted. <br><br>  *New Server Active* <br><br>  Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active and ready for play. Enjoy! As a reminder, /movelog registration will take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to Midnight (PDT: GMT-7). <br>  Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, early next week. <br><br>  ***User Interface Changes*** <br><br>  Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch: <br><br>  *Moving and Resizing Windows* <br><br>  The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, then clicking again. The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the appropriate size, and then clicking <br>  again. Coordinates for window locations in each resolution are stored in the <br>  EQCLIENT.INI file. <br>  <br>  *Bugs with Several Commands Fixed* <br><br>  We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared. They should now only function when the native button would have functioned if pressed. <br><br>  *Miscellaneous Additions* <br><br>  Added the following /-commands: <br><br>  - /camp: Causes your character to camp out. You must be sitting to use /camp.<br>  - /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an invitation to join another group.<br>  - /invite: Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation if one is pending.<br>  - /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack". You may also add a parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state. <br><br>  In addition: <br><br>  - CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-slot.<br>  - ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and ENTER.<br>  - The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell. However, you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that have sent you /tells. <br><br>  *Pauses in Socials* <br><br>  You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause). <br><br>  For example, a social consisting of: <br>  /sit off /cast 1 /pause 100 /sit on <br><br>  ...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. <br><br>  Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same line. <br><br>  For example: <br>  /sit off /pause 100,/cast 1 /sit on <br><br>  ...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another, and MUST be specified first on the line. <br><br>  *Emote Codes* <br><br>  The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). <br><br>  The new %-codes are: <br>  %T - Returns the current target.<br>  %S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).<br>  %O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).<br>  %P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).<br>  %R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).<br><br>  For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote: <br>  /point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. <br><br>  ...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill it." <br><br>  - The EverQuest Team </font></blockquote><br>Come join us on a discussion of this patch in the <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showthreaded.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=393378&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">Westwood Tavern</a>

The response to this has been mixed, with roughly an equal number of people on both sides of the issue.<br><br>Now that the problem was fixed, we've reevaluated the the bravery code and determined that they flee too often now. As such, that potential to flee will be reduced in tomorrow's patch, though they will still flee more than they did before.<br><br>That said, the same change also had a decidedly negative effect: Charmed creatures began fleeing. I think everyone can agree that this part of it was pretty well objectionable, so we're going to stop charmed creatures from fleeing.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br>

On 3 occassions in the past week, people banned for activities on this board later contacted us and said that it was some ex-friends, guildmates, or others "borrowing" the account.<br><br>While I'm on it, if someone contacts you via messageboards, the usenet, email, or instant messaging, and offers to "trade" accounts for a while just to see what your character class is like and let you try theirs, they intend to steal your account. <br><br>Also, if someone offers to buy some items off of you, says that they need the items on the current character, and offers to log in their "alternate" to give you the money, they intend to steal your stuff.<br><br>Not to mention, if someone throws up a webpage with some 3rd party utility that allows you to "cheat" in EverQuest without getting caught, it just might contain a backdoor virus to allow them to get your account name and password. There are reputable 3rd party programs out there that do not affect gameplay that are as such not illegal and are distributed by reputable sources such as mainstream news sites that might be safe, but we make no warranties of any type nor do we endorse those programs. Just be sure of your source.<br><br>Finally, if someone with a level 1 character has a name very much like someone in your guild, and asks you to help twink them up with items, the person is most likely not your friend from the guild and just wants free stuff.<br><br>That should about cover it <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>

After speaking with the programmer responsible for AI among other things, it's apparent that there was a change made while optimizing code that caused an "unintended fix" to the AI. Though no one sat down and said, "I'm going to make creatures flee more", that's the result.<br><br>Without going too far into specifics and formulae regarding the decision to flee, there are several "components" that NPCs use to determine how brave they are. One of the common ones that everyone knows about is the interrelation of hitpoints and level with the attacker. One of the other less-known components was using some uninitialized memory (memory space allocated to a variable that hasn't yet been 'set' to anything, and usually contains garbage) that had the effect of making NPCs much more brave than they should have been.<br><br>We are going to discuss this in the tuning meeting Monday, but my initial impression is that the AI is now working as it should, and I like how things are turning out so far.<br><br>What are your thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=389730&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a>

If someone was using the 20/40 weapon, the damage bonus would be applied ONCE in a 4 second period. If they were using the 10/20 weapon, it would be applied TWICE in the same period. With the 5/10 weapon it would be applied FOUR times in that same 4 second period.<br><br>It was this damage bonus which makes weapons that are very fast for their type better than those that are slower.

Furthermore, the "Spell Effects" box will also be resizable, to choices of 3x5 (current), 2x8, or 1x15. <br><br>Finally, the Chat window will also be resizable. Resizing horizontally will cause more text to be displayed per line. While resizing vertically will still only display a maximum of 10 lines, the spacing between the lines will be dynamically adjusted. I know that many people felt the font size changed in this patch, but really only the spacing between lines was reduced at higher resolutions.

Anytime you are dealing with these beings (NPC) many things can and usually go wrong.<br><br>Poisons are a trademark of the rogues, and I have only one request on the topic, this being that no blindness poisons are applied and used against each other. This is to ensure that the matches are based on true skill and trickery, not a false trickery granted by a poison.<br><br>Pick Locks, while a needed skill in some of the greatest dungeons in the realm, are far away from the Arena that we hold the events in. This also holds true for Sense and Disarm traps, which are hundreds of miles from the arena zone.<br><br>Instill Doubt has been requested to be disallowed by a council of rogues that met in the Arena this past week. After showing that a single success of this skill results in an undoubted win, it was outlawed from the event. This skill should not be considered &#8220;useless&#8221; by any means, just too strong to be using against each other in this duel.<br><br>Disarm, on the other hand, will be allowed in the event. It will take a quick hand to disarm a rogue in motion, and an even quicker hand to pull out another dagger from a nearby sheath. This skill cannot be ignored and will remain in the event.<br><br>Activateable items will be disallowed. Needless to say those bringing earrings that can lifetap, potions that can heal or negate poisons will negate damage done to them not out of skill, but out of the wealth of a rogue that can afford such luxuries. Items that have these abilities can still be worn, just not used.<br><br>Hide and Sneak is a no-win situation for the judges, contestants, and participants. If we allow hide and sneak, everyone who enters the ring will have see invis gear on so they can engage their opponent at all times. The only thing hide and sneak will accomplish is to take away the event from the crowd who has come to see the greatest rogues fight each other. <br><br>Therefore we are going to disallow hide and sneak in this event so that the rogues can wear items that will allow them to increase their combat efficiency and allow everyone to see the great action.<br><br>Backstabbing is allowed and encouraged. Since this is normally the most damage that a rogue can do to an opponent, of course it will be allowed.<br><br>The use of ranged weapons for the rogues is another profession defining ability. I must state that the bow is not allowed, but other weapons of ranged attacks will be granted. Also be advised that &#8216;kiting&#8217; will not be allowed. <br><br>This leaves a lot of room for interpretation of this statement, so I will make an all encompassing rule that states you can only attack via range once, then reengage with melee. Now if you wish to throw a dagger, melee once, back off, throw another dagger, that is allowed. As long as there is melee between the ranged attacks, you may engage as much as you desire.<br><br>There was a rule with the warriors, which stated they must face each other at all times in combat, therefore not allowing for &#8220;Constructive Fleeing&#8221;. If you wish to turn your back on a fellow rogue, knowing full well their capabilities of attacks from the back, both melee and ranged, you may do so. I expect low life expectancy for those who turn their backs to a rogue, and highly advise against it.<br><br>(OOC) The rule of Link-Death has been reviewed, and it was determined to modify the standing of this rule. If you go Link-Dead and are losing, you forfeit the match. If you go Link-Dead and are winning the match, the battle will be reviewed by the GM for a rematch. The option of disqualifying the Link-Dead player is still given to the judge, even if winning, but the Judge has the option to call for a rematch now.<br><br>These are the current rules of the event, and I assure you that they are still open for discussion and revision up to the point of the first match (Prexus &#8211; Wed at 5pm). I have worked with many rogues to try to find another event that will fit within time restraints so all servers can run them, that spectators can watch the glorious event, and that are fair to the profession that is involved.<br><br>Good luck to the Rogues, we shall see you at the event!<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Event Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</font></blockquote>

Anyone who has taken the time to build friendships can get groups if they've fostered the required friendships, and can contribute to those groups.<br></font><font color=050056><br>Or having them set up a page where everyone can go to and read comments on the class, its strengths, its weaknesses, strategies, and other class specific things such as quests etc??<br></font><font color=#a00000><br>There's already several websites out there that specialize in information of this type without making it part of an official information release. <br><br>-Gordon

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><font size=2 color="maroon" face="Verdana"><br>September 19th, 7:00am<br>------------------------<br><br>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7). Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted. If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27. <br><br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions to the game. <br><br>*New Epic Quests*<br><br>We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" style quests for every class in the game (including paladins). The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br><br>Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br><br>*Class Issues*<br><br>Rangers:<br><br>Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all melee-centric classes. In the course of these tests we determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the following changes:<br><br>- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br><br>Monks:<br><br>High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty. The additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br><br>Cleric:<br><br>Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration. We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br><br>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction. This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group. As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased. <br><br><br>*Fungal Regrowth*<br><br>"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell. It was being used as an offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target. Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern. The spell was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<br><br><br>*Attack Speed Buffs*<br><br>In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual component. This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" equipment and spells. The downside to this is that those who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br><br><br>*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*<br><br>Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address disparities in risk and reward. For the most part, the quality of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the "rares" from Sebilis.<br><br><br>*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*<br><br>In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand. Included in this change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip. The delay on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br><br>In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified. The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<br><br><br>*Server Selection Screen*<br><br>It has come to our attention that new players often think that the high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else is there, it must be a good server. However, in Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay. Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in "green" in the server selection window. The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br><br><br>*Custom Emotes and AFK*<br><br>Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. For instance: <br><br>/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <br><br>...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it." <br><br>Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK. Type "/AFK <message>" (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message. For instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with "Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.<br><br><br>*Skill Gain*<br><br>The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats. This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br><br><br>*Trade Skills Enhanced*<br><br>Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things to be discovered once in game. <br><br>In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented. Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes: <br><br>- Baking<br>- Blacksmithing<br>- Brewing<br>- Jewelcraft<br>- Tailoring<br>- Fletching<br>- Pottery <br><br>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200. Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering. Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill. <br><br>The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project. Further enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=387746&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"]here</a> in the Westwood Tavern.

This is perhaps the greatest challenge for a massively multiplayer game to meet. Rather than just saying this is impossible I choose to look at it from a different perspective. It is my belief that everyone can be a hero in his or her own mind and in the minds of those around them. The 12th level warrior who makes a stand to hold off the gnolls while his party escapes is indeed a hero to that particular group. The 50th level cleric who travels the world resurrecting and healing those in need could be considered a hero on the server in which he does this. The point I&#8217;m getting at is that you, the player base, decide who your heroes are based on the way they act and the things they do. <br></blockquote><br></font><br><br>Read the rest of this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=386443&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">here</a> in the Westwood Tavern.

It's the assumption that they may not know what they are doing is inappropriate. It's very possible that warnings could be issued for borderline cases, and it really has no affect upon the account by itself. However, a pattern of someone not knowing that what they are doing is inappropriate leads to us no longer being able to give them the benefit of the doubt. This can very well lead to suspension or banning. <br><br><b>Suspension</b> - Suspensions are temporary in nature. They typically last 7-10 business days, and customers are not allowed to access the EverQuest servers or message boards (for posting) during this time. They are appropriate when there has been a pattern of inappropriate conduct as indicated by warnings, or when there isn't question that conduct was inappropriate. A suspension means that while we still want your business, we want you to know that your conduct isn't appropriate.<br><br>Suspensions are also the first step taken when account-ownership is contested by someone with a bona fide claim.<br><br><b>Banning</b> - Banishment is permanent removal from the game, and possibly future products as well (to be decided at a future date). It means that though we appreciate your past patronage, it is not in our best interest to continue the business relationship. Bannings are appropriate when the intensity of a willful act causes us to reach this determination. Bannings are also appropriate when there is past problems such as warnings or suspension. <br><br>Bannings are also appropriate for things such as confirmed EULA violations, attempts to defraud a GM/CS Rep, or other such problems.<br><br>Warnings are typically not contestable beyond the person who issued it. At most, the Server GM, at their option, may consider the issue.<br><br>Those who have been suspended or banned can contact <a href="mailto:EQAccountStatus@verant.com">EQAccountStatus@verant.com</a>, which is an email address reserved solely for communication with those customers, and is serviced by dedicated staff. Normal emails from people who have not been suspended or banned will not receive a response from this email address, and should forward their issue to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>

There was a problem with this implementation that will be fixed in the new one. However, the @ symbol has been replaced with a series of @-variables that expand into various pieces of information, and now works in all chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild).<br><br>The new @-variables are:<br><br>@T - Returns the current target<br>@S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She)<br>@O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her)<br>@P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her)<br>@R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>@C - Returns the class of the target (only works on Player characters)<br><br>Furthermore, animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current cannedemotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Abashi", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" (getting a bit complicated now, sorry). For instance, if my current target is "a gnoll", and I were to type:<br><br>/point say points at @T, indicating that he is ready to kill @O.<br><br>...my character would execute the /point animation, and the text output would be:<br><br>"Abashi points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it."<br><br>Custom text for canned animations must be directed at a target named "say".<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=385263&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a>

None of those (admittedly primitive) MUDs found the players regarding the sysops with such naked contempt.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I disagree that there is that much of a "disconnect" given the scale of what we are doing here. I think that we have far more communications with our customers than other service companies out there this size, in or out of the game industry. The MUDs of old have a much smaller playerbase to deal with and thus have a much greater chance of pleasing everyone with the decisions that they make. That's a rough thing to do at this size. Consider this, more poeple have played EQ than live in the state of Wyoming.<br><br><font color="#050056">Yeah sure you always had your share of bellyachers but here, I've seen some seemingly decent ideas and valid questions prefaced with lines like "I'm sure this will be ignored, but what about.." and "I know Verant doesn't give a **** but this would be cool.."<br><br><font color="#a00000">I really hate to see people prefix their posts like that as well, because it virtually guarantees that the post will go unanswered. Answering posts that are prefixed with some negative statement designed to promote a response out of spite get us off on the bad foot, and just encourage more posts of that type.<br><br><font color="#050056">Average players I've been in pick-up groups with treat /petition like the lotto: good freakin' luck. For them patch messages are out of left field (What is this moss twig, and why is it being nerfed??). And they're always seeing another "stealth nerf" behind every new situation, failed/useless spell, or bad death experience. (Stealth nerfs exist but I have no idea how widespread they are.)<br><br><font color="#a00000">The foreseen "stealth nerf" is certainly our fault due to repeated problems with getting the appropriate things announced to the public. We've made great strides in that department over the past 9 months, and I think that we'll continue to improve. <br><br><font color="#050056">And some staff members with Verant have slipped into a bunker mentality: it's us against the ignorant, whining, class-envious players who play 20 hours a week and then complain about how awful the game is<br><br><font color="#a00000">I disagree, concerning the bunker mentality. Again, I feel that we have a great deal of communication with our customers. We not only have me here on the boards every day, but Aradune, Rowyl, Ester, Hobart, Akriss, people in customer service and tech support, as well as Yak over on the tradeskill board. These others weren't "ordered" to come post here on the boards, they chose to because of their committment to satisfying the customers and their respect for customer opinions.<br><br><font color="#050056">I'm just an ignorant consumer so I can't say.. however I DO know that this discontent will continue until EQ is no longer the hyperpopular online game it is now.<br><br><font color="#a00000">As I mentioned in another thread today, that's the natural cycle of these things. If you visit the boards for the other games out there, you'll see the same type of thing that you see here. There is always going to be a percentage of players for whom we fail to fulfill our goals. Considering our over-70% retention rate over 18 months, and the fact that we are still growing and adding servers, I think that we're doing fairly well over all.<br><br><font color="#050056">Un-gag more staff members. Letting the coder in charge of the UI, and the guy in charge of tradeskills speak was a stroke of genius! Why don't we see GZ speak out anymore? What's the deal with the gag orders in the first place??<br><br><font color="#a00000">GZ is involved on another project but still consults with the EQ team and will always be the ArchMage  We do have to place some limits on how many people can be out here in the public light, and how often, since they of course are working on ways to add content to and improve the game.<br><br><font color="#050056">Fire Gordon Wrinn. I'm sorry Abashi, nothing personal at all<br><br><font color="#a00000">I don't know why you would expect that I wouldn't take this personally. See my comments above about negative posts in threads. To be honest, had I read this before I started responding I wouldn't have. You have a good post here for which you've harmed your credibility. <br><br>-Gordon</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote>

Clerics can do so much for a group in other areas, it makes sense that they would have to rely on the group for some things as well.<br><br><font color="#050056">AC Lines.. SoW cost so mouch to cast. Why should we burn 300+ mana for an AC buff, this seems like a awfully large jump in mana cost from AoF. We should see this buff reduced to the 175 mana range. <br><br><font colot="#a00000">It's a tradeoff. If the spell costs too much to cast, and is not worth that cost to you in that case, it's your option to choose not to cast it. If the group on the other hand wants every single stackable buff possible, it's going to cost more in the way of mana, components, and time.<br><br>-Gordon</font></font></font></font></font></font><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=9&Board=eqclerics&Number=384454&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a>

They usually consist of trio of actor NPCs or so entering an area and running amok until they are killed by a sufficient force of players.<br><br>Story-telling events typically have little-to-no fighting of any kind, and are usually used to tell a story leading up to or concluding an epic quest.<br><br>Epic quests often run several hours and boast a slew of actor NPCs that both tell a story and engage in combat at some point during the quest.<br><br>In addition to these, there are also &#8220;Invasions&#8221; which are more static in nature and deal with a temporary data reset of the zone. Examples of this have been the period undead invasions of Qeynos Hills, or the recent one in Najena that was launched with a small epic quest.<br><br>We realize and agree that there have been problems publicizing the story behind dynamic events, and will be launching a new section of our website in the next couple of days to deal with that issue. However, the question I would like to pose is, what do you want to see in the way that dynamic events are handled? It seems that no matter the event, or the story behind it, there are always some people who felt that the event was nothing but a &#8220;killing spree&#8221;.<br><br>What can we do to make these events more enjoyable for the players?<br><br>-Gordon</blockquote></font><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=383697&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a>

In other words, for example, a weaker item might be moved from VP to Sebilis, and a really strong item might be moved from Sebilis to VP.<br><br>This will undoubtedly make some happy, and some upset. Some will perceive this as a nerf of the easier dungeons. Some people will be upset that an item they've wanted is now more out of reach.<br><br>I'm also sure links to the mud wimping article will be posted all over cyberspace.<br><br>But, again, the alternative, which would be making the existing VP loot significantly more powerful, would cause MUDflation.

That's our bad, and I apologize. Unfortunately it's usually the higher end, really tough zones, that don't get banged on really hard until some time after release and thus require some tweaking time after release.<br><br>Anyway, it's not an easy call and I apologize in advance for any hard feelings We'll try even harder to avoid these situations with Velious but as our favorite rant site might say 'Tuning high level zones pefectly before thousands of customers bang on them is HARD'<br><br>-Brad<br></font></blockquote><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=383455&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5" target="_blank" >here</a> on our forums.

I don't want to get into specifics yet because we are still fine tuning, but the end result is that a Ranger should be significantly more survivable. <br><br>I'm personally happy with the solution because, rather than just increasing defense and making them more Warrior-like, we've upped skills that are more traditionally associated with Rangers (the view that they are nimble, chain-wearing fighters who often avoid attacks). <br><br>I'd also like to pre-announce a future goal and policy change: <br><br>Soon (we'll announce a date in the future), we're going to completely stop adjusting game balance as it relates to tweaking classes. Recently, we've made more changes than usual due to the level limits being raised from 50 to 60. Soon, however, we're going to come to a point where it stops. <br><br>We'll continue to add content (i.e. items, spells, etc.) and game balance will still be tweaked (and will continue to be tweaked as long as we do add content). But class balance changes as a whole will cease. <br><br>The Ranger upgrade is part of this. I'd say that hopefullly by early 2001 we'll be done. <br><br>Abashi or I will post more on this as we work out the plan in detail internally. <br><br>-Brad<br></font></blockquote><br>I am sure everyone will have a lot to say about this.

More things to do. We need to provide as many avenues to fun as possible, without infringing on other players' idea of fun. For instance, there are those who find it fun to cause other players grief. We do not wish to support that playstyle. <br><br>EverQuest already has many avenues to fun available to the players, leaving it up to you to decide which avenues to take. We can always provide more, as long as those avenues do not cause other avenues to break down as mentioned above. <br><br>- Gordon</blockquote><br><br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This was submitted by Zanen:<blockquote><font size=2 face="verdana" color=#050056>Some people may be wondering what the big deal is with Bards lately. Let me<br>elaborate.<br><br>- The level 15 Bard song, called Lullabye, is an AE Mez.<br><br>- It is not as powerful as the level 16 Enchanter spell, Mesmerize, because it only lasts 3 seconds (all other songs last 9). This means the Bard playing it can do NOTHING else while playing it, and it has a chance to be resisted every 3 seconds, making it very dangerous to use.<br><br>- The Enchanter's Mesmerize costs so little mana that meditating while mes'ing will actually INCREASE their mana if they've casted Clarity on themselves. Bard's Lullabye costs 0 mana.<br><br>- In a patch last year, an unannounced nerf was made to all Bard mez songs.<br><br>- Bards suddenly noticed that their song SAID it was working but the mobs kept hitting them. After several months, they finally convinced GZ to do a public test in January 2000 to see what the problem was.<br><br>- This chat is available at <a href="http://www.eqsongs.com/NewsArchive/GZ_LullabyLog.htm">http://www.eqsongs.com/NewsArchive/GZ_LullabyLog.htm</a><br><br>- During the chat GZ said that a secondary resist rate had been added to the song.<br><br>- The secondary resist rate had no message for it, so the song gave a successful message even when it failed. Upon discovering this, GZ figured that was the whole problem and had the message added 2 weeks later. The song STILL says it is successful, however, it ALSO says it has failed at the same time.<br><br>- During the chat, people asked GZ what the resist rate should be. GZ said about 25% on low cons (blue/green) and 35% on white cons. He didn't mention yellow/red.<br><br>- GZ also said CHA should lower this resist rate.<br><br>- Level 50 Bards ran tests and found that the resist rate against a level 1 mob was 35% and completely unaffected by high CHA<br><br>- They also discovered that the resist rate got worse as they tried against higher and higher mobs. The resist rate against exp-giving (blue con) mobs was about 70%.<br><br>- 70% resist rate checked every 3 seconds was fatal to the Bard.<br><br>- Bards complained until last month, Ester The Tester was set to test the song and find what was wrong with it.<br><br>- Ester admitted she was clueless on Bards and didn't know much about the issue.<br><br>- Ester later said she thought that since the song was level 15 it shouldn't still be effective against high level mobs.<br><br>- Bards explained that ALL spells and songs in the game have their<br>resistance rates dependant on the level of the caster versus the level of the mob and the spell level was irrelevant.<br><br>- Case in point, Enchanters use their level 16 AE mez all the way up to 50 with consistent resist rates against blues. Same with Druids and their level 1 Snare.<br><br>- Ester never acknowledged these responses so Bards didn't know if she had heard.<br><br>- The next day, it was announced that the song was working as intended.<br><br>- Having already been told recently that the admittedly accidental nerf to Bard snare song would not be fixed, and having been looked over when the enhancements to the other Hybrids were made recently, the Bards were outraged.<br><br>- Many Bards quit EQ that day.<br><br>- Other classes agreed that the Bard Lullabye should be functional as Enchanters now have an unbalancing monopoly on Crowd Control. Even Enchanters showed their support, saying that they feel the Bard AE mez should work again.<br><br>- When asked why GZ would say one thing and then go back and say something else, Gordon replied that the snippets of chat log that he had been shown did not explicitly state which resistance GZ was referring too. The whole chat log does, of course, but Gordon had not read it. <br><br>- Gordon/Ester claimed that the song was not supposed to be effective above level 30 and that the Bard's single-target mez was the "upgrade" to the song. However, it is even weaker because it is single-target only and has the SAME high resist rate as Lullabye.<br><br>- One of the level 50+ Bard testers pointed out that Ester may not have been aware of the fact that when the song is resisted, it says it is successful as well. If they used a parsing program during their tests that assumed every successful message was indeed a successful mez, the resist rates would seem much lower then they actually are. There has been no response so far on this possibility.<br><br>Zanen</font></blockquote>Note: This article is being posted as submitted and is not confirmed or denied as factual.

That a group of 3 people can camp the Sebilite Guardian to score a far superior weapon than several dropped off of Silverwing? or Hoshkar? <br><br>What happened?<br><br>- Furor, Fires of Heaven<br></font><font color=#a00000><br>I think it's a combination of mistakes, our hesitancy to 'nerf' to fix mistakes, and also the knowledge that other areas will most likely be upgraded in the future (for example, the planes vs. Kunark loot issue). <br><br>Anyway, I stand by what I said to you back then, and I think overall it still holds true in this game. As evidence, I submit many complaints on this very board about the game being too hard, that it punishes casual gamers, etc. In other words, your concern that the best loot isn't necessarily always in the toughest dungeons is virtually drowned out by other players' concerns that good loot is only obtainable by Uber guilds in the depths of difficult dungeons after adventuring for hours and hours. <br></font><font color=050056><br>The day a gamer starts being a businessman and seeing the $$ is truly a sad day... <br></font><font color=#a00000><br>No way for me to prove it, but I'm still the same gamer as I was back then. I'm still damn proud of EQ and still very involved with it. I've less time overall because I'm also responsible for our other future MMOG titles, but I've definitely not become what you fear I have. In fact, with our merge with SOE I've now more time to be involved with games and less 'business' responsibilities. <br></font></font><br>And later... <br><font color=#a00000><br>Guys, all the planes are going to get an item upgrade.<br><br>Several other older dungeons are going to be revamped too. <br><br>FA style quests for every class are almost finished and in early testing (the weapons look really cool, btw -- I was checking them out today). <br><br>And, rumor has it, the FA may very well be upgraded too. <br><br>As for Veeshan's Peak items, I'll bring up this issue at the next tuning meeting. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>- Brad

Dates and<br>places to meet to be invited to the guild will be periodically posted on the guild's message boards.<br> <br>2.  A week long 'boycott' of Rallos Zek will be held between 10/16/2000(Monday) - 10/23/2000(Sunday).

When pressed, this button will run a full CRC comparison on each file in your EverQuest directory versus the file located on the server, guaranteeing that you have the correct version of each file on your system.  <br><br>We've found that some people experiencing crashes while in EverQuest were actually being affected by file corruption that is not detected by the fast file comparison done each time you start EverQuest.  As such, anyone experiencing unexplained crashes should run the "Thorough File Check" to see if that improves the situation.  Please be aware that the process will take longer to complete.<br><br><br>*Looking for a Few Good Testers*<br><br>Verant Interactive's Quality Assurance department is seeking highly motivated individuals to fill several entry-level QA positions available at our San Diego development studio.  Applicants must have at least 6 months EQ gaming experience and must be able to work in our San Diego office.  Extensive gaming experience in all platforms, as well as previous testing, QA, and beta testing experience is a plus.  Please send your résumé to eqtesting@verant.com with a subject of "Applicants".<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>
