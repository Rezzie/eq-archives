              <blockquote>My Elemental (lvl 12 summon, now a lvl 16 summon) has 
                not bashed in over 4 days. Also, all the other Magician pets in 
                my group didn't bash AT ALL (last 4 days, not just once). Even 
                against low greens, they only punch and kick (assuming you've 
                got a lvl 16 summon). Also, my Necro friend reported his pet isn't 
                bashing either (lvl 8 summon).</blockquote>

                that has stopped all NPCs from bashing unless they have a shield 
                equipped. This is already fixed on test and will be moved live

              <blockquote>The bad news is that we need to bring the servers down 
                for about an hour shortly to deal with some stability issues introduced 
                with the last patch. It will be quick, but you know how we hate 
                to bring them down for any reason outside the normal scheduled 
                outage period.The good news is that as part of this patch, we've 
                fixed the "warp on flee" bug that plagues many areas of the game. 
                In some zones, NPCs will warp-off somewhere when they turn to 
                flee. They tend to come back at nearly full health, usually leading 
                a nice train behind them. They'll no longer warp when fleeing.

              <FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote>Now what? Three more spots left to fill and lots of 
                classes to choose from. *This* is the heart of the issue at hand. 
                Groups want efficiency. They *need* efficiency. Why? If all is 
                going smoothly, efficiency means the difference between everyone 
                getting one bubble of experience and perhaps two or three bubbles 
                of experience in a night. If things start to get rough (eg. an 
                extraordinarily difficult pull, an untimely respawn, or a train 
                slamming into the party in the middle of a fight), then efficiency 
                often means the difference between the party surviving or spending 
                the next hour and a half doing a dreaded mass corpse recovery.</blockquote>

                  Where: North Ro, Tunnel/Platform Area<br>
                  Why: General Fun for All 
                <p>Hello all of Lanys T'Vyl !!! We, The Indigo Order, are bringing 
                  to you, a Bazaar on Fridays in North Ro, as well as a mini festival 
                  to kick it off! We chose North Ro, to give some of the East 
                  Commoners a break! 
                <p>The Bazaar be the general fair, we are counting on people to 
                  have items to auction. It's on friday so everyone who sleeps 
                  late on Sunday's still has a shot at it. It's also nice to have 
                  new equip to kick off the weekend. 
                <p>Now for the festival. There will be several events. There will 
                  be a race, some dueling contests, and a scavenger hunt if all 
                  goes well. Anyone who participates in an event or duel will 
                  have a chance to win a random drawing. The prizes for this random 
                  drawing arn't that great, hopefully various Fine Steel Weapons 
                  and Pieces of Banded. This is our first event so cut us some 
                  slack. =) 
                <p>There will be a raffle for a Shiny Brass Halberd as well. Its 
                  1 platinum for anyone above level 10, and 5 gold for anyone 
                  under 10. People's names will be registered to a piece of paper 
                  and a random number will be drawn. The winner gets the halberd 
                  and a quarter of the money from the raffle. Raffle tickets will 
                  also be rewarded for winning events and such. 
                <p>To start the evening we will have a race, from the platform 
                  to... a not yet revealed location in North Ro. This is to prevent 
                  teleporting, I am hoping everyone can honor this! The prize 
                  will be 5 platinum and two raffles for the halberd. There is 
                  no entry free. 
                <p>The dueling contest is nothing special right now, but everyone 
                  is encouraged to duel and entertain the crowd!! 
                <p>There will be a scavenger hunt for anyone under level 7. The 
                  things you need to scavenge will be reported at the start of 
                  the hunt. The prize is 4 raffle tickets for the Halberd and 
                  5 platinum. Second gets 3 platinum. And third gets 1 platinum. 
                <p>There will be free SoW's for all and levitates while components 
                  last. I hope we have a good turn out and tell your friends! 
                <p>I would like to get to know my server more, and have lots of 
                  fun. Hopefully as the time goes on we can add on to this event 
                  and have better prizes, but until then, Fare Well!

                this one done.

              <blockquote>To my mind, one of the few benefits of being a necromancer, 
                a troll warrior or an ogre shaman is that you can hunt the guards 
                and other NPCs in a pinch. 
                <p>Yet tonight I stood and watched a monk and a Dwarven paladin 
                  killing Halfling guards in Misty Thicket. Two days ago a druid 
                  was upset (and whining publicly) cause all the Halfling guards 
                  were camped. 
                <p>If the so-called goods can kill Halgling guards yet still retain 
                  enough faction to sell at town (and walk by the other guards 
                  to go clean the blood of their hands at the bank), where is 
                  the benefit to playing one of the evil races? 
                <p>Stats (except for INT, WIS and CHA) appear to mean very little, 
                  so we can pretty much discount that. The dark elves have infravision. 
                  Then again, their faction is actually BETTER than that of trolls 
                  and ogres. So... what are the pluses of being one of the "hated" 
                  races? 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Well, for a tangible benefit, I've always 
                found the ability to kill indiscriminately with my evil character 
                quite refreshing. Though there are certainly some faction loopholes 
                that allow "good" characters to kill "good" NPCs, they often have 
                to search and find specific NPCs that don't hurt their faction, 
                my character never really had to worry about that. 
                <p>As far as intangible benefits go, I just like roleplaying an 
                  evil character.

              <p><blocksquote>Whats the point of Everquest? I have not seen anything 
                about the enviroment that promotes roleplay. All I see is CAMPING 
                for ITEMS and EXP. Even in groups thats all the game is about.What 
                is the point of getting plane gear? Plane gear is suppose to be 
                the best gear in the game and since this game is all about camping 
                gear why should we camp this last tomb of gear if we will never 
                be able to use it anywhere better? 
              <p><font color="a00000">That's one of the interesting things about 
                MMORPGs: They are what you make of them. If all you choose to 
                see or partake in is "camping items and exp", then that's all 
                there is here for you. On the other hand, if you choose to believe 
                and pursue something more, you can get as much out of the game 
                as you allow yourself to.</font> 
              <p><font color="a00000"></font>Is there a feeling at Verant that 
                there is much room for impovement or is it true that you guys 
                are satisfied with the current state of the game as Brad likes 
                to hint at? 
              <p><font color="a00000">It would be entirely arrogant of us to try 
                and say that "EQ is perfect". EQ is however, extremely successful, 
                and fulfills the general goals that was laid out for it. EQ generally 
                adheres to the vision of the perfect game, but there is and always 
                will be better ways to do things than what we chose for this incarnation.</font> 
              <p><font color="a00000"></font>Will you try to do things different 
                on future games or keep the same attitudes and practices towards 
                players? 
              <p> 
              <font color="a00000">I think it makes sense that any future products 
              that we create in the MMORPG genre will try to capitalize on EQ's 
              strengths and leave behind its weaknesses, much as competitor&#8217;s 
              products will try to do the same. As an example, we would try to 
              retain the things about EQ that makes it a very compelling game 
              to play, and might try to rid future products of the aspects of 
              EQ that people tend to be unhappy with (e.g. downtime). Though downtime 
              is integral to EQ at this point, and will remain a facet of EQ, 
              future products might focus on limiting its impact.

                get kicked off April 21. OK, i'm thinking, do I need to check?

                TIME. What are the odds ANYONE got it wrong? Aren't they really 
                hinting "we won't check"? SO, if you are 13 or under, or know 
                someone who is, who doesn't want to be booted off, better "FIX" 
                your birthdate before Verant makes a "MISTAKE" nad kicks you off. 
                Pass it along. (I actually do like this, Verant, even though this

                in that age range an EverQuest account. This goes for current 
                subscribers as well.

                  60 chars NOT 50 level 50s you go in there u die repeatedly you 
                  waste money. In the exspansion level 60 chars will be able to 
                  go up with 24 people and no have to spend another DIME after 
                  they gate up. You want to do it now and not wait then YOU suffer 
                  the financial troubles 
                <p>simply put when you are of the correct level plain of sky will 
                  cost probly 300 plat per person no more. NOW i cant think of 
                  a single person who cant afford 300 plat at level 50 much less 
                  at 60 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">If you are paying 3Kpp per person to go to 
                the Plane of Sky, there's only one reason: You want to. The zone 
                need not cost a cent after the first trip in. Deaths can be handled 
                with resurrect. Heck, you can even get by a few of the key requirements 
                using death, resurrect, and summon-corpse (this one costs money 
                though). 
                <p>Now of course if you want to bring more people than there are 
                  keys, or skip by the first island, it's going to cost you. We 
                  want the Plane of Sky to remain challenging regardless of how 
                  many warm bodies you can throw at it.

                scam directed at EQ customers attempting to get them to send their 
                passwords and login information to parties impersonating Verant 
                personnel. I would like to stress as firmly as possible that no 
                Verant, Sony, nor 989 Studios representative will *ever* ask you 
                for your password, or request that you change your password to 
                a specified string. 
                <p>Furthermore, any official communications will come from the 
                  verant.com or station.sony.com domains. We never use free email 
                  accounts provided by any of the free email providers on the 
                  web. 
                <p>I'm beginning to believe that people are perpetuating these 
                  scams in order to get some sick sense of accomplishment by seeing 
                  their scam-email posted on the front page of news sites. I'll 
                  therefore ask that news sites no longer post those actual emails 
                  when issuing the warnings, and instead opt to just summarize 
                  them. 
                <p>Please do not be fooled by these scams.

                you to type in your station name and password to enter an application... 
                it would be very easy to design a site that is a fake "guide application"... 
                so yes, in fact, Verant CAN ask for your name and password, just 
                not directly in Email... didn't think of that? 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Actually that's not true. Though the guide 
                application does ask for *A* password, it specifically states 
                that the password that you give should be different from your 
                login password.

                Greater Faydark or some other popular zone hoping someone comes 
                along selling the item you need? Now you can buy and sell items 
                e-bay style for platinum pieces. Just post the item on the list 
                for your server, arrange through e-mail with the highest bidder 
                where and when to meet, and go play without any distractions. 
                Everything is free. There are no fees or costs to post or bid 
                on items. As a bonus, buyers can browse the Magical Realm's extensive 
                equipment list to learn everything about the item before bidding.

              <blockquote>Greetings adventurers, I am Mince, a proud Gnome Gemchopper. 
                I am of the opinion that many areas of Norrath, especially dungeons, 
                are underutilized. In order to promote these areas as well as 
                the art of the Dungeon Crawl, I intend to periodically lead expeditions 
                to these locales. I am looking for hearty adventurers to join 
                me in these expeditions. Be forewarned that dungeons are dangerous 
                and have their own unique challenges (i.e. locked doors, traps, 
                large groups of monsters, etc.). Also, it will be a Dungeon Crawl 
                (meaning we will be moving from room to room, not camping in the 
                same spot). Therefore, power levelers, campers, and people that 
                run at the first sign of danger may not find this experience to 
                there liking. However, for those who enjoy joining a band of adventurers 
                and conquering a dungeon while focusing on fun, companionship, 
                and defeating foul beasts, please come out and join me. 
                <p>Target: Befallen, an undead infested dungeon located in West 
                  Commons. It consists of three floors with the dungeon getting 
                  progressively harder the deeper you go.Level range: 6-19th. 
                  I will lead the Bottom floor group(s) (levels 16-19). I will 
                  need leaders for the Middle floor (levels 11-15) & Top floor 
                  (levels 6-10) groups.<br>
                  Rallying point/time: Ro Tunnel entrance in East Commons at 4 
                  pm Pacific time (Sunday, April 2nd). Please be geared up and 
                  ready to go. It is encouraged that you bind yourself in West 
                  Freeport beforehand. The dungeon is roughly 5 minutes travel 
                  time from the rallying point. 
                <p>Any questions? Contact <a href="mailto:mince@luclin.com">mince@luclin.com</a> 
                  or Mince in-game. And be on the lookout for future Mince's Dungeon 
                  Crawls in the weeks and months to come.

                not have said. I'll take your word for it that it says what you 
                say it does, and decline to comment further. Whatever the experience 
                requirements are, that's what they are, that's the way it is, 
                and it won't be changing. The contents of the hint book aren't 
                going to change, and neither are the experience requirements to 
                put them in line if any discrepancy exists. <br>

                As we didn't have creative control over any of this documentation, 
                it's very likely that it contains information that might not be 
                entirely correct. It is also very likely that it contains information 
                that we didn't want released. The hint book itself was written 
                in late beta, and since the game has continued to evolve after 
                print, I'm sure that there are many things in it that are obsolete.<br>
                <br>
                As for the question in general, there's really nothing wrong with 
                it, I just don't want to be roped into answering all of the other 
                questions that would result from it. My recommendation to you 
                would be to kill a few things and draw your own conclusions.<br>

                time. Last night I was pulling Tundra Jack in Everfrost with darkness 
                dot and medding. While I was kiting Tundra, my pet already dead, 
                a druid came around tried to be cool casting snare on Tundra, 
                Tundra of course resisted and my darkness was removed, triple 
                hit for 135 while I was meding. I didnt even notice him running 
                towards me. 
                <p>Ok, fix that problem Verant, it sucks that newbies or not very 
                  bright players can have an invluence in my hunting tactics. 
                  Easy to fix: Darkness line should only be removable when players 
                  in SAME GROUP cast the removing spell (snare / root). 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">You might consider using dooming darkness 
                or higher instead of engulfing. Dooming darkness overrides snare, 
                and not to mention, slows the critter just as much.

              <p> 
              <blockquote>Welcome all to EQ University. Our course is titled Whining 
                101 wherein all the fine points of whining will be discussed and 
                many mysteries revealed. 
                <p>First let's look at the most fundamental law central to all 
                  of Whining Theory 
                <p>Law 1: "Conservation of Whining" Whining is neither created 
                  nor destroyed. It only changes form. That is to say it moves 
                  from class to class dependant on any and every action taken 
                  by Verant. 
                <p>Example: FA is revealed to be 2H slash. Paladins whine. FA 
                  modified to allow bash. Whine migrates from paladins to SKs 
                  and warriors. 
                <p>Example 2: Mages whine their pets don't dual wield. Verant 
                  fixes mage pets. Whine moves to necros, whose pets no longer 
                  hit fast enough. Verant compensates necros. Whine moves to enchanters. 
                <p>One can view this law as saying there is a fixed amount of 
                  "whine" to go around and it has to land somewhere. This also 
                  explains Gordon's prematurely gray hair, for he and the development 
                  team are really squeezing a balloon. As soon as they remove 
                  some Whine from Class X, it migrates overnight to Class Y as 
                  if by magic. 
                <p>Some classes have a higher "whine affinity" than others, making 
                  whine transfer from them to others more difficult. Other classes 
                  have a lower "whine affinity" as it were, giving up their whines 
                  quickly. If one thinks of whines as particles much like electrons, 
                  one can speak of these classes as whine acceptors and whine 
                  donors. This allows one to even construct a periodic table of 
                  sorts. 
                <p>Donor Semidonor Semiacceptor Acceptor 
                <p>Rogue Paladin Mage Ranger<br>
                  Enchanter Warrior Necro Wizard<br>
                  Bard Shaman<br>
                  Cleric Shadowknight<br>
                  Monk Druid 
                <p>Now it can be seen from this table that some gaps exist to 
                  the right hand side. It would seem there are six more "undiscovered" 
                  classes whose propensity is to whine most impressively. That, 
                  however, is pure hypothesis and beyond the scope of our course. 
                <p>The second fundamental law can be summed up as "whines run 
                  downhill". Whine acceptors are sort of mini black holes of misery 
                  and despair. They suck all available negative energy into themselves, 
                  leaving a shortage of whines available for other classes. Thus, 
                  when a true injustice is imposed upon whine donors, such as 
                  the enchanter pet nerf or shaman buff uselessness, the resulting 
                  whines tend to be short lived and underpowered. The overpowering 
                  attractive force of the whine acceptor classes simply asserts 
                  itself and the whines are dragged away by wizards and rangers 
                  for their own use. 
                <p>Certain situations are guaranteed to generate fluxes in the 
                  space/time/whine continuum. The finding of the FA recently is 
                  one such event. No matter what the stats would have been, that 
                  was a situation ripe with whine potential. Even though paladins 
                  are only semidonors and therefore not normally powerful enough 
                  to attract much whine away from the wizzies and rangers on their 
                  own, rare events like this can temporarily overcome the natural 
                  order. 
                <p>Whines have half lives much as radioactive elements do. Classes 
                  to the left of the periodic table have whines that decay rather 
                  quickly, typically a few days. The classes toward the right 
                  have never had their half lives measured but they are believed 
                  to be several years at least. 
                <p>This leads us to our last fundamental law. For every action 
                  there is an UNequal and opposite reaction. The inequality of 
                  the reaction depends on the position in the table of the class. 
                  For whine acceptors, the reaction is greater than the action, 
                  and for whine donors, it is less, again maintaining balance. 
                  Some examples may make this clearer. 
                <p>A small enchancement to the cleric class is likely to elicit 
                  a major whine-fest by the rangers and wizards. A major nerf 
                  to the enchanter class is likely to elicit nary a word from 
                  rangers and wizards. 
                <p>A small negative change to a ranger weapon will elicit doomsday 
                  whining from that class, as if the very earth had opened up 
                  and lava was running in the streets. A major lowering of wizard 
                  spell resistances will be whined about because it wasn't good 
                  enough. 
                <p>Once these laws are understood, reading the EQ message boards 
                  makes a lot more sense. 
                <p>Thank you class is dismissed!

                <br>
                I am pleased to announce the upcoming wedding of one of our members, 
                Titanyia Silveroak to Crysdin Silveroak this Thursday night, March 
                30th. The ceremony will be held at the entrance to Permafrost, 
                in the Everfrost zone, at 8pm CST. <br>
                What better place to hold a wedding than the beauty of the ice 
                and snow...<br>
                <br>
                Gwynneth, also from the Sign of One has been asked to be Titanyias 
                maid of honor and Brennen, our Primoris Capitus (First Officer), 
                is planned to conduct the services. <br>
                <br>
                We will stand by Titanyias side as Crysdins guild will be standing 
                at his side. Teleports are planned for the evening to as close 
                as we can get and SOWs for the rest of the way. Activities and 
                events are planned following the ceremony, (including Ice Giant 
                slaying!), so come ready to enjoy yourself and mingle with all. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We wish Titanyia and Crysdin Silveroak all the happiness in Norrath 
                and hope to see you there! <br>

                <br>
                Time: 8:00 pm EST<br>
                Where: North Ro, Tunnel/Platform Area<br>
                Why: General Fun for All<br>
                <br>
                Hello all of Lanys T'Vyl !!! We, The Indigo Order, are bringing 
                to you, a Bazaar on Fridays in North Ro, as well as a mini festival 
                to kick it off! We chose North Ro, to give some of the East Commoners 
                a break! <br>
                <br>
                The Bazaar be the general fair, we are counting on people to have 
                items to auction. It's on friday so everyone who sleeps late on 
                Sunday's still has a shot at it. It's also nice to have new equip 
                to kick off the weekend. <br>
                <br>
                Now for the festival. There will be several events. There will 
                be a race, some dueling contests, and a scavenger hunt if all 
                goes well. Anyone who participates in an event or duel will have 
                a chance to win a random drawing. The prizes for this random drawing 
                arn't that great, hopefully various Fine Steel Weapons and Pieces 
                of Banded. This is our first event so cut us some slack. =) <br>
                <br>
                There will be a raffle for a Shiny Brass Halberd as well. Its 
                1 platinum for anyone above level 10, and 5 gold for anyone under 
                10. People's names will be registered to a piece of paper and 
                a random number will be drawn. The winner gets the halberd and 
                a quarter of the money from the raffle. Raffle tickets will also 
                be rewarded for winning events and such. <br>
                <br>
                To start the evening we will have a race, from the platform to... 
                a not yet revealed location in North Ro. This is to prevent teleporting, 
                I am hoping everyone can honor this! The prize will be 5 platinum 
                and two raffles for the halberd. There is no entry free. <br>
                <br>
                The dueling contest is nothing special right now, but everyone 
                is encouraged to duel and entertain the crowd!! <br>
                <br>
                There will be a scavenger hunt for anyone under level 7. The things 
                you need to scavenge will be reported at the start of the hunt. 
                The prize is 4 raffle tickets for the Halberd and 5 platinum. 
                Second gets 3 platinum. And third gets 1 platinum. <br>
                <br>
                There will be free SoW's for all and levitates while components 
                last. I hope we have a good turn out and tell your friends! <br>
                <br>
                I would like to get to know my server more, and have lots of fun. 
                Hopefully as the time goes on we can add on to this event and 
                have better prizes, but until then, Fare Well! <br>

                pet spells are useless and harmful at times. Why would I want 
                my pet to spend valuable combat time to cast 15 damage spells 
                when it can melee for 120+ and the stun and root spells are resisted 
                and cancel snare/darkness. 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Several months ago, damage from the mage 
                pets was upped significantly in order to make up for time lost 
                due to casting. In other words, the pets were balanced assuming 
                that they would be casting all of the time. This is even truer 
                now that mage dual-wield. 
                <p>Making a "/pet no cast" option would result in us having to 
                  reduce the amount of damage they do significantly, and since 
                  I don't think that people would go for that, we'll have to pass.

                <p>Gordon, you have stated that Verant's opposition to a /drag 
                  command (drag corpse without looting rights) is that you want 
                  people to develop "trust" within the game. Yet, we constantly 
                  see server banner messages that shout "Trust NOBODY!!! Don't 
                  give ANYBODY your password!!!". 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Passwords (out-of-game) and corpses (in-game) 
                are two separate things, so the argument really doesn't apply. 
                <p>Here's the deal. If you consent the wrong person, he's going 
                  to steal from you. Don't do that, and if you do, and he does, 
                  then report him to a GM. 
                <p>You are fully in control of who you give consent to, and always 
                  have been. The /corpse ability (dragging) is relatively new 
                  to EverQuest, and was put in to help people get their corpses 
                  out of inaccessible areas without having to wait for a GM/Guide. 
                  At this point, it works well for that use and we decline to 
                  invest further time into it. 
                <p>Stating it as plainly as possible, we consider the issue closed.

                race. A guild has been created in which your level 1 char will 
                be guilded for the duration of the race, so that we can all chat 
                and enjoy the fellowship. We invite all guilds to send representatives 
                to the race. Choose your name according to the guild you belong 
                to: for example, I am Elche of the Shining Path, and my gnomes' 
                name will be Spelche. If you are unaffiated please name your gnome 
                lemXXXX where XXXX is the name you choose :). <BR>

                The rules. 1. Level 1 gnomes are allowed to turn in their note 
                prior to the start of the race <BR>

                took place on this day, the 26th of March, 2000. Warriors Mages 
                and Priests from throughout all the land made their way to the 
                Arena of Lake Rathetear to partake in the Test of Tactics lead 
                by the Lady Daegarmo and sponsored by Rallos Zek himself! 
                <p>The prize, the fabled Fanged Skull Stiletto! 
                <p>The battles would consist of 6 on 6 no-holds-barred skirmishes. 
                <p>After what seemed a decade of battle, two teams remained out 
                  of the original nine that participated. The Final round was 
                  set to pit the mighty Fires of Heaven guild against itself! 
                  What ensued was a battle of tactics that lasted an eternity. 
                  In the end, there could be only one team - and so it stood, 
                  that Lazink, Gentos, Nullo, Vernal, Sean, and Kreugen were crowned 
                  champions after destroying their mighty guild leader and his 
                  elder guards. 
                <p>On a side note, the Pope of Veeshan, Nino McHammer was nearly 
                  assassinated by a crazed zealot that rushed the arena armed 
                  with a dagger and insane bloodlust. Luckily, he was zapped almost 
                  instantly, only being able to scratch the hood of the Popemobile, 
                  leaving behind a smoking and rather stinky corpse. 
                <p>Special Thanks go out to Lady Daegarmo for running such an 
                  EXCELLENT event. There were absolutely no interruptions or disruptions 
                  throughout the entire test and the event was run to perfection 
                  by Lady Daegarmo and her staff in representation of Rallos Zek. 
                  Even the representative for the Champions of Xegony made a presence, 
                  hoping to no doubt meet the Champions of Veeshan one day in 
                  the squared circle for the ultimate Test of Tactics. 
                <p>Congratulations to all the contestants and winners!

                mana, then they can use thast mana to heal themselves. Why shouldn't 
                a warrior be able to Meditate to raise his own HP? Unless their 
                grouped with a healer, Warriors have the longest downtime of any 
                class, along with the Rogue who should also be considered for 
                this. I don't see any problems with class balance seeing as every 
                other melee class has a way of healing other that Bind Wound. 
                Bind Wound however will only get you half healed. 
                <p>This will give people a reason to be a warrior, and it will 
                  not take away from any other classes! Come on now! Be fair and 
                  give the warriors their due. They deserve it. I am a caster 
                  BTW, and I have no problem with it. In my opinion it should 
                  have been in the original game design. 
                <p>If there is a valid reason why this shouldn't happen I would

              <p>Will experience required to attain 51 be scaled up? If so how 
                many pre-expansion lvls would it take to go from 51 to 52? For 
                example is going from 51 to 52 roughly equal in time and effort 
                in going from 30 to 40? 
              <p>

              previous levels for sure. Not going to go into more detail than

                <p>Last night, an elite strike force of the Mythic Legion on Druzzil 
                  Ro defeated the mighty Noble Dojorn in the Plane of Sky. The 
                  battle was furious. Our flesh was seared by magical winds and 
                  our souls were twisted and torn. Yet we persevered and the mighty 
                  Noble fell at lastto our onslaught. Upon his decaying corpse 
                  we found a Belt of thePines, a large sky pearl, and a Golden 
                  Efreeti Chestplate! 
                <p>Congratulations to Mythic Legion for this first time defeat 
                  on Druzzil Ro, and to Rohaise Xiffar, Druidess of Rivervale,

                regard for its players , its too bad that a decent game as EQ 
                has such uncaring staff - frankly ye all remind me of some of 
                the GMs that come and go who have their click and all else be 
                damned - the game is popular not because of you but in spite of 
                you -- have a good day.

                here posting on Sunday afternoon -- because I don't care. That 
                explains why the EQ team works their butts off day in and day 
                out to make this a great game, often working tons of overtime. 
                <p>That explains why many ideas and features in EQ came from the 
                  message boards. 
                <p>That explains why we hired a guy (Abashi) to do nothing but 
                  interact with the online community and to post messages. 
                <p>That explains why we have a huge volunteer network of Guides 
                  who work their butts off for free.

                <p>*boggle* 
                <p>EQ is a popular and great game precisely because of the passion 
                  and commitment the EQ team put into the game (and continues 
                  to), because of the hard work and time the GMs and Guides put 
                  into the game, and because of the 200,000 players, the vast 
                  majority of whom love the game and play it all the time. 
                <p>EQ is popular in spite of people who post stuff like this. 
                <p>Implying that I don't care about something I've poured my heart 
                  and soul into for four years of my life is insulting at best. 
                  Do some of you really think about what you're saying and the 
                  people behind the scenes before you post? I have to think you

                <p>All no-drop would, to say the least, destroy the economy. 
                <p>So we have some items that are no-drop and many that aren't.

                tweeked with these new graphics? That would be very nice indeed, 
                plus it wouldn't hurt to add some more skins in the game, not 
                only faces and bodies, but also armor, weapons and the such..

                College. For part of my research this semester for an independent 
                study, I am interested in exploring several aspects of EverQuest, 
                ranging from player-character identities, to gender bending in 
                EQ, to appeal of the game itself. I am using online forms to collect 
                responses. The study's main page is at:<br>

                The tale of the Tome of Hatred, as told by Arravis Dru`giir:<br>
                <br>
                Twenty two hundred years ago the Necromancers, Shadowknights and 
                Priests of Innoruuk created a spell which allowed their deity, 
                Innoruuk, to physically enter the world of mortals. This complex 
                spell was kept within The Tome of Hatred, a singularly evil and 
                vile book. The existence of this tome became known to an order 
                of holy monks who stole the book from the Tier`Dal with the objective 
                of destroying it. All but one of the monks was slain in the process 
                of retrieving it, however they were unable to destroy the book. 
                To protect the tome the monk split the pages among seven powerful 
                adventurers. <br>
                These individuals are to safeguard the pages and avoid contact 
                with each other lest the tome be reconstructed. Unfortunately, 
                the pages themselves still seem to hold a sentient power and can 
                at times exert an influence over the guardian they are bound to. 
                Each page is able to sense the general location of the other pages 
                and their guardian.<br>
                <br>
                The guardians have protected the pages by passing them from eneration 
                to generation, however, recently three of the guardians fell into 
                the hands of the Tier`Dal. The dark elves have been using the 
                captured guardians to find and recover the remaining pages. I 
                was the leader of these guardians, and to rescue them I gathered 
                a large group of adventurers to assist in the recovery of the 
                guardians and the pages of the tome (this was the previous event, 
                part 1). These adventurers succeeded all too well. The guardians 
                were rescued and the pages in the hands of good again. It was 
                then that I began the magical ritual that would destroy the book. 
                During the casting, I began to feel the power of Innoruuk in my 
                mind. The father of my kin, the Tier`dal, whom I had left long 
                ago spoke to me. A divine vision possessed me and it could not 
                be denied. My mere mortal mind broke under the strain... <br>
                And I saw the error of my ways. In secret, Lord Innoruuk had organized 
                an army of darkness that at that moment, attacked the gathered 
                adventurers. In the confusion, I fled to the depths of Neriak, 
                tome in hand. There, I have studied the Tome of Hatred under the 
                watchful eye of Innoruuk and his priests and priestesses.<br>
                <br>
                I am now ready to begin preparations to cast the spell that will 
                summon our father back to his home. Gather children of Hate, progeny 
                of Innoruuk and let us bring our wrath upon this petty world. 
                We shall sweep over the land, destroying all our enemies and making 
                it ours for the plunder. The necessary preparations must be made. 
                The spell requires blood and magic. Help me recover these so that 
                Lord Innoruuk may walk among us again. So prepare yourselves Kin, 
                gather your spells and take up arms, our future awaits!<br>

              <blockquote>Greetings from Aven du Sora on the Innoruuk server!<br>
                We'll be holding an event this Saturday, March 25th, at 7pm PST, 
                in and around West Freeport. The major purpose is to start YAAP 
                (the Young Adventurers Assistance Program). All races are welcome, 
                we will be stationed outside the gates. We'll have food, drink, 
                buffs, and weapons available for free for characters under 10 
                seasons. Armor for all classes available for easy tasks. Magic 
                items will also be given for simple quests. Equipment will NOT 
                be "uber-twink"; expect fine steel, banded, raw silk and the like. 
                If you have Crafted Armor or a Flowing Black Robe at 5 seasons, 
                you've already had enough assistance :-). We will also have a 
                raffle, storytime at the stage, and maybe other events as well. 
                These are for everyone. Free 6-packs for all who want to relax 
                with the crowd. We'll make sure to have enough drink so everyone 
                can stagger through Freeport! The Raffle will have items nice 
                for low and mid-level characters. Tickets will be 1pp each, limit 
                3 per person. (we want younger people to have a fair chance at 
                goodies). We'll have a nice assortment of prizes, hopefully several 
                dozen. A cash prize will be awarded to end the raffle. Winners 
                need not be present, we'll record them and post a list afterwards 
                at the <a href="http://ads.eqhq.com">Aven du Sora website</a>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Take note that our event is at 7PM PST, or 10:00 EST. At this 
                time, the Innoruuk.Com Bazaar in East Commons should be just dying 
                down, so once its over, head on over to Freeport for even more 
                fun! <br>
                <br>
                We hope to see you there! <br>

                  quite bored one Norrathian afternoon. He sent me a message through 
                  the lands that he wished to see our arch-enemy the Priest of 
                  Discord slain. Many trembled at the thought of messing with 
                  the Dark Priest and his 350+ damage staff whacked them on the 
                  head. Four brave adventurers were not afraid however. And knowing 
                  the stupidity of going face to face with the Leader of the Player 
                  Killers; Alyssa of Inner Circle; Kriall of Revelation; Itzlegend

              <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>We 
                are going to have the first EFL game on April 15th! The exact 
                time of day is not decided yet. The time will be decided in a 
                few days. This is not going to be a normal game, in fact it's 
                going to be free to attend! But because this game isn't set up 
                like normal, any one can sign up to play in this game, it doesn't 
                matter what level, race, or server you are on you can sign up 
                for this game. But there probably won't prize, except for the 
                prize of being the first to win an EFL game! This is going to 
                be a timed game that will last 1 hour. The ball will be a giant 
                eye from queen klicknik (it looks quite a bit like a football, 
                when worn). Any one can sign up to play in the game, it will be 
                using Ogre warriors like normal, but the game will not be held 
                in the arena! This is how people will be able to tackle (kill) 
                one another; each person who is going to be in the game will make 
                an Ogre warrior newbie on Fennin Ro. That newbie will join 1 of 
                2 guilds, depending on which team they are on. Just before the 
                game starts the guilds will declare war and the players will now 
                be able to kill one another. This will also make it so spectators 
                can't interfere by killing players. Now I have a guild that has 
                only me in it, which means team 1 will be my guild, but I need 
                guilds to volunteer to be team 2. The smaller the guild the better! 
                There is a new section right in the middle of the EFL page, click 
                there to participate in this game! Here is the EFL web page address.

                <p>The Confederation of Guilds* on Povar wishes your attendence 
                  at the Charter Member meeting Thursday, March 23, 2000 at 9:00 
                  Eastern time in Povar Chat. Interested Guilds and parties, please 
                  send representation of your group-- or, if interested as an 
                  individual, please come let your voice be heard in this historical 
                  meeting. The meeting will briefly touch on the forming Charter 
                  of the Confederation, as well as the Core Beliefs and Preamble 
                  to the Mission Statement. All constructive thoughts and opinions 
                  are welcome as we solidify weeks of talks into the new Confederation 
                  of Guilds on Povar. 
                <p>When Guilds become Members of the Confederation, they agree 
                  to accept the obligations of the Confederation Charter, an inter-guild 
                  Server-wide treaty which sets out basic principles of inter-guild 
                  relations. According to the Charter*, the Confederation has 
                  four purposes: to maintain Norrathian international organization 
                  and security, to develop friendly relations among Guilds, to 
                  cooperate in solving intra-guild and Server problems and in 
                  promoting respect for player rights, and to be a centre for 
                  harmonizing the actions of Guilds. 
                <p>Confederation Members are sovereign Guilds in their own right. 
                  The Confederation is not a world or server government, and it 
                  does not make laws. It does, however, provide the means to help 
                  resolve inter-guild/Server conflict and formulate policies on 
                  matters affecting all of us. At the Confederation, all the Member 
                  Guilds-large and small, rich and poor, high level and low, with 
                  differing political views and social systems-have a voice and 
                  vote in this process. 
                <p>Come let your voice be heard.<br>

                -------------------<BR>
                <BR>
                ***UPDATE MESSAGE***<BR>
                <BR>
                This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes 
                to improve performance of the game engine in general. However, 
                there are several changes to note:<BR>
                <BR>
                *Spell Changes*<BR>
                <BR>
                - Skin Like Nature has had its damage shield removed and has regained 
                its regeneration component. We're certain this time :)<BR>
                - Many Shaman buff spells have had their recast delay removed. 
                You can now cast them on multiple people without having to wait 
                between each cast.<BR>
                - The Wizard spell "Rend" was improperly saving versus cold. It 
                now saves versus Magic. <BR>
                <BR>
                *Bug Fixes and General Enhancements*<BR>
                <BR>
                The spawning problem in Solusek's Eye (SoldungA), related to the 
                spawn of the Clockwork gnomes, will be fixed later today in a 
                zone patch. <BR>
                <BR>
                The +/= key will no longer take screenshots. <BR>
                <BR>
                You can now adjust your clipping plane by using the SHIFT/- and 
                SHIFT/+ key combinations. <BR>
                <BR>
                You can now view the Message of the Day by typing /motd.<BR>
                <BR>
                Corrected a bug in the /follow process that would cause your character 
                to loop around to the right at times when following someone.<BR>
                <BR>
                Corrected a bug that would cause item-loss associated with trading 
                a container marked LORE. <BR>
                <BR>
                Corrected some grouping bugs that had the potential to cause the 
                client to crash. <BR>
                <BR>
                *Feign Death and Pets*<BR>
                <BR>
                The Feign Death spell will no longer wear off. This change had 
                been made due to an issue that was discovered that allowed Necromancers 
                to solo creatures while feigned and AFK. The change had some unintended 
                effects, as we discovered that there are a few cases where someone 
                could be legitimately feigned for a longer period. Instead of 
                having the spell wear off, any summoned pet will automatically 
                suicide 2 minutes after its owner feigns. This is the solution 
                requested by most of the players who voiced an opinion, and should 
                serve the same goal as the original change.<BR>

            <div> This was sent to us in via Gordon...<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Hello All,<BR>
                <BR>
                I'd like to let everyone know about several of important things:<BR>
                <BR>
                1) We are going to be putting up 4 new servers over the course 
                of the next 5-6 weeks. We aren't blind to the overcrowding in 
                any way and this is a major step towards helping this situation. 
                It may seem as though we aren't attentive to this issue, but it's 
                been a major challenge to update all of the machines for Ruins 
                of Kunark as well as adding more servers. Although we haven't 
                decided this for certain, it is likely that on at least 2 of the 
                servers we will probably be moving people from the more overcrowded 
                servers.<BR>
                <BR>
                We will be SURE to give much more advance notice this time as 
                we realize our mistake the last time we did this.<BR>
                <BR>
                2) We are currently adding the hardware neccessary to run the 
                new Kunark Zones. This will mean some downtime each day for 1 
                -2 servers per day for about the next 20 days or so. Each server 
                needs to be taken down one by one for about a 6 hour upgrade. 
                This is a significant hardware upgrade and will have a lot of 
                good effects on the game overall. <BR>
                <BR>
                3) We are adding more customer service people to help run EverQuest.<BR>
                <BR>
                4) The price point of EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark has been determined 
                as $16.95 plus Shipping and Handling. We will offer different 
                shippingoptions that should satisfy everyone, including special 
                international shipping options to make sure our International 
                customers are satisfied. In early April you will be prompted when 
                logging into EverQuest. This will give you the opportunity to 
                purchase EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark online and bill it right then 
                and there. We will announce the date this will be going up well 
                in advance. Please note this price is ONLY for current customers 
                upgrading only.<BR>
                <BR>
                5) Very shortly we will be adding another ISP in addition to UUnet 
                and CERFnet.<BR>

              <blockquote>QUELLIOUS SPRINGTIDE FESTIVAL 
                <p>Our four guilds welcome in Spring in Norrath with a huge Festival 
                  for all! 
                <p>Date: Saturday, March 25, 2000 <br>
                  Time: 3:00 pm EST (12 noon PST) <br>
                  Place: East Commons Tunnel <br>
                  Server: Quellious <br>
                  Sponsored by: Legendary Heroes, Peace Conclave, Bootleggers, 
                  Dragon's Bane 
                <p>**Free food/drinks for all** <br>
                  **Free experience ressurections/SOWs/buffs/teleports/binds** 
                <p>Events will include - 
                <p>Find Malinine! <br>
                  Here are the rules... One unlucky character named Malinine is 
                  going to DIE in several places all over the West Commons Area. 
                  The members who wish to play this game must pay 5pp to join 
                  to a designated member of Bootleggers, and come to the East 
                  Commons Tunnel. Once everyone is in East Commons Tunnel, Malinine 
                  will zone in and give them all consent to loot his corpse. Everyone 
                  will zone into West Commons and begin to run madly around looking 
                  for the corpses which will be looted for prizes and money! (Kind 
                  of like an easter egg hunt.) All members must be in the East 
                  Commons Tunnel to play, latecomers will most likely not be let 
                  in. 
                <p>Freeport Trivia <br>
                  This event will be going on during the entire festival. It is 
                  open to all classes and races. At different times during the 
                  festival, questions about Freeportand it's surrounding areas, 
                  will be asked and the first person to answer will win a prize 
                  for answering that particular question. Questions will cover 
                  things such as names of shop owners, different locals in Freeport, 
                  etc. 15 to 20 triviaquestions will be asked during the festival, 
                  so there will be plenty of chances to win a prize. 
                <p>Male/Female Beauty Contests <br>
                  A series of judges will run 2 contests: female beauty contest 
                  and male beauty contest. Entrants will be judged on personality, 
                  beauty, dancing and poise. Judges will pose a question to each 
                  to help in their determination. Prizes will be given to winners, 
                  1st and 2nd runners up of men and women. 
                <p>Lottery <br>
                  The Lottery will simply use the /random command. There will 
                  be a designated ticketmaster. The ticketmaster will stand at 
                  the East Commons tunnel exit. 
                <p>There will be two stages to the lottery. The first will happen 
                  first, second will happen second. 
                <p>FIRST STAGE - 2pp per ticket <br>
                  SECOND STAGE - 5pp per ticket 
                <p>All lottery contestants must give the platinum to the ticketmaster. 
                  The ticketmaster then writes down their number. For example, 
                  if "Milla" was the 6th person to buy a ticket, she would be 
                  listed as No. 6. Then, the ticketmaster will use the /rand command 
                  for how ever many people there are entered. Whoever wins gets 
                  50% of the lottery earnings, second place gets 40% and third 
                  place gets 10%. 
                <p>Slave Auction <br>
                  Take home a high level slave at the end of the day! 
                <p>That's right, we'll be auctioning off higher level players 
                  of each guild to lower level players. You must be under level 
                  20 to bid for your higher level slave! Need a personal cleric, 
                  tour guide, information source, whatever they want to use them 
                  for within reason. They will probably not attack a Sand Giant 
                  for you. There will be a mulitude of players of various levels 
                  availible for "Auction." Could you use a 35th level druid for 
                  two hours? The winner of each player will buy the right to have 
                  him/her as their "Servant" for 2 hours, (real time). 
                <p>Wedding <br>
                  Renewal of vows between Oriz Stormweaver and Kirastar. All are 
                  welcome...much fun expected. Lots of sillyness, drinks, and 
                  entertainment for all. We ask that no gifts be brought...we 
                  only wish everyone to share this wonderful moment with us! 
                <P>Where: Aviak Villiage, South Karana <br>
                  Who: You, and all your friends <br>
                  Drinks: heck yeah! 
                <P>Teleports will be made available to N.Karana if needed. Dancing, 
                  drinking, story telling, and much sillyness to follow the ceremony! 
                <p>During the Entire Festival - <br>
                  All members of the 4 guilds will hand out free drinks/food Newbie 
                  Giveways - Members of the 4 guilds will circulate with a ton 
                  of stuff to give away! Mini Bazaar - Members of the 4 guilds 
                  will be circulating with items they wish to trade/sell at this 
                  time Buffs/binds/sow/ressurections - Members of the 4 guilds 
                  will circulate and provide these free of charge to whoever in

            <div> We just received a very interesting article from Alora Spellborne 
              about the efficiency of the caster classes, dmg wise. Here is a 
              snip from the article:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote>After all the debating and complaining about spells, 
                damage, and mana efficiency, I decided to take the time to look 
                into it more in depth. I put together several scenarios on figuring 
                out what spells a caster would use in order to maximize their 
                efficiency. All scenarios are in terms of the caster Vs. a single 
                target; so area effect spells are not used, but I have included 
                those in a different ranking. Resist factors were not taken into 
                account, for there are ways to always lower a MOBs resist rates. 
                If you are having resist problems, have your casters debuf the 
                MOBs. I didn&#8217;t have time to include Shamans in the evaluation, 
                but I can make a reasonable guess as to where they reside in the 
                rankings.</blockquote>

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>This weekend, I asked how the author 
                defined "damage", meaning that damage is not a standalone concept. 
                Damage could be defined as damage per spell or damage per point 
                of mana, in which case Shamans or Necros would seem to take the 
                cake. It could be defined as damage per "load" of mana, in which 
                case Necros would seem to edge out there as well. It could also 
                be defined as complete damage potential, in which case one of 
                the pet classes (necros/magicians) would seem to have an edge. 
                It could also be argued that Enchanters have the largest damage 
                potential due to charm, and their ability to make a pet that hits 
                in the 90s. I've actually seen an enchanter solo 5 spectres at 
                once using charm and mez. <br>
                <br>
                "Damage", from our point of view, is defined as damage over the 
                shortest period of time that the character can inflict that damage. 
                The statement that wizards have no rivals when it comes to inflicting 
                magical damage is true under this definition. So, as to the quoted 
                "Point #2" above, wizards do indeed do more magical damage than 
                the other classes. </font></blockquote>
              </font> <FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote>WHAT IS THE MOST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION OF VERANT'S 
                WIZARD DESCRIPTION?<br>
                <br>
                A. This means that Wizards can out-damage every other spell caster. 
                In exchange for this power, wizards will be one-dimensional, lacking 
                the variety of spells that the other classes have. Wizards will 
                have no pet, no real buffs, no group buffs, no group friendly 
                spells, no healing spells, no DoT spells, no Bolt spells, no shield 
                spells, no disease or poison spells, etc.<br>
                <br>
                or<br>
                <br>
                B. This means wizards have no rival at chain-casting the 'direct 
                damage' variety of spells. Thus it is possible that in a short 
                period of time, a wizard might possibly out-damage another spell 
                caster, but if you are talking about a 90 second fight, instead 
                of a 30 second fight, Wizards will do much less damage than many 
                other casters. And when you reach level 50, you will have to have 
                an enchanter and/or shaman with you in order to be effective.</blockquote>
              </font><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>First, addressing option "A". Though 
                I did say that wizards are rather straight forward, they are far 
                from "one-dimensional" and they aren't exactly "lacking the variety 
                of spells that the other classes have". In addition to direct-damage 
                spells of 3 out of the 5 types (which no other class has), they 
                also have roots, stuns, movement slowing (e.g. Bonds of Force), 
                and travel spells, as well as a reasonable series of self-buffs. 
                This is not a one-dimensional class. Now people can feel free 
                to insist that all of those other spells "suck" and therefore 
                refuse to count them in their estimation, but they are counted, 
                and do not suck, in ours. <br>
                <br>
                Option B, though essentially correct, is an entirely minimalist 
                point of view that could be adopted by any class in order to emphasize 
                their weakness. As for the suggestion that wizards have to count 
                on a shaman (or other resistance debuffer) to be fully effective, 
                we have no problem with agreeing with that. In the same fashion 
                that a melee character needs to count on heals and buffs to be 
                fully effective, it is reasonable (to us) for wizards to count 
                on a resistance debuffer in the same way. <br>
                <br>
                Now I'm fully aware that there are people out there who now dislike 
                their class or don't feel it is what they had envisioned, but 
                it is what we envisioned. I'll agree that there is not much I 
                could do to help these people come to like their class, short 
                of handing out enhancements just for the sake of enhancing them. 
                Wizards are essentially well-balanced, and we won't be making 
                any massive changes to them aside from the general refinements 
                we make to all classes as time goes on. Much in the same fashion 
                that rogues need to insist upon their value to the group and overcome 
                the stigma of months and months of posts complaining about how 
                ineffective they are, wizards now need to do the same. <br>
                <br>
                I know I get flamed every time I say this, but if you dislike 
                you class that much, I'll suggest you play another. That's why 
                we provide 14 of them for you to choose from, since not everyone 
                is suited to play every class. <br>
                <br>

                the sole indicator of how well you hit, but only a part of it.

                are trying to hit are also taken into account.<br>

                Raising the skill caps for the 1-50 game is not planned because 
                the game was balanced with the caps being as they are set now. 
                The end result would be that even if we did raise the caps, we'd 
                have to decrease the impact of level and other issues in order

                away at critters, doing as much damage as melee, yet without significant 
                risk, and where the only balancing factor is cash. Spell-casters 
                have mana to mitigate these issues, there's no similar meter by 
                which to control archery or throwing. Though many good suggestions

                as told by Arravis Dru`giir:<BR>
                <BR>
                Twenty two hundred years ago the Necromancers, Shadowknights and 
                Priests of Innoruuk created a spell which allowed their deity, 
                Innoruuk, to physically enter the world of mortals. This complex 
                spell was kept within The Tome of Hatred, a singularly evil and 
                vile book. The existence of this tome became known to an order 
                of holy monks who stole the book from the Tier`Dal with the objective 
                of destroying it. All but one of the monks was slain in the process 
                of retrieving it, however they were unable to destroy the book. 
                To protect the tome the monk split the pages among seven powerful 
                adventurers. These individuals are to safeguard the pages and 
                avoid contact with each other lest the tome be reconstructed. 
                Unfortunately, the pages themselves still seem to hold a sentient 
                power and can at times exert an influence over the guardian they 
                are bound to. Each page is able to sense the general location 
                of the other pages and their guardian.<BR>
                <BR>
                The guardians have protected the pages by passing them from generation 
                to generation, however, recently three of the guardians fell into 
                the hands of the Tier`Dal. The dark elves have been using the 
                captured guardians to find and recover the remaining pages. I 
                was the leader of these guardians, and to rescue them I gathered 
                a large group of adventurers to assist in the recovery of the 
                guardians and the pages of the tome (this was the previous event, 
                part 1). These adventurers succeeded all too well. The guardians 
                were rescued and the pages in the hands of good again. It was 
                then that I began the magical ritual that would destroy the book. 
                During the casting, I began to feel the power of Innoruuk in my 
                mind. The father of my kin, the Tier`dal, whom I had left long 
                ago spoke to me. A divine vision possessed me and it could not 
                be denied. My mere mortal mind broke under the strain... And I 
                saw the error of my ways. In secret, Lord Innoruuk had organized 
                an army of darkness that at that moment, attacked the gathered 
                adventurers. In the confusion, I fled to the depths of Neriak, 
                tome in hand. There, I have studied the Tome of Hatred under the 
                watchful eye of Innoruuk and his priests and priestesses.<BR>
                <BR>
                I am now ready to begin preparations to cast the spell that will 
                summon our father back to his home. Gather children of Hate, progeny 
                of Innoruuk and let us bring our wrath upon this petty world. 
                We shall sweep over the land, destroying all our enemies and making 
                it ours for the plunder. The necessary preparations must be made. 
                The spell requires blood and magic. Help me recover these so that 
                Lord Innoruuk may walk among us again. So prepare yourselves Kin, 
                gather your spells and take up arms, our future awaits!<BR>

                beginning of the ceremony. Luvilae Windchaser burst in to stop 
                all from drinking, but alas it was too late. Cynarra had drank

                of ultimate revenge on his ancient foe. The much awaited wedding

                  off with his typical bluntness mixed with his apparent growing 
                  boredom. 
                <p>After some small amount of time had passed without acknowledgment, 
                  I grew impatient and spoke more harshly, pointing out that it 
                  would be unwise to ignore tidings from the daughter of Hate. 
                  At this point he began to interrogate me on the subject of Lanys 
                  T'Vyl, letting slip that he is considering joining forces with 
                  Firiona Vie or Lanys T'Vyl, but has not yet come to a decision. 
                  Ultimately he suggested I discuss these matters with Lanys and 
                  provide him with something interesting. 
                <p>Returning once again to Nektulos, I relayed the information 
                  to Lanys. She seemed pleased with the information and felt that 
                  Al'Kabor would be manipulated to serving us. Telling me that 
                  she would call on me and my house again, she gave me the gift 
                  of a Gigantic Zweihander from her father and departed shortly 
                  thereafter.

              </font>Well that helps you little =) He did said something interesting 
              about the current server status of EverQuest:<br>
              <FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote>JSmedley says, "We are planning on adding 2-4 servers 
                in the near term. More if neccessary. EQ servers are not related 
                to servers for Star Wars"<br>
                JSmedley says, "Let me take a second to describe some infrastructure 
                issues"<br>
                JSmedley says, "Currently there are 28 servers. All are housed 
                in San Diego"<br>
                JSmedley says, "We use 2 major ISP's (UUnet and AT&T Cerfnet)"<br>
                JSmedley says, "During our peak hours we are using around 500 
                Meg of bandwidth"<br>
                JSmedley says, "that is bigger than a lot of ISP's"<br>
                JSmedley says, "we've had to build this all up from scratch, and 
                we don't try to hide the fact that we've been learning as we go 
                to some extent"<br>
                JSmedley says, "I think we have this down pretty well now and

              </blockquote>
              </font>I actually got the chance to ask some questions too, three 
              in total. Here is one of them:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote>What role do you think fan(news)sites play in the average 
                day life in EverQuest? Because in old PnP RPG, there was only 
                one way to acquire information. However nowadays you can simply 
                look it up in large online databases.<br>
                JSmedley says, "It's vital. We couldn't survive without the fan 
                sites. In fact, we use them to distribute a lot of information."<br>
              </blockquote>
              </font>Good to hear we (the newssites) are still appriciated by 
              the big folks at Verant =) Sorry that I do not have anymore for 
              you, however I too late realised this:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>

              <blockquote>The Bristlebane Ambassador's Council met again in game 
                on Saturday evening (March 18th). Our new GM Athelan never showed 
                up. Guide Vasque patiently spoke with the Ambassadors for roughly 
                two hours. He spoke at length about the interpretation of the 
                "Play Nice" rules. Many Ambassador's expressed serious concern 
                that this new policy would create even more trouble. We briefly 
                touched on the Light vs Darkness concept and how these guilds 
                are available for all guilds and players to use for roleplaying. 
                <p> Perhaps the greatest disappointment is Verant's apparently 
                  complete lack of interest in supporting or bringing roleplaying 
                  to the server. Once again it was repeated that Verant will not 
                  attempt to involve the player community in GM events. They will 
                  continue to be run as individual events with no continuity or 
                  storyline to be followed. Further Verant will NOT assist in 
                  any way with player community run storylines and events.

                <p> Well I would like to start off by thanking everyone who attended 
                  the meeting that was held on the 17th. We didnt get much done 
                  since I didnt know that that was St. Patricks day at the time 
                  and so most people were out partying. We decided that we should 
                  probably vote on a leader and officals of other departments 
                  of the Senate. We concluded that it would probably be best to 
                  do this offline using our mailing list. If you want your guild 
                  included in the Senate please email me. If you or a guild representative 
                  isnt on the mailing list it means your guild is not offical 
                  listed in the Senate so please contact me. My email address 
                  is <a href="mailto:Apocalip19@aol.com">Apocalip19@aol.com</a>. 
                  Next I would like to say that we will be holding another meeting 
                  this Friday the 24th. In the same place, behind the Jade Tiger 
                  in Northern freeport, at the same time 9pm EST. I dont like 
                  to have meetings this close together since I know they are time 
                  consuming but we werent able to accomplish much do to my folly 
                  last week so this meeting will be to make up for it. I hope 
                  to see you all there.

                  This, however, was no ordinary homecoming. He returned with 
                  the sword whispered in <br>
                  the legends of old. Many believed it did not exist. Many cursed 
                  it a hoax.<br>
                  But alas, Musk had returned to Norrath to prove them all wrong<br>

                Finally there is a fellowship for those advenurers in Norrath 
                who wish their brethren to play with honour! The Soul of Valour 
                is a growing group of honourable souls who wish smite the forces 
                of darkness while holding themselves to a higher standard of honour 
                than most, for as we all know, honour is the very soul of valour.<br>
                <br>
                /ooc The Soul of Valour is a roleplaying guild that seeks members 
                who, like us, do not approve of the outrageous twinking and dishonourable 
                conduct of many of the other players we find in EQ. All Races/Classes 
                are welcome, but traditionally "dark" characters must find some 
                reason to explain their honour. For details, visit <a href="http://www.halour.cjb.net">http://www.valour.cjb.net</a> 
                the website is not yet complete (remember, the time I spend building 
                a website is time I'm not playing EQ. You see my dillemma ;).<br>
                <br>
                Also, everyone is invited to our kickoff party on Saturday, March 
                18 at 5pm MST. It will be held in North Qeynos, and will feature 
                free beer to all, and a chance to meet and greet you fellow roleplayers.<br>

                  patch day (horay!). 
                <p> Anyway, thanks goes to Remelio for writing up a story to keep 
                  you readers out there busy until I return to the lands of writing. 
                  If there are any other readers out there holding on to a story, 
                  then please send it to me. I, for one, would love to have something

                <p> I've also added a couple of screenshots which were taken before 
                  I quit EQ (except for one). I don't know if I've written about

                <p> Three Leading Interactive Entertainment Companies to Combine 
                  Efforts to Develop, Distribute, and Host First Star Wars Online 
                  Multiplayer Title. 
                <p> LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC announced today it will 
                  partner with Verant Interactive Inc. and Sony Online Entertainment 
                  to create the first massively multiplayer Star Wars online role-playing 
                  game. Expected to release in 2001, the title will immerse thousands 
                  of game players into the classic Star Wars universe. Gameplay 
                  will feature a unique combination of combat, specialized missions, 
                  and daring quests. 
                <p> The Star Wars online game will be developed by Verant, distributed 
                  and sold at retail by LucasArts, and available for play exclusively 
                  online at The Station@sony.com (www.station.sony.com). 
                <p> The partnership brings together three of the foremost companies 
                  in the interactive entertainment industry. LucasArts, a leading 
                  international developer and publisher of interactive entertainment 
                  software, has developed critically acclaimed and commercially 
                  successful Star Wars titles across a variety of platforms since 
                  1991. Verant, creator of EverQuest, the most successful massively 
                  multiplayer online game to date, is recognized as the leading 
                  creator of persistent gaming universes. EverQuest currently 
                  boasts more than 200,000 customers, 120,000 of whom play daily.

                  including EverQuest. 
                <p> "The combined expertise of LucasArts, Verant, and Sony Online 
                  Entertainment will bring to gameplayers an incredibly dynamic 
                  online gaming experience worthy of Star Wars," says Simon Jeffery, 
                  president of LucasArts. "The immensity and richness of the Star 
                  Wars universe lends itself ideally to a game of this nature." 
                <p> "We couldn't possibly ask for a better universe in which to 
                  create a massively multiplayer game, " says John Smedley, president 
                  and CEO of Verant. "Star Wars offers such an incredible amount 
                  of depth and detail that we'll be able to create a place for 
                  fans to feel right at home. This game is going to be incredible!" 
                <p> "Star Wars online will be a phenomenon that transforms online 
                  gaming for both gamers and casual game players," says Lisa Simpson, 
                  president of Sony Online Entertainment. "It is a great addition 
                  to the blue chip brands our audience has come to enjoy at The 
                  Station. We are delighted to work with LucasArts and continue

                that the pet models have to be present in every zone. That means 
                that their models and textures have to be loaded in the *big* 
                global files. Models and textures for the "ghoul" for instance 
                are currently not in every zone. We should have something special

                No, we're not going to force you to camp. However if you insist

                These rules change nothing for people who already work well with 
                others. For instance, lets say you are camping something that 
                always has a list going. If someone new comes in, putting them 
                on the list is perfectly acceptable, much the same as you did 
                before. <br>
                <br>
                These rules don't let them come in and demand that they get the 
                next loot, they only say that you need to work something out,

              <blockquote>1. Was the zone in debuff part of the original game 
                plan or a change made to prevent ppl from accessing the platforms 
                out of order? 
                <p><font color="a00000">It was a measure to prevent people from 
                  zoning in with levitate, which then enabled them to get to islands 
                  out-of-order.</font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>If it was a preventative measure 
                  why was the level of the islands not altered to prevent ppl 
                  from moveing up out of order? (Besides a new download) 
                <p><font color="a00000">The new download is a big part of it. 
                  Changing world geometry leads to having to download the entire 
                  zone again. The other thing though is that our people who are 
                  capable of doing world geometry are tied up for a while. There 
                  are also more problems than just allowing people to get to islands 
                  out of order, it's letting them get down to an island that they've 
                  already been to. </font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>2. Since the new change people 
                  are no longer able to access the starting platform once the 
                  get higher up. (You used to be able to float down) You have 
                  to jump off and gate back up. Costing a player upwards of 250p 
                  per trip. Are the costs to get into sky going to be changed 
                  to reflect this new demand? 
                <p><font color="a00000">Not at this time. Perhaps if we see an 
                  excessive shortage of platinum, we might reevaluate our money 
                  sinks so that they are in line with the means of the players.</font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>3. What is the average amount of 
                  cash that a lvl 46+ player (ballpark it) has on his person? 
                  Most folks that i know usually have between 500p and 1k. 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I suppose 
                it depends on your class. I know a few enchanters with over 30K 
                in the bank. I know that as a solo high-40s necro, I can make 
                over 200pp per hour, and I have 3500pp in the bank. 
                <p>Considering that there are auctions out there for hundreds 
                  of thousands of platinum, I think there's probably still enough 
                  of it out there. 
                </font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>4. We spent around of 15000p - 
                  18000p so far this week getting to gorgolask platform in PoA 
                  for a 30 person trip. Thats 500-600p per person so far. Is this 
                  the target Verant is looking for? 
                <p><font color="a00000">Considering that the only mandatory cost 
                  in the Plane of Sky is the component to zone in, with everything 
                  else being optional for short-cuts, it sounds ok. Of course, 
                  the entire zone is supposed to be the pinnacle of difficulty.</font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>5. Do the above figures encourage 
                  farming of items to gather easy cash for these trips? 
                <p><font color="a00000">I think that people are probably depleting 
                  their reserves before resorting to farming. They can also start 
                  selling some of the items they find in the world for plat, rather 
                  than making them trade-only. There's a bit of this going on 
                  currently, and overall the economy is getting healthy.</font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>6. I get the feeling that PoA is 
                  a work in progress. Should we expect any other "high impact" 
                  (high impact to me was the "anti buff" patch) changes to the 
                  zone or is it getting close to verants "vision" for PoA? 
                <p><font color="a00000">I won't call any zone perfect, but we 
                  think we have it pretty well figured out. That's not to say 
                  that we won't have to make a change or two should no one ever 
                  be able to reach the top, or should some loophole be found that 
                  makes it entirely too easy, but it's looking good at present.</font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>7. One last comment/question... 
                  If I had been given a choice of loosing buffs or moving the 
                  islands I would have chosen the latter. I feel being able to 
                  levitate in PoA... with all the mobs that can cast blowback 
                  and gravity flux... is useful for keeping yourself in PoA and 
                  preventing damage to yourself. Is it possible to have the islands 
                  adjusted to prevent people from exploiting levitate? Another 
                  30min patch makes me no difference if the change is a good one 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">We don't have any plans at present to change 
                zone geometry. As mentioned above, we have all the people who 
                are capable of that tied up for a while.

              <blockquote>Was curious as to what Verant plans on doing with the 
                warriors in the expansion. MOst classes are getting 25+ new spells 
                while warriors are getting what? This of course includes rogues 
                and monks as well. It has been rumored that the skill cap is going 
                to be lifted - let me assure you that will NOT suddenly make fighters 
                incredible. There needs to be a large new influx of skills to 
                help balance out the warriors. NOTE - warriors not paladins or 
                rangers who will benefit from a host of new spells. Some skills 
                that might help: 
                <p>Triple strike - 51<br>
                  Repair - higher level bind skill - 52<br>
                  Stun - a chance any hit with a weapon will stun an opponent- 
                  54<br>
                  Incapacitate - a chance a blow will slow the target creature 
                  for a period of time - 56<br>
                  Elude - a chance a warrior will avoid a blow - level 59<br>
                  Critical Hit - a chance that a blow will be a critical hit above 
                  and beyond the random chance - level 60 
                <p>Just some ideas - a reply would be great. 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Though I can't yet comment on anything specifically, 
                please be assured that we are not leaving the non-casting classes 
                out in the dark. All of you will get some nice extra abilities

                weaknesses, a total lack of spell diversity, no pets, no real 
                buffs or debuffs, no group friendly spells, and no variety. 
                <p>HOWEVER, the trade-off was supposed to be doing more damage 
                  than any other class. More damage and more powerful are two 
                  totally different things. Why do necromancers and mages consistently 
                  out-damage wizards, yet necromancers and mages have buffs, debuffs, 
                  pets, healing, invulnerability, DoT, and on and on and on? 
                <p> Verant has given Wizards all the down-sides to being a one-dimensional 
                  damage dealer, but the fact is that we do not do more damage 
                  than mages or necromancers. How can you justify that? 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">No where did anyone say this, and I'm sorry 
                if that's what you got out of the FAQ. Take the FAQ to mean direct 
                damage, or take it to mean damage in a given amount of time, in 
                either case, wizards take the cake. You do more damage in X seconds 
                than anyone else can do. You're spells do more damage than anyone 
                elses direct damage spells. 
                <p>Did you expect that you'd be able to do more damage in a full 
                  load of mana? I'm sorry, that just isn't the case. Most of the 
                  other casting classes can do more damage than wizards can in 
                  a full load of mana, it just takes a LONG time to do it. 
                <p>I wouldn&#8217;t expect this to change dramatically. We are 
                  toying with the idea of giving you a new series of spells to 
                  help in certain conditions, but that&#8217;s basically it. Nothing

                how much they pester, cuss and whine, they will actually have 
                to start playing the game and maybe even become a worthwhile hunting

                <br>
                We need help on guides on how to play a druid and compare the 
                styles of playing from roleplay to pvp. Do you think Druids have 
                gone downhill since kiting has been changed? How do you deal with 
                the demanding crowds asking for SOW(s)? What do you think the 
                future of Druids will be like in Kunark? There have been rumors 
                of soloing druids able to kite dragons, even after the kiting 
                'nerf', is thatmith or possible?<br>

                on Vallon Zek. It involved a Dragon rampaging around the gates 
                of Ak'Anon and it wasn't until many gnomes had been killed did 
                help arrive from Elven lands. After much pointless fighting it 
                was realized that the Dragon was invincible, but soon a Hero arrived 
                ( a character played by a GM), although much to everyone's suprise 
                he was a Dark Elf in the service of Mayong of Mistmoore. He dealt 
                the Dragon an almost fatal blow and soon after mayong himself 
                appeared. Some small talk ensued between Mayong and the Dragon, 
                a shard and Lady Vox were mentioned before Mayong finished it 
                off. At this point the event proceeded to Dagnor's Cauldron where 
                Lord Galendore sent Snoweagle to find one Kivgor Illbriar, a Dwarf 
                rogue. Platr actually found him and was handsomely rewarded by 
                Mayong himself. Platr became an immortal Vampire in the service 
                of Mayong forever, and the event is to be continued as far as 
                I know. 
                <p>Platr recieved a Vial of mayong's blood which gave a permanent 
                  92 sv Magic, a new Mayong diety, and changed Platr's name from 
                  Forlife to Eternal Knight. He also recieved Mayong's belt which 
                  has the following stats : +10 DEX, +10 AGI, +10 STR, effect: 
                  haste (50%). Although I enjoyed myself, some complained that 
                  it was overcrowded and rather boring

                <font color=#a00000> Indeed. Though we are sensitive to some people's 
                religious concerns regarding playing a character that worships 
                a fictional deity, we still believe that context, story, and role-play 
                requires this in some cases. 
                <P>Paladins and Clerics are very good examples of classes that 
                  are holy in nature, and therefore require a deity to serve. 
                  We provide many agnostic choices for those who wish to abstain 
                  from role-playing that aspect of a character.

                I can't tell you how hard that made me laugh. Can someone.. anyone.. 
                please tell me what drops the Bloodmoon, better known as the ultimate 
                (and one of the very few) SK only weapon? Please, tell Abashi 
                not to have a cow over Paladins killing a frog when Shadow Knights 
                have to kill their own God to get weapons.. I'm still laughing.-(player)<BR>
                <BR>
                -Yeah, but they are Shadowknights. Suppose they worship Innoruuk. 
                What greater proof of devotion could a follower of the God of 
                Hate give to their own god than to kill them? <BR>
                Back to the Paladin/Frog thing, someone here brought up a pretty 
                good point today. Who's to say that Paladins of one deity have 
                to be nice to the Paladin of another deity just because they are 
                both "good"? The history of Man is filled with wars between people 
                in the name of their deity, and sometimes they even worshiped 
                the same deity. Now these are certainly dark periods in history, 
                but The Crusades did happen.-(Gordon) <BR>

                <br>
                The server population of Quellious has grown tremendously and 
                many poeple now have mature and veteran characters on Quellious. 
                Quellious is experiencing over-crowding not unlike other mature 
                servers, and some concerned citizens would like to invite those 
                on Quellious who wish to voice their opinions and preferences 
                for how to handle the courtesy in organizing raids of key High-Level 
                Raid zones and places. Specifically Plane of Hate, Plane of Fear, 
                Plane of Sky, Lord Nagafen, and Lady Vox.<br>
                <br>
                All are welcome from newbies to vets as insight may be garnered 
                from each of you. This first meeting I am scheduling for Monday 
                March 20 at 9PM EST and the Chat Room will be called "Quellious 
                Raids". If you wish to attend the meeting, then please send an 
                email to tuula@norrath.net and I will send you a reply with the 
                password to the chat room (as I don't want stragglers who are 
                not prepared for the meeting just popping in). In your email please 
                give me your characters name and level on Quellious. This initial 
                meeting will be an attempt to discuss and come to a majority consensus 
                as to how to handle courtesy and scheduling of high-level raids 
                in an attempt to draft up some kind of rules of courtesy for Quellious 
                and the results of the meeting will be posted on The Quellious 
                Raid Website (The Raid) <a href="http://unseen.dhs.org/raids/.">http://unseen.dhs.org/raids/.</a><br>
                <br>
                If you cannot make this meeting time but wish to express your 
                thoughts and views via me as proxy, then send me and email and 
                I will add your views on particular aspects of discussion where 
                appropriate.<br>
                <br>
                This notice is also to let those on Quellious know that The Quellious 
                Raid site (<a href="http://unseen.dhs.org/raids/">http://unseen.dhs.org/raids/</a>) 
                has been created with the intention of improving the communication 
                between the raid-ready guilds, individuals, and raid leaders on 
                Quellious and all are welcome to come and read the news, articles, 
                and post there. Depending on the how successful the Raid meetings 
                go we will be putting up and actual Calandar for raid scheduling 
                that all can book into in order to further help prevent raid schedule 
                conflicts and divide raid times as fairly as possible amongst 
                all on the server.<br>
                <br>
                So come out and show your voice! <br>

                A. Melee specialization - Offensive, Defensive, or Hybrid abilities 
                - It stands to reason that trying to avoid being hit should lower 
                your chance to deal a critical blow. 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Being blunt, since melee characters were 
                balanced without a specialization, the addition of any specialization 
                at this point would have to have a negligible effect on gameplay. 
                With maxed specialization, you'd basically have to hit roughly 
                the same as you do now with maxed skill. That means we'd have 
                to nerf any situation where your specialization was less than 
                max. 
                <p>In hindsight, perhaps we should have done something like this. 
                  That would of course necessitate having many more weapons of 
                  each type than currently exist, otherwise we'd just end up with 
                  everyone wielding the same weapon anyway, making specialization 
                  moot. 
                <p>Anyway, it's an awful lot of work to do for zero net change, 
                  so we'll have to pass.

                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">I'd agree with this if this was the case, 
                but everyone has a different idea what "logical" is. There have 
                been times (*many* times) that I think I've went through and addressed 
                all of the logical issues in a post, only to have someone with 
                an issue I felt was illogical respond that I've "missed the whole 
                point". 
                <p>As to the post you quoted, it's not unusual for people to come 
                  back and say "We didn't ask for X". No. Maybe THAT POSTER didn't 
                  ask for clarity, but many others did. Maybe THAT POSTER didn't 
                  ask for pets, but many others did. 
                <p>That list of 7 things represents the things requested most 
                  in those wizard threads. Take the post below where clarity is 
                  brought up again: 
                </font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>Since Mana is our ONLY group tool, 
                  something along the lines of a skill to up the regeneration

                <p><font color="a00000">So, ok, the author doesn't want clarity, 
                  he just wants a skill to up his mana regen rate. That already 
                  exists in meditation. </font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>NO ONE asked for a pet.

                many different station names, brought up pets, or some other form 
                of secondary damage for which pets were the only thing they offered 
                as an example. 
                <p>But back to the issue at hand. Everyone's point of view is 
                  different here. With exception of the people on the thread that 
                  responded that they play a wizard and their wizard is fine (and 
                  I thank them for their objectivity), everyone thinks that their 
                  wizard sucks. 
                <p>I'm sorry that I can't give you the response you want to hear, 
                  but in our opinion, you don't "suck". That's the only logic 
                  I have to bestow.

                45 take longer. No problem. 
                <p>The question I haven't seen answered yet, perhaps because it 
                  wasn't asked clearly, is this: 
                <p>why do the following levels (31 35 41 46) take double experience 
                  off compared to the normal (32 33 34 for example) levels? 
                <p>30 35 40 45, you lose a quarter bub.<br>
                  31 36 41 46 you lose a full bub.<br>
                  1 through 29, 32 33 34 37 38 39 42 43 44 47 48 49 you lose a 
                  half bub. 
                <p>I understand bubbles are relative, not linear, but for example, 
                  31 and 32 are in the same five-level range, so why twice the 
                  exp loss at 31 than 32? 
                <p>Note, I understnd this won't change, but I wanted to ask so 
                  the answer is more complete and I bet people are curious. 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">I answered this in the thread titled "Oh 
                my..." yesterday. But here's the text: 
                <p>------<br>
                  It looks like you lose more experience in Hell+1 because you 
                  have more experience total, and therefore lose a bigger percentage 
                  of the bar. For example, suppose level 30 takes 100M experience, 
                  and level 31 takes 30M experience to get through. When you die 
                  in 30, you'll lose a percentage of your total experience (NOT 
                  the experience required to level, but the TOTAL experience). 
                  For example, suppose you lose 5M experience. That will appear 
                  to be a quarter bar. 
                <p>Ok, now, suppose you are in level 31. You have more experience 
                  total, so when you die you lose 6M experience. 6M is 1/5 of 
                  the experience required for 31, so you lose a full bar. 
                <p>As I mentioned above, the amount of experience you lose (in 
                  points) is the SAME regardless what level they are. So, if experience 
                  loss were 10% (it's not, this is just an example), and a level 
                  36 Human has 100M experience, he loses 10M. A troll SK might 
                  only be level 32 at the time when he has 100M experience. He 
                  still loses 10M when he dies. <br>

                are going to find more issues than 20 internal testers or 1000 
                external ones. Massively multiplayer games have a good deal more 
                things that can be done in them than singleplayer games, and therefore 
                it is impossible to address how each thing that can be done interacts 
                with everything else that can be done within an internal test.

                <font color="a00000">This isn't reasonable. Games such as this 
                have to change. With those changes, both good and bad things can 
                happen. Many of the balance issues that arose post-production 
                were due to positive changes made to one facet of the game or 
                another. People by nature tend to forget positive changes, thus 
                making the negative ones stand out. 
                <p>There are certainly some issues that we are embarrassed about, 
                  due to the amount of time it took to acknowledge/find them (e.g. 
                  Alchemy), but the majority became a necessity after release. 
                  We still firmly believe that the changes we've made have made 
                  the game better, and the players happier in general.

                Date: Saturday, March 25, 2000<br>
                Time: 8:00pm EST (5:00pm PST)<br>
                Location: Shadowman Statue, Lesser Faydark<br>
                <p>On Saturday, March twenty-seventh of 1999, the first ever post 
                  release event on the Fennin Ro Server, of EverQuest, was held. 
                  Although it was not the most successful player run event ever 
                  held, it was truly a momentous event, celebrating not only the 
                  release of EverQuest, but also the coming together of it's community. 
                  One year later, on Saturday, March twenty-fifth, 2000, the second 
                  annual EverQuest Gathering will be held to help unite the community 
                  of Fennin Ro as well as prove why it was chosen, by the people, 
                  as the role playing server. The event will begin with a speech 
                  to honor the event and to introduce the new era of EverQuest. 
                  It will include predictions of what the future may bring for 
                  Fennin Ro, and illuminate the true potential of it's role playing 
                  community. This will be followed by various events including: 
                  numerous raffles, each organized by what class can use the reward, 
                  as well as a general raffle which will have a cash prize; a 
                  trade market in which people can buy and sell various items; 
                  free alcoholic beverages for everyone; duels which spectators 
                  may bet on, and the winner will also receive a reward; a dance 
                  party for everyone to show off their best moves; and finally, 
                  a scavenger hunt. Following the event, the procession will move 
                  to Mistmoore Castle, where we will battle our way through it's 
                  corridors and banish all of it's evil residents from the face 
                  of Norrath.<br>
                <p>Note to lower level players: Be careful to stay away from the 
                  altar of the statue, which is where the shadowmen spawn, although 
                  they will be kept cleared, it may still be a little dangerous.<br>

              We need help on guides on how to play a druid and compare the styles 
              of playing from roleplay to pvp. Do you think Druids have gone downhill 
              since kiting has been changed? How do you deal with the demanding 
              crowds asking for SOW(s)? What do you think the future of Druids 
              will be like in Kunark? There have been rumors of soloing druids 
              able to kite dragons, even after the kiting 'nerf', is that mith 
              or possible?<BR>
              <BR>
              You have a guide to write up? Submit it to EQSS on the <A HREF=mailto:eqadmin@stratics.com?subject=EQArticle>Submit 
              Article</a>. Or help out at the discussion at the Druids Forum under

                  email to EQ Customers directing them to change their password 
                  to one provided in the email, then instructing the customer 
                  to email their station name back to an address in the aol.com 
                  domain. Evidence suggests that the party sending this mail is 
                  taking email addresses from fan site Web Boards and the EverQuest 
                  Usenet newsgroups. 
                <p> Please be aware that this is a scam perpetuated by someone 
                  who is attempting to fraudulently gain access to your account. 
                  It was NOT sent by Verant Interactive nor The Station@sony.com. 
                  Official Representatives for EverQuest will never ask you for 
                  your password, and though we may instruct you to change your 
                  it, we will not instruct you to change it to something specified 
                  by us. 
                <p> Any official email correspondence in regards to EverQuest 
                  will come from either verant.com or station.sony.com. Please 
                  be aware that it is very easy to make an email appear official, 
                  and then have replies sent to an outside fraudulent address 
                  when you hit the "Reply" button. You should double-check the 
                  return address of any correspondence that appears official to 
                  insure that it goes to the verant.com or station.sony.com domains.

                <p>Dear EQ Customer: 
                <p> We regret to inform you that our security systems will be 
                  shut down for a period of 48 hours. Therefore no user will be 
                  able to log into their account with their current password. 
                  This will become effective starting March 10 and will last through 
                  March 12. If you wish to access your Everquest account during 
                  this period of time you will need to change your current password, 
                  to the a given password that our Development Team has provided 
                  for you. 
                <p> You may change this password back as of March 13. 
                <p> To change your current password, follow the easy steps below.<br>
                  1) Click (ACCOUNT) in main Everquest window.<br>
                  2) Click (CHANGE ACCOUNT) In the next window.<br>
                  3) Enter your current password under your station name.<br>
                  4) Enter old password in the top box, and enter and re-enter 
                  your given password. 
                <p> New Password: 57335084 
                <p> In order for this password to be active on March 10-12, we 
                  will require that you reply this message back to EQsupport07@aol.com 
                  with you station name. i.e. Station Name: Gnome518 
                <p> If you have any questions regarding these terms and conditions, 
                  please contact customer service at everquest@aol.com. 
                <p> <font color=#a00000> I would think Verant will add something 
                  to the patch message about this. Be weary of any suspect emails 
                  you might receive though.</font></blockquote?

                1. High level Shadowknight.<br>
                2. Enough free time to play a highly active role in the story.<br>
                3. Good at roleplaying and improvising for things for which lines 
                are not provided.<br>
                4. Must be willing to play out your new role at all times.<br>
                <br>
                If you fit the bill for this character, please send me an e-mail, 
                the sooner the better. If you don't meet some of these requirements, 
                but still think you'd be able to do the job also send me an e-mail.

                innocent, i.e. died/lost equipment to a bug. You guys dont accept 
                screenshots as proof. You sometimes relent with "known bugs" but 
                as you said youself Abashi... 
                <p> 
                <blockquote>"You might consider for a moment that EQ was not coded 
                  solely by one person over the course of a long lunch. It&#8217;s 
                  hard enough to be 100% certain about your own work before you 
                  take into account how it&#8217;s going to interact with everyone 
                  else&#8217;s."</blockquote>
                <p>You admit that there is a large possibility for error, thus 
                  there are bound to be a lot of "unknown" bugs. So how can I 
                  prove to a GM that I am not trying to cheat the system? 
                <p> 
                <font color=a"00000">There really aren't though. Items just don't 
                spontaneously disappear. Characters don't log in one day to find 
                themselves spontaneously naked. Characters aren't spontaneously 
                deleted. It just doesn't happen. 
                <p>People DO accidentally drop items<br>
                  People DO accidentally destroy items<br>
                  People DO accidentally combine items<br>
                  People DO accidentally hand items to NPC's<br>
                  People DO accidentally delete their characters<br>
                  People DO accidentally sell items to NPC's 
                <p>...and they frequently do this stuff without knowing they did 
                  it, and assume that it was "lost". 
                <p>In addition, people DO con other people, cheating them out 
                  of items, sometimes entire characters full of items. 
                <p>In over 40 days /played time on my character, I never had an 
                  item disappear. I did however on at least one occasion do all 
                  of the above (except delete my character or con someone). 
                <p>During this time, of the 2 other people I grouped with almost 
                  religiously, only one of them ever lost anything, and it wasn't 
                  exactly lost. She had a torch turn into a pair of cloth pants 
                  in her hand. 
                <p>There's really only one very specific case where an item can 
                  enter existence, and disappear in a manner other than listed 
                  above. Now, if you think there's another, please prove it to 
                  us so we can fix it, but please don't expect us to hand out 
                  items in perpetuity every time someone says "I lost an X".

              <blockquote> 
                <p>Verant defenders, here is a good reason for bashing Verant. 
                  The poster identifies a rare, but potentially extremely damaging 
                  problem. That problem has a simple fix, which he proposes. In 
                  my judgement, implementing such a fix in the most anal QA-crazy 
                  corporate environment I can think of would take a day, dev and 
                  QA time included. Gordon's response? Essentially: Nah, lump 
                  it. 
                <p>The ease or difficulty of implementation here is really moot.  
                  How often must we take steps to save people from their own bad 
                  choices?  The freedom to make bad choices is essentially part 
                  of an RPG, and we don't want to go Confirmation Box Crazy just 
                  to stop people from making them. 
                <font color="a00000"> 
                <p>We've gotten tons of suggestions for various confirmation boxes 
                  in game. If we implemented all of them just on the basis of 
                  them being easy to implement, you wouldn't be able to take a 
                  single action in EverQuest without having to click YES.  Among 
                  those suggested:  
                <li> Box for Attacking. </li>
                <li> Box for Dropping items. </li>
                <li> Box for handing items (above and beyond that whichexists). </li>
                <li> Box for Hailing NPCs. </li>
                <li> Box for Zoning.  </li>
                <li> Box for Combining Items in a Kit. </li>
                <li> Box for Forgetting Spells.  </li>
                <li> Box for Disembarking a Ship.  </li>
                <p> In addition, for each box that already exists in game, people 
                  have also suggested secondary "Are you <u>absolutely</u> sure?" 
                  boxes for most of the things listed above. 
                <p>Confirmation Boxes are a crude and ugly way to try and make 
                  a piece of software foolproof.  That said, there are situations 
                  where they are appropriate, such as for character deletion.  
                  Beyond that, we have to examine the possible benefit of the  
                  box. 
                <p>I'm sure everyone has heard the old joke where the guy goes 
                  into the Doctor and says, "Doc, my arm hurts when I do <i>this</i>" 
                  (Picture arm twisted around in an unnatural position).  The 
                  Doctor says, "Don't do that". Problem solved. 
                <p>If the risk that comes from binding yourself in a bad location 
                  is too high to be palatable... Well, don't do that.

                Being a SK of the 31st level I thought it was time to partake 
                in getting my quest armor. It is stated to be mid-level and im 
                past the halfway point. 
                <p>It is a gloomy day in the temple of Cazic-Thule and I am climbing 
                  the Acrhon Temple slaying lizards with no mercy. Before long 
                  a group of lizard show up with the intent to kill me. They are 
                  healing eachother and about have me bested. I decide I cant 
                  win this battle but no need to die, I fiegn death. The lizards 
                  go on thier way except for one Zealot who stands over me while 
                  im laying there attempting to heal. After healing close to a 
                  half bubble of life I get this feeling that I can no longer 
                  stay still, followed soon after by the same feeling. Then with 
                  no control I let out a loud sigh and I'm no longer pretending 
                  to be dead. All of the lizards who were fighting me previosly 
                  showed back up bringing the entire temple with them. I died 
                  at level 31 due to this misfortune. 
                <p>According to a patch message written by Gordon Wrinn, this 
                  type of FD wearing off was added to Necromancers and would not 
                  affect Monks or Shadow Knights. I have emailed Gordon with no 
                  response and many have been finding the same problems and discussing 
                  it on the <a href=http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Hybrids&number=15&DaysPrune=10&LastLogin=" target="_blank">EQ

                  to go there.

                Palluin a warrior of Kelethin, and something has been on my mind 
                lately. Yesterday when I was camping the throne room I'm Crushbone 
                I heard various messages like : DVinn train to zone and watch 
                out DVinn's loose. I even had the unfortunate experience of getting 
                caught in one of these fights. It was then that I really found 
                out how much I despise those disgusting creatures and I personally 
                have had enough of this. So, therefore I will be planning an attack 
                on Crushbone on Saturday March 11th on the Erollisi Marr server 
                at approximately 4:00PM EST time. Everyone is welcome. Although 
                I strongly suggest that the higher level characters be used for 
                train control, healing, buffing, etc. (for various experience 
                reasons). You can e-mail me for details at <a href="Nalvin86@hotmail.com">Nalvin86@hotmail.com</a>.

              be linked to the new Database.<BR>
              <BR>
              We need help on guides on how to play a druid and compare the styles 
              of playing from roleplay to pvp. Do you think Druids have gone downhill 
              since kiting has been changed? How do you deal with the demanding 
              crowds asking for SOW(s)? What do you think the future of Druids 
              will be like in Kunark? There have been rumors of soloing druids 
              able to kite dragons, even after the kiting 'nerf', is that mith 
              or possible?<BR>
              <BR>

                Where: Freeport City Hall (Brell Serilis)<br>
                When: Saturday, March 11, 2000, 5:00pm Pacific Time<br>
                Why: See Below 
                <p>What follows is a RPing account of what this meeting is, and 
                  who I am. For those of you not into RPing skip to the bottom 
                  where a summary of what this event is. For those who enjoy RPing, 
                  enjoy! 
                <p> Good morrow fellow inhabitant of Norrath! If you are reading 
                  this that means that my messangers have distributed the message 
                  fast enough. 
                <p> Some of you may remember who I am, but I am gambling that 
                  most of you do not. My name is Ialik Vendarian. I was the military 
                  advisor to the Republic of Freeport approximately sixteen years 
                  ago. At the time of my resignation, the ROF was running strong, 
                  holding multiple events, gaining much support. I left the ROF 
                  because my father was ill. My brothers and I went to visit him. 
                  When I arrived at my old home, I found the house burnt to the 
                  ground. My father, mother, and brothers had perished in the 
                  flames. The death of my family gave me many things to think 
                  about. I have spent the last sixteen years on a journey into 
                  my own soul. Upon my recent return to these lands I discovered 
                  that the Republic of Freeport was no more. Not long after my 
                  leaving the ROF, Krozy, the founding father of the ROF, also 
                  resigned. The ROF did not last long after that and quickly faded 
                  into a thing of the past. I have decided to continue on with 
                  the torch that Krozy once held. I announce to you, The Council 
                  of Norrathian Nations! (From here on called The Council.) The 
                  Council is just now being constructed and this is why I have 
                  written this for you to read. I have a meeting planned to work 
                  out the full structure of The Council and I hope that you will 
                  be able to attend. I have many ideas and plans which will be 
                  announced at the meeting. Everyone is invited to attend as what 
                  this meeting discusses will affect us all. Together we, the 
                  people of Norrath, can build a future to be proud of! 
                <p> Ialik Vendarian 
                <p> As explained above I was the military advisor to the Republic 
                  Of Freeport on the Xegony server approximately 1 year (sixteen 
                  Norrath years) ago. I have just recently returned to EverQuest 
                  and have decided not to return to Xegony for three reasons. 
                  1: The server is too crowded. 2: Brell Serilis is more RolePlaying 
                  oriented. 3: Because Serilis is a newer server, it has a wider 
                  variety of leveled players. This meeting is open to all players 
                  of all classes and races. The Council is targeted for "Good" 
                  characters of Norrath but this meeting also includes discussion 
                  of the formation of an "Evil" group too. The Council is not 
                  just a government like the ROF, but also the stepping stone 
                  for a large scale, server-wide Roleplaying story that I have 
                  worked out and hope to execute if enough people are interested. 
                  I hope to see, and meet a lot of people at the meeting. Thanks 
                  for your support and cooperation, 
                <p>Mikel Olson (Ialik Vendarian)<br>

              <blockquote>Just a suggestion, and I'd like to get a comment from 
                you on whether it's possible or not. 
                <p>Currently, it's only possible to have 20 people on your friends 
                  list, and it is only possible to have one friends list per account. 
                  This means, we have to share between servers and individual 
                  characters. Most people have their list filled, and still have 
                  to type manual /who requests for the remainder of their friends. 
                <p>Why is it set up this way? Wouldn't it be much more practical 
                  to store a friends file, much like the character preferences 
                  OPT file, which would be a plain ASCII file with a list of names 
                  separated by new line characters, and have the friends list 
                  go by this? That way, each unique character name could have 
                  it's own friends list, and there wouldn't have to be a limit 
                  on the amount of friends you could have. 
                <p>I'm sure this wouldn't be a huge coding job, and I know it 
                  would be one of the little things you could do to make players 
                  happier. Anyone else feel the same way? 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Expanding the friends list is on the programming 
                list. I don't have an ETA on it, but it is being worked on.

                to the expansion. The only reason I made comments regarding Togor's 
                and Strength was because it affected existing spells in-game.

              <blockquote>Didn't Abashi say that Togor's was reduced? Maybe part 
                of the problem is that he doesn't know everything, doesn't get 
                told everything, so we get the wrong information sometimes. How

                  have tuning meetings, where we do get everyone together. At 
                  today's tuning meeting, we found out that the change made to 
                  the spdat.eff didn't have any effect on the spell since it was 
                  being controlled in code. The control for this spell will be 
                  turned over to the spell database shortly, since code-controlled 
                  caps have to be adjusted to make room for levels above 50. </font> 
                <p><font color="a00000"></font>How many times is it going to happen,

                then for it to be checked in code to find out that what they remembered 
                wasn't entirely accurate. It's just a drawback of having a project 
                that is this large; no one can remember everything off the top 
                of their head. So how many times is it going to happen? Once in 
                a while for certain. 
                <p>Now I've always admitted it when released information wasn't

                  only telling you what you want to hear, and spending more time 
                  trying to figure out how to sugar-coat issues than just addressing 
                  them, I can do that. Just hold a poll and I'll adhere to the

                  of the spell didn't change" does this mean that Togor's is still 
                  as effective as it was before at 50th level? OR Is the maximum 
                  effect still the same, just reached at higher levels (i.e. 60)? 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">The former. The spells effectiveness hasn't 
                changed at 50th level. 
                <p>This type of thing is going to be happening with a number of 
                  spells as time goes on. Many spells have a base effect, plus 
                  an additional effect per level. Since max level in the game 
                  is currently 50, the level caps the effect of the spell. However, 
                  when the max level is raised, the spell would be allowed to 
                  continue improving automatically up until the next max level. 
                  The resulting value from the linear improvement is often too 
                  high for the mana and casting time. As such, caps have to be 
                  noted specifically within the spell database.

              <blockquote>There has been a lot of talk about all of the changes 
                coming for Kunarak in terms of game content, but I have heard 
                nothing about improvements to the EQ Client Software. We have 
                been told many times that, of course, different people work on 
                these parts. Client side improvements have received no coverage 
                in the building Kunark hype though and I am starting to wonder 
                if there will be any. Even in the case of the enhanced 3D promised 
                for Kunark, there has been a claim that the functionality being 
                used was present in EQ at release, but it was not used because 
                the current zones were designed much earlier before the 3D engine 
                was complete. 
                <p>A long time back there was an explanation that the "640x480" 
                  main view we all know and loathe is a remnant of the fact that 
                  computers improved a lot from the time EQ was begun until today. 
                <p>Plain and simple, the time is long since past to have a 1024 
                  x 768 version of the main view. 
                <p>Can we expect this or any other great client side improvements 
                  (better 3D sound would also be nice) for Kunark? 
                <p> 
                <font color="a00000">Back when EQ was in its primary development 
                cycle, the thought of resolutions higher than 640x480 wasn't expected 
                any time in the near future. Video technology did progress to 
                that point later in EQ's development cycle, but at that point 
                we were too far in to do a major UI redesign. 
                <p>In order for the default UI to support those higher resolutions 
                  in the manner requested, it would have to be redesigned for 
                  each specific resolution. This would result it a very large 
                  download, containing copies of the UI art for each resolution. 
                <p>The redesign of the default UI would also require a good deal 
                  of manpower, manpower that we feel is better applied to other 
                  aspects of the game. As such, we have no short-term plans to 
                  redesign the default UI so that it fills the higher resolution 
                  screens.

                the Verant representatives without whom the event would not have 
                been such a success. 
                <P>We were treated to the most extensive public look at EverQuest: 
                  The Ruins of Kunark that has been given to date, and let me 
                  be the first to say that it looks like it's going to blow our 
                  socks off! We were also fortunate enough to be able to give 
                  away several copies of the product that will be shipped to the 
                  winners when it is released. 
                <P>We are currently in the planning stages for EQG3, and we would 
                  appreciateany input you can give us as to how to make the event

              forums: 
              <blockquote><FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2>Some 
                time ago, on the wishlist forum, there was a thread where lots 
                of RP gamers stated their desire for a RP server. I know the Wishlist 
                forum is not the most popular one, and there is lots of garbage, 
                so here it is again: We, the players who get odd looks every time 
                we do a "Ho there wanderer", want a RP server. How do you (Verant) 
                reply? Yes or no will be fine. And how does everyone else feel? 
                Far as i can tell, there is not a single drop of RP in this RPG. 
                <P>Ibian, Enchanter of Tallon Zek

                <P> 
                <font size=2 color=#a00000 face="Times New Roman">We consider 
                all servers to be RP servers since this is a role-playing game. 
                Role-playing is a personal decision that each player makes for 
                themselves. The joy for role-playing should be role-playing itself, 
                not any tangible benefit handed out by the game. That's why when 
                people say "There's nothing to encourage role-playing", I get 
                very confused, as there is everything to encourage it, except 
                perhaps ones own propensity to become self-conscious. 
                <P>Now, if you are asking about an "Enforced Role-play" server, 
                  we'd consider it as soon as someone comes up with a definition 
                  for role-play that would allow us to enforce it. We catch a 
                  lot of flack for our naming policy, which is much clearer than 
                  any enforced role-playing server could be in my humble opinion. 
                <P>Now if we are talking about an un-enforced role-play server, 
                  I'd have to say that that would do no better than the servers 
                  we have now, which are all basically un-enforced roleplay servers. 
                  Perhaps in name alone, it would support further role-playing, 
                  but I'm sure that many people of all play-styles would join 
                  it, if for no other reason than it had less players for the 
                  first few hours.

                Just wanted to get the word out that me and a team of friends 
                have started a great new site called TheSky.Org (<a href="http://www.thesky.org">http://www.thesky.org</a>). 
                Our goal: To provide the EverQuest community with an online 'news 
                ticker', updated daily with general news, server specific news, 
                and forum posts by the EQ team. (Our forum logs section will eventually 
                evolve into a megaplex of every post made by any EQ staff member 
                in the past and present!) All info is collected from the many 
                EQ related sites across the internet and presented in clean, "plain 
                jane" form for easy surf-free reading. <br>
                <br>
                Our hope is that TheSky.Org will not be competition for various 
                sites (like EQ Stratics), but a gateway of EQ information to all 
                the great sites that are out there.<br>

              <blockquote>Yesterday we completed the split of the Fennin Ro server, 
                moving a portion of the users from Fennin over to Druzzil Ro, 
                the new server. In order to avoid moving too many people, we limited 
                the number in order to see the splits effect on prime-time usage. 
                <p>Tonight we will re-open registration on Fennin Ro to allow 
                  more people to move over to Druzzil. In addition, we will also 
                  be opening registration on Solusek Ro and Xegony, taking some 
                  of the players from both of those servers as well. The move 
                  itself will take place on Friday morning. 
                <p>Very soon, we'll be posting a patch message with all of the 
                  relevant data for customers on those three servers, but I wanted 
                  to get the word out to them as soon as possible. 
              </blockquote>
              </font>Sounds like good news for those people who did not make it 
              in their first attempt. Good to see the other servers are being 
              split too!<br>
              In another posting in that thread he replied to some questions on 
              the split:<FONT color=#050056 face="Times New Roman" size=2> 
              <blockquote>(player)<br>
                One question that comes to mind about bringing in players from 
                Solusek Ro and Xegony to Druzzil Ro is that of duplicate character 
                names. There will very likely be a few duplicate names found from 
                server to server, and this may create problems when migrating 
                accounts from servers other than Fennin Ro. 
                <p>(Abashi)<br>
                  Yes, we are aware of the issue of possible duplicates, and that 
                  will be addressed in the patch message that will go up soon. 
                  Basically, it's announced that people who choose to move might 
                  need a name change on their character to resolve a duplicate 
                  issue, and if this occurs, an "X" will be appended to their 
                  name. In the event they have an "X" appended to their name, 
                  they may contact a GM in-game and get the name changed to something 
                  they pick. 
                <p>(player)<br>
                  Also, the original Fennin split was capped at 1200 accounts. 
                  Will tonights registration use different, lower caps? (ie, 300 
                  accounts from each?). 
                <p>(Abashi)<br>
                  The number of people we are moving is much smaller than it was 
                  yesterday. Ideally, yesterday 100% of the people we moved would 
                  have been represented in peak usage. As a side effect though, 
                  people who played off-peak logged on and executed the command. 
                  In addition, there are also people with multiple accounts that 
                  executed the command for each account. As a result, the amount 
                  of "peak usage" that was moved was less than we would have liked. 
                  Comparing the number moved to the amount of peak usage moved 
                  allowed us to estimate the outcome future moves and help us 
                  move the right number. 
                <p>(player)<br>
                  Keep adding new non-split servers (300 copies of the game sold 
                  each day -> new servers every other week just to keep up). 
                <p>(Abashi)<br>
                  It doesn't quite work like that. First, of the new users we 
                  attract, roughly 30% play at peak. There's also the fact that 
                  people also leave the game. 
                <p>(player)<br>
                  FINISH the Fennin split first.Once that split is DONE, then 
                  see if there's more room for overflow off other servers. 
                <p>(Abashi)<br>
                  The problem with this is that each split means that the server 
                  must be down for an extended period. This goes for the source 
                  as well as the destination server. We want to limit the number 
                  of people negatively affected by the split, hence we are doing 
                  a few at once.

              <blockquote><font color=#a00000>We are absolutly opposed to capping 
                server population, as we feel that it does more harm than good. 
                New people join the game and want to play with their friends, 
                and they can't do that if we've capped the server. <br>
                <br>
                Secondly, as people leave a new server, people have to be allowed 
                to move in and take their place. A healthy server economy needs 
                newbies, mid-levels, and 50s. Yes, I'm basically saying that the 
                economy isn't healthy on a brand new server until we see the proverbial 
                bell curve. Luckily the "Racers" move in and help a new server 
                obtain that balance within a couple of months.</font></blockquote>

                its the number of people activly playing on the server that does. 
                Since people can't play more than one character at a time, I don't

                Yesterday we completed the split of the Fennin Ro server, moving 
                a portion of the users from Fennin over to Druzzil Ro, the new 
                server. In order to avoid moving too many people, we limited the 
                number in order to see the splits effect on prime-time usage.<BR>
                <BR>
                Tonight we will re-open registration on Fennin Ro to allow more 
                people to move over to Druzzil. In addition, we will also be opening 
                registration on Solusek Ro and Xegony, taking some of the players 
                from both of those servers as well. The move itself will take 
                place on Friday morning.<BR>
                <BR>
                Very soon, we'll be posting a patch message with all of the relevant 
                data for customers on those three servers, but I wanted to get 
                the word out to them as soon as possible.<BR>

                This installment Features over thirty responses, dozens of Grammatical 
                corrections, and several sordid questions probably better left 
                undiscussed. And, following in the tradtion of other high-budget 
                trailers, here is a clip that leaves you dying to know what the 
                hell is going on and why it is happening in the first place! <BR>

                <blockquote><font size="-1">Sorry, but the technique is a secret, 
                  passed down through many generations of my African ancestors 
                  from the great tribal chieftan himself, Momama Mojamba. Were 
                  I to reveal the secret, mighty Momama's wrathful spirit would 
                  descend upon me like a Japanese elevator on Venus. No, seriously, 
                  I just use the standard Max 1.2 UVW map modifier (I have to 
                  use 1.2 because our in-house plug-ins were written for that 
                  version of the software), the shape of which depends on the 
                  shape of the object that I'm mapping.</font></blockquote>
