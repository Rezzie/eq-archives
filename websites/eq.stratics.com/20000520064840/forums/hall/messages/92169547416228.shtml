Here is an article that I wrote for another web Site about how to optimize your Connection. This mainly pertains to those who still use analog modems. If you have any questions, then please feel free to email me at the above email address.<p>Optimizing your Connection with an Analog Modem<p>First, lets start with the basics!<p>Information is sent to and from your computer, over the internet via "packets". A packet is a package of information. When you log into a game server, via your internet connection, you are constantly transferring packets of information from the game server to your computer. Ping is the amount of time that it takes a packet from your pc to reach the game server and then back to your pc, and it is measured in milliseconds.<p>In order to play on a game server, there needs to be a constant packet or data flow between your computer and the server. When there is an interruption to that packet flow, then you get lag, that evil creature that causes many a player severe stress syndrome.<p>The reasons for packet disruptions number in the hundreds, however, I will cover a few of the more major ones.<p>THE CONNECTION MYTH<br>When dialing up to the internet via an analog phone and modem, the fastest connect speed is not always the best. Keep in mind that transfer speeds over analog phone lines are automatically limited to 51kbps, so a true 56k connection is virtually impossible. Also keep in mind what a signal actually has to go through to get from your computer to the server and then back again. First the packet is compressed, then it is transfered from a digital to an analog signal, it competes with random line noise along the way and then is reconverted back over to a digital signal again.<p>THE NEW .V90 STANDARD<br>The whole purpose for this .v90 standard was to squeeze that last bit of bandwidth possible out of your analog connection and the only real improvement to your internet connection comes in the form of more efficient data compression. This is an improvement for web browsing and checking email, but for gaming, this can actually be a nightmare.<p>Having several friends who own Internet companies and provide internet service, they all agree that for gaming, .v90 connections should be disabled. The purpose for this standard again, is to squeeze as much bandwith out of your analog connection, so one of the main pitfalls for online gaming is that your modem will constantly try to retrain or at times even renegotiate your connection to your internet provider. If it senses a drop in bandwidth or in a little line noise, it will automatically try to retrain.<p>Remember that the speed reported by dial up networking, when you connect to the internet is not necessarily your rate of transfer speed. This is only the agreed upon maximum speed that your computer and internet provider agreed upon. Your goal should be to find the speed at which you can achieve the most reliable and consistant connection.<p>My suggestion to you is to consult your modem manual or hardware website and find out the string commands that will force a .V34 connection, which is more reliable over analog connections anyway. If your connect speed ends in an odd number such as 53333, then you are connecting via the .v90 protocal. If you are connecting at an even speed such as 52000, then you are connecting at either flex or x2, depending on the modem. For a stable gaming connection, this is better than a .v90 connection, but probablly will not be as stable as a .V34 connection. If you are connecting a speeds 33600 and below, then you are connecting via the .v34 standard.<p>MULTILINK/SHOTGUN<p>I have tried to use two analog modems linked together via "shotgun" technology from Diamond. I was using a Supra Express 56k .v90 modem. For web browsing, etc...it does work and gives you a faster download speed. However, for gaming, it didn't seem to improve my connect speed at all. I have also spoken with several friends who have also tried to use two analog modems via shotgun and they reported no significant decrease in ping or lag.<p>ISDN uses a similar setup and as of the time of this writing, I am currently testing to see if there is any big advantage to using a dual line 128 kbps connection, versus a 64kbps, single line connection. I suspect that the real advantage to ISDN is the absence of line noise, not necessarily the bandwith and the fact that there is no analog to digital converting. More on this, once our testing is done.<p>Time to Optimize!<br>I. Update all hardware and software with any current patches or firmware<p>Make sure you have all of the latest patches for windows 95 (98). Including the TCP/IP Stack upgrades. Also, make sure you have all of the current drivers for Direct X, as well as any 2d/3d video cards that you may have. Last but not least, any latest drivers for your modem. Do not assume that just because you bought a brand new modem that it shipped with the most current drivers. In fact, in most cases, there is already a new driver version availible via your manufacurer's websight, before the product hits the shelves.<p>II. Check phone connections<p>Trace the line from your modem to the wall. Is the phone cable making a solid connection or is it loose? Is the wall jack shielded properly? Follow the line from your wall jack to the router box on the back of your dwelling. Has it been spliced from another line or is it a straight shot to the router box. <p>Also, is the router box properly shielded? I checked mine recently and it wasn't shut completely from when the phone guy had just been out. Rain was getting into the box and causing line noise.<p>III. Contact your phone company and have them check for line quality.<p>Tell them that you are having a problem with line noise and you need a service person to come out and check your lines. Be persistent with this!! They don't like to do it, but if you are paying that stupid line service fee each month, like I do, then it is included in the contract!! <p>When you make the initial call, it is very possible that the operator will run a very simple diagnostic program to check the noise in our line. Keep in mind that this is a very basic diagostic tool that tests for static and generally does not even record many of the various types of line noise that you can encounter.<p>The best solution is to have a technician dispatched to your house and have him check the junction box and physically test the quality of your lines.<p>IV. Use a shorter phone cable.<p>Have you ever noticed that the phone people can install phone jacks in the most inconvienient places? Ok, maybe that is a rant for another website. That was the case in my house, so I ended up buying a super long phone cable which ran from my computer to the wall jack. This wasn't such a great idea.<p>First, longer cabling increases the possibility of splits in the wire, line noise, and signal loss. The best solution here is to move your computer as close to the wall jack as possible and use a smaller phone cord . You will experience signal loss, the longer the cord is and the possibility for line noise increases.<p>V. Try a trouceroute to the gameserver<p>Bring up a dos prompt, while you are connected to the internet and type:<br>tracert (Ip Address of server). <p>This function will trace the route a packet goes from your computer, to the host server. Many times there may be a bad router on the way to the game server, that is giving you the problem. You will know if you see an incredibly high ping.<p>There is a really kewl little proggie called UOTrace and was actually designed for Ultima Online Subcribers. However, they have made the proggie freeware. UOTrace has several handy little features, such as analyizing your connection to a particular server, continuosly pinging, and will allow you to look up information on a particular IP address, such as in the case of a bad hop. Generally, there is an email address as well, so that you can notify the owners of the router that you are passing through. You can download a copy of UOTrace on our downloads page.<p>The internet is made up of hundreds of thousands of routers that get you where you need to go. Many times, the server that you are trying to game on, could be as much as 30 or more hops from where you are. Always try to find the server closest to your physical location, as this will decrease the number of hops.<p>VI. Try optimizing your system for STAC compression instead of hardware.<p>I picked up this technique from ELRIC over at Hexen2.com <p>Rather than your modem compressing the data that you are sending, with STAC you CPU is compressing the actual packets that you are sending. You help get rid of some of the bottle neck at the modem because the "processor" on the modem is not having to compress/decompress any more, just transfer. STAC compression basically increases throughput and decreases latency.<p>Step 1: <p>Turn of Hardware Compression (this will have to be done with Init String additions, which is modem specific). To do this lookup what the AT string is to turn of compression on your modem, should be in your manual somewhere. <p>Step 2:<p>Then go to Modem/Properties/Connection Tab/Advanced/Extra Settings and put the AT string in there. This will add the entered string to the end of your existing string. <p>Step3:<p>Now go to your dialup networking profile and edit the properties / server types. Turn on Software Compression, turn off Log on to Network, Netbeui, IPX/SPX. Click on TCP/IP Settings and turn off Van Jacobson Header Compression. <p>Step4:<p>You are now configured for STAC compression, which is faster that Hardware Compression.<br>
