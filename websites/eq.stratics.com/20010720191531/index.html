        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=DeveloperAPOs+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_new">the Developers Corner forum</a>, the next installment to "Ask Brad". Including questions about Luclin, the future of MMORPG's, whether we will ever see EverQuest on Unix and Brad's underwear!<blockquote><b>Hi Brad,<br><br>I was a beta player and am still a big fan of the game (EQ) after all this time. One of the things you did when you created the game was to say that all the servers would be maintained by Sony/Verant rather than like what ID had been doing with QUAKE, where anyone could set up a Quake server. There would be no private "World Servers" in EQ.<br><br>I guess my question is: Is this the model you are following for all future games currently planned? Will you be setting up a Neverwinter Nights style game eventually where players generate the content for one another?<br><br>Guess we players are all just frustrated Game designers at heart.<br><br>-Archanalia</b><br><br>Personally I think there&#8217;s a big future for both traditional MMOGs as well as &#8216;Neverwinter Nights&#8217; style games. They&#8217;re both very different, afterall. <br><br>We&#8217;ve no plans on making EverQuest such that the public could maintain servers for two reasons:<br><br>1. It&#8217;s not the economic model we&#8217;ve designed both the game and its support structure for.<br><br>2. One EQ world takes something like 20+ high-end dual processor machines with tons of memory to run, not to mention gobs of bandwidth. So we simply don&#8217;t think it would be very practical for people outside of our business to run.<br><br>That said, while EQ, Star Wars: Galaxies, Planetside, and Sovereign are all being designed as premium subscription based MMOGs, I wouldn&#8217;t rule out an SOE/Verant &#8216;Neverwinter Nights&#8217; style game one day. I can&#8217;t wait to play the game myself, as well as to discover the potential of user-generated content.<hr><b>Brad,<br><br>Ok, so Verant likes grouping... But, they apparently don't like multi-group raids... Why isn't there a 'raid channel (or channels)' for each zone?<br><br>A lot of people aren't in guilds, and a lot of guilds get allies to raid - why not fix this 'design flaw' so you can accommodate us?<br><br>(granted, 'design flaw' is not the most appropriate word, but it fits my feelings on this...)<br><br>Thanks <br><br>Jason Wallace</b><br><br>You&#8217;re right: we need to better accommodate multi-group raids. We definitely have lots of content in the game designed for raids, and we love the fact that the game can handle massive battles. But it wasn&#8217;t always that way, which can help explain why we don&#8217;t currently have any features to support groups with more than six members.<br><br>Way back when we were designing the game we were very worried about how many players we&#8217;d be able to display on the screen at once. This was back when we were developing a software render and using Pentium 133s to develop the client. In the text MUDs we&#8217;d played, groups could be huge (sometimes there&#8217;d be between twenty and thirty people all attacking a dragon). But we were worried about framerate, and what might happen if a bunch of players appeared on the screen at once. <br><br>Single player games didn&#8217;t really have such concerns because their developers could always control how many players and NPCs could appear on the screen at once &#8211; they could budget for a maximum. But we couldn&#8217;t stop an army of players from assembling (nor did we really want to).<br><br>So we designed the game for a maximum group size of six, made some character optimizations (for example, dynamic level of detail on character models), and hoped for the best.<br><br>Turns out, over time, technology has advanced such that we can display many more players than ever we&#8217;d hoped. Not only that, bandwidth optimizations have been made as well. So we&#8217;ve been putting in raid content for some time, but I agree with you &#8211; it&#8217;s time to put in additional support and features for larger group communications, experience splitting, etc.<br><br>I don&#8217;t have a time frame for you, but I hope it will happen by Luclin or soon after.<hr><b>Brad,<br><br>Are there any plans to have books written that take place in the world of Norrath, perhaps telling the exploits of Firona Vie, Lanys T'vyl or other noteworth folk? Maybe giving more detail about things that have happened, like Bloody Kithicor? I think it would be great, and a nice way to carry a little EverQuest with us when we can't be near our PC.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Kendall</b><br><br>We&#8217;d love to have novels written about Norrath and its inhabitants. I can&#8217;t say much more right now, but we ARE currently talking to publishers and writers.<hr><b>What are your thoughts on having one character per account on a server? I personally think it shot down two birds with one stone. It made twinking much harder and also made people think twice about soiling their reputations. Will this be considered in future EQ servers and future games, and is it Boxers or Briefs for you?</b><br><br>Surefoot Twelvetoes<br>Sterling Order of Knights<br>Fennin Ro<br><br>I definitely think fewer characters per server is a good thing. To understand why there are eight character slots per server, we&#8217;ll have to take another walk down memory lane: <br><br>Back when we were designing the game, we had NO clue if it would turn out to be popular or not. We certainly had no idea we&#8217;d end up with 30+ servers. In fact, we were thinking we&#8217;d have five or six at most. And because we wanted to have a game with 12 races and 14 classes, we also wanted to make sure players had the opportunity to explore and enjoy most of those race/class combos, should they so choose. <br><br>Obviously, with 20/20 hindsight and 30+ servers, eight character slots per world isn&#8217;t necessary. And that is why you see the feature restricted on Sullon Zek and the future RP server. We will also consider fewer character slots with our future games.<br><br>ps. Briefs<hr><b>Hi Brad,<br><br>I was recently reading through your posts and stumbled on your comments regarding DirectX and OpenGL.<br><br>I beg to differ on one point. There is an advantage to using OpenGL, and that is EQ could more easily be ported to Linux or MacOS. I for one, would love to see a MacOS port. I have many friends who are unable to play EQ, because they are Mac diehards and refuse to pay Mr. Gates.<br><br>While I realize it is probably too late for EQ, are there plans to port future Verant MMORPG titles (SWG -- *hint* *hint*) to other platforms?<br><br>- Samoy Spiritstorm<br>51 Enchanter, Povar</b><br><br>That&#8217;s a very valid point &#8211; it&#8217;s definitely easier to port to other platforms using OpenGL. Unfortunately, however, EverQuest is very Win32-centric, and not only because we chose to use Direct X, so I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be seeing it ported any time soon.<br><br>Our second generation engines, however, are being designed from the ground up to be much more portable.</blockquote>The full article can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000242.html" target="_new">here</a>.

Joffe has been an Everquest player since before he joined the company. <br><br>Joffe says, "The thing that struck me first was the first-person aspect of it.

But perhaps the real secret to EverQuest's success stems from the game's creators.<br><br>"A lot of the guys who built the game are hard-core gamers that have been into the whole Dungeons & Dragons-type game for a very long time," Joffe notes. "They were given an opportunity to create something [the way] they thought was the best... And they did."<br><br>Scott McDaniel, executive director of Sony Online Entertainment, adds: "The real foundation of the game was a competitive analysis. The producers and creators of the game are avid game-players. And they were dissatisfied with what was available in the fantasy role-playing market.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Absor posted an update from Hobart on the Sullon Zek changes reported yesterday over at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=DeveloperAPOs+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_new">the Developers Corner forum</a> : <blockquote>I think there has been a little confusion about what I meant when I said "looting rights".<br><br>Here is a recap of the paragraph that is causing confusion:<br><br><i>"We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience. Along with the experience loss, the killing person will be given looting rights also."</i><br><br>Here is some clarification:<br><br>Many people have expressed the concern of twinking kills to lower level players. They would do this by taking a higher level character and beating down an opponent. Then letting a much lower level character get the final blow. Thus, the looting rights. While this can certainly happen, it is still the case where only coin can be looted. And, in this special case of experience loss being caused outside the + or - 5 level limit, a deity insignia would NOT be generated. The insignia's will remain only for those kills within a + or - 5 level limit.<br><br>We could take this even another step back and say there are NO looting rights and just experience is lost. I am even open to more suggestions on how we keep high level players from (I can't think of another word besides grieving?) lower level players.<br><br>While I have the time, I wanted to address some more thoughts on this.<br><br>Bards and boats - We will definitely remove songs at first. And yes, this will most likely happen across all servers. If anyone can think of any problems this would cause, please let us know.<br><br>Evil Vs Evil? - This is more of a probe to see what players think about the idea. That's why we threw it out to you to chew on. But I can assure you that it hasn't been ruled out 100%. <br><br>"Conclusion: I really think Sullon Zek is a GREAT idea, but I see these certain aspects of the game as unbalancing, easily manipulated to favor certain people (not exploits mind you, just poor PvP planning for the world as a whole). <br><br><b>As the server is now, it is far more discouraging than fun, especially for light races playing evil chars and dark races playing good/neutral classes. They are just too thinly spread in their starting zones/areas/cities and the lack of binders in the surrounding areas and cities makes it even more discouraging. Upon hitting level 6 they are just bait and the lack of numbers means there is no way in which they can amass a small army for vengeance as they are far too outnumbered."</b><br><br>The poster did not give a name for the above text.<br><br>One thing to remember. EverQuest was not made with PvP in mind. So when servers like the Zek's come out, it is very hard to balance everything in regards to PvP. We don't have the resources to go through all the old world content and rebalance it for PvP. With Sullon, we have made some exceptions and have begun implementing quests that only appear on this server. We also did some changes with the race class combinations found on this server to help attempt to balance things.<br><br>As for the server being more discouraging then fun, everyone has a different thought on the "FUN" aspect of the server. Hopefully over time, and time permitting, we will be able to add more fun aspects to the server.<br><br>PvP Immunity update:<br><br>The changes made for the PvP Immunity for players under 6 is in its QA phase. Here are the details on what has been done.<br><br>These zones will continue to protect players below level 6 from PvP combat.<br><br>Steamfont, Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Everfrost, Tox, Misty Thicket, East Commons, Innothule Swamp, Feerrott, Butcher, Field of Bone, Swamp of No Hope, Warsliks Wood, Lake of Ill Omen and all City Zones (the zones where faction hits will take place).<br><br>When entering another zone, it will indicate that you are no longer immune from PvP.<br><br>/Con:<br><br>You may also notice that we slipped in new con messages for the Neutral Alliance. They can now tell whether their opponent is evil or good aligned. This should allow for neutral alliance to make alliances with another alliances more easily.<br><br>Hobart Wolfkin<br>Barbarian Warrior<br>The Tribunal</blockquote>The original thread can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000241.html" target="_new">here</a>.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Absor has posted some information from Hobart on some new rules and ideas for Sullon Zek over at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=DeveloperAPOs+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_new">the Developers Corner forum</a> :<blockquote>I wanted to give some information on what we are still planning to do with Sullon.<br><br>The first thing that will always be in progress is adding Sullon specific content. You will notice that their a some new NPC's that will start to appear on this server to guide and explain the rules and what options you may have as a member of a certain Deity Alliance.<br><br>For Example: The first set of NPC's will offer an item for a small donation that will allow players to identify players of another alliance through armor tints. This NPC will also explain in more detail how Insignias work, and what they may be used for in the future. NOTE: Not all these NPC's are done for every deity. They will be completed and patched as time permits.<br><br>The second topic is team balance.<br><br>Very soon, there will be methods to determine outside the game what team has control of what areas. The strength and maybe some other stats about that team will be shown. We may increase or decrease the reward for a particular alliance based on this information. An example would be offering a larger bounty for the insignia of a slain Cazic Thule follower over the insignia of a slain Tunare follower.<br><br>On this same topic will be slightly changing the way teams identify each other through /con. We will be changing it such that each team will be able to tell which team his target is aligned with. This will help those who wish to form a temporary alliance with another team.<br><br>Other gameplay issues.<br><br>We will be removing the below level 6 PvP immunity in mid to high level adventure zones. This will be done to prevent players below level 6 from causing grief without the higher level players having a means to retaliate. A prime example of this is the level 5 bard training sand giants in the oasis. Because this would be considered a mid level adventure zone, the level 5 bard could and would most likely be killed by another player. This will indeed make the trek from one city to another, which is currently pretty safe for players below level 6, much more difficult if it involves going through adventure zones.<br><br>Example zones where the below 6 PvP immunity would remain would be: Nektulos, Qeynos Hills, Innothule, and East Commons. These are just some of the examples. We will provide a full list or provide an in-game method of notifying the player when he enters one of the zones where this is implemented.<br><br>We will be removing the ability for bards to use songs on boats. Following shortly behind that will come the removal of any melee combat on the boats. Before doing this, we will be taking a look at ways of insuring the safety of a traveler on a boat from NPC's in the ocean.<br><br>We will be also changing the way PvP experience loss works on Sullon. The current problem is that a high level player can repeatedly kill lower level players without risk. The higher level player can continue to harass these lower level players without risk of experience or coin loss for any amount of time. While one could use the same argument that the lower level players are also losing nothing, we feel there should be some innate risk with a higher level player bottom feeding these lower level players. With this change, it will make higher level players think twice before attacking low level players. This will also give groups of lower level players an incentive to group up and take on higher level adversaries. So we intend to change the rules so that any character killed by a lower level character will lose experience. Along with the experience loss, the killing person will be given looting rights also.<br><br>Hobart Wolfkin<br>Barbarian Warrior<br>The Tribunal</blockquote>The original thread can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000241.html" target="_new">here</a>.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Aradune has made some updates over at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=DeveloperAPOs+Corner&number=1&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin=" target="_new">the Developers corner forum</a> about the new role play server. He mentions the possibility that /emote will be language specific and more importantly information about completely removing the NODROP tag from ALL items on the server! Here is what he had to say :<blockquote>Wow, we are getting a LOT of great feedback. A few have really got me thinking, so much so that I&#8217;m going to suggest something pretty crazy&#8230; <br>But first, there have also been some requests for more clarity on what I posted yesterday: <br><br><b>8) /emote will be changed such that one has to understand the language of the emoter (lest the command simply be used to bypass language barriers).</b> <br><br>Some players are rightfully saying that this inhibits RP&#8217;ing a bit. I agree, but we don&#8217;t really have a better solution. If we let people use /emote, some will simply communicate with it, bypassing the intended language barriers (for example: &#8220;/emote is communicating with you anyway, even though you don&#8217;t understand my language&#8221;).<br><br>But the canned emotes (/wave, /gesture, etc.) will remain. And if we can, we&#8217;ll add even more canned emotes in the future.<br><br><b>10) /who list will show everyone as 'anonymous'. </b><br><br>I&#8217;m still iffy on this. Some players were concerned that it would too greatly inhibit people who want to find groups. They may be right. We&#8217;ll definitely leave the LFG functionality in though.<br><br><b>11) 'Warrens' loot code turned on for ALL zones.</b><br><br>I&#8217;ll get to this in a minute <br><br><b>12) This is a PvE server, NOT a PvP server.</b><br><br>I should have been more clear here (we received a bunch of email asking what &#8216;PvE&#8217; means). PvE means Player vs. Environment (as opposed to Player vs. Player). What I really meant, though, is that it would work the same as our non-PvP servers, or &#8216;blue&#8217; servers, work now. You can still duel, guildwar, turn your PK Switch on with the Priest of Discord, etc.<br><br>There were also, as expected, lots of messages asserting that the server can&#8217;t truly be &#8216;RP&#8217; if it&#8217;s not PvP. Well, we&#8217;ll have to agree to disagree there.<br><br>Ok, now for Brad&#8217;s wacky idea for the day (I can&#8217;t wait until tomorrow when the team confronts me on this one  )<br><br>First, what is the &#8216;Warrens&#8217; loot code? It&#8217;s also called Trivial Combat code, or even &#8216;anti-bottom feeding code&#8217;, although some people get mad when I use those terms  In a nutshell, it means if you kill a mob that wouldn&#8217;t give you experience, you won&#8217;t get loot from it either. It&#8217;s really more complicated than that, and we&#8217;re continuing to refine it. For example, you still get non-magical items, and it works a little differently when you&#8217;re grouped. <br><br>There were two major concerns about applying this code to all the zones. The first was that there are some quests that require you to kill a &#8216;green&#8217; mob to get a quest component or some such. My response to this is we&#8217;ll address those as we come to them. Normally, this shouldn&#8217;t be the case, and so we&#8217;ll probably just clean up the quests over time. And for the few that are that way on purpose, we&#8217;ll specially flag them or something. Bottom line: I don&#8217;t want to wait until every single quest is addressed before launching the server.<br><br>The second concern was regarding no-drop items and how the Trivial Combat code interferes with obtaining them. And this is a good point &#8211; let&#8217;s say you missed getting an item and now you&#8217;re too high level. Well, trade for it or buy it &#8211; that&#8217;s what the player driven economy is all about, after all. But then what if the item is no-drop? <br><br>So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seriously considering: disabling the no-drop flag on the RP server. Lore items would still exist, but ANY item would be tradable.<br><br>Let us know what you think.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Brad</blockquote>Read the full story <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000238.html" target="_new">here</a>.

This resolves a bug that occurred a short while ago that would cause pets to be the focus for most attacks by NPCs.<br><br>- Fixed the animation problem where an animation played on the upper body would get stuck.  This could be seen by starting to cast a spell and then walking forward while it was playing the casting animation.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow a player to target an invisible PC or NPC with the F7 or F8 keys even if they had See Invisible up.<br><br>- Stacking issues with 'change form' type spells have been corrected.  Lich and Clarity will no longer stack, nor will Spirit of Wolf and Wolf Form.<br><br>- The bug with screenshots that some people experienced when using 32-bit color mode should be fixed.<br><br><br>** Item and Vendor Adjustments **<br><br>- Changed the forged Antonian Javelins to be stackable.<br><br>- Gnome Skin Sleeves are now droppable and rentable.<br><br>- Spiderling and Spider Silks are now stackable<br><br>- Spider Legs are now stackable.<br><br>- Tarnished weapons worth slightly more to the vendors than the rusty ones.<br><br>- Reduced the weight of the monk only Black Pantherskin armor.<br><br>- All Sheets of metal and Folded Sheets of metal are now stackable.<br><br>- Rangers will now be able to wear Girdle of Reflection<br><br>- There is now a vendor in Felwithe that sells the Enchant Ores series of enchanter spells.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>-  The Crazed Ghouls should be less of a problem in Unrest.<br><br>- The Monk red headband quest should now be available again.<br><br>- We've added a few more Yew Leaf spawns.<br><br>- Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets.  All fish vendors should return to normal, but they won't be paying as well for certain fishy items.  This resolves a problem that was created with the increased value of player made food items all over Norrath.

It's not one of power -- The class availability of the teams is in good balance. I imagine zone-control is a big part, but my guess is that it comes down mostly to "evil" seeming "cooler" than good. Do players *really* find this a problem? How many players joined Good expressly for the higher difficulty level and the "target rich environment"? How many joined evil due to a desire to be a part of what's imagined to be the "winning team"?</blockquote>but also a reminder that the ruleset is not <b>completely</b> without limitations!<blockquote><i>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. <b>However</b>: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any server.</i><br><br>Unfortunately, we have been forced to warn, suspend and banish a relatively high number of players (over 60 suspensions since the server opened) that have chosen to ignore the part of the rule after the bolded word <b>However</b>.</blockquote>Both these stories can be found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000239.html" target="_new">here</a> and <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000232.html" target="_new">here</a>.<br><br>... and finally a minor update about the possible dissapearance of gnome skin sleeves! ;)<blockquote><b>Gnome skin sleeves began popping up in [I'm sure you know where].
