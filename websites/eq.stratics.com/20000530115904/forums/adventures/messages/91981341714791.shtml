<b>Posted by Alnaron on Fennin Ro on February 23, 1999 at 6:43:37 PM EST:<div>(209.218.172.150)<p>

A couple of days ago, I traveled in a small band of adventurers with the goal of obtaining the much coveted Minotaur Axes for our party.  We set forth with myself (11th wood-elf ranger), Tiberon (12th dwarf cleric), Smeagol (now Smeag, the 11th dwarf paladin), and Elil (9th wood-elf ranger).<p>Traveling from the Butcherblock Mountains into Steamfont was a new experience for me.  I always look forward to seeing new lands and Steamfont held a few nice surprises for me.  Upon entering Steamfont, we traveled along a stretch of road, taking a left at the first fork.  A very short Watchman (sorry, but I find gnomes comical) glared at us as we walked by but offered no resistance.<p>After a bit of a walk, we approached a set of moving windmills which I found quite impressive.  We stopped for a bit of respite and got quickly attacked by two rather large earth elementals.  I taunted them with my usual barrage of inciteful comments and quickly found myself tanking both 'mentals.  During the ensuing battle, Elil managed to target a mental I wasn't taunting and found himself tanking.  Unfortunately, he was not as agile as I and quickly found himself near death!<p>I shouted for Elil to back off, but as he did so, both 'mentals pursued and quickly dispatched him.  We won the fight, but had to wait for Elil to run back from Kelethin to retrieve his belongings.<p>Upon Elil's arrival, we pressed onward to the Minotaur caves, happily noting that no other groups were present.  Smeagol and Tiberon were experienced Minotaur slayers and proceeded to move us to a nearby spot while Smeagol went inside to lure our first Minotaur.<p>Soon enough, Smeagol cried out the words that every group loves to hear (when ready), "Incoming!".  Our stalwart friend rushed out of the caves, closely pursued by a snorting Minotaur who made sounds much like that of an angry cow.  The Minotaurs proved to be quite easy and we slew one after another (sometimes in pairs) for the next hour probably.  We managed to obtain one of the Minotaur Axes (8 dam 37 delay) which I passed on to Elil since he had a rusty longsword.<p>Up until this point, our fights were readily handled (we found out we could handle 2 at once, but 3 was a bit much) until Smeagol pronounced it was harder to find Minotaurs inside the cave.  I offered to go inside with him, in a vain hope to use my tracking skill to locate more of the bullish mobs to fight.<p>Entering the cave for the first time was a little nerve-wracking for me.  I had heard stories of the dreaded Minotaur Hero who could handily dispatch a group of adventurers with a single glance and crush most guards with a short fight.  I stayed wary and constantly tracked, but the trails were pointing deeper and deeper inside the cave.<p>Smeagol advised caution, but I found myself traveling a little further after each tracking attempt.  Deep inside the caves, past a three-way split tunnel, I heard noises of battle!  Apparently there were two npc's inside who were fighting minotaurs, and winning!  I could not see the battles, but the sounds of combat echo'd inside the caves.  I pushed on further in a hope to find the battle, but then I heard the dreaded sound I'll never forget...<p>"Meldrath the Malignant starts casting a spell..."<p>I wasn't sure who or what this was, but I quickly relayed this information to the group.  Tiberon and Smeagol said "RUN!".  I started heading back while asking them who or what this was.  "Meldrath is the high level enchanter inside here that can charm people!"  *gulp*  I found myself slapping the spacebar repeatedly in a vain attempt to maximize the run/jump technique.  Smeagol and I made it outside ok, and we figured we escaped the mighty Enchanter's notice...  We were soon to find out otherwise.<p>After a few minutes of nothing coming out of the caves, I offered to go back inside hoping that the cave had respawned.  The others agreed to my idea, but cautioned me to stay alert (no need to say it twice!).  Upon entering the cave, I slowly walked inside, tracking constantly.  I found Meldrath on track, but I couldn't tell how far down the path he was.  I figured I could make the first turn and get away with a quick looksie to see what was around the corner...<p>As I turned to the right, I saw two of the Minotaurs running around, and a small gnome dressed in black.  I saw that this could be no other than Meldrath and proceeded to turn around right as Meldrath started casting a spell.  I tried to run, but then the spell took effect.<p>"You have lost control of yourself!"<p>My view changed instantly and I lost control of myself.  I found my body walking over to Meldrath and circling around uselessly with the other Minotaurs.  This was cool!!!  I tried to talk to my groupmates, but I could neither speak, nor interact with my persona in any way, shape, or form.  I realized I was safe at the moment and proceeded to enjoy the perspective of a mob -- halfway hoping some foolish adventurer would travel in and I'd get a chance to PK someone (heh).<p>After a couple of minutes, I realized nobody was coming inside, but Alnaron started pressing forward into the cave walls and managed to 'see' beyond it (a graphics glitch I'm sure).  Somehow Alnaron managed to target our cleric, Tiberon, and switched to his bow and proceeded to fire arrows into Tiberon through the cave walls!  This was hilarious!!<p>After about 5 minutes of being charmed, the spell faded and I sprinted outside of the cave, laughing to myself the whole time.  I told my group of my trip and they too were laughing at the situation.  If you haven't been charmed yet, give it a try sometime...  It's impressive!<p><br>Alnaron - Fennin Ro
