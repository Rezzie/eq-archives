                  EverQuest is, ultimately, a game about grouping and social interaction. 
                  It is a game about taking the strength of a warrior, the healing 
                  of a cleric, the air cover of a wizard, the debuffs of an enchanter, 
                  and the strengths of other characters to create a team that 
                  will bring a high-level mob to its knees. That said there are 
                  times when it is fun to just go out solo and take on the world 
                  by yourself. The problem is that the designers designed most 
                  of the characters to function most effectively in a group. As 
                  your character gets higher and higher in level, he or she needs 
                  to group more and more to survive. The magician (with his pet), 
                  however, is one character that can survive into its mid twenties 
                  solo and still take on challenging mobs. To be successful and 
                  consistently survive, you need to understand how to balance 
                  the risk of engagement to a reasonable level before you engage 
                  and understand when the tide has turned and it is time to run 
                  after you engage. The key to balancing and managing engagement 
                  risk is in understanding and mitigating the factors that drive 
                  the risk. In the following sections we will define these factors 
                  and create a framework for understanding how to balance engagement 
                  risk. Using this framework, we can define a set of simple rules 
                  that indicate when the risk has shifted against us and we need 
                  to escape. We will also use the framework to develop a guide 
                  of actions to take before you engage to shift the risk as far 
                  as possible in your favor. </font>

                  The first step in managing the risk of engagement is to develop 
                  a framework to describe and measure the risk. The framework 
                  should describe the risk of engagement in a way that defines 
                  all the factors that affect the risk and allows us to quickly 
                  assess and measure those factors to guide our actions. </font> 
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Engagement 
                    risk has two broad dimensions that should encompass all the 
                    factors that affect the risk: </font>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                    idea, then, is to balance these two dimensions to ensure your 
                    survivability. So the more lethal the mob you engage, the 
                    more assured escape must be if you are to survive if things 
                    go bad. Each of these dimensions can be broken into three 
                    factors that define the dimension and fully describe the drivers 
                    of engagement risk. </font>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Factors 
                    that drive probability of escape. There are four methods that 
                    you can use to escape an engagement: running to a zone, casting 
                    a spell that removes you from the fight (gate for a magician), 
                    running to guards, running to a group of friendly players 
                    who will help you. Your probability of successfully using 
                    any of these methods is driven by three factors: </font>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Security 
                      of the escape path.</b> For a path to be secure it must 
                      be a short distance and clear of mobs for a running escape. 
                      So for a highly secure path you must be standing very near 
                      the zone, guards or friends and there cannot be intervening 
                      mobs between you and the escape point. For a casting escape 
                      security means there is enough distance between you and 
                      the mob to allow you time to cast the spell before you are 
                      engaged. In the case of a casting escape you must be free 
                      to actually cast spell (i.e., you are standing still and 
                      no mob is hitting or stunning you to interrupt the spell).

                        example of a low security path would be the lower levels 
                        of a dungeon. In a dungeon there is a restricted path 
                        to the zone and it tends to fill with intervening mobs 
                        as they spawn behind you. Being within view of the zone 
                        or guards would be a secure path. Standing at maximum 
                        distance from your pet while he fights the mob is also 
                        a secure escape position (you have time to cast a gate 
                        spell before the mob can get to you and the mob's engagement 
                        with your pet lessens the chance the mob will try to stun 
                        you). </font>

                          from the threat, and it is always available if memorized. 
                          The downside is it takes a few seconds to cast and can 
                          fizzle or be interrupted. </font>

                          power to quickly overwhelm your opponent (not always). 
                          Most of them are aggressive enough to help you if you 
                          can get close but they will not absolutely remove you 
                          from the threat. Guards, then, are a good bet but not

                          all) or be willing (or quick enough) to help when you 
                          get there. Depending on their levels they may not even

                      and the engagement's resulting impact on your health and 
                      mana level. If you are highly involved in the engagement 
                      you will likely reduce your probability of escape by lowering 
                      your health as you are hit, lowering your mana as you cast,

                          on one is limited by your low HP and AC. A magician 
                          must be very careful to manage their level of engagement. 
                          This factor has much less effect on our tanking friends 
                          who can survive much longer toe to toe and, as such, 
                          preserves their ability to stay in a fight longer and 
                          still escape. </font>

                        then, you highest probability of escape is if you are 
                        fighting a mob close to the zone point and letting your 
                        pet do most of the fighting. To make this escape dimension 
                        useful in a framework, however, we must distill the above 
                        factors into an easy rule to differentiate a high probability 
                        of escape situation from a low probability of escape situation. 
                        If we make the assumption that we can mitigate the certainty 
                        of escape issue if two methods of escape are available, 
                        we can create the following rules: </font>

                          we need two methods available. You should always have 
                          your gate spell available if you are not engaged so 
                          if you are near a zone or guards or a group of player 
                          characters you have two methods available. They must, 
                          however, be secure. So it must be a short distance, 
                          clear of mobs. To be obtainable you must have more than 
                          one bubble of health, enough mana to cast gate, and 
                          not be engaged in one on one combat. </font>

                          of a dungeon you likely have a low probability of escape. 
                          There are likely no guards, player groups may not be

                          mob spawns in between. Your gate spell is all you have 
                          with certainty. If you are in an open area out of view 
                          of the guards and zone point (like in many parts of

                    we need to define a similar set of rules to measure the lethality

                    the mob to get a clear picture of the risk of the engagement. 
                    There are three factors that drive the lethality of a mob. 
                    Once we understand these factors we can define a set of rules 
                    to characterize high and low lethality in an engagement and 
                    balance those with our rules above to determine the actions

                          is the level of the mob. By using the consider function

                          level. For a magician, mobs in the green, blue, black, 
                          and yellow range are usually fair game. Obviously the 
                          higher the level the more certain we have to be of our 
                          escape route. </font> 
                          <p>
                        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                          mob's ability to cast a spell (even a stun spell) also 
                          weighs in here. A black mob with the ability to stun 
                          can be far more lethal, in some cases, than a yellow 
                          without that ability. Shamans and other casting classes 
                          are also dangerous to engage. The magician's power to 
                          solo higher-level mobs comes from his ability to have 
                          both the pet and the magician inflicting damage at the 
                          same time. A spell caster can remove you from the engagement 
                          with a stun and put the burden of engagement on your 
                          pet. The mob's capability to stun also slows your ability 
                          to run for a zone point and thus allows him to inflict 
                          more damage on you without your being able to respond. 
                          With you removed from attacking, the odds can quickly 
                          shift to the mob. </font>

                          damage in a short time. Also, if they can outrun you, 
                          you have to be much closer to your escape point. A giant 
                          spider, for instance, is very slow. You can easily outrun 
                          it. As a result, you can be much farther away from your 
                          zone point than if you attack a gnoll that can easily 
                          overtake you. </font>

                      of mobs.</b> The higher the number of mobs in an engagement 
                      the lower your chances of surviving. You can easily solo 
                      one mob with your pet. More than one becomes more of a problem. 
                      You ability to successfully engage a higher-level mob requires 
                      you to cast damage or healing spells during the conflict. 
                      If a mob is hitting you, your spells are frequently interrupted. 
                      You just don't hit hard enough to bring down a high level 
                      mob with your staff or dagger. With one mob, your pet can 
                      engage while you stay out of the fray. You can control when 
                      you need to step in to take a few hits while you pet recovers. 
                      You can stay out of range and burn like a wizard if things 
                      go wrong. It is possible to engage multiple mobs successfully; 
                      it just raises the risk of the engagement. Do not underestimate 
                      the havoc a green mob hitting you can cause while you are 
                      trying to support a pet attacking a yellow. </font>

                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Social 
                      status of mobs.</b> Tied to the number of mobs involved 
                      factor is the social status of the mobs. Some mobs are very 
                      aggressive and they tend to support each other. This means 
                      if you attack one, any other one in the immediate area will 
                      also join in. Before you know it, you have three mobs hitting 
                      your pet and two coming after you. Also many mobs have relationships 
                      with others not of their kind. In Everfrost, for instance, 
                      the snow leopards seem to like the giant spiders. I have 
                      often found a lone blue giant spider and initiated the attack 
                      only to have several snow leopards come along. I end up 
                      engaging four blue mobs vs. the one lone blue I had anticipated. 
                      So a mob's social status, aggressiveness, and availability 
                      in an area can significantly alter the risk of an engagement. 
                      </font>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, 
                    then, a low-level non-casting single non-aggressive mob is 
                    our lowest risk for engagement. There is not much news in 
                    that observation. The key here is to again distill the above 
                    factors that drive lethality into a simple set of rules that 
                    will define a high lethality situation and differentiate if 
                    from a low-level lethality situation. The following rules 
                    should provide the definition we need: </font>
                  <ul>
                    <p>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      high lethality engagement exists if a red mob is involved, 
                      multiple mobs are involved (other than two blues), or a 
                      caster is involved. A red mob is a wild card. It is hard 
                      to tell how many levels above you it is. Even a lower level 
                      red is more than a challenge for a solo magician and pet. 
                      To engage a red you are taking a significant risk (it can 
                      be done, you just need to balance the risk with two or more 
                      highly secure escape methods). Multiple mobs are difficult 
                      to defeat. You will likely be drawn into one on one combat. 
                      This is not a bad situation for a tank, but you can't stand 
                      toe to toe. My experience has been that anything more than 
                      two blue mobs at once is a wild card. I have (as many of 
                      you have) defeated three blues on several occasions. I have 
                      also gotten set to the Promised Land by three blues as well. 
                      The situation can easily get out of control and your escape 
                      ability will evaporate rapidly. For three blues, a blue 
                      / yellow, blue / black, two blacks or two yellows, you are 
                      in a high lethality situation and you need to manage the 
                      risk appropriately. Casters are also a wild card. A blue 
                      that can cast can quickly shift the balance of the engagement 
                      with a simple stun spell. As soon as you discover a caster 
                      in the group, you have entered a high lethality situation. 
                      Social tendencies of the mobs are an overlay here. The more 
                      social the mob the more likely you are going to end up with 
                      more than two mobs attacking you. So the social driver is 
                      baked into the rule by limiting the number of mobs you are 
                      engaging. </font>

                      pretty easy for me to remember. I did not mention greens 
                      here. Most greens do not really want to engage you. Many 
                      times you can pull higher-level mobs and the greens will 
                      stand still. If you do have greens attacking, you need to 
                      eliminate them quickly to allow you to focus on the higher-level 
                      mobs. </font>

                    our definitions of probability of escape and lethality of 
                    mob, we can place ourselves on the grid during an engagement. 
                    Most engagements will start in the upper right hand corner 
                    (engage at will) block. In this corner we are engaging one 
                    of any non-red mob that is a non-caster or two blues and we 
                    have two escape routes available to us. You are likely out 
                    in an open area with your gate spell up and within sight of 
                    a zone, guards, or some solid friends. This is the bread and 
                    butter corner. You should be able to fight and win in this 
                    corner all day. </font>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                    are times when you may start in the bottom right corner (maintain 
                    escape route). You are engaging low lethality mobs but you 
                    only have one real escape route. This would likely be in a 
                    dungeon or out in the middle of a zone with no ability to 
                    reasonably get to the boundary, guards, or a friendly group. 
                    In this case you must look carefully for anything that will 
                    nullify your escape route and defend the route or immediately 
                    execute your escape plan. </font>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes 
                    you just have to see if you can take that red mob or those 
                    fours blues. You may feel that two blacks just cannot be that 
                    hard and you just have to at least try to take them down. 
                    These types of engagements are high lethality and place you 
                    in the upper left (establish control) corner. It is okay to 
                    take the chance, but you need to understand that the risk 
                    here is high. You need to make sure you have two very secure 
                    escape routes. This means you will likely have gate up and 
                    are standing a very short distance from a zone or very strong 
                    guards (you escape routes need to be as absolute as possible). 
                    The key here is to understand if you are in control of the 
                    situation. If you feel like things are deteriorating quickly 
                    and you cannot maintain control, then do not blink, just escape.

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                    should really never start in the bottom left (immediate escape) 
                    corner. It is a place that you end up when things go wrong. 
                    I believe that many players get killed and frustrated because 
                    they start in this bottom left hand (immediate escape) corner. 
                    You are out gunned and you do not have adequate ability to 
                    get away. The key is to use the simple rules above to understand 
                    when you are in this lose / lose situation and to escape without 
                    thinking about it. </font>

                    everything were as simple as understanding your starting corner

                    simple. It is not. The hardest part of the game is to realize 
                    when you have migrated from one corner to the next. You need 
                    to immediately realize when you have gone from the upper right 
                    to the lower left. It is not always obvious. It is, however, 
                    easy to recognize the trigger events that cause you to move 
                    from one corner to the next and then set up some simple rules 
                    to respond accordingly. The next section explores these triggers 
                    and establishes simple rules to help understand when it is 
                    time to call it quits and just make a run for it. </font>

                  Most players die in EverQuest for the same few reasons. They 
                  either start in the bottom left corner of the framework (immediate 
                  escape) and do not realize the danger (or do not care, it is 
                  just a game after all), they do not recognize when they have 
                  shifted into the bottom left corner from a safer condition and 
                  continue to fight, or they do not take the actions in the upper 
                  left (establish control) and lower right (maintain escape route) 
                  corners to keep them out of the immediate escape area. The goal, 
                  then, is to understand the trigger events that lead a shift 
                  from one framework corner to the next. Then based on those trigger 
                  events, we can define some simple rules to quickly evaluate 
                  your position on the matrix and lead you to the correct action.<br>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Immediate 
                    escape triggers and rules.</b> There are four triggers that 
                    should lead you immediately to the bottom left corner (immediate 
                    escape). They do not require any thought you just immediately 
                    execute your most secure escape. </font>

                      red mob shows up once the engagement begins.</b> It does 
                      not matter which corner you are in. It does not matter what 
                      you are doing or who you are engaging. Once a red mob shows 
                      up, immediately escape. Do not think, do not consider, just 
                      run or gate. The reason is simple. No matter where you are 
                      on the framework matrix, you are going to quickly end up 
                      in the bottom left corner. A red mob immediately puts you 
                      in the high lethality side. A red mob will also make short 
                      work of your pet and remove your ability to gate (thus removing 
                      one of your escape routes). Even if you have several other 
                      escape routes you must start immediately moving to exit 
                      or the red will overtake you and engage you one on one removing 
                      the running escape. They tend to hit very hard relative 
                      to your level and your HP and AC are not likely enough to 
                      compensate, thus decreasing your chances of escape by running.

                      arrival of a new mob takes you to three mobs in the engagement.</b> 
                      Again, it does not matter which corner you are in or what 
                      you are doing just escape quickly. Facing three mobs, you 
                      have immediately entered the high lethality side of the 
                      matrix. With three mobs to work on you, the chance of a 
                      one on one engagement just got real high. As we have said 
                      before, a one on one engagement clearly removes (or greatly 
                      decreases) your ability to gate (a primary escape method). 
                      And you will likely be slowed down from running to your 
                      nearest help. I try not to think on this one. While I have 
                      survived three mobs while soloing, there are just too many 
                      things that you have to consider and too many things that 
                      can go wrong. I set this rule in stone and do not think 
                      about it. </font>

                      control) or lower right (maintain escape) corners (or have 
                      ended up there) escape immediately if your pet dies. This 
                      is another trigger event I do not think about. If your pet 
                      dies then something has likely gone wrong. When you are 
                      starting in one of the higher risk corners you have very 
                      a small safety net. In the few seconds it takes you to figure 
                      out what went wrong, it is likely that you have either lost 
                      control of the situation or lost your one escape route. 
                      In either event, the framework says you have shifted lower 
                      left and need to escape. I prefer to gate or zone and figure 
                      out later what happened. </font>

                      area. If you are in the upper left (establish control) corner 
                      the addition of another mob just pushed you to a more lethal 
                      situation and your ability to control the situation just

                      of a new mob just put your escape route into jeopardy. Maintaining 
                      it is going to be difficult. Again, it is very hard to quickly

                    events, however, that allow you a second or two to think before 
                    you act. These events occur when you are in the "safe" corner 
                    in the upper right corner. The next section will review these

                    you engage. There is more of a safety net. Most trigger events 
                    (outside of the first two immediate ones above) will move 
                    you to the upper left corner or lower right corner and you 
                    have several seconds to consider what to do. When a trigger

                    left and must quickly answer the question, "can I control 
                    the new situation?" If you cannot, then you have just slipped 
                    to the lower left corner and should immediately escape. When 
                    a trigger event removes an escape route you need to quickly 
                    answer the question, "can I maintain my one remaining escape 
                    route?" If that route is about to be compromised, then you

                      You need to understand that you have immediately shifted 
                      to the left and are in the upper left (establish control)

                      blue (that you can likely kill alone) then you can probably 
                      establish control of the situation and continue the fight. 
                      You need to remember, however, that you are in a high lethality

                      and shifts you to the left on the framework matrix. You 
                      need to ask yourself if you can quickly defeat the caster 
                      and reestablish control of the situation. If it is a blue

                      non-red caster you need to evaluate where its damage is 
                      vs. yours. If you are still in control then keep going. 
                      If it is a new caster that has shown up, you need to quickly 
                      evaluate your HP state and that of your pet vs. the mob 
                      you are engaging and consider the level of the new caster. 
                      If your pet can finish off the current mob and the caster 
                      is blue, then you can engage the caster and let your pet

                    lose your pet and you may have a long walk back from where 
                    you zoned or your bind point. But if things go wrong and you 
                    do not escape, you still have to start over from the current

                    mobs out of traffic to avoid the new mob trigger.</b> One 
                    of the most common triggers is a new mob showing up uninvited. 
                    One way to minimize the probability of a new mob showing up 
                    is to pull your prey to an area out of traffic and away from 
                    the other mobs that can support it. Most of the mobs that 
                    move around do so in a predefined manner. You need to establish 
                    the traffic patterns in an area and pull away from it. For 
                    instance, in Everfrost there is an area south of the south 
                    tower that is a mob freeway. There are always a wide variety 
                    of mobs moving on the freeway. When I first found this area, 
                    I would run up and engage a mob in the high traffic area. 
                    Soon I would have additional orcs or snow leopards or giant 
                    spiders taking large chunks out of my magician. Most of the 
                    mobs in this area are very social (and aggressive when their 
                    friends are attacked). Once I understood the traffic pattern, 
                    I started casting my pull spell from max distance and then 
                    turned and ran towards the south tower. This pulled the mobs 
                    out of the traffic and actually helped me establish another 
                    escape route since there are always very helpful higher-level 
                    players at the tower (this is a big mammoth hunting area). 
                    The same is true for patrolling mobs. Pull them away from 
                    the patrol area and engage them one on one. </font>

                    When your pet gets down to 50% evaluate the situation and

                    the situation when you are fighting a mob that is too far 
                    above your pet. The problem is that as you level your pet 
                    does not. Pets are generally a level or so above or below 
                    the level of the spell they are cast from. So a pet cast from 
                    a level eight pet spell will be a level or so above or below 
                    level eight. So when you are on a new spell level (4, 8, 12,

                    range. You need to be away from your pet so you have the choice 
                    of moving in or burning. This also applies to green mobs. 
                    Clean up a green that is engaged first so he does not interupt 
                    your spell casting. </font>
