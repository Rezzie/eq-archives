My bravery fluctuates like the weather unlike the normal brave warriors out there. I've helped others at the bottom of Befallen at the risk of losing all my belongings to aid others. But pertaining to your situation, I have to plead guilty.<p>In the Northern Desert of Ro I like to Solo with my pet. There is a platform near the tunnel to the East Commons. It appears to me as a spot for migrant warriors to gather looking for work. Well I made 12th lv and was trying out my new elementals. I was fighting a Dune Spider when I with my pet, I got knocked down to about half hp and backed off to let my pet handle the spider a bit while I cast. Suddenly, I get clobbered from behind by 2 mummies. I tried to cast once when I notice my pet die to the spider. Well, being a desperate Magician with little resources. I hauled ass to the platform nearby. They were all lazing around basting in the desert sun when I promptly ran through the middle of them. I turned to watch the impending mayhem for a moment. Well the zombies thought this was a banquet and forgot all about me and proceeded to wallop the sleeping paladin and ranger. The dune spider was nearly dead, so I dispatched it quickly. The mummies were still around so I cast raining blades on them. Now, you may begin to wonder about my motives (if it wasn't obvious). I had two thoughts running through my head.<p>1) Save the warriors I so rudely woke from their naps or<br>2) Get the experience for the kills.<p>Well, it was a little of 1 and a lot of 2. I kind of felt bad after it was over and they were all cursing about who had brought this horde down on them. I stood around pretending I didn't know who had done it and acted as mad as the rest. Until, I couldn't stand it any longer, and ran up and looted all the corpses. I said "Thanks" and left as quickly as I came.<p>This is despicable of course. I'm usually upstanding and loyal. I really felt bad about doing it. I only did it one more time. (hehe). The second time I died deservedly (I only attempt this when I'm in trouble). So you can see, your motive was just a little less intentional (probably a lot) than mine. I was not trying to get them killed either, but there were like 12 sitting around, I knew nobody would die.
