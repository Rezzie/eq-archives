There are honourable warriors out there. I was given a large shield when I saved one warrior's life. Another handed me their loot. And I have in turn found those I healed unasked watching me while I solo'ed, prepared to save me if the fight turned ugly.<p>Really, I don't get discouraged by fools who demand healing. If the "Please" is there, I will heal. Without it, then it is at my discretion. I save my mana, generally, for people in danger of dying. It's very easy to take on something you've killed many of, but suddenly found it had hit you twice for max damage and you'd missed. Now down 20%HP, the fight is a lot iffier. Normally, they just escape to the guards, but if I'm there, I help out.<p>What I don't like is what a couple french people did to me and my group. (Karana is the server of choice for the french community.) We were just hunting calves in teh Everfrost, when two female barb shamen wander out onto the dirt. At level 3, their lives would be short. They were lucky not to get slaughtered the moment they came out, but there were lots of lures out trawling for the big stuff. They hung around us, nearly dying constantly, nattering in french. (I understand some, but I'm not fluent.) I could tell they were nattering, because they were insulting my Gnomish friend who had just made the trip from Freeport. They did thank me for the healing I did, but then they hung around us. We were level 9 and 8, so they couldn't and didn't really interfere, but they did start taking on the weaker stuff that we ignored. I saved them twice, before saying, "No more." to my party. We are always prepared to help those in trouble, but this was pushing it. "They'll figure out they are in the wrong place the hard way, sooner or later."<p>THey did disappear soon after, but only when they figured out we had changed our policy. Never saw them again, so I assume they changed to new characters.<br>
