                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Why a 
                    Dwarf? Certainly there are other races (Barbarian, Troll, 
                    etc.) that seem a more obvious choice, and I have played them 
                    all at one time or another. But of all of these races, I have 
                    had the most fun in the role of a warrior playing as a Dwarf. 
                    There are a variety of advantages to playing as a Dwarf; good 
                    starting stats, some unique weapons, and very nice role-playing 
                    opportunities just to name a few. </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So without 
                    further delay, lets get into the nitty-gritty of the Dwarf 
                    Warrior. </font>

                    Creation</font></b><br>
                    When allocating those first 25pts to stats I recommend the 
                    following: </font>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 20pts 
                      - Strength<br>
                      5pts - Agility </font></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Strength 
                    is a very important stat for a warrior for two main reasons; 
                    the amount of damage you deal and the ability to wear very 
                    heavy armor. As a warrior one of your primary jobs is to absorb 
                    punishment. To that end, you will need to always have the 
                    best armor to keep that AC as high as possible. As most metal 
                    armor gets rather heavy until you can find magical armor (which 
                    is often weighs half as much) it is important to have a high 
                    strength so you can bear more weight. One of the earliest 
                    armor types you will acquire will be bronze. This armor is 
                    heavier than banded, but offers great protection until you 
                    can upgrade to various magic armor, such as the Dwarven Ringmail 
                    Tunic. Strength also affects, later in a warrior's life, your 
                    maximum damage per blow cap. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Agility 
                    greatly affects the amount of damage you take when hit and 
                    also seems to be directly tied to dodge, which prevents you 
                    from being hit altogether. A Dwarf starts relatively low in 
                    this stat, so get it up ASAP. </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now it's 
                    time to pick your deity. This is surprisingly important to 
                    the Dwarf warrior. I highly recommend choosing Brell Serilis 
                    as your god. The reason may not seem readily apparent at the 
                    low levels, but become monumental later on. This is because 
                    the EQ Team has recently added a few Dwarf only items that 
                    are dependent on Brell as your deity: the Stormguard Battleaxe/Hammer 
                    of Brell and Bloodforge Armor. The armor can be received if 
                    not a Brell worshipper, but your faction will need working 
                    on to get to that reward if you are agnostic. Also, several 
                    Dwarf quests, and several Gnome quests, are not open to you 
                    if you are agnostic. Even though these items may not be on 
                    your wish list, it appears Verant has taken steps to make 
                    more items deity exclusive so later on, it may become VERY 
                    important. </font>

                    Now it's time to enter Norrath. The first thing you will want 
                    to do is find your guild hall. The guild is located in South 
                    Kaladim and can be found by looking for a marble white building 
                    that architecturally resembles a church. There is a small 
                    pond behind this building, and behind that is the Stormguard 
                    Hall. Enter the building, and go left up the stairs. Here 
                    you will find Furtog Ogrebane, the warrior guild master, on 
                    a balcony. Turn in your note for some exp, faction and an 
                    AC 4 tunic. </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The next 
                    thing you will want to do is set up your hot boxes. This is 
                    an important feature to consider for a warrior and you will 
                    want your first series of hotboxes to resemble something like 
                    this: <br>

                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I recommend 
                    these keys (placed in any a pattern you are comfortable with) 
                    for the following reason; a warrior should be skilled in at 
                    least 3 (arguably 4) weapons. Those weapons are 1H Slash, 
                    2H Slash, Archery (and 1H Blunt if you so desire). With this 
                    set up, you can place a weapon of each category in the slots 
                    for on the fly changing during a fight, and a backpack in 
                    inventory slot 2 for quick changing of shields and other weapons. 
                    Just drop the next weapon in the melee slot and you won't 
                    miss a beat. Ranged Attack is used for pulling creatures, 
                    and Sit is something warriors do as often as mages meditate. 
                    </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You can 
                    play with the setup, but in order to master all weapon skills, 
                    you need to have the appropriate item easily accessible. Also, 
                    it is very important to train ALL of the weapon skills at 
                    an early level and this setup allows you to interchange a 
                    weapon in the middle of a fight. Raising a skill from basically 
                    zero when you are in your teens because you neglected it in 
                    the early levels is painfully slow. </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You will 
                    notice that Run is not in that setup. This is because almost 
                    everyone always runs, so you will have that clicked from the 
                    moment you logged on anyway, and won't touch it afterwards. 
                    </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Now it's 
                    time to enter the Butcherblock Mountains. Ask for directions 
                    out of the zone, or look for the cave exit that is the largest 
                    opening in the zone. This takes you out of Kaladim. When you 
                    enter the open air, you will see a dreadful sight; the land 
                    is overrun with Bats, Snakes, Skunks, Rock Spiderlings, Decaying 
                    Skeletons and Goblin Whelps. Dwarfs have a saying, "Never 
                    leave an Elf to do a Dwarfs job!" Stay between the Kaladim 
                    entrance and the Guard Tower to the left of home and start 
                    clearing this area of beasts. Here you will easily get from 
                    level 1 to 4 in no time at all, but be VERY poor for all of 
                    your effort. Butcherblock is a great training ground, but 
                    a horrible place to make money at low levels. As soon as you 
                    are 4th level, I recommend going to Greater Faydark. </font>

                    Getting from Butherblock to Greater Faydark is a relatively 
                    simple process, especially if a kind soul casts a Spirit of 
                    Wolf on you. Don't worry about dieing on the way since by 
                    now, your skill at dieing will most likely be maxed! When 
                    you get to Greater Faydark, have someone bind you at the Orc 
                    Lift below the Wood Elves' tree city of Kelethin. If you are 
                    not sure where that is, ask around and a kindly Elf will surely 
                    guide you. If you are new to Norrath and don't know how to 
                    get to Kelethin, just take the road going right out of Butcherblock 
                    and follow it the city or better yet, visit one of the many 
                    EQ map sites and print one out. </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> From 
                    the Orc Lift, you should head to Orc Hill. Orc Hill is located 
                    on the road leading from the Orc Lift, toward Crushbone (the 
                    Orc stronghold). It is to the right halfway between the two. 
                    It has a relatively close proximity to the lift (for emergency 
                    run to the guards), a very high spawn rate, and a good number 
                    of people your level to give you a hand when things get nasty. 
                    The best part about Orc Hill will be the sudden influx of 
                    good loot that you missed while in Butcherblock. Here you 
                    will easily fill out a complete set of cloth armor and gather 
                    enough coin to make your first major purchase; the Dwarven 
                    Ringmail Tunic. </font>

                    protection (AC 12) and the boost to magic resistance (+8) 
                    make this armor excellent for the low level Dwarf. Considering 
                    you already have a higher than average magic resistance, this 
                    addition makes it easier to stand up to the spells that Orc 
                    Shamans, Oracles and such are always trying to cast on the 
                    tank of the group. The tunic is also very reasonably priced 
                    between 12 and 15 plat (with slight variations depending generally 
                    on the age of the server you are on). Some unscrupulous sellers 
                    will try to convince you that they are worth 20 plat or more. 
                    Don't be fooled into spending that kind of money; be patient 
                    and get one cheaper. They are rather common items and I have 
                    seen them auctioned EVERYTIME I am in Faydark for no more 
                    than 15 plat. </font>

                    10 - 16</font></b><br>
                    In short time, you will hit level 10 and be ready to enter 
                    into Crushbone itself. These will be very fun times for you 
                    as a Dwarf; cracking Orc skulls and spreading revenge in the 
                    name of Kaladim throughout the zone. The coin will come in 
                    loads and you will collect many Orc belts and Legionnaire 
                    shoulder pads. Hold onto these, and take them back to Conloe 
                    in Kaladim to show how you have brought honor to the Stormguard 
                    name. You can easily stay in Crushbone until 16th level, fighting 
                    the Orc Trainer and getting the Shiny Brass Shield, or crushing 
                    the Warlord for those valuable Bracers of Battle. This is 
                    also the place where you can complete the Screaming Mace quest 
                    and use it either to build your 1H Blunt skill or sell for 
                    between 75-100 plat (again depending on your server). If there 
                    comes a time when you need a new taste of adventure, head 
                    on over to the Steamfont Mountains, and fight Minotaurs and 
                    Lesser Ebon Drakes. The loot is a little slower, but the adventure 
                    is great. There are also some quests in Ak'Anon for you to 
                    have fun with while there. </font>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By this 
                    time you will be a pro and ready to head off and bring great 
                    honor to your clan. I would recommend filling out your armor 
                    with either Bloodforge or banded before you leave. Don't forget 
                    to put at least 1 point of training into each new skill acquired 
                    at the appropriate level to get it started. Many Dwarves also 
                    enjoy smithing and/or brewing as a trade skill. Be forewarned, 
                    smithing is a money pit until you become skilled and you will 
                    dump 100 - 200pp before you start making a decent profit.

                    Note on Role-playing a Dwarf</b><br>
                    The many role-playing opportunities the Dwarf provides is 
                    one of the reasons I enjoy the race. I have included some 
                    classic fantasy themes that may help you develop the personality 
                    of your warrior. I have received many laughs and praise for 
                    the various "Dwarf quirks" emotes I keep hot keyed. Here are 
                    some ideas: </font>
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      angry Dwarf.<br>
                      Dwarves are renown for their short tempers and generally 
                      sour dispositions. I like to emote things like: <i>Barthalomew 
                      looks extremely angry for no apparent reason.</i><br>
                      Always be griping about how such and such really makes you 
                      angry and how if YOU had a choice, you'd have done such 
                      and such differently. One of my favorites (that always gets 
                      a smile) is: <i>Barthalomew mumbles a thank you and looks 
                      rather embarrassed and Barthalomew wonders which is worse; 
                      a goblin marrying his sister, or YOU!</i> </font>
                      <p> 
                    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      sleepy geezer.<br>
                      Some Dwarves are very old and wrinkled. This character is 
                      always nodding off and will always enjoy a good hearty meal. 
                      It is fun to emote things like: <i>Barthalomew digs into 
                      his pack pulls out a rather large leg-of-lamb and starts 
                      eating, and Barthalomew dozes off again with rather large 
                      snores,</i> or <i>Barthalomew seems half awake and rather 
                      ancient.</i> </font>
                      <p> 
                    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      brewer.<br>
                      Dwarves and ale are synonymous. Pick up the brewing skill 
                      and brag about your family brew. Build up a high alcohol 
                      tolerance and keep a hearty supply of various brews on hand 
                      at all times. You can also take this to the extreme and 
                      emote some drunken Dwarf actions like: <i>Barthalomew has 
                      had FAR too much to drink and gives a sexy wink to the Wood 
                      Elf.</i> </font>
                      <p> 
                    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      racist Dwarf.<br>
                      This is the most difficult to pull off due to the inherent 
                      nature of EQ that requires grouping. Dwarves are very suspicious 
                      of other races and even more so with Elves. Their history 
                      is dotted with many wars and currently involves a tenuous 
                      truce. A hardcore role-player would NEVER group with a Dark 
                      Elf and would only join a group with Elves under dire need. 
                      Of course this is unrealistic in EQ considering the game 
                      structure and a lot of people won't understand or appreciate 
                      your role-playing. So a way around this is to create clever, 
                      but not too insulting, emotes: <i>Barthalomew eyes the Elf 
                      with suspicion as he deliberately sharpens the blade of 
                      his axe</i> or <i>Barthalomew questions the wisdom of allowing 
                      one of the pointy ear people into the party.</i> A clever 
                      Elf will pick up on these small pokes and will play off 
                      of it for some fun. Be sure to add some mild compliments 
                      especially after a hard fought battle such as <i>Barthalomew 
                      thinks this Elf ain't half bad for an Elf at least</i> 
                      </font>
                      <p> 
                  </ul>
                  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The point 
                  is, the game is much more enjoyable if you do more than fight, 
                  sit, fight, sit gaining levels mindlessly. I have found that 
                  a few well placed emotes will make people remember you for many 
                  months to come. I have had people I vaguely remember run up 
                  to me, say "Hi!" and eagerly want me to join their party just 
                  because of some silly thing I did in Dwarf character months 
                  before while in their group. </font>
