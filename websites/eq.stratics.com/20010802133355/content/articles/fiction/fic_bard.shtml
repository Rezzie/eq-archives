                  <div> Darter Elfgard turned away from his friend and faced the 
                    lich, ignoring the moisture in his eyes. Back to back to back, 
                    the barbarian warriors and the ranger fought for their lives. 
                    Shouting warcries, firing arrows and swinging with all their 
                    might, the trio created a pile of snow orc bodies around them. 
                    Huntra cut the ice giant down like a huge oak, and, like an 
                    oak, its downfall caused the earth to tremble. Suddenly, they 
                    were engulfed in crimson flames. Everything went dark, dark, 
                    dark... 
                    <p> "....Dart, Dart, Darter! I know you can hear me! Drink 
                      some of this." Darter croaked a question and instinctively 
                      swallowed the warm liquid placed to his lips. Volgar sighed 
                      sadly as he looked at his bandaged comrade. "Ah, Dart, you 
                      have a lion's courage, but you are barely strong enough 
                      to survive this harsh land of ours. You'll do, though. Aye, 
                      you'll do just fine." 
                    <p> Huntra placed her hand on her clanmate's arm and said, 
                      "Lets leave him be for now. He still needs much rest." Volgar 
                      nodded. They turned, arm in arm, and left their new friend 
                      in the hospice to heal and recover his strength. After they 
                      left Darter stared at the ceiling, blinking his eyes. 
                    <p> Two weeks later, The ranger had his bandages removed and 
                      was allowed out of the bed to recover his strength. Volgar 
                      and Huntra took him on long walks around their home village, 
                      helping him get his muscles back in tone. As he grew stronger, 
                      they extended the walks into day hikes and finally mountain 
                      climbing to restore his confidence and agility. After a 
                      month they judged he was ready for his first big hunt. 
                    <p> "Well, Dart," said Huntra, "Ye been layin' around here 
                      eatin' up our food and drinkin' our ale long enough. Time 
                      ye earned yer keep! We're going on a mammoth hunt today 
                      and you're invited. We could use your trackin' skills, believe 
                      it or not. For bein' so big, they can be fearsome hard to 
                      find sometimes." 
                    <p> "Mammoth hunt, eh? Aye, and I will be glad to join ye. 
                      I am gettin' a rash on me tail from sittin' around here 
                      so much, heh." Darter walked over and grabbed his bow and 
                      quiver from the corner. The trio packed a trail lunch, gathered 
                      their weapons, and set out on their venture. 
                    <p> Volgar picked up mammoth sign within the hour, and Darter 
                      took the lead. Suddenly he stopped and looked around, wearing 
                      a puzzled frown. 
                    <p> "What's up, Dart?" asked Volgar. 
                    <p> The ranger sighed and said, "I don't know, but I have 
                      lost the trail. I can't seem to find any sign anywhere." 
                    <p> Huntra carefully searched the area, walked over to a low 
                      bush and picked up a coarse hair. "Here," she said, "looks 
                      like one passed near this bush." 
                    <p> Darter blanched as he rushed over and inspected the hair. 
                      "There is something very wrong here. I never should have 
                      missed that." He looked at his new friends. "What's wrong 
                      with me?" he asked plaintively. "Why can't I track like 
                      I used to?" 
                    <p> Not knowing what to say, Hunta and Volgar shrugged their 
                      shoulders and looked away in embarrassment. 
                    <p> "Tell ye what, Darter," said Huntra, "We'll all track 
                      together and see if your skills come back to you after some 
                      practice. Maybe that lich weakened your abilities in some 
                      way. Time and practice may help you recover them." 
                    <p> "Aye, my friend," said Volgar, "don't give up hope yet." 
                      He gave Darter a friendly slap on the back, nearly propelling 
                      him off the mountain trail into the ravine below. 
                    <p> The hunters moved on, taking their time and searching 
                      for sign. As the day wore on, Darter grew more and more 
                      quiet and withdrawn. 
                    <p> In the early afternoon they found themselves on the edge 
                      of a mountain meadow. They halted at the treeline and thoroughly 
                      inspected the open area. There on the opposite edge, they 
                      spotted a mammoth grazing. 
                    <p> "Dart, ye stay here and make good use of your bow. Volgar 
                      and I will work our way down wind. When you see us charge 
                      the mammoth, let fly with your arrows." Darter nodded grimly 
                      and unslung his bow. 
                    <p> Volgar and Huntra slipped into the forest. Darter grinned 
                      at how quiet they were, in spite of being such big brutes. 
                      He settled back to wait and caught himself worrying over 
                      his lost tracking skills. He almost missed the initial charge 
                      on the mammoth, but noticed in time and let fly with his 
                      arrows. He gasped in dismay as his arrow flew wide of the 
                      mark, almost hitting Volgar instead. He ran closer to the 
                      fray and let fly again. He overshot his mark. Growling in 
                      rage, he broke his bow over a boulder and pulled out his 
                      hunting knife. He charged the mammoth. 
                    <p> Shouting and running, Volgar and Huntra advanced on the 
                      mammoth and jabbed it with their spears. Darter literally 
                      ran up the mammoth's trunk and stabbed it in the eye with 
                      his knife. The mammoth screamed in pain and tossed his mighty 
                      head, sending Darter somersaulting into the meadow. Bellowing 
                      in rage, the mammoth turned and thundered into the forest. 
                      The three hunters gave chase. They managed to flank the 
                      huge creature and herded it over a cliff into the ravine 
                      below. 
                    <p> "Well, " panted Volgar, "there's more'n one way to kill 
                      a mammoth, eh Dart?" Huntra laughed out loud and gave out 
                      a whoop of victory. Everyone smiled in triumph, recovering 
                      their breath and thrilling in the excitement of the hunt. 
                      Then Darter grew somber as he remembered his missed shots. 
                    <p> "I don't understand it. First my tracking, and now my 
                      archery is gone. What am I going to do? I can't be a ranger 
                      without those skills." The elf frowned and turned from the 
                      others, working his way down to the carcass. 
                    <p> Huntra and Volgar looked at each other sadly, then followed 
                      him down. 
                    <p> They spent the night at the kill site, cleaning the carcass 
                      and making a cache so they could come back for what they 
                      couldn't carry with them. That evening Darter sat and stared 
                      into the fire, saying nothing. 
                    <p> The next day they hiked back to their village. As they 
                      approached, Huntra and Volgar yelled and whooped joyfully, 
                      letting their clan mates know their hunt was a success. 
                      The clan chief organized a pack train to fetch the rest 
                      of the kill. He grinned broadly and engulfed the trio in 
                      a great bear hug. "Tonight we celebrate! Tunare must be 
                      thanked for providing us with such a great store of food!" 
                    <p> That evening the entire clan gathered round a huge bonfire, 
                      eating mammoth steaks and drinking Halas heaters. After 
                      the meal, Volgar got up and acted out their hunt for the 
                      enjoyment of the clan. "Then Darter grabbed his hunting 
                      knife and ran right up the mammoth's trunk! He stabbed it 
                      right in the eye!" 
                    <p> "In the eye?" they shouted. 
                    <p> "Aye, in the eye!" Volgar replied. 
                    <p> The barbarians rolled on the ground laughing. Darter beamed 
                      at the clan, a broad smile on his face. 
                    <p> "Someone should write a song about that," said a voice 
                      from the crowd. 
                    <p> "Aye, 'tis a shame we have no bard," Huntra commented. 
                    <p> "Well," said Darter, "I don't claim to be a bard, but 
                      then I haven't been much of a ranger lately, either. But 
                      I can tune a lute and sing ye a song ye might enjoy, if 
                      ye'll bear with me rusty voice." 
                    <p> "Aye, a song, a song!" they all shouted. 
                    <p> "Arvan! Go fetch Darter's lute, and take care ye don't 
                      break it!" the clan chief roared good naturedly. The boy 
                      beamed with pride and ran off to do his chief's bidding. 
                      Before long he returned, carrying the lute as though it 
                      were precious crystal. 
                    <p> "Thankee, me lad." Darter grinned and winked at the boy, 
                      who puffed up his chest and strutted back to his place by 
                      the fire. He then smiled at all the ladies as he tuned the 
                      sapphire blue lute. His eyes sparkled as he sung: 
                    <blockquote> I'm tellin' ye now, dear ladies, sweet ladies
                      <div> Don't make the mistake o' lovin' a bard. 
                        <p> For a bard will ramble an' a bard will roam

                          <div> Aye, a bard will ramble an' a bard will roam

                      </div>
                    </blockquote>
                    Darter grinned broadly and strummed a catchy tune: 
                    <blockquote> Not meanin' ta hurt ye, dear ladies, sweet ladies,
                      <div> But only a fool would fall fer a bard. 
                        <p> 'Cause a bard's gotta ramble an' a bard's gotta roam,
                        <div> No way in this world could a bard stay at home.
                          <div> His fate is to ramble an' his fate is to roam,

                    </blockquote>
                    The barbarians took up the rhythm, clapping and drumming: 
                    <blockquote> Please take my advice, dear ladies, sweet ladies
                      <div> A bard will only play wit' yer heart.

                          <div> Aye, a bard must ramble an' a bard must roam

                    </blockquote>
                    Darter laid his sapphire blue lute to the side and bowed. 
                    The clan clapped and cheered, then went on celebrating deep 
                    into the night. Exhausted and even somewhat content, Darter 
                    finally made his way to his bed. 
                    <p> That night he had a dream. He dreamed that Tunare, the 
                      mother of all, came to him and took him for a walk in the 
                      wilderness. 
                    <p> "Look around you, my child, and tell me what you see." 
                    <p> Darter looked around and replied, "I see trees and animals, 
                      I see the wind blowing the leaves and the rain making circles 
                      in the pond." 
                    <p> "Now tell me, what would you see if there was no wind, 
                      no rain?" 
                    <p> He thought about it for a moment. "Nothing." 
                    <p> Tunare beamed and hugged him. "You are right, for without 
                      the wind and the rain, there would be no life. I want you 
                      to meet someone." She gestured at the storm clouds and the 
                      formless took on shape and substance, descended and stood 
                      before Tunare and 
                    <p> Darter. "Karana, I leave Darter in your charge, guide 
                      him and show him the value of the wandering wind and the 
                      power of the falling rain. Teach him well and show him wisdom." 
                    <p> Karana bowed and smiled. "That I shall m'lady. I will 
                      be with you always, Darter, for I see within you the wandering 
                      spirit. I shall show you the power of lightning, the nurturing 
                      of rain and the strength of wind. Then, someday, ye shall 
                      be as quick as lighting, as gentle as mist, and as swift 
                      as wind. Ye shall wander this world and sow knowledge and 
                      understanding as the wind spreads seeds and sows new life 
                      upon the land." Then Karana did become as mist and rise 
                      back into the rolling clouds. 
                    <p> Tunare guided Darter back to his room and hugged him once 
                      more. "Remember, Darter, without the forces of Karana, my 
                      world would be as barren and lifeless as yon moon. Those 
                      who follow Karana have much to offer this land." 
                    <p> Somehow suddenly shy, Darter hung his head and nodded 
                      silently. When he raised his eyes, Tunare was gone. 
                    <p> The following afternoon (everyone overslept after the 
                      previous night's revelries) Darter gingerly walked around 
                      with an aching head and a thoughtful manner. 
                    <p> Volgar laughed to see Darter in such a state and said, 
                      "I'm thinkin' ya need a little fur of the wolf that bit 
                      ya, my friend, what say we go to an inn I like to visit 
                      now and then?" 
                    <p> Darter shrugged his shoulders and replied, "Why not, can't 
                      be any worse off then I am right now, eh?" 
                    <p> Huntra and Volgar grinned at each other, took him by his 
                      elbows and marched him off along a mountain trail. Soon 
                      they arrived at an out of the way inn, apparently not often 
                      frequented. A sign above the door said Everflowing Keg. 
                    <p> "Mind yer manners, now, Darter, for its not everyone who 
                      is welcome here," said Huntra. 
                    <p> Darter nodded and smiled, a secret sparkle in his eyes. 
                    <p> Volgar burst into the tavern and roared, "Now just where 
                      is the good fer nothin' owner of this rat hole, and why 
                      isn't there an ale in me hand yet?" 
                    <p> Alerik, a fellow barbarian, roared back as he leaped over 
                      the bar and grabbed Volgar, pulling him off his feet, "By 
                      the shadow of Rallos Zek! There must be frost giants at 
                      yer heels, to chase the likes of you into me fair establishment!" 
                      He dropped Volgar and grabbed Huntra, kissing her soundly. 
                      "Aiyee! Ye gets more beautiful every time I see ye, darlin! 
                      When ye gonna sell thisn' and come work for me?" Alerik 
                      jerked a thumb in Volgar's direction and gave Darter a broad 
                      wink. 
                    <p> Huntra laughed heartily and said, "Oh, I guess I'll keep 
                      him for awhile yet!" She began to make introductions. "Alerik, 
                      this is..." 
                    <p> "Darter Elfgard, aye, we've met, and he has made himself 
                      welcome. Why, even that shadow hangin' sourpuss has accepted 
                      his presence summat, heh." Alerik glanced into a dark corner 
                      at Grymm Umbra, the solitary drow. 
                    <p> Huntra and Volgar looked at Darter with raised eyebrows. 
                      "Ye've been here before, have ye?" 
                    <p> "Aye, once, on the night we camped on our way to the frigid 
                      wastes. I needed to clear me thoughts about that smelly 
                      troll, Trukk, and found this place quite by accident." 
                    <p> Volgar said, "Maybe it was an accident, maybe not. I find 
                      very little happens by accident. However that may be, ya 
                      found a good place, and that is truth!" 
                    <p> Alerik led them to a table near the fire and brought them 
                      all a round of drinks. For hours they sat and talked of 
                      adventures they had shared in the past, laughing and joking. 
                      As the night grew on, they bragged more and more of their 
                      prowess with sword and knife. 
                    <p> Up against a far wall was a throwing target, and the barbarians 
                      began a contest to test their range and accuracy. 
                    <p> Alerik turned to Darter and held out the throwing daggers 
                      to him. "Come try yer hand, Darter, let's see what ye can 
                      do!" 
                    <p> Darter shook his head ruefully and tried to decline. "I'm 
                      not much fer thrown weapons, friend Alerik, the bow is my 
                      weapon, or was, until recently." 
                    <p> Alerik urged him on, "Ye never know, lessn ye try, besides, 
                      'tis all in fun." 
                    <p> Darter sighed in resignation and accepted the knives. 
                      Without rising from his seat, he quickly threw the first 
                      knife toward the target. Bullseye. Astonished, he looked 
                      from the target to the knives in his hand, then up at Alerik. 
                    <p> "Aiyee! Was that a lucky shot, or were ye just funnin' 
                      me about not throwing knives?" 
                    <p> "No, really, my friend, I have never made it a practice 
                      to handle thrown weapons! I don't understand..." 
                    <p> "Finish out yer round, Darter, we'll see if it was luck 
                      or talent that was behind the first throw," said Huntra. 
                    <p> Darter threw, then threw again. Bullseye, and bullseye 
                      again. Amazed, he looked at his friends and helplessly shrugged 
                      his shoulders. 
                    <p> A gravelly voice spoke from the shadows. Grymm. "I don't 
                      know what class ye profess to be, but I know what I have 
                      seen with my eyes. And I know what I have heard 
                    <p> with my ears. I have seen your skills and I have heard 
                      your songs. I say ye are worthy of the name....bard. In 
                      my eyes, so shall ye be. Bard." He fell silent. 
                    <p> "Bard, eh?" Darter pondered, half to himself. He thought 
                      back to the past weeks; his loss of his ranger abilities, 
                      Tunare's visit, his bond with Karana, the feelings he saw 
                      reflected in the faces of his listeners when he sang his 
                      songs, his unexplained talents. They all pointed to the 
                      way of the bard. "Ye may be right, friend Grymm, ye may 
                      be right, at that."
