Without going into specifics on how the bug is used, basically, a player can use the interaction between illusions and the mesmerize spell to cause an opponent to be permanently mesmerized. If you play on the PvP Teams servers, you are probably somewhat familiar with this issue.<br><br>The issue that makes the bug possible is deeply woven into the fabric of how illusions work, making it something that cannot be addressed directly. Initial ideas (ruled unacceptable) on how to fix this issue included:<br><br>1. Turning off illusions entirely on the PvP Teams servers.<br>2. Making stun and mez spells invalid in PvP combat.<br>3. Making an illusion cause a team-switch. In other words, if a dark elf cast "Illusion: Human", they would become a human in all senses, able to attack and be attacked by people not on the human team.<br>4. Making an illusion cause a team-switch, but only for the purpose of Mez and Stun spells. This idea would lead to situations where one person could attack someone who couldn't attack them in return. <br><br>The final solution that we've arrived at is the best method that we've thought of to address the issue, and the one that will most likely go live unless someone here can bring something to our attention that we've overlooked. The solution is:<br><br>On PvP Teams servers, casting a *non-beneficial spell* upon another *player-character* will result in any active illusion upon the caster, even illusions that have other effects, being canceled. <br><br>"Illusion" in this case is defined as any spell effect that makes you look like something different than you actually are. This would include all of the enchanter illusions, as well as spells such as treeform, wolf form, the Call of Bones series, and Item-activated illusions such as the Guise of the Deceiver, etc.<br><br>If anyone has any questions or comments on this change, or can think of any issues that make the solution worse than the problem it solves, please post follow-ups in this thread.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br><B><I>Gordon Responds..</i></B><br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>Who in the blazes could possibly write code so hopelessly, helplessly interrelated that an ILLUSION has any effect whatsoever on a MESMERIZE?<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>The teams-server ruleset, devised after release, is actually responsible for the problem, not the illusion and mesmerize itself. This is why the change made will only affect those on the teams servers, and not the servers as a whole, and neither will it affect the standard PvP server RZ. <br><br>The core problem is a mismatch in team assignment understood by the client, and the zone-server that the client is connected to at the time. <br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>What I mean is, say someone is using illusion: Ogre to get around Ferrott, and then they start a fight with an Ogre PC... Their Ogre illusion drops and the next thing you know, a wandering Ogre Bouncer is pounding them into the ground.<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>If the person in Illusion:Ogre were to cast a non-beneficial spell, it would drop the illusion and could possibly, based upon whatever other issues are present, make the enchanter subject to attack by NPCs. However, since the illusion would not drop based upon BEING attacked by the other PC, the person being attacked could certainly try to exit the zone under the cloak of the illusion.<br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>Curious: is cancel magic a beneficial or harmful spell?<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>Cancel-magic would be considered a non-beneficial spell in this case.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>Errr. Maybe i read this wrong or you explained it wrong. when does the illusion drop? If I am the Enchanter with an illusion on and I am casting the *non-beneficial* spell on another player, does it drop then? OR if I am the Enchanter with an illusion on and someone else casts on ME it drops? Which are you refering to?<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>The former. If player A has an illusion up, and player A casts a non-beneficial spell on player B, player A's illusion will drop. However, it will not drop if player A is minding his own business and player B comes along and casts on player A, nor will it drop if player A casts on an NPC.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font><br></blockquote><br></font>  		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem959812320,42372,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Crash Fixes</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Patch_Server_Announcement [ 3:32 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:dhark@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Dhark</a></font><div> Recently put on the Patch Server : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><font color=#a00000><br>We've heard from a couple of sources recently that there are people having problems accessing and playing the game.

The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>*Spells/Songs*<br><br>- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold.  It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it.  This has been corrected.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<br><br>The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only.  The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors.  This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory.  Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary.  We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<br><br>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected.  Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<br><br>The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced.  In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect.  The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<br><br>The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.  They have been adjusted.<br>- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep.  NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<br>- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected.  All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<br>- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<br>- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis.  They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<br>- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<br><br>We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work.  There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones.  <br><br>The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized.  Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk.  Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<br><br>Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons).

That said, there are a couple of specific issues here that I'd like to address: <br><font color="050056"><br>1 - Exp loss from DoT spells <br><br>For months, players killed by a DoT spell would lose experience. Very unfair to those without DoT spells of course. Such an obvious problem surely had to have been tested/known before opening PvP servers. <br><font color=#a00000> <br>This issue was addressed on the PvP servers shortly after TZ and VZ launched. It still exists on the normal servers for PvP people and people who engage in duels. Due to the way DOTs work, changing this aspect beyond its current state is not feasible. <br><font color="050056"><br>2 - DoT casters can't loot victims <br><br>Even to this day, when soemone dies due to DoT, the caster cannot loot that victim. Very unfair to those with DoT as their main form of damage. <br><font color=#a00000><br>This issue is the same problem that causes/caused XP loss due to DOTs. As with the issue above, changing it beyond its current state is not feasible. <br><font color="050056"><br>3 - Exp loss from pet death <br><br>For months, people who were killed by someone's pet would lose exp. Very unfair to those without pets, and to those casters with pets who hated to make that happen but were left with little choice. Surely Verant knew about that problem. <br><font color=#a00000><br>I don't know off the top of my head if this still happens in PvP situations (/duel, guildwar, etc.) on non-PvP servers, but it has been correct on the PvP servers. The exception to this is cases where owner of the pet is LD or under the effect of Fear (cast by an NPC since PCs can fear each other any longer). As with the issues above, addressing these exceptions is not feasible, and we'll consider any cases of intentional abuse a customer-service issue. <br><font color="050056"><br>5 - Charm/Fear taken out of game <br><br>Due to problems that would occur to people who got charmed/feared (such as being treated as an npc and bearing full bore spell damage instead of the nerfed rate, etc etc.), verant simply too charm and fear out of the game. For enchanters, clerics, necros, sk's and others, that was a major blow to their offense. Instead of fixing the game code problems, Verant simply trashed a major component to entire classes. <br><font color=#a00000><br>The nature of these spells made them abusable beyond all repair. People would fear people in dungeons, where they wouldn't break out until in deep an alone causing XP loss. People would charm people and have them attack nasty critters and die, causing XP loss. People would charm people and sit them down next to NPCs that are aggro to the native race of the target, but not to the charmer. When charm broke, the NPC would attack the person who was charmed causing XP loss. People would also keep other people charmed for extended periods of time thus denying their ability to play the game. The only solution that would have allowed these spells to remain in-game would be to eliminate XP loss entirely, which would too drastically change the PvE apsects of the game. <br><font color="050056"><br>6 - Melee v. Caster imbalance <br><br>It didn't take long for people to realize that in general, casters are far superior pvp players to melee players. In a fast-fix attempt to balance, Verant simply reduced all spell caster damage to do only .63% of full damage when used in PvP. Of course, this was very unfair to wizards who only have spell damage for offense, whereas other casters were still left with their other forms of damage, pets, useful spells, etc. <br><font color=#a00000><br>We still believe that this was the best option. Spells were designed to be effective against NPCs, which have many more hitpoints at a given level than PCs do. The change made sense. You'll notice that we also reduced pet damage in PvP at the same time as well. <br><font color="050056"><br>Verant's response? Let's just change one of the race war to coin only and see what happens. No poll, no option to move. Anarchy. Eventually, especially at higher levels, people just wear no-drop items, or trash so it ends up that the loot system basically punishes those who choose not to fight like a cheeseball. <br><font color=#a00000><br>We did a poll. It suggested that the majority of people who were taking part in the discussion supported coin-only loot. However we didn't know whether that population was representative of the whole, which is why we changed one server. I think that the numbers are showing now that more people prefer coin-only loot. However just to be sure, we are still considering allowing people the option to move in the near future. <br><br>- Gordon <br></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044000.html">No drop and lore blues</a></b><br><font color="050056"><blockquote><br>Abashi why aren't popular items like the SMR and Runed Cowl Lore? <br><font color=#a00000><br>The LORE and NODROP tags on items have different effects on the player economy and the farminmg issue. <br><font color=#a00000><br>For instance, NODROP, though created for the purpose of making people complete their own quests, is *very good* at controlling the farming problem. However it's very bad for the player economy, and actually promotes camping, or gives people the feeling that they are required to camp. It also makes things such as looting a persons corpse for them when it's in a bad place impossible. <br><br>LORE, though not as good as NODROP at stopping farming still does does something, making it a bit cumbersome for one character to hold a bunch of items on their own. It's easier on the player economy than NODROP, but still presents some gameplay problems. It also gives people the feeling that they are required to camp because people are less likely to want to trade LORE items since they they have to go back and get another one for themselves. <br><br>Though the absense of both of these tags does present some farming issues, it is by far the best for the player economy, general gameplay, and gives people another reasonable option to acquire something besides camping it themselves. With the implementation of the play-nice policies, as well as the addition of all of the new zones with the expansion, the farming issues are being handled through other means. <br><br>So, to answer your question, we don't want to place the LORE and NODROP tags on items as a matter of course, and would prefer to give each item and situation some serious thought due to the negative consequences of these tags. <br><br>- Gordon 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></font></font></blockquote></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem959143445,11909,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Raid on Crushbone</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>The_Nameless [ 9:44 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font><div> <font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2><blockquote>Argash studied the parchment on his desk, the time for researching his own spells had come. It had been a long hard task but he had finally researched his first spell. To be honest it had been such a simple spell, a summoning of food that would last twenty days, but the failed attempts had often discouraged him. Now that it was done he felt proud of himself,  the world was right again. Laying down the parchment he turned around and stared out the window across the high towers of Erudin. He could almost see the Isle of Kerra from where he stood. High above the fog that lingered across the Toxxulian forest it was a crisp clear day. <br><br>            Looking out he thought back across the previous twenty-four seasons at the events that had shaped his life thus far. It had been a crisp spring day much like this one oh so many years past when word had reached him in Felwithe that his parents had been murdered in Crushbone while under a flag of truce. The evil D&#8217;vinn had invited them there to discuss he supposed surrender of the Crushbone orcs to the Fier&#8217;dal. After that day he had vowed not to rest until that bastard lay dead at his feet. Seasons came and went and finally just six short seasons ago, he had returned to his homeland. <br><br>            He had traveled long and far while gaining knowledge that would lead to that day. He entered Crushbone with one thought on his mind. REVENGE. Many orcs stepped in his path while he strode to the castle and up the tower, each one died before they new what had happened. Upon entering the tower his ever-faithful companion Jobeker began to pummel on the ambassador as Argash began chanting his incantations. With the heat of the sun Argash had smite the flesh and tissue clean off the ambassador&#8217;s bones. Having vanquished his life long foe he had knelt down and wept. <br><br>            Now the Brethren we aiming there sights on the elimination of the Avatar of Fear in Cazic Thule. Many had battles had been fought but as of yet they had not been successful. Deep in thought Argash almost did not hear the quiet nock on the door. &#8220;Enter.&#8221; Argash sat back down as Tluyen entered the room. &#8220;Ahh Tluyen tis good to see thee once more. I trust your journey to the land of Kunark was successful?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Except for the sickness I felt on the boats it was a most worthwhile adventure.&#8221; The bard sat opposite the desk from Argash and hung his head. &#8220;I am afraid though that I come with a heavy heart this day and to speak of matters not of Kunark.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong Tluyen you look rather distressed?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;On my trip back from the lost lands I passed through Kelethin and heard word that D&#8217;Vinn had returned from the dead.&#8221; The smile on Argash&#8217;s face vanished and was replaced by that of sheer horror. &#8220;Thinking that it cannot be so as you yourself slew him I checked it out myself. And indeed I did see him scheming with the orc prophet and Emperor Crush.&#8221;<br><br>            Had he gotten this news some seasons ago Argash would have stormed out of his room in a fit of rage. However having grown wiser over the past few years Argash sat quietly and reflected upon the news trying to think of the best course of action. Soon a plan began to form in his head. &#8220;Tluyen is that Tier&#8217;dal still downstairs awaiting the councils decision?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;I believe so. I think she was playing with Belrich&#8217;s wolves and there cubs. Why?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;I must speak with the Magistrate and the Avatar.&#8221; Standing up Argash donned his new red and yellow robe and tied the blue sash around it. &#8220;Thank you Tluyen for all the information. I would like you to leave Odus in the morning and gather all the Brethren under twenty seasons as well as anyone else you think can help and meet me in Kelethin three days hence.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Aye Wordmaster it shall be as you ask.&#8221; Bowing his head. They both left the room. Tluyen headed right and down the stairs to pack for his journey. Argash headed left and went down the hall to the stairwell at the end and went up. He had heard the sweet sound of her flute earlier so he knew her to be in her rooms practicing.<br><br>            Several hours later Argash was back in his room quickly scribing some notes. &#8220;Jobeker I have a task for you,&#8221; The huge mound of floating soil glided towards his master. &#8220;Take this note to the Tier&#8217;dal lady down in the gardens. You shall find her playing with Belrich&#8217;s wolf cubs.&#8221; The mound of earth carefully took hold of the note and silently glided out the door and down the hall to the stairs.<br><br>            Several minutes later a meek nock was heard at the door. &#8220;Enter&#8221; Calendria the Tier&#8217;dal seeking entrance to the Brethren stepped into the room and closed the door. &#8220;Please have a seat Calendria.&#8221; She sat lightly on the chair across from his desk with her hands timidly resting on her knees.<br><br>            &#8220;Do you know why I have called you here?&#8221; She knew full well of this mans past and knew that if anyone of the Brethren had reason to hate the Tier&#8217;dal it was he. She suspected that his hatred toward her kind burned hotter then the sun.<br><br>            She replied, &#8220;I am assuming it pertains to my application to join the Brethren. Furthermore I suspect that as out of all the Brethren you have the most reason to oppose my request that the Avatar wished you to speak with me and gain your opinion.&#8221;<br><br>            Argash stared at her hard in the eyes. True had he been less seasoned he would have vanquished her on the spot. But Tunare had taught him tolerance in all things and that before one could decide if another was truly an enemy to be killed one must first consider the deeds and actions of the person not that of their family&#8217;s history. &#8220;You are most wise to have discerned that however tis not all the exactly like you have ascertained. Up till now I have abstained from the debate over your entrance do to my personal feelings of the Tier&#8217;dal and my past. I did not want the anger of my past to cloud my judgment and as I trust Avatar in all things I figured it would be best if I just watched from a distance and let the Avatar and the Council make the decision.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Now I assume that since you are aware of my past you also know that six seasons ago I traveled to Crushbone and slew the foul beast D&#8217;Vinn who slaughtered not only my parents but yours as well from what I understand.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;I had heard that he was dead but I did not know that it was you. I thank you then for I had not yet been able to return and do so myself.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Yes well it appears as if now you will have your chance. I have received a report from on of our bards that the Necromancers and Clerics of Neriak have combined their forces and restored the dead ambassador to the living. My spies in Neriak have informed me that since I had left his heart intact when I left the tower that is how they were able to revive him.&#8221; A brief smile creased his lips &#8220;I hear though that the burn marks will remain for quite some time.&#8221; <br><br>            &#8220;Now I have spoken with the Avatar and she has agreed with my proposal. As of earlier in the day the younger members of the guild have begun packing for the journey to Fedwar. Three days from now we shall enter the city of the Crushbone orcs and lay waste to the foul beasts that dwell there. You will accompany us for your quest to join the guild will come to a point here. Your one and only task will be to defeat the Ambassador in one on one combat. Jobeker and I shall keep the Emperor and his guards from interfering with you duel. When and if you are victorious you must then rip out his heart and burn it in the presence of the Avatar and myself.&#8221; <br><br>            Argash stood up and began to search for something on his desk. Eventually he found a piece of parchment and after making sure it had everything on it he handed the parchment over to her. &#8220;These are your orders, We leave in the morning I suggest you go start packing.&#8221;<br><br> <br><br>OOC:<br><br> <br><br>This event is being sponsord by the Brethren of the Mystic dawn.

In other words, if we've designed a dungeon to be 35-45, the majority of the people in there are 45+.

These are the people who typically build one character up to max then turn around and build another. For them, the leveling is the "fun" that the game provides. I just got an email today from a gentleman who has 4 character over 50th level, and I would guess that he falls in this playstyle.<br><br>Other playstyles do exist. <br><br>For instance, a common playstyle is the guy who hates to level, but wants to be as powerful as possible, so powers up his character to max and then goes off to have "fun". These are the people who have one high-level, maybe a low-to-mid level secondary, and primarily play their high-level character. <br><br>There are other people for whom the concepts of leveling and power are only a secondary part of the game. They play first to have fun and worry not about maximizing their XP acquisition rate. What this type of gamer and the one above find "fun" are often the same thing, however the one above doesn't begin to have this fun until the character is maxed. We typically don't know what level these people are as they rarely talk about it, and if queried, usually have a higher p-time to level ratio than the other types. <br><br>So, to recap, if I had to place labels on each type of gamer:<br><br>1. The Powerleveler (Leveling is fun)<br>2. The ???? (having trouble coming up with a label) (Doesn't like leveling, thinks adventuring, socializing, and exploration is fun, but can't have that fun until the character is maxed.)<br>3. The Social Gamer (Is not concerned with leveling, and thinks adventuring, socializing, and exploration is fun).<br><br>Note: Let's not confuse this with "The Roleplayer" which really isn't a playstyle in this regard. Most roleplayers would fall under #3, but I have met many 1s and 2s as well. Also, the playstyles aren't firm, but more of a scale that wraps back to #1 after #3. Players do fall in between the different numbers. In addition, there are a couple other less common playstyles, such as the Experimenter, who has a bunch of characters, low-to-mid level. <br><br>Giving levels 51-60 a steep experience requirement should increase enjoyment for those close to a #1, would not affect those close to a #3, and I can see how it might make things difficult for those who tend towards #2. Our assumptions would be that there are more people who have tendencies towards #1 than #2.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br><b> Humor..

On April 24th, I will be hosting an event<br>for the E'ci server. The gathering will take place in East Commons by the Ro Tunnel. The time will be 7pm CST. The purpose of this event is to encourage others to host similar events on our server since they seem to be lacking. It also allows newbies to meet other newbies and group for experience. There will be many events such as a scavenger hunt, mini-quests for prizes, drinking, a bazaar, and just a general good time away from evercamping.  Buffs, heals and binds will be given freely. Be on the look out for various surprises too. Following the festivities a dungeon raid on Befallen will occur, preferrably for lvls 9 and up. We will need experienced Befallen players to help lead the raid and take leadership of the various groups. The first 30 or so players that are gathered will attempt to eradicate Befallen of its evil minions. Ports will be offered from various places throughout Norrath. It would be very nice if we could get some ports going from Kunark and allow our fellow Iksar brothers to attend.  I am asking the higher lvl Wizards and Druids to give free teleports to the event in order to make this successful. So bring your drinks, possessions and your party hats and lets have a good time!!<br><br>Please refer to the Everlore E'ci message board thread <a href="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/Forum25/HTML/000206.html">"Let's Get an Event on E'ci"</a>.<br><br>Dharkbaine Draagenborne <Keepers of the Shadows><br>Level 21 Troll Shaman of E'ci<br></blockquote><br></font> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958929505,137,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EverQuest Express Issue 125</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 10:18 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font><div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>EverQuest Express Issue 125 is now available.

For instance, it is possible that 50 boogeymen could spawn, just as it's possible that zero could, but on average it is usually a given number.<br><br>For the purpose of raising the spawn percentages for the frightfingers, we reduced the percentages of Phoboplasms (which can drop any of about 8 different class-inspecific items), not boogeymen. <br><br>-Gordon<br> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></font></blockquote></font></font></div></div></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958772874,11435,"></a> <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 	    <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 	    <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>	 		<td bgcolor=030034 width=98%><table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%> 			<tr> 				<td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Friday [ May 19 ]</b></font></td> 			</tr> 		</table></td> 	</tr> </table>   <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>The Past and Future Merge</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Rodcet_Nife [ 2:47 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font><div> This in from Stephen LaBuda<br><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Wedding on Rodcet.<br> <br>You see a Half-Elf sitting  on a boulder inside what is knows as Hill Giant Alley. He seems to be pondering the moment, watching the action of the adventures that try and quell the Hill Giant Infestation of the Rathe Mountains.  Several adventurers sitting nearby surround him. His name is Kiko, Kiko Trueheart, Druid of the 42nd Acorn.  He looks up and Begins to speak to these friends that are gathered.<br><br>I spent a lot of Time here, probably a little too much in some peoples eyes.  But I do dislike dungeons so, and Tunare&#8217;s Work still needs to be done here. I have gained many Acorns here, and I am going to tell you one of them now.<br><br>I walked with the Dragon since I began my adventures in the World. We sought out the the entity that brought together all the races of Norrath to challenge the injustice of  that have been dealt to us by our Gods. During this time I met many other adventurers. One particular was a beautiful young wood elf Druid named Winneda. For some reason her friends call her &#8220;Pooh&#8221;. Well we were mainly casual acquaintances and grouped against Giants on occasion, or rid the land of the One Eye Menace as well. For the most part is was merely a shout across the zone, as when she entered the area the cries of all her followers come out. And for the most part a friendly Kiko! And Winne! Was exchanged across the air.<br><br>One day it happened, my heart grew old and tired with the plight of the Dragon and I went to seek adventure alone, and find myself. I happened upon Winne and we began to talk. Amazing how things work out, she took me on adventures to the newly discovered lands of Kunark.  Countless hours were spent exploring the Dreadlands and Firiona Vie. We became close in the sense that you must in a land like Kunark. I remember a voice coming to me saying I should marry Winne. I was shocked and brushed it off. But the More I thought about it the more I realized that we were truly soul mates. My Love had come to me a long time ago and I had finally just realized it. <br><br>Together we brought out a new found Union as well. The Manifest Ascension and my friends in the Elemental Dragon decided to decided to combine forces and so it was. A great merger to bring to opposite ideas together. This Combination has brought me great happiness.  It is wonderful to have family built of so many great people, and such grande ideas.<br><br>Well I finally got the nerve. In Greater Faydark at the Wizard Spires, I kneeled down in front of Winne and asked her to be my Bride. Many great warriors and Sorcerers surrounded us. When Winne accepted it was the happiest day of my life. The sorcerers and Warriors cheered and cast their Magics through the Trees of the faydark, and a great celebration ensued.<br><br>So my friends, it is set, ON the day of Saturday the 20th, at noon (Pacific Time) in West commonlands. Not far from the Druid teleport stops, I will wed my Beloved Winneda. She will be my wife and together we will live out our lives here in Norrath, on the world of Rodcet Nife.  Come one, come all and celebrate with us.  <br></blockquote><br></font><br>Thanks 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958702523,23213,"></a> <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 	    <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 	    <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>	 		<td bgcolor=030034 width=98%><table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%> 			<tr> 				<td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Thursday [ May 18 ]</b></font></td> 			</tr> 		</table></td> 	</tr> </table>   <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>The Tunar Priest of Discord Must Die!</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 7:15 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:spiritus@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Spiritus Mundi</a></font><div> <font color="050056" face="new times roman" size="2"><br><BLOCKQUOTE>Hail Citizens of Norrath! <br>The guild of the Guardians of Discord, a PvP only guild residing on the <br>Tunare server has finally decided to change it's path and follow the ways of <br>Order.

I went to E3 (Entertainment Expo) last week and I obtained some interesting information about the Level 51-58 Spell Drop from a High level EQ Production Manager. <br> <br>Q: I and several thousands of people are wondering thru message boards and extensive contacts on friends on Xegony Server and other servers on why spell Level 51-58 spells are not dropping.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> They are dropping, you have go find and hunt for them.</font><br> <br>Q: How come with all 200,000 people playing?  Not one person has found the spells.  That is a large percentage of people not finding the spells not a small vocal minority.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> The spells are dropping in certain zones, you have to go to the zones and kill the monsters.  I know many people who have ALL the 51-58 spells already,  You just have to look in the right zone.   City of Mist, Skyfire, Sebilis.</font><br> <br>Q: It is interesting, you have been showing us many Kunark zones and many places where I know I will not be inside for a while, you have killed hundreds of monsters (Using GM mode and access to weapons and spells that players will not have access to)  and I have not seen a spell drop that you have destroy or looted.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> The spells are there!  You just have to look for the spells.</font><br> <br>The whole time I was watching him hitting the monster up to 400 damage per hand, casting almost any spell for players, GM's and Gods.  He was running thru many zones hacking and slashing everything quick as if I took my Level 36 Warrior fully tweak and buff in Blackburrow.  He showing me most of the best zones and who are the Master Boss in each area or zone.<br> <br>Q: I know Kunark and Star Wars has bought you a lot of media attention, I know releasing Kunark was a labor intensive and time consuming with all the problems of with shipping?  Is it possible that you overlook the spell drop issue.  It can be a simple mistake, people overlook.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> Again, Spells are dropping.  (others have ask) Now, this is how the spells are dropping.   (His explanation) Take a zone like City of Mist, when Kunark 1st open, there is a 0 percent chance for spell drop at 1st.  But once almost every mob is killed in the zone, there is a 1 percent drop.  As each time the zone get cleared or killed, the percentage of spell drop increases and stop at a certain point.</font><br> <br>Then he started to Answer other questions.<br> <br>Interesting!  My Point of View.<br> <br>What is this sounds like to me is that every time we clear or killed all or most of the mobs in a certain zone at least once not counting the same mob over and over as in the zone entrance, the spell drop percentage increases 0%, 1%, 2%. 3%.... X%, maybe 10 or even as high as 25%.   <br>Example: Highkeep and only Pickclaws in the basement. <br> <br>E.G. There is 15 spawn location, every time we killed all the pickclaws, fairly common occurrence in Highkeep, we get percentage increase on a spell drop.  For zones size of City of Mist and Sebilis, that a lot killing of mobs throughout the zone.  Just wondering,  there are several classes who need level 51-58 spells, so we are competing between for spells drops among several classes then among several people in the same class.<br> <br>This conversation was on Saturday, 13th around 10:45 Pac Time.<br> <br>After all this, I read this on <A HREF="http://www.Graffe.com" Target="_blank">Graffe</a> A Site for Wizard of Norrath.<br> <br>Following two Quote are from <A HREF="http://www.Graffe.com" Target="_blank">Graffe</a> Wizard Site:<br><br><font color=#a00000>Well I got some time late Wednesday and went into an area that is supposed to be pretty-well saturated with the new spells, whacked about 250 critters, and didn't find any spells. So I'm not completely convinced that they are dropping correctly any longer. <br><br>I'll get back with you. <br><br>-Gordon <br><br>Then he posted this a bit later:<br><br>Monday is probably the soonest we'll see some action on this. Everyone who can fix it is up at E3 looking after our booth. I'm trying to find out now if the correct data is on the servers but just not activated. If that's the case, we could probably fix it before then. <br><br>-Gordon</font><br><br>By the Way, For those who want to know what is E3.  E3 is a convention or show held in Los Angeles similar to CES, Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas.  The main purpose is to display all new games and future games coming to a PC, Mac, Sony, Nintendo, Sega Dreamcast, and Xbox.  You see games months and years in advance.

Your Iksar should no longer sound like humans.<br>- Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane will no longer be natively KOS to the outpost in the Overthere.  Take care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.<br>- Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear.  Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. <br>- Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have been addressed.  Some guards that should not have been buffed have been fixed.  In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible.  The level of those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them.<br>- Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of completion and reward.<br><br>*Item Updates*<br><br>- Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout.<br>- Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back.  It was showing as a 2H sword when equipped.<br>- The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact.  This has been corrected.<br>- Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor.  It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots.<br>- The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be worn to activate its effect.<br>- Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon. <br>- The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.<br>- The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.<br>- The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small sack, now looks as intended.<br>- Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon.

A hearty thanks go to all of the nominees. However, there can only be one. Congratulations go to Prince Regent Darmendrax Thex, the first Regent of Neriak. <br> <br>From Darmendrax-<br><BLOCKQUOTE><i> <br>I would hope that many people who walk these halls recognises my name, and knows me as a Teir'Dal of character and integrity. Any others might wish to answer to me as to why not. <br>It is my intention to take the helm of our new government, to stand at the head of our proud peoples to repel the tides of the pales of Norrath, and take the fight to their very gates. And I am willing to prove my battling talents against my rival would-be leaders, Zaknifien, Lethoric and Zhantric. <br><br>I would consider myself articulate and intelligent, qualities that one would only expect from a Teir'Dal prince. I know diplomacy when it is necessary, and when the only answer is a bag of platinum in the hands of a trusted assassin. I have allies all over the world, contacts and servants as well. I look at the human, troll and ogre citizens of Neriak, and acknowledge their interests beside that of the Teir'Dal. <br><br>Our Lord Innoruuk watches over me, and as a Knight of his most blessed darkness, I wield his magicks ... deadly as my sword, possessed with his spiteful strength. My black heart pulses with a passion for rage, rancor and revenge. Baptized in his burning gaze at birth, his favour follows me like a dark shroud across the lands I travel. <br><br>Additionally, I have been a long standing officer in my guild, House DeVir, and possess all of the experience and responsibility that entails. I am always prepared to speak to or aid my brothers and sisters, no matter age or station. And my family name, my very blood, was destined to watch over our fair lands from the dawn of time to the grim and bloody sunset of this world. <br><br>The law is known to me, and while I shall always treasure the advice of those behind me, my council of advocates, when an iron fist is called for I shall not be found wanting. We are not a people of charity, pity and mercy. Nor are we given to the pleasantries of the light races. But our politics cannot be insular, lest we turn to in-fighting and chaos to the benefit of our foes. Methinks I shall ensure we do not follow this path. And who would be a finer princess than the lovely, malicious Lady Mordwyn? Neriak needs a ruler not only strong and blessed of the Father, but wise and canny in the ways of Norrath too. <br><br>I am ready for my task. <br><br>Darmendrax Thex<br></i></BLOCKQUOTE><br>Collective of Old Fennin<br><a href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro" target="_blank">http://www.sok.org/fenninro</a><br></blockquote><br></font><br> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958434078,42979,"></a> <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 	    <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 	    <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>	 		<td bgcolor=030034 width=98%><table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%> 			<tr> 				<td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Monday [ May 15 ]</b></font></td> 			</tr> 		</table></td> 	</tr> </table>   <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Norrathian Senate Meeting</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Cazic_Thule [ 4:41 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font><div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Greetings all,<br><br>    I have been doing much thinking as to the workings of The Norrathian Senate of the Cazic-Thule Server as of late and I have made some very important conclusions.

No doubt some (hopefully not released by us:) will lack that "certain something" that makes EQ great. <br><br>In the end it is the players that choose the direction that the genre goes.

Couldn't it stand to reason, that at some point, the dark elves would form an alliance with the Iksar.

Plus, I only have a basic familiarity with a few classes and how they work. So what I'd really like, is for those of you out there who know which end of the sword goes in the enemy, to lend me a hand.<br> <br>I'm looking for maybe three or four smallish (Around or under 500 words) guides to PvP combat, for each class. (Warrior, Druid, Shadowknight, etc) These should include tips and tactics on how each should best deal with the various other types of opponent (Healer, Tank, Caster, etc) and how to cope in a variety of situations, (Ambush(Either end of), Duel, 1 on 1, 1 on 2 or Pets, group PvP, etc)<br> <br>I'm not so much interested in what Verant should do for the Warrior or the Wizard so much, but more how best to use what each class has as things are now. I'd ideally like something to cover different level ranges too; I imagine a level nine Monk fights quite differently to a level forty-nine Monk. Some variety here would be useful too, allowing for a Beginners Guide and a Masterclass for each, perhaps.<br> <br>I'm not interested in motives either, it doesn't matter if you're a PK, Anti-PK or whatever; as long as you are good at PvP, I'd love to hear from you.

Without going into specifics on how the bug is used, basically, a player can use the interaction between illusions and the mesmerize spell to cause an opponent to be permanently mesmerized. If you play on the PvP Teams servers, you are probably somewhat familiar with this issue.<br><br>The issue that makes the bug possible is deeply woven into the fabric of how illusions work, making it something that cannot be addressed directly. Initial ideas (ruled unacceptable) on how to fix this issue included:<br><br>1. Turning off illusions entirely on the PvP Teams servers.<br>2. Making stun and mez spells invalid in PvP combat.<br>3. Making an illusion cause a team-switch. In other words, if a dark elf cast "Illusion: Human", they would become a human in all senses, able to attack and be attacked by people not on the human team.<br>4. Making an illusion cause a team-switch, but only for the purpose of Mez and Stun spells. This idea would lead to situations where one person could attack someone who couldn't attack them in return. <br><br>The final solution that we've arrived at is the best method that we've thought of to address the issue, and the one that will most likely go live unless someone here can bring something to our attention that we've overlooked. The solution is:<br><br>On PvP Teams servers, casting a *non-beneficial spell* upon another *player-character* will result in any active illusion upon the caster, even illusions that have other effects, being canceled. <br><br>"Illusion" in this case is defined as any spell effect that makes you look like something different than you actually are. This would include all of the enchanter illusions, as well as spells such as treeform, wolf form, the Call of Bones series, and Item-activated illusions such as the Guise of the Deceiver, etc.<br><br>If anyone has any questions or comments on this change, or can think of any issues that make the solution worse than the problem it solves, please post follow-ups in this thread.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br><B><I>Gordon Responds..</i></B><br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>Who in the blazes could possibly write code so hopelessly, helplessly interrelated that an ILLUSION has any effect whatsoever on a MESMERIZE?<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>The teams-server ruleset, devised after release, is actually responsible for the problem, not the illusion and mesmerize itself. This is why the change made will only affect those on the teams servers, and not the servers as a whole, and neither will it affect the standard PvP server RZ. <br><br>The core problem is a mismatch in team assignment understood by the client, and the zone-server that the client is connected to at the time. <br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>What I mean is, say someone is using illusion: Ogre to get around Ferrott, and then they start a fight with an Ogre PC... Their Ogre illusion drops and the next thing you know, a wandering Ogre Bouncer is pounding them into the ground.<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>If the person in Illusion:Ogre were to cast a non-beneficial spell, it would drop the illusion and could possibly, based upon whatever other issues are present, make the enchanter subject to attack by NPCs. However, since the illusion would not drop based upon BEING attacked by the other PC, the person being attacked could certainly try to exit the zone under the cloak of the illusion.<br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>Curious: is cancel magic a beneficial or harmful spell?<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>Cancel-magic would be considered a non-beneficial spell in this case.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font><FONT color=#050056><br>>>>Errr. Maybe i read this wrong or you explained it wrong. when does the illusion drop? If I am the Enchanter with an illusion on and I am casting the *non-beneficial* spell on another player, does it drop then? OR if I am the Enchanter with an illusion on and someone else casts on ME it drops? Which are you refering to?<br></font><FONT color=#a00000><br>The former. If player A has an illusion up, and player A casts a non-beneficial spell on player B, player A's illusion will drop. However, it will not drop if player A is minding his own business and player B comes along and casts on player A, nor will it drop if player A casts on an NPC.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br></font><br></blockquote><br></font>  		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem959812320,42372,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Crash Fixes</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Patch_Server_Announcement [ 3:32 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:dhark@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Dhark</a></font><div> Recently put on the Patch Server : <br><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><font color=#a00000><br>We've heard from a couple of sources recently that there are people having problems accessing and playing the game.

The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br><br>*Spells/Songs*<br><br>- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold.  It now appropriately saves versus magic.<br>- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it.  This has been corrected.<br><br>*Items*<br><br>The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<br><br>The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only.  The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors.  This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory.  Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary.  We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<br><br>A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected.  Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<br><br>The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced.  In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect.  The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<br><br>The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br><br>*General Changes*<br><br>- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.  They have been adjusted.<br>- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep.  NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<br>- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<br>- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected.  All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<br>- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<br>- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<br>- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<br>- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis.  They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<br>- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<br><br>We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work.  There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones.  <br><br>The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized.  Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk.  Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<br><br>Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons).

That said, there are a couple of specific issues here that I'd like to address: <br><font color="050056"><br>1 - Exp loss from DoT spells <br><br>For months, players killed by a DoT spell would lose experience. Very unfair to those without DoT spells of course. Such an obvious problem surely had to have been tested/known before opening PvP servers. <br><font color=#a00000> <br>This issue was addressed on the PvP servers shortly after TZ and VZ launched. It still exists on the normal servers for PvP people and people who engage in duels. Due to the way DOTs work, changing this aspect beyond its current state is not feasible. <br><font color="050056"><br>2 - DoT casters can't loot victims <br><br>Even to this day, when soemone dies due to DoT, the caster cannot loot that victim. Very unfair to those with DoT as their main form of damage. <br><font color=#a00000><br>This issue is the same problem that causes/caused XP loss due to DOTs. As with the issue above, changing it beyond its current state is not feasible. <br><font color="050056"><br>3 - Exp loss from pet death <br><br>For months, people who were killed by someone's pet would lose exp. Very unfair to those without pets, and to those casters with pets who hated to make that happen but were left with little choice. Surely Verant knew about that problem. <br><font color=#a00000><br>I don't know off the top of my head if this still happens in PvP situations (/duel, guildwar, etc.) on non-PvP servers, but it has been correct on the PvP servers. The exception to this is cases where owner of the pet is LD or under the effect of Fear (cast by an NPC since PCs can fear each other any longer). As with the issues above, addressing these exceptions is not feasible, and we'll consider any cases of intentional abuse a customer-service issue. <br><font color="050056"><br>5 - Charm/Fear taken out of game <br><br>Due to problems that would occur to people who got charmed/feared (such as being treated as an npc and bearing full bore spell damage instead of the nerfed rate, etc etc.), verant simply too charm and fear out of the game. For enchanters, clerics, necros, sk's and others, that was a major blow to their offense. Instead of fixing the game code problems, Verant simply trashed a major component to entire classes. <br><font color=#a00000><br>The nature of these spells made them abusable beyond all repair. People would fear people in dungeons, where they wouldn't break out until in deep an alone causing XP loss. People would charm people and have them attack nasty critters and die, causing XP loss. People would charm people and sit them down next to NPCs that are aggro to the native race of the target, but not to the charmer. When charm broke, the NPC would attack the person who was charmed causing XP loss. People would also keep other people charmed for extended periods of time thus denying their ability to play the game. The only solution that would have allowed these spells to remain in-game would be to eliminate XP loss entirely, which would too drastically change the PvE apsects of the game. <br><font color="050056"><br>6 - Melee v. Caster imbalance <br><br>It didn't take long for people to realize that in general, casters are far superior pvp players to melee players. In a fast-fix attempt to balance, Verant simply reduced all spell caster damage to do only .63% of full damage when used in PvP. Of course, this was very unfair to wizards who only have spell damage for offense, whereas other casters were still left with their other forms of damage, pets, useful spells, etc. <br><font color=#a00000><br>We still believe that this was the best option. Spells were designed to be effective against NPCs, which have many more hitpoints at a given level than PCs do. The change made sense. You'll notice that we also reduced pet damage in PvP at the same time as well. <br><font color="050056"><br>Verant's response? Let's just change one of the race war to coin only and see what happens. No poll, no option to move. Anarchy. Eventually, especially at higher levels, people just wear no-drop items, or trash so it ends up that the loot system basically punishes those who choose not to fight like a cheeseball. <br><font color=#a00000><br>We did a poll. It suggested that the majority of people who were taking part in the discussion supported coin-only loot. However we didn't know whether that population was representative of the whole, which is why we changed one server. I think that the numbers are showing now that more people prefer coin-only loot. However just to be sure, we are still considering allowing people the option to move in the near future. <br><br>- Gordon <br></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><font color="050056"><font color=#a00000><br><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/044000.html">No drop and lore blues</a></b><br><font color="050056"><blockquote><br>Abashi why aren't popular items like the SMR and Runed Cowl Lore? <br><font color=#a00000><br>The LORE and NODROP tags on items have different effects on the player economy and the farminmg issue. <br><font color=#a00000><br>For instance, NODROP, though created for the purpose of making people complete their own quests, is *very good* at controlling the farming problem. However it's very bad for the player economy, and actually promotes camping, or gives people the feeling that they are required to camp. It also makes things such as looting a persons corpse for them when it's in a bad place impossible. <br><br>LORE, though not as good as NODROP at stopping farming still does does something, making it a bit cumbersome for one character to hold a bunch of items on their own. It's easier on the player economy than NODROP, but still presents some gameplay problems. It also gives people the feeling that they are required to camp because people are less likely to want to trade LORE items since they they have to go back and get another one for themselves. <br><br>Though the absense of both of these tags does present some farming issues, it is by far the best for the player economy, general gameplay, and gives people another reasonable option to acquire something besides camping it themselves. With the implementation of the play-nice policies, as well as the addition of all of the new zones with the expansion, the farming issues are being handled through other means. <br><br>So, to answer your question, we don't want to place the LORE and NODROP tags on items as a matter of course, and would prefer to give each item and situation some serious thought due to the negative consequences of these tags. <br><br>- Gordon 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></font></font></blockquote></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem959143445,11909,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Raid on Crushbone</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>The_Nameless [ 9:44 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font><div> <font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2><blockquote>Argash studied the parchment on his desk, the time for researching his own spells had come. It had been a long hard task but he had finally researched his first spell. To be honest it had been such a simple spell, a summoning of food that would last twenty days, but the failed attempts had often discouraged him. Now that it was done he felt proud of himself,  the world was right again. Laying down the parchment he turned around and stared out the window across the high towers of Erudin. He could almost see the Isle of Kerra from where he stood. High above the fog that lingered across the Toxxulian forest it was a crisp clear day. <br><br>            Looking out he thought back across the previous twenty-four seasons at the events that had shaped his life thus far. It had been a crisp spring day much like this one oh so many years past when word had reached him in Felwithe that his parents had been murdered in Crushbone while under a flag of truce. The evil D&#8217;vinn had invited them there to discuss he supposed surrender of the Crushbone orcs to the Fier&#8217;dal. After that day he had vowed not to rest until that bastard lay dead at his feet. Seasons came and went and finally just six short seasons ago, he had returned to his homeland. <br><br>            He had traveled long and far while gaining knowledge that would lead to that day. He entered Crushbone with one thought on his mind. REVENGE. Many orcs stepped in his path while he strode to the castle and up the tower, each one died before they new what had happened. Upon entering the tower his ever-faithful companion Jobeker began to pummel on the ambassador as Argash began chanting his incantations. With the heat of the sun Argash had smite the flesh and tissue clean off the ambassador&#8217;s bones. Having vanquished his life long foe he had knelt down and wept. <br><br>            Now the Brethren we aiming there sights on the elimination of the Avatar of Fear in Cazic Thule. Many had battles had been fought but as of yet they had not been successful. Deep in thought Argash almost did not hear the quiet nock on the door. &#8220;Enter.&#8221; Argash sat back down as Tluyen entered the room. &#8220;Ahh Tluyen tis good to see thee once more. I trust your journey to the land of Kunark was successful?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Except for the sickness I felt on the boats it was a most worthwhile adventure.&#8221; The bard sat opposite the desk from Argash and hung his head. &#8220;I am afraid though that I come with a heavy heart this day and to speak of matters not of Kunark.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong Tluyen you look rather distressed?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;On my trip back from the lost lands I passed through Kelethin and heard word that D&#8217;Vinn had returned from the dead.&#8221; The smile on Argash&#8217;s face vanished and was replaced by that of sheer horror. &#8220;Thinking that it cannot be so as you yourself slew him I checked it out myself. And indeed I did see him scheming with the orc prophet and Emperor Crush.&#8221;<br><br>            Had he gotten this news some seasons ago Argash would have stormed out of his room in a fit of rage. However having grown wiser over the past few years Argash sat quietly and reflected upon the news trying to think of the best course of action. Soon a plan began to form in his head. &#8220;Tluyen is that Tier&#8217;dal still downstairs awaiting the councils decision?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;I believe so. I think she was playing with Belrich&#8217;s wolves and there cubs. Why?&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;I must speak with the Magistrate and the Avatar.&#8221; Standing up Argash donned his new red and yellow robe and tied the blue sash around it. &#8220;Thank you Tluyen for all the information. I would like you to leave Odus in the morning and gather all the Brethren under twenty seasons as well as anyone else you think can help and meet me in Kelethin three days hence.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Aye Wordmaster it shall be as you ask.&#8221; Bowing his head. They both left the room. Tluyen headed right and down the stairs to pack for his journey. Argash headed left and went down the hall to the stairwell at the end and went up. He had heard the sweet sound of her flute earlier so he knew her to be in her rooms practicing.<br><br>            Several hours later Argash was back in his room quickly scribing some notes. &#8220;Jobeker I have a task for you,&#8221; The huge mound of floating soil glided towards his master. &#8220;Take this note to the Tier&#8217;dal lady down in the gardens. You shall find her playing with Belrich&#8217;s wolf cubs.&#8221; The mound of earth carefully took hold of the note and silently glided out the door and down the hall to the stairs.<br><br>            Several minutes later a meek nock was heard at the door. &#8220;Enter&#8221; Calendria the Tier&#8217;dal seeking entrance to the Brethren stepped into the room and closed the door. &#8220;Please have a seat Calendria.&#8221; She sat lightly on the chair across from his desk with her hands timidly resting on her knees.<br><br>            &#8220;Do you know why I have called you here?&#8221; She knew full well of this mans past and knew that if anyone of the Brethren had reason to hate the Tier&#8217;dal it was he. She suspected that his hatred toward her kind burned hotter then the sun.<br><br>            She replied, &#8220;I am assuming it pertains to my application to join the Brethren. Furthermore I suspect that as out of all the Brethren you have the most reason to oppose my request that the Avatar wished you to speak with me and gain your opinion.&#8221;<br><br>            Argash stared at her hard in the eyes. True had he been less seasoned he would have vanquished her on the spot. But Tunare had taught him tolerance in all things and that before one could decide if another was truly an enemy to be killed one must first consider the deeds and actions of the person not that of their family&#8217;s history. &#8220;You are most wise to have discerned that however tis not all the exactly like you have ascertained. Up till now I have abstained from the debate over your entrance do to my personal feelings of the Tier&#8217;dal and my past. I did not want the anger of my past to cloud my judgment and as I trust Avatar in all things I figured it would be best if I just watched from a distance and let the Avatar and the Council make the decision.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Now I assume that since you are aware of my past you also know that six seasons ago I traveled to Crushbone and slew the foul beast D&#8217;Vinn who slaughtered not only my parents but yours as well from what I understand.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;I had heard that he was dead but I did not know that it was you. I thank you then for I had not yet been able to return and do so myself.&#8221;<br><br>            &#8220;Yes well it appears as if now you will have your chance. I have received a report from on of our bards that the Necromancers and Clerics of Neriak have combined their forces and restored the dead ambassador to the living. My spies in Neriak have informed me that since I had left his heart intact when I left the tower that is how they were able to revive him.&#8221; A brief smile creased his lips &#8220;I hear though that the burn marks will remain for quite some time.&#8221; <br><br>            &#8220;Now I have spoken with the Avatar and she has agreed with my proposal. As of earlier in the day the younger members of the guild have begun packing for the journey to Fedwar. Three days from now we shall enter the city of the Crushbone orcs and lay waste to the foul beasts that dwell there. You will accompany us for your quest to join the guild will come to a point here. Your one and only task will be to defeat the Ambassador in one on one combat. Jobeker and I shall keep the Emperor and his guards from interfering with you duel. When and if you are victorious you must then rip out his heart and burn it in the presence of the Avatar and myself.&#8221; <br><br>            Argash stood up and began to search for something on his desk. Eventually he found a piece of parchment and after making sure it had everything on it he handed the parchment over to her. &#8220;These are your orders, We leave in the morning I suggest you go start packing.&#8221;<br><br> <br><br>OOC:<br><br> <br><br>This event is being sponsord by the Brethren of the Mystic dawn.

In other words, if we've designed a dungeon to be 35-45, the majority of the people in there are 45+.

These are the people who typically build one character up to max then turn around and build another. For them, the leveling is the "fun" that the game provides. I just got an email today from a gentleman who has 4 character over 50th level, and I would guess that he falls in this playstyle.<br><br>Other playstyles do exist. <br><br>For instance, a common playstyle is the guy who hates to level, but wants to be as powerful as possible, so powers up his character to max and then goes off to have "fun". These are the people who have one high-level, maybe a low-to-mid level secondary, and primarily play their high-level character. <br><br>There are other people for whom the concepts of leveling and power are only a secondary part of the game. They play first to have fun and worry not about maximizing their XP acquisition rate. What this type of gamer and the one above find "fun" are often the same thing, however the one above doesn't begin to have this fun until the character is maxed. We typically don't know what level these people are as they rarely talk about it, and if queried, usually have a higher p-time to level ratio than the other types. <br><br>So, to recap, if I had to place labels on each type of gamer:<br><br>1. The Powerleveler (Leveling is fun)<br>2. The ???? (having trouble coming up with a label) (Doesn't like leveling, thinks adventuring, socializing, and exploration is fun, but can't have that fun until the character is maxed.)<br>3. The Social Gamer (Is not concerned with leveling, and thinks adventuring, socializing, and exploration is fun).<br><br>Note: Let's not confuse this with "The Roleplayer" which really isn't a playstyle in this regard. Most roleplayers would fall under #3, but I have met many 1s and 2s as well. Also, the playstyles aren't firm, but more of a scale that wraps back to #1 after #3. Players do fall in between the different numbers. In addition, there are a couple other less common playstyles, such as the Experimenter, who has a bunch of characters, low-to-mid level. <br><br>Giving levels 51-60 a steep experience requirement should increase enjoyment for those close to a #1, would not affect those close to a #3, and I can see how it might make things difficult for those who tend towards #2. Our assumptions would be that there are more people who have tendencies towards #1 than #2.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br><b> Humor..

On April 24th, I will be hosting an event<br>for the E'ci server. The gathering will take place in East Commons by the Ro Tunnel. The time will be 7pm CST. The purpose of this event is to encourage others to host similar events on our server since they seem to be lacking. It also allows newbies to meet other newbies and group for experience. There will be many events such as a scavenger hunt, mini-quests for prizes, drinking, a bazaar, and just a general good time away from evercamping.  Buffs, heals and binds will be given freely. Be on the look out for various surprises too. Following the festivities a dungeon raid on Befallen will occur, preferrably for lvls 9 and up. We will need experienced Befallen players to help lead the raid and take leadership of the various groups. The first 30 or so players that are gathered will attempt to eradicate Befallen of its evil minions. Ports will be offered from various places throughout Norrath. It would be very nice if we could get some ports going from Kunark and allow our fellow Iksar brothers to attend.  I am asking the higher lvl Wizards and Druids to give free teleports to the event in order to make this successful. So bring your drinks, possessions and your party hats and lets have a good time!!<br><br>Please refer to the Everlore E'ci message board thread <a href="http://www.everlore.com/boards/EL/Forum25/HTML/000206.html">"Let's Get an Event on E'ci"</a>.<br><br>Dharkbaine Draagenborne <Keepers of the Shadows><br>Level 21 Troll Shaman of E'ci<br></blockquote><br></font> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958929505,137,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EverQuest Express Issue 125</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 10:18 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font><div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>EverQuest Express Issue 125 is now available.

He seems to be pondering the moment, watching the action of the adventures that try and quell the Hill Giant Infestation of the Rathe Mountains.  Several adventurers sitting nearby surround him. His name is Kiko, Kiko Trueheart, Druid of the 42nd Acorn.  He looks up and Begins to speak to these friends that are gathered.<br><br>I spent a lot of Time here, probably a little too much in some peoples eyes.  But I do dislike dungeons so, and Tunare&#8217;s Work still needs to be done here. I have gained many Acorns here, and I am going to tell you one of them now.<br><br>I walked with the Dragon since I began my adventures in the World. We sought out the the entity that brought together all the races of Norrath to challenge the injustice of  that have been dealt to us by our Gods. During this time I met many other adventurers. One particular was a beautiful young wood elf Druid named Winneda. For some reason her friends call her &#8220;Pooh&#8221;. Well we were mainly casual acquaintances and grouped against Giants on occasion, or rid the land of the One Eye Menace as well. For the most part is was merely a shout across the zone, as when she entered the area the cries of all her followers come out. And for the most part a friendly Kiko! And Winne! Was exchanged across the air.<br><br>One day it happened, my heart grew old and tired with the plight of the Dragon and I went to seek adventure alone, and find myself. I happened upon Winne and we began to talk. Amazing how things work out, she took me on adventures to the newly discovered lands of Kunark.  Countless hours were spent exploring the Dreadlands and Firiona Vie. We became close in the sense that you must in a land like Kunark. I remember a voice coming to me saying I should marry Winne. I was shocked and brushed it off. But the More I thought about it the more I realized that we were truly soul mates. My Love had come to me a long time ago and I had finally just realized it. <br><br>Together we brought out a new found Union as well. The Manifest Ascension and my friends in the Elemental Dragon decided to decided to combine forces and so it was. A great merger to bring to opposite ideas together. This Combination has brought me great happiness.  It is wonderful to have family built of so many great people, and such grande ideas.<br><br>Well I finally got the nerve. In Greater Faydark at the Wizard Spires, I kneeled down in front of Winne and asked her to be my Bride. Many great warriors and Sorcerers surrounded us. When Winne accepted it was the happiest day of my life. The sorcerers and Warriors cheered and cast their Magics through the Trees of the faydark, and a great celebration ensued.<br><br>So my friends, it is set, ON the day of Saturday the 20th, at noon (Pacific Time) in West commonlands. Not far from the Druid teleport stops, I will wed my Beloved Winneda. She will be my wife and together we will live out our lives here in Norrath, on the world of Rodcet Nife.  Come one, come all and celebrate with us.  <br></blockquote><br></font><br>Thanks 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958702523,23213,"></a> <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 	    <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 	    <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>	 		<td bgcolor=030034 width=98%><table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%> 			<tr> 				<td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Thursday [ May 18 ]</b></font></td> 			</tr> 		</table></td> 	</tr> </table>   <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>The Tunar Priest of Discord Must Die!</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 7:15 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:spiritus@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Spiritus Mundi</a></font><div> <font color="050056" face="new times roman" size="2"><br><BLOCKQUOTE>Hail Citizens of Norrath! <br>The guild of the Guardians of Discord, a PvP only guild residing on the <br>Tunare server has finally decided to change it's path and follow the ways of <br>Order.

I went to E3 (Entertainment Expo) last week and I obtained some interesting information about the Level 51-58 Spell Drop from a High level EQ Production Manager. <br> <br>Q: I and several thousands of people are wondering thru message boards and extensive contacts on friends on Xegony Server and other servers on why spell Level 51-58 spells are not dropping.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> They are dropping, you have go find and hunt for them.</font><br> <br>Q: How come with all 200,000 people playing?  Not one person has found the spells.  That is a large percentage of people not finding the spells not a small vocal minority.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> The spells are dropping in certain zones, you have to go to the zones and kill the monsters.  I know many people who have ALL the 51-58 spells already,  You just have to look in the right zone.   City of Mist, Skyfire, Sebilis.</font><br> <br>Q: It is interesting, you have been showing us many Kunark zones and many places where I know I will not be inside for a while, you have killed hundreds of monsters (Using GM mode and access to weapons and spells that players will not have access to)  and I have not seen a spell drop that you have destroy or looted.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> The spells are there!  You just have to look for the spells.</font><br> <br>The whole time I was watching him hitting the monster up to 400 damage per hand, casting almost any spell for players, GM's and Gods.  He was running thru many zones hacking and slashing everything quick as if I took my Level 36 Warrior fully tweak and buff in Blackburrow.  He showing me most of the best zones and who are the Master Boss in each area or zone.<br> <br>Q: I know Kunark and Star Wars has bought you a lot of media attention, I know releasing Kunark was a labor intensive and time consuming with all the problems of with shipping?  Is it possible that you overlook the spell drop issue.  It can be a simple mistake, people overlook.<br> <br>A:<font color=#a00000> Again, Spells are dropping.  (others have ask) Now, this is how the spells are dropping.   (His explanation) Take a zone like City of Mist, when Kunark 1st open, there is a 0 percent chance for spell drop at 1st.  But once almost every mob is killed in the zone, there is a 1 percent drop.  As each time the zone get cleared or killed, the percentage of spell drop increases and stop at a certain point.</font><br> <br>Then he started to Answer other questions.<br> <br>Interesting!  My Point of View.<br> <br>What is this sounds like to me is that every time we clear or killed all or most of the mobs in a certain zone at least once not counting the same mob over and over as in the zone entrance, the spell drop percentage increases 0%, 1%, 2%. 3%.... X%, maybe 10 or even as high as 25%.   <br>Example: Highkeep and only Pickclaws in the basement. <br> <br>E.G. There is 15 spawn location, every time we killed all the pickclaws, fairly common occurrence in Highkeep, we get percentage increase on a spell drop.  For zones size of City of Mist and Sebilis, that a lot killing of mobs throughout the zone.  Just wondering,  there are several classes who need level 51-58 spells, so we are competing between for spells drops among several classes then among several people in the same class.<br> <br>This conversation was on Saturday, 13th around 10:45 Pac Time.<br> <br>After all this, I read this on <A HREF="http://www.Graffe.com" Target="_blank">Graffe</a> A Site for Wizard of Norrath.<br> <br>Following two Quote are from <A HREF="http://www.Graffe.com" Target="_blank">Graffe</a> Wizard Site:<br><br><font color=#a00000>Well I got some time late Wednesday and went into an area that is supposed to be pretty-well saturated with the new spells, whacked about 250 critters, and didn't find any spells. So I'm not completely convinced that they are dropping correctly any longer. <br><br>I'll get back with you. <br><br>-Gordon <br><br>Then he posted this a bit later:<br><br>Monday is probably the soonest we'll see some action on this. Everyone who can fix it is up at E3 looking after our booth. I'm trying to find out now if the correct data is on the servers but just not activated. If that's the case, we could probably fix it before then. <br><br>-Gordon</font><br><br>By the Way, For those who want to know what is E3.  E3 is a convention or show held in Los Angeles similar to CES, Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas.  The main purpose is to display all new games and future games coming to a PC, Mac, Sony, Nintendo, Sega Dreamcast, and Xbox.  You see games months and years in advance.

Your Iksar should no longer sound like humans.<br>- Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane will no longer be natively KOS to the outpost in the Overthere.  Take care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.<br>- Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear.  Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. <br>- Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have been addressed.  Some guards that should not have been buffed have been fixed.  In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible.  The level of those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them.<br>- Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of completion and reward.<br><br>*Item Updates*<br><br>- Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout.<br>- Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back.  It was showing as a 2H sword when equipped.<br>- The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact.  This has been corrected.<br>- Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor.  It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots.<br>- The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be worn to activate its effect.<br>- Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon. <br>- The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.<br>- The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.<br>- The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small sack, now looks as intended.<br>- Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon.

A hearty thanks go to all of the nominees. However, there can only be one. Congratulations go to Prince Regent Darmendrax Thex, the first Regent of Neriak. <br> <br>From Darmendrax-<br><BLOCKQUOTE><i> <br>I would hope that many people who walk these halls recognises my name, and knows me as a Teir'Dal of character and integrity. Any others might wish to answer to me as to why not. <br>It is my intention to take the helm of our new government, to stand at the head of our proud peoples to repel the tides of the pales of Norrath, and take the fight to their very gates. And I am willing to prove my battling talents against my rival would-be leaders, Zaknifien, Lethoric and Zhantric. <br><br>I would consider myself articulate and intelligent, qualities that one would only expect from a Teir'Dal prince. I know diplomacy when it is necessary, and when the only answer is a bag of platinum in the hands of a trusted assassin. I have allies all over the world, contacts and servants as well. I look at the human, troll and ogre citizens of Neriak, and acknowledge their interests beside that of the Teir'Dal. <br><br>Our Lord Innoruuk watches over me, and as a Knight of his most blessed darkness, I wield his magicks ... deadly as my sword, possessed with his spiteful strength. My black heart pulses with a passion for rage, rancor and revenge. Baptized in his burning gaze at birth, his favour follows me like a dark shroud across the lands I travel. <br><br>Additionally, I have been a long standing officer in my guild, House DeVir, and possess all of the experience and responsibility that entails. I am always prepared to speak to or aid my brothers and sisters, no matter age or station. And my family name, my very blood, was destined to watch over our fair lands from the dawn of time to the grim and bloody sunset of this world. <br><br>The law is known to me, and while I shall always treasure the advice of those behind me, my council of advocates, when an iron fist is called for I shall not be found wanting. We are not a people of charity, pity and mercy. Nor are we given to the pleasantries of the light races. But our politics cannot be insular, lest we turn to in-fighting and chaos to the benefit of our foes. Methinks I shall ensure we do not follow this path. And who would be a finer princess than the lovely, malicious Lady Mordwyn? Neriak needs a ruler not only strong and blessed of the Father, but wise and canny in the ways of Norrath too. <br><br>I am ready for my task. <br><br>Darmendrax Thex<br></i></BLOCKQUOTE><br>Collective of Old Fennin<br><a href="http://www.sok.org/fenninro" target="_blank">http://www.sok.org/fenninro</a><br></blockquote><br></font><br> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem958434078,42979,"></a> <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 	    <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 	    <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>	 		<td bgcolor=030034 width=98%><table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%> 			<tr> 				<td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Monday [ May 15 ]</b></font></td> 			</tr> 		</table></td> 	</tr> </table>   <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Norrathian Senate Meeting</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Cazic_Thule [ 4:41 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font><div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Greetings all,<br><br>    I have been doing much thinking as to the workings of The Norrathian Senate of the Cazic-Thule Server as of late and I have made some very important conclusions.

No doubt some (hopefully not released by us:) will lack that "certain something" that makes EQ great. <br><br>In the end it is the players that choose the direction that the genre goes.

Couldn't it stand to reason, that at some point, the dark elves would form an alliance with the Iksar.

Plus, I only have a basic familiarity with a few classes and how they work. So what I'd really like, is for those of you out there who know which end of the sword goes in the enemy, to lend me a hand.<br> <br>I'm looking for maybe three or four smallish (Around or under 500 words) guides to PvP combat, for each class. (Warrior, Druid, Shadowknight, etc) These should include tips and tactics on how each should best deal with the various other types of opponent (Healer, Tank, Caster, etc) and how to cope in a variety of situations, (Ambush(Either end of), Duel, 1 on 1, 1 on 2 or Pets, group PvP, etc)<br> <br>I'm not so much interested in what Verant should do for the Warrior or the Wizard so much, but more how best to use what each class has as things are now. I'd ideally like something to cover different level ranges too; I imagine a level nine Monk fights quite differently to a level forty-nine Monk. Some variety here would be useful too, allowing for a Beginners Guide and a Masterclass for each, perhaps.<br> <br>I'm not interested in motives either, it doesn't matter if you're a PK, Anti-PK or whatever; as long as you are good at PvP, I'd love to hear from you.

I come here to inform you all of a great saga just begone. The saga began one night hence as I traveled through West Freeport, I happened apon a small band of my fellow Atani at the Theatre who sat quitely listening to a man named Hicor, so being the curious mage I am, I to stopped to listen to the Hicor's tale. He spoke of his friend Nyplid, who on the very day of his wedding had been manhandled and spirited away. Nicor told of how he had investigated Nyplid's disapearence. His investigation had of course begone were Nyplid had last been seen and soon came to believe that the dark races of Norrath may of had something to do with Nyplid's disapearence. Though he found no strong clues he did find a note posted in one of the local taverns that spoke of a Shadow from another realm. The Shadow could not come into our realm nor could he take a person from this realm to his. Yet the Shadow had followers here in Norrath, ones of the dark races. Two of which the names are known, Drodak a Troll and Androdameia a Shdowknight. Turning up know other clues, Nicor decided to investagate the sewers of Freeport as it is rumored that the dark races inhabit them at times. Nicor said he began his search in the sewers and came apon a Darkelf, but though questions many times the Darkelf only ignored Nicor. After more investigation of the sewers he had come apon a piece of tatered cloth, the cloth had strange symbols as some sort of writing. He himself could not translate it to the fullest yet know that the cloth had something to do with the Shadow.<br><br>We had all sat quitely listening to the occurance of poor Nyplid's kidnapping and of the search for him when Hicor asked that who among us would help to locate Nyplid and return him safely home. Out of the Atani that were assembled there four responed I being one of them. The others were Granaut A dwarven cleric who liked his ale, Nacacia a halfelf rogue, whos bueaty hides her deadly skills, and lastly Lowelf a druid, a blessing to know. After the four agreed to help, Hicor handed me the tatered cloth and told us to seek out a friend in Felwithe named Delcaraa, but that she might be hard to see as her mother was sick and that she had left her post as Cleric for the fireworks company Kaboom to tend to her, but we might seek out Cahboom who also worked for the comapny and he might aid us to find Delacaraa. Hicor did warn us not to let Cahboom see the Cloth as he would destroy it, why I am not sure. Hicor then left after thanking us for the help we offered. The four of us sat a moment and talking about what to do I, Nacacia and Granaut decided to set sail on the next boat that left for Faydwer. Lowelf decided he would go alone, as most druid seem to be loners most of the time, but he would keep us informed if he found out anything. We arrived shortly at Faydwer and headed to Felwithe, at the great wizard spires we meet the Gnome Kahboom who was interested in hiring our dwarven cleric friend as a replacement for Delcaraa until she could return to work, of which Granaut agreed, "so if by chance you are in Faydwer and here a loud boom know that Dwarven ale and fireworks do not mix well." After talking to Cahboom he agreed to lead us to were Delcaraa lived, apon ariving and introducing our selves she asked that the others leave and of course I asked that Cahboom leave as well so that we could talk in private, but unknown to Delcaraa, Nacacia had used your stealth to sneak back in. I then took out the tatered cloth from my backpack and showed it to Delacaraa, she stood back in amazment. Asked if she might have the cloth to investigate it. I agreed, she took the cloth and said that it would take at least a week before she could tell me more of what it was and perhaps how it fit into Nyplids disapearence. We left her to her studies "I was thankful to get rid of that piece of cloth if made me fell very uneasy holding on to it." <br><br>Knowing how well my drawven friend likes his ale we decided to head to the local tavern in Felwithe for a few rounds and some discussion of the events.

It cancles there high level tugurs/slow spells. Since when can a level 5 spell cancle a level 40+ or higher spell out. So basially since most groups i get in either have a shaman or enchanter in them ill never be able to use this weapon. Well there is the off chance that I might just go out soloing with it (not).

Floating above that is a red glowing orb, similar to those found on the other statues around the zone, just much larger. Again, like those other orbs, touching the orb slows it down and eventually stops it. I have no idea what this achives. I am but one man, and could not stop all the orbs at once. An air of magic surrounds the orbs though, so I feel they may have something to do with the door to Veeshans Peak..the door I have been blessed to touch. <br><br>At the actual front of the "gateway" stand two, sometimes three, Guardian Wurms. I'm only of the 20th season, so have no idea how powerful they are, but research suggests that they are, EACH, as powerful as Nagafen or Vox themselves. Indeed all those who have seen them from afar were scared to approach. This did not phase me <br>however, and I managed to sneak past them. I stood before a door of Wurm sized proportions. Apon the door was a red symbol that I could not hope to decifer. I have included many sketches, however poor, of what I saw. While I looked around theplace I noticed a few firepots..they do not seem to do anything. <br><br>The door itself is strange compared to any other I have seen in Norrath. You cannot open it from anywhere but DIRECTLY in the <br>middle. A side step to the left or right, and you cant get a grip on the door. As a assassin, I tried to picklock the door, to no avail. The key required must be somewhere else, or perhaps the orbs are part of the key..Veeshan knows. <br><br>After spending some time in the cave, I was visited by a GM named Darmell. He wished to congratulate me for managing to get here, especially considering my age. Who knows, perhaps, perhaps, I am the first to touch these fine doors. I shall now spend much of my life no doubt trying to unravel the mysteries I have found today, hopefully by sharing my knowlage it shall allow others to find a way of opening these doors. <br><br>And that was how, I, Cyriex Callidus, became known as Cyriex Callidus the Wurmshadow"<br><br>Cyriex Callidus<br>20th Rogue<br><br></blockquote></font><br>Yeeaaaa.. you just go on in there.

This is intentional, and is not a bug. It's also necessary for the political environment of Kunark to make sense, and our stance on it is firm. There are consequences, the importance of which each person has to decide for themselves, for killing everything that moves.<br><br>We're not forcing anyone to fight anywhere, or to stay out of any particular zone. Like all faction issues, it is your choice whether or not that faction is important to you. This is the same choice that players of good alignments had to make when deciding whether or not to kill things that give them bad faction. It's a personal choice. Being KOS in the evil outpost does not put the spells that are available there out of your reach. You certainly have the ability to have someone else, who is not KOS there, complete the quests for you. Evil races are KOS throughout Faydwer as it is, and people get along fairly well there. Kunark is not meant to be an encapsulated environment that people never leave. We expect people to have to go back to the mainland from time to time to get supplies and such. If you make yourself KOS to the outpost, there are other ways for you to get into Kunark without going through it.<br><br>So just to summarize, the factions are intentional. I suggest that everyone consider their options carefully before making a decision on how to tackle the continent.<br><br>-Gordon<br> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></font></blockquote></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem957491785,12476,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>VBS/LoveLetter.worm Alert!</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1>EverQuest_Stratics_Announcement [ 6:56 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font><div> Quoted from <A HREF=http://www.mcafee.com>McAfee.com</a>:<br><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><blockquote><br>VBS/LoveLetter.worm is a dangerous VBScript worm, discovered 5/4/00. <br><br>**UPDATE**: Two new variants were discovered at 3:00 pm today, 5/4/00.

I have been bored the the server lately, so I am organizing an event. Heres how it works:<br> <br>Drunken Race through Kelethin ( I don't know if it's been done, but sounds cool). Everyone will pay 1pp to enter the race at the Newbie lift. They will then run to the Druid guild all the way by the bank. Everyone must consume 10 drinks of alcohol, or until they can't drink anymore. (SOWs ARE ILLEGAL IN THIS, AS WITH ANYOTHER SPEED SONG) Everyone will then run as fast as they can and try and get to the Guild. The winner gets 50% of the entry fees, 2nd place gets 25%, and 3rd Gets 15%. Also, If you die on the way, (by unknown reasons) you are out of the race. When We get to the Guild we can all do what ever, trade have some fun, or do what ever. Anyone can join, any race, class, level. If you want in, come join us. The event will be held on Saturday the 6th of May. Meet me at the Newbie lift there, we will start at approximetely 1pm EST. Hope to see you there.<br></blockquote><br></font> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div></div></div></font></td> 	</tr> </table> <a name="newsitem957300132,45547,"></a>  <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Kunark on CNN</b></font><div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 1:42 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font><div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>Found this link under "Computing" on the main CNN website just now<br>(<a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_blank">www.cnn.com</a>):<br><br><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/05/02/everquest.idg/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/05/02/everquest.idg/index.html</a><br><br>It is entitled "EverQuest shows its staying power with Ruins of Kunark" It heralds RoK and gives a briefer for people looking into the game or new to it as an Iksar.

It really isn't about relative power compared to another class, nor would we claim that that relative power is meant to be fixed from levels 1 to 60. <br>Offensive power is only one equation in determining "balance". Other factors are usefulness to a group, and special skills or abilities. For instance, though a wizard's teleporting capability does not at all affect their offensive efficiency, it does contribute to other factors of "balance". A bard gives up much offensive prowess in exchange for being a very desirable member of a group. <br><br>By "compelling reason", we mean that one class does not invalidate another. For instance, the monk can do more offensive damage at a give level than any warrior. Now, if they had the hitpoints of a warrior, could wear their armor, and carry as much weight, then there would be no compelling reason to play a warrior other than roleplay. The monks weakness opens the door for another class to be viable.<br><br>Now any time I speak about "compelling reasons", posts on the board follow along the lines of "Just what is the 'compelling reason' to play a [insert class here]." All I can say in all of these cases is that "compelling" is in the eyes of the beholder, and I would encourage everyone to find that out on their own. Our opinions might differ from yours, but we believe that there are compelling reasons to play every class in the game, which is why we consider them balanced.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font></blockquote><font color=#a00000><br></font><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037560.html" target="_blank">Expansion Spells</a><br><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>>>>Aside from the ones that you can buy from Kunark vendors, where are these new spells?

I only say this .. I spent 12 hours online on Saturday .. my mana used to regen to three bubbles in around 4 minutes and to full in 7-7.5 ( with a wisdom of 181 ) .. on saturday however it seemed that I regained my mana at a lowered pace .. getting 3 bubbles in 8 minutes and back to full in about 11 or 12 .. was the formula adjusted or am I just hallucinating from spending to much time in Kunark?<br><font color=#a00000><br>There has been no intentional change, however due to the number of people reporting it I'm not ready to dismiss it just yet. However, I highly suspect that the observations are due to a number of things, not related to the actual rate. For instance:<br>1. Perception: Mana above level 50 continues to increase at a rate much like it was before, however the mana regen rate does not increase on the same curve, giving the perception that it takes longer to med, even though you are still getting the same amount of mana back per tick. This is something that people also notice and claim as they level up or gain +INT/WIS/MANA items. They increase the amount of mana that they have without increasing the regen rate in a linear manner. <br><br>2. Watched Pot: The addition of Kunark has caused people to spread out more. The net result of this is that the ratio of people to targets has improved. Where a group used to be at full mana the next time it was their "turn" to kill a particular spawn, they are now staring at their mana bars while a surplus of critters walk by that they could be killing. <br><br><br>3. Placebo Effect: The "Placebo effect" also causes the "Watched Pot". Someone, perhaps due to one of the reasons mentioned above, perceives that the mana regen rate has changed, and comments on it. This causes other people to become sensitive to the issue, causing them to pay close attention to their mana bars, giving the impression that it is taking longer to regen.<br><br>4. Of course there is always the good old fashioned "bug", which shouldn't take too long for us to figure out as soon as I can corner the programmers  I'm looking into it this afternoon.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font></blockquote><font color=#a00000><br></font><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037687.html" target="_blank">Snake Kicks???</a><br><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>>>>Why do snakes kick?<br><font color=#a00000><br>The skills that NPCs have are based on level and class, not on the model that they use.

Of the 40 threads at the time that I'm writing this:<br>13 are complaining about rogues<br>2 about rangers<br>2 about paladins<br>1 about wizards<br>1 about magicians<br>1 about druids<br>1 about enchanters<br>1 about necros<br><br>That's over half of the posts on the first page that basically consist of "My class isn't balanced, isn't powerful enough, isn't desired in groups, can't do something some other class can." or something along those lines. The other 18 posts are perhaps issues that we'd like to answer, but people constantly bumping the class-envy posts keeps pushing them down. That isn't fair to the people who have issues that we can and are willing to address or do something about. <br><br>I'm very sorry if we haven't been able to give everyone the answer that they are looking for in regards to their class, but being as clear as possible, notwithstanding current planned and announced enhancements, we consider all classes to be essentially well-balanced at this time. This means that we feel that there is a compelling reason to play each class beyond the desire to roleplay. It does not mean that every class is equivalent in offensive power, desirability to a group, or has some unique special skill or ability, just that there are tangible reasons someone might choose to play your class.<br><br>I don't wish to get involved in the unending recursive arguments that surround class-envy posts any longer (e.g. Explain how we are balanced, what is the compelling reason to play us, etc). This is all meant to be part of the discovery process in the game. Part of the process where everyone finds out what character class suits them. We can&#8217;t tell you what you should like about your class, and if there is no other way to convince to you like your class other than to start handing out enhancements, then we may be at an impasse.<br><br>If you wish to keep discussing these issues on our boards, it&#8217;s perfectly fine. We&#8217;ll read them and we may respond to some issues raised from time to time providing that the content is respectful and the answer would be of benefit to players as a whole, but we won&#8217;t feel compelled to answer class-envy posts regardless how many people comment in them. We&#8217;ll close the threads when they hit between 300-400 posts, and if the number of threads reach spam proportions (like the 13 rogue posts on the first page), we&#8217;ll start closing them before that. <br><br>It is not at all our intention to suppress anyone&#8217;s ability to discuss these issues, but we want to be sure that people with issues that we can address, and that we&#8217;d like to address, have priority on the boards. <br><br>Thank you for understanding, and I do intend to follow up on this thread today if content allows.<br><br>-Gordon<br></font></blockquote><font color=#a00000><br></font><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037846.html" target="_blank">Dual Wield Level Damage Bonus</a><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br><blockquote><br>>>>Is there any reason why for melees who dual weild, the level damage bonus is only calculated on your primary hand?<br><font color=#a00000><br>That's just the way that it was set up for balance reasons.
