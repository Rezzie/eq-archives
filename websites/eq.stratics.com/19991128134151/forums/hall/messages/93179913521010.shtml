   Fairly well put.  Here's my reply. <p>>The word of God, the Bible are basic truths<p>   Only to those who submit to the religious dogma of your particural doctrine.<p>>Why if your a politician, trying to change the >bible, why not change the 10 commandments?<p>   Because most religions contain an equivelent "Basic moral code" designed to prevent too much disorder.  There is no need for a politician to question the right to kill.  Furthermore, most of those morals are basically ingrained in the species ; From India to Japan to Jeruselum.<p>>And the words are not hateful nor from the word >of man. Its so pathetic that the little demons >in this world try to twist the TRUTH.<p>   And they've been doing it to the bible for thousands of years - Therefore, it is no longer "The TRUTH".<p>>Twist the words all YOU want, but the text >explains how we should live our lives quite >clearly. I do not follow all the rules set down, >its impossible.<p>   I didn't change the words.  Ambitious politicians masquerading as men of faith have done it for me all throughout the middle ages.  There's more Rome in Christianity then there was Christianity in Rome.<p><br>>Ignorance is bliss. So is the reader who thinks >the words of the bible have been twisted.<p>    Ignorance is bliss ; And this can be said for any sort of dogmatic religious structure.<p>>So it is not immoral to kill a man? So it is not >immoral to have sex with another man...although >were not made for it at all? So it is not >immoral to steal?<p>   We were not made to live in cities, have religion, or eat meat, but we do it anyways.  Furthermore, I think it's ridiculous to lump murder, theft, and homosexuality in as one issue.  Christian religion does not have the monopoly on right and wrong in this world, reguardless of what claims are made.  One more distinction - I would not consider it amoral to a kill a man who assaulted my family, would you?<p><br>>This is a game yes, and is not the place for >little children to see same sex marriages, >homosexuality, racial hatred, swearing, constant >banter about this or that. Its not the place for >any of it, but if I want to put my views down Im >scorned. <p>    Not at all, sir.  You've been questioned : Not scorned.  I think it's better that children see the world for what it is and are given the tools to make good decisions.  When you hide a truth from a child, they react to it and a confused and immature manner when the stumble across it in the real world.  This game is for adults as well ; The fact is, gay men and women exist in this world.  Nothing anyone does will get rid of them.  Better that our children have a cultured, real idea of who they are and what they're about then a sheltered, confused, and possibly prejudiced or hateful idea.<p>>Sorry but this game has nothing to do with >marriage, sex or racial hate. Its a game. Your >last comment should include the news they put up >today.<p>   Sorry, I don't read the news here :) It's a role-playing game, where people create personas to use.  That means they WILL include aspects of human life - Relationships, marriage, and if they want, sex.  That's what role-playing is all about - Enacting the character.<p>>Real life moral death squad? Sorry but I do see >a major problem with young people seeing same >sex marriages/homosexuality in this game. <p>   Yes, but that's irrelevent.  What is relevant is weather or not the aforementioned young people's parents have a problem with it.<p>>One last thing, which is not opinion but fact. <p>>The bible is the longest lasting text >ever "translated" by man. Prophets, in direct >contat with God wrote the bible. It is his word, >whether people like it or not.<p>   That is unsubtantiated opinion ; Like it or not.  Where is your basis for this "Fact"? Where is your hard proof? Nevermind : I'm not here to debate your belief in your religion - But I will say, reguardless of what YOU think, I don't have to believe that.  As a matter of fact, no one does.  What you believe does not determine the moral code for everyone else - That's the ultimate point.<p>Chance<br>
