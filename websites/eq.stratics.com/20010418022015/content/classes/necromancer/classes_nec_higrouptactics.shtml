                  Necromancers, after all the changes made (most especially the 
                  pet weapon delay "fix", noted with derision by most mages and 
                  necros as a 'nerf') what are our strategies now? This is purely 
                  my own personal opinion, how *I* play, I'm sure that there could 
                  be any number of improvements but this method of play means 
                  I am alive and gaining experience. Necromancers have (or are 
                  about to) gained and lost several old strategies and gained 
                  new ones, both when grouping and when soloing. I won't list 
                  "we used to" items, merely what we can effectively do now.<br>

                      excellent at countering the effects of Pact of Shadow and 
                      Mana Creation DOTs. Basically you should always have this 
                      effect up--remember, if there is another necromancer (you 
                      are 45 and he is 49) you can only have ONE of these doing 
                      damage (though you will both get life) so let the higher-level

                      is not a priority you are doing something wrong or are in 
                      a relatively "risk-free" zone. Basically you should always

                      to the party: 540 damage in 30 seconds. NOTE: Now you know 
                      *exactly* when your spell has worn off. Use this knowledge 
                      wisely! </font>

                      In a group environment, this is your secondary offensive 
                      spell. Be careful when you use it, it REALLY makes them 
                      mad (STR, AC are lowered, and it does 540 DD over 60 seconds) 
                      which can get you dead in a hurry. Note it is *very* similar 
                      to IB in terms of damage/mana ratio, so I see many necromancers 
                      use IB instead. Don't make the same mistake! You are *not* 
                      a burner. Even our primary feeding ground (Lower Guk) our 
                      anti-undead spells take 1-2 bubbles of mana to kill one 
                      mob, same in our secondary feeding ground (OOT) as we can 
                      not effectively do enough DD quickly enough with IB (long 
                      recast delay) nor can we survive ANY mobs "anger" at us 
                      for trying to kill them so quickly no one can pull them 
                      off us without doing quite a bit of burning themselves, 
                      in effect saving us by putting themselves at risk. This 
                      effectively excludes most melee types from the short list 
                      of people that can immediately pull a mob off of us and 
                      onto themselves. </font>

                      Death:</b> This spell makes your pet far more effective. 
                      Keep it up--I did some checking, and only SLTW (49 ench 
                      spell, high mana cost with a high recast time as it wears 
                      off quickly) can do what this does--don't ask anyone else 
                      to speed buff your pet for you. Soon this will not wear 
                      off every other fight so it need not always be memmed. </font>

                      of Shadow:</b> An excellent spell, this slowly heals a PC 
                      or a pet for 350 damage over 30 seconds or so, being able 
                      to cast it every 12 seconds means for 10 mana you can really 
                      pump out the healing. Of course, it takes this healing from 
                      your life bar! This is where trust and group tactics both 
                      enter a higher level. Did you know that using this spell 
                      does *not* put you on the mobs agro list? Here is how I 
                      understand healing agro to work: Mob does 300 damage. Cleric 
                      removes that damage. Cleric gets beaten on. Necromancer 
                      removes the damage, slowly over time (think like this: Necro 
                      Heal DOT is equal to Necro Damage DOT in agro list as Cleric 
                      Direct Heal is to Wizard/Mage Direct Damage) and does not 
                      ever get attacked for it. This is critical in places like 
                      lower guk, where you absolutely can not let your cleric 
                      die but must absolutely have healing available at all times. 
                      Which is where our strategy comes into play. YOU become 
                      the healer, in effect, of EVERYONE else in the party except 
                      yourself. As you should have 1200-1400 HPs with the appropriate 
                      cleric/druid buffs on, the Cleric can instead heal you when 
                      your life drops to 200-300 with 1 CH and he will NEVER get 
                      attacked. This means the Cleric can, if needed, STILL do 
                      emergency healing on other party members, and keep buffs 
                      up, without the usual problems where they run out of mana 
                      or get beaten on by a mob, heal themselves, and get beaten 
                      on AGAIN. It is *very* critical you make the cleric understand. 
                      Most of the high-level clerics sitting in lower guk that 
                      I have grouped with on Povar are absolutely delighted--they 
                      can keep almost FM, and only need to watch MY life bar unless 
                      something like the Frenzy, Hand, or Lord pops (they simply 
                      do too much damage for us to keep up with all the damage 
                      but do NOT stop healing!). In Sol B or in OOT the mobs simply 
                      don't DO enough damage to outpace our heal. Anything past 
                      Kobolds in Sol B, like the various spiders and giants, will 
                      do so much damage you would have to die several times to 
                      keep even 1 person full. So you need not try--most people 
                      going into these areas are in a large raid anyway and there 
                      are either enough clerics or you are all dead anyway. </font> 
                      <p>
                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Screaming 
                      Terror:</b> An excellent spell. Use it, even WITH an enchanter 
                      in the group. Its a short term mez, with a memory wipe built 
                      into it. This spell has limited use in OOT, where the Seafuries 
                      just shrug it off--so don't bother. However, in Sol B or 
                      Lower Guk, it works just fine. Here are times when you using 
                      this spell can be *very* effective. Enchanters mez breaks 
                      on a mob, the rest of the party is fighting a named (say 
                      Frenzy) and really can NOT break off to assist, and the 
                      Enchanter can't get a spell off to nuetralize the mob. Cast 
                      ST on it. Most times it will work. Many enchanters say to 
                      me "don't cast that spell I can't override it". To which 
                      I reply: STUN THE MOB. This breaks my mez, and gives you 
                      the time needed to re-mez it. All ST is in this situation 
                      is breathing room for your enchanter. I highly recommend 
                      that in Lower Guk you go nowhere without one, or you will 
                      find YOU are required to mez. You CAN do this, but you aren't 
                      very good at it, and if you fail to mez one it jumps right 
                      on you. Where else is this spell useful? Why, to wipe the 
                      hate list. Most people don't think of this, and watch their 
                      poor burner or enchanter get hacked to pieces. You HAVE 
                      cast VOS on the mob, no? You DO have a pet on it, no? And 
                      its STILL going after your wizard, cleric, enchanter, etc? 
                      Cast Screaming Terror on it. You'll mez it for a second, 
                      and most likely wipe its agro list. Suprise, YOU are the 
                      first to damage it (DOT+Pet) so it beats on your pet until 
                      the melee class(es) beat on it enough for the mob to switch 
                      to them. It works well, try it. </font>

                    <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Darkness 
                      line:</b> I use engulfing darkness--most fights don't last 
                      so long that the spell will wear off (clinging darkness 
                      is too short, dooming and up cost too much mana). Explain 
                      to your rangers, druids, mages, and wizards; to NOT root 
                      or snare. Why? Darkness wears off after a set period of 
                      time. Once on, it doesn't "break" until its time is up (60 
                      seconds). Snare overrides Clinging and Engulfing, Dooming 
                      and up overrides snare. Root overrides both. Most 40+ mobs 
                      break snare and root in seconds. So don't bother to use 
                      them unless you are *pulling* with it (usually a ranger 
                      with snare). Once in your designated "we fight here" area, 
                      stop casting (Mages: Get anything but an earth pet unless 
                      you don't have another pet for your current max pet level--we 
                      DO know Mages have a hard time getting all 4 pets for their 
                      level, right people? Well you do now!) root and snare UNLESS 
                      you see the mob running off (meaning Darkness wore off at 
                      a bad time) once its been beaten to low life. In case you 
                      don't know, Darkness is the same as snare except (a.) its 
                      a DOT [the lower 2 don't do alot of damage], and (b.) cannot 
                      be broken--so it slows the mob just as effectively as snare/root 
                      but won't "break", just wear off. Many times, if you have 
                      a good group killing things efficiently, you don't have 
                      the mana to spare for this spell so let the rangers/druids

                      usually help them figure out what they need to do (casting 
                      snare once at the beginning of a fight does NOT mean the 
                      mob will still be snared at the end of it). </font>

                      following situations you SHOULD. Lower level Mages (fire), 
                      Shamans (disease, poison) and even lower level Necros (fire, 
                      disease, poison) are having a hard time getting their spells 
                      to 'stick' or are getting alot of full/partial resists--help 
                      your party out. This is a very good resist debuff (25-29) 
                      on Fire, Disease, and Poison resists which should allow 
                      your party members to "get through" where before they would 
                      not. NOTE: For some reason, when this spell is RESISTED, 
                      you become #1 on the agro list for a moment. Doesn't take 
                      long to get the mobs off, just keep that in mind. When its 
                      not resisted they don't seem to care. </font>

                      Have the Shaman cast VOS. Why? He most likely has it memmed, 
                      and knows how to use it. If he can't get it to 'stick', 
                      then help him out with Scent, less resisted than his resist-debuff. 
                      Regen/Chloro. Get it, keep it, love it. Effectively keeps 
                      the damage from our Mana Generators to a minimum. Not as 
                      effective when Lich is up (you'll be turning it on and off 
                      far more than Call of Bones) but still, ask that they keep 
                      it up at all times. Ask for STR+AGI buffs for pet at all 
                      times. SOW if outside. </font>

                      Same as the Shaman, except you'll have to do the VOS, and 
                      Druids only have a STR buff. Wolf form? I guess. Doesn't 
                      do much for us, honestly--but I have jboots, many newer 
                      players wouldn't (and in lower guk SOW is a moot point anyway).

                      for keeping you alive. Let them know exactly how many HPs 
                      you have PER bubble so they know what to cast and when. 
                      Let them know when buffs are going--without their buffs 
                      you have effectively 1/4-1/3 less HPs with which to pact.

                      that you aren't, they clarity you and you refresh it). Note: 
                      Clarity and Call of Bones/Lich do not stack, with the Necromancer

                      nag them about keeping it up at the *end* of the fight. 
                      NOTE: Rangers can't take damage, so expect to have to heal 
                      them several times in a fight. In all cases, ask them NOT

                      Say this "My pet can die and I can just get another". If 
                      that doesn't convince them to stop, take it to tells and

                      have pets that are slightly worse than yours. Explain darkness/root

                      the limitation and use the max pet they have. However if 
                      this is the same mage you grouped with a month ago and he

                  At 44+, with the overcrowding, you'll find places to get experience 
                  in a good group is not easy, so being as useful as you can and 
                  knowing your strengths is a big plus. Lower Guk Dead Side and 
                  Ocean of Tears Seafury Island are the places to go for the high 
                  level necromancer. At 47+ you can go to the planes, but don't 
                  expect to gain experience there (they're just places for high-levels 
                  to die and lose exp but maybe gain great items). Lower Guk Dead 
                  Side you are more effective with some really good loot, but 
                  Ocean of Tears Seafury Island is better cash and experience--not 
                  to mention generally safer. So LGDS is your "primary" feeding 
                  ground, with OOTSI your "secondary" feeding ground.<br>

                    OOT at 49+ you don't have to do much to kill a Seafury. At 
                    44-48 you do. So 49+ is a solo experience, just as lower guk 
                    can be (most popular place in lower guk for the solo 49+ necro? 
                    Reanimated hand.) though if you want good loot you'll group. 
                    44-48 you must if you want a decent shot at survival. I personally 
                    prefer a Shaman to pair with--you both get about the same 
                    experience in OOT as you would solo since your pet isn't taking 
                    his chunk anymore, and with just 1 other person you do well. 
                    And Shamans just complement you perfectly. </font>
