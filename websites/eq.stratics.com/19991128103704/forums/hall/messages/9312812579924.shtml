Heres one GREAT POST from FoH saying how his class sucks and HOW HE SOLOED all the way. BULLCrap  As we all know FoH was helped by a gms countless times. Anyway read it I got this from another board.<p><br>A wizard nukes. That's it. We kinda nuke a little itty bit better then the rest (at least for five levels) but its nothing to write home about.<p>A wizard -can- solo, although its the pathetic stumblings of a newborn babe for the first 30 levels or so. Its not really so much that a wizard can solo at these levels, its that they must. Prior to group gate, the group opportunities for an unguilded (hell, even guilded such as myself) wizard are slim and quite often far between. Even after a group needs gating ability, its more like "Well a wizard will do since we can't find a druid" .. Wizard gates are pathetic at 29, poor at 34, and mediocre at 39. Let me reiterate: Soloing for a wizard is not an option, its a lifestyle requirement, and its not even good soloing. At level 50, I've soloed about 40 of my levels and I have never soloed when a group was available. It would be about 45 levels soloing if I didn't have gate, and the 5 outstanding levels grouping were in Cazic when the group I was with wanted to make sure they got the Tae kills.<p>Some of these problems associated with grouping at the high teens and twenties levels have been relaxed a bit on the older servers because people actually need Wizards to combat kill stealing. How thrilling. Regardless, none of that was a problem when I was levelling, thus grouping was near impossible.<p>A wizard is not even the best kill stealer, as if that was something to look forward to. Not anymore, anyways. Ran some tests with a (at the time) level 44 warrior and my 50th level self. I'd lose fully 80% of the time. Admittably the warrior had some damn nice equipment, but it strikes me as unacceptable that a warrior who has an easier time grouping, an experience bonus (or rather, no experience penalty) and generally easier time at the game (and yes I will argue this with any warrior in the game, the vast majority of you wouldn't have the -ability- to take any caster, much less a wizard, to 20th level) should end up being the most powerful damage hitter at the end-game ALSO.<p>BTW: These tests were run without enchanter speed spells or bard songs. Just think of the carnage when those are in play. There's no sort of "increase casting speed" buff available for any class in the game, much less two of them that stack with an item also.<p>I'm still using a 39th level DD for 350 points of damage. My 49th level DD isn't in the game AT ALL, and Conflag is fire based, and thus nearly useless in most of our outings. Where is the wizard mastery of combat damage? I would expect not one, but THREE direct damage spells at level 49. One for fire. One for cold. One for magic. In fact, the triad of DD spells should begin at least at 39th. One piddly 200 point spell above Magicians at level 49 isn't going to cut it. Realize that in beta Ice Comet had a 15 second casting time and took a reagent, I'd trade that in for a bolt spell any day.<p><br>I just got my first piece of Rubicite last night, the tunic. I'll be twinking up the real god class in EQ. A warrior.<p><br>Senir<br>Level 50, Fires of Heaven<br>Erudite Arch Wizard, Veeshan<p><br>
