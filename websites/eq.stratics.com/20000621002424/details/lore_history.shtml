Pleased with the conditions on Norrath , Veeshan deposited her brood onto the frozen         continent of Velious.

From his Plane of Underfoot,         a dark realm of vast caves and endless tunnels, Brell Serilis quietly created a magical         portal to a cavern deep in the belly of Norrath. From there the Duke of Underfoot secretly         seeded the underworld of Norrath with all manner of creatures. Brell then returned home,         sealing his portal within a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living Stone. It is rumored         that the Heretics of Paineel know the location of Brell&#146;s portal and seek to tap its         power, but Heretics are tight lipped and rumors are rumors.</strong></em></font></p>         <p align="center"><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000" size="3"><br>         </font><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/images/History_title5.GIF" alt="The Pact and It's Price" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="20"></strong></em></p>         <p><em><strong><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         <img src="http://eq.stratics.com/images/Cap_I.GIF" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="40">t is said that it was The Duke of Below who called the         meeting. The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord were in attendance. Brell,         carefully avoiding all queries as to the origins of his information, told of Veeshan's         discovery of a new and potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her brood.         Words befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips. He proposed and they         accepted an alliance of sorts, ignorant of the fact that Brell too had already released         some of his creations into the Underfoot of this new world. The planet that would come to         be known as Norrath was divvied up between these beings of power for the purpose of         keeping the Wurmqueen in check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath         and keep a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the         planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of Norrath.         In the abysmal depths of Norrath's oceans Prexus left his children, the Kedge, hearty         aquatic beings of great mental power. But is was on the surface of Norrath that Tunare's         creation of the Elves, creatures whose limitless grace and beauty was only exceeded by         their mastery of magic, drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a         decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he rules,         Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his         fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret this         disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, The Prince of Hate         snatched away the Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them         apart, physically and mentally, over the course of three thousand years. He then gathered         the quivering pieces of these beings of light and rebuilt them in his own dark sadistic         image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing The Teir'Dal, as         Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of         Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></strong></em></p>         <p align="center"><br>         <img src="http://eq.stratics.com/images/History_title3.gif" alt="The Erudites, Necromancy, and the rise and fall of Miragul" WIDTH="481" HEIGHT="22"><br>         <img src="http://eq.stratics.com/images/History_title4.gif" alt="as told by Aradune Mithara, sometimes historian, more often Ranger Lord, Outrider of Karana" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="14"></p>         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://eq.stratics.com/images/Cap_O.GIF" WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="45"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>ver three thousand years in the past         humanity was in its infancy. Mankind dwelled in the center of Antonica, spreading out         slowly to inhabit the vast and fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered,         several reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos to the west, and         Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who watched from         afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained a solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was         there to stay.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early on small groups formed,         some linked by similar appearances, others by common goals. Competition was fierce, and         when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many groups abandoned the promises         and alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence,         urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. They had broken away from         the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers in the name of peace, and these leaders         insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals to which all had agreed.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Their cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages were encouraged to         trade with one another and to respond to competition nonviolently. An economy based         largely on agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns were surrounded by large         farms. Most of humanity&#146;s leaders were pleased with this, wanting nothing more than         peace and food on every man&#146;s table after a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted         more. Even though their people had risen well beyond the standard of living endured by         their barbarian brothers to the north, they were not content. Explorers and adventurers         returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as         descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of         sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of         this, they became both jealous and determined. </em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         A small, fragile man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them         into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man.         Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud&#146;s followers fled the         city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon         the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite         appealing to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of their own,         dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a         towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and scholars, who called         themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other         artifacts brought to them by their spies. The first human mages were then born &#150;         wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely         in both power and knowledge.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         One of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and more extreme         than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but         he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow.         They created schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and assigning         themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found this         limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted to one school of thought         or another.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of outcasts         who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept secret from the         majority of students. The council was morally and ethically opposed to much of the         information gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only         studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few         lucky spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of         the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing this art. Miragul         was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created for himself four identities, four         separate countenances and names, and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the         council, nor anyone else for that matter.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing desire to know all         there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of         Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in         several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely         dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there         was one very significant difference &#150; they did not use swords and bows, but rather         magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and         structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and         regroup in the southern regions of Odus.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the         conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth         identify and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy         time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left         Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men,         however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew         afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the         east, wishing to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the         great lake called Winter&#146;s Deep and he hid there for some time.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and looked         over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his         understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even more         arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long         distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and         confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false         identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men. </em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of         the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people         and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both size and         value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther north, and away from all         intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite         spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and         was not until centuries later referred to as merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and         remote environment appealed to Miragul&#146;s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with         only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with         intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items.         He had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely         necessary. </em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels and         rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic         to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to         house his store of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world,         exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them to his cache, and then the next         dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories he had created. </em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best to extend         his life using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment when it came to         aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death         did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his         skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#146;s time was spent less exploring the         world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon discovered the various hidden         dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means         by which he could traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. But his         strength was leaving him, and his journeys into these realities were short and often         unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the         specter of death haunted him daily.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         The mage&#146;s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned         from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art,         became Miragul&#146;s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to create         portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He         traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers.         Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole that         led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that huge         civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though         somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its         inhabitant&#146;s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select few         respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They         revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise the dead, creating         zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master. Many of the heretics planned to         assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to wreak revenge upon the council that had         exiled and made war upon them in centuries past. </em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead         ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must         discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic&#146;s goals, learning         spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he         was experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he was given in         Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way to transform a         living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for         he was tired and almost dead himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics         were almost ready to make war once again. </em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a         portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew         silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the         while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment.         The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining and         fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other         necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of         the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich.</em></strong></font></p>         <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#804000"><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all         the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#146;s soul, now         locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to         amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and         Miragul&#146;s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander         his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power.</em></strong></font> 		<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>       </tr>     </table>  <br> <br>  <table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=908070 width=80%> 	<tr> 		<td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1></td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 		<td align="center"><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;<div>Author: 989 Studios (Edited by Thayer)<div>&nbsp;</td> 	</tr> 	<tr> 		<td bgcolor=f0f0f0><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&copy; Copyright 1999 Stratics.
