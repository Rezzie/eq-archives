                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over 
                    the past few days, I have been experimenting with the human 
                    monk. This report will detail information concerning the first 
                    four levels of my investigation into this character class. 
                    As many of you know, the monk can only be human, and as a 
                    result, the starting locations are limited to Freeport and 
                    Qeynos. I decided to start out in the city of Freeport. To 
                    give you a brief introduction to the monk, the monk is a class 
                    like no other. The monk is dedicated to the belief that the 
                    use of weapons and armor is a sign of weakness, and the monk 
                    tries to perfect his body into a lethal killing machine. As 
                    a result of this belief, the monk does not use most weapons 
                    and armor. The starting equipment for a monk is very modest. 
                    You get five loaves of bread, five flasks of water, the player 
                    killer switch scroll, and a guild scroll. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                      beginning in the beautiful and immense city of Freeport, 
                      I began to investigate the city itself. Freeport is divided 
                      into three major areas: North, West and East. The West area 
                      is mainly shops, the North is the same, and the East has 
                      shops and also docks for boat travel. I started in West 
                      Freeport and eventually found my way to the monk guild. 
                      This simple task should be your first. Read the directions 
                      carefully on your scroll which you receive upon creation. 
                      It will give the location of the guild house. It is hard 
                      to find, but search West Freeport, and you will prove victorious 
                      on your first quest. Once you find this house, remember 
                      where it is in the city, because you will return here every 
                      time you level up.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
                      I had completed this task, I decided to check out some combat 
                      action from the gates of West Freeport. Outside the gates, 
                      you will find anything from snakes to skeletons. First level 
                      monks are able to fight large rats, bats, and snakes. The 
                      key to any first level character is be ready to run. Always 
                      keep in mind where the guards are, and if things get bad, 
                      run as fast as you can to them.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                      level one, the monk has three basic modes of combat: punch, 
                      kick, and throwing. These maneuvers do not inflict a lot 
                      of damage, but you get many attacks. NOTE: Stick to punch 
                      and kick for the time being until you have enough extra 
                      money to invest in throwing knives, shurikens, or throwing 
                      axes. The monk also has two basic modes of non-combat: mend 
                      and bind wound. Mend allows you to attempt to heal your 
                      own wounds. Mend costs nothing, but it takes awhile before 
                      you can use it again. Bind wounds is a skill which allows 
                      you to heal another player. You will need to buy bandages 
                      in order for this skill to work. Once you have done some 
                      fighting, you will soon find yourself at level two. Once 
                      you have reached level two, go back to your guild house 
                      and get some training. Consider improving your combat skills 
                      as best as possible.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                      second level, you will find large rats, bats, and snakes 
                      easier to defeat. You may also begin to attack decaying 
                      skeletons, but watch out for deathfist pawns and deathfist 
                      centurions. They can take the form of humans or orcs and 
                      can be very nasty! Once you have fought enough to reach 
                      third level, go back and train some more.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                      third level, you should be able to take on decaying skeletons, 
                      bats, giant rats, snakes, fire beetles, and deathfist pawns. 
                      The key to third level is know your own limitations. If 
                      you start to get pounded on, just run. There will always 
                      be more to fight. At this point in my travels, I began to 
                      realize that the south gates in East Freeport was even a 
                      better place to do combat. At the south gates, you will 
                      find a higher concentration of more difficult monsters. 
                      Watch out though! Deathfist pawns and deathfist centurions 
                      spawn in groups sometimes, and you can find yourself out 
                      numbered quickly. Also keep in mind that the fire beetle 
                      is an opportunist. This monster typically will leave a prepared 
                      warrior alone; however, should you be engaged in combat, 
                      the fire beetle loves to take advantage of the moment. Also, 
                      do not be surprised that if you attack one fire beetle, 
                      others may attack you as well. Once you have done enough 
                      combat to move you up to level three, head back to train 
                      some more.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                      forth level, you should be able to defeat decaying skeletons, 
                      bats, giant rats, fire beetles, deathfist pawns, armadillos, 
                      spiderlings, black wolves, some deathfist centurions, and 
                      snakes. Be cautious as you travel further out, you may encounter 
                      black bears or giant spiders. These creatures are not to 
                      be trifled with as of yet. As you fight more, and reach 
                      level five, it is time to retrain again. At this point I 
                      will leave off, but not without tantalizing you first. At 
                      level five you get the right to earn a new skill, Round 
                      Kick! Expect more soon about Round Kick and new monk information.</font>

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                    you have reached level five, a whole new world opens up. This 
                    article will address levels five and six, as well as, mention 
                    quests, armor and weapons, and new skills. The first thing 
                    you will notice upon reaching level five is the ability to 
                    train in the skill of Round Kick. This skill is similar to 
                    the regular kick, but can do more amounts of damage. I highly 
                    recommend that you spend one of your five practice training 
                    classes on this new skill and the other four towards Mend 
                    Wound. As a level five monk, you will also begin to realize 
                    that the monsters which you can kill by yourself no longer 
                    give the experience they used to at lower levels. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
                      may want to begin experimenting with joining and forming 
                      groups. Grouping is a valuable and exciting part of EverQuest. 
                      You get to meet people, fight with them, and die with them. 
                      A good, well-rounded party is always the best. I recommend 
                      based on my experience: one fighter, one wizard, one bard 
                      or cleric, and one other spell caster. While a total of 
                      six members can be in a group, the more efficient you are, 
                      the more experience you get. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                      you are a member of a group, it is time to size up your 
                      opponents. The rattlesnake, orc raider, puma, and skeleton 
                      are the least difficult for moderate leveled groups. You 
                      may also run into giant scarabs or giant spiders. These 
                      are more difficult and can quickly put you in pain. Make 
                      sure you have sufficient muscle before taking on these monsters. 
                      The madman and deverish thug are probably beyond your group's 
                      ability. These humanoid creatures pack a mighty punch and 
                      have the potential to eliminate your entire party.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also 
                      at level five, you may want to invest some of that hard 
                      earned gold into items you can use. The armor and weapons 
                      a monk can use is very limited. The armor a monk can wear 
                      is restricted to cloth, leather and some magical. The weapons 
                      a monk can use are limited to throwing knives, shirkens, 
                      throwing axes, clubs, staffs, maces, and warhammers. I recommend 
                      that you stick to your hands and feet for the time being, 
                      so that you can improve your skills.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further, 
                      I found that fighting monsters all the time was getting 
                      a tad boring, so I decided to investigate the Quest part 
                      of EverQuest. The easiest way to see if an NPC has a quest 
                      for you or not is to hail them. First, select the target 
                      NPC, and then click the hail button under your Socials menu. 
                      If there is a quest needing to be accomplished, the NPC 
                      will instruct you on how to complete the quest. You have 
                      to search pretty hard for quests right now, but you might 
                      find something of interest in your guild house (grin). Once 
                      you have fought your way up to level six, it is time to 
                      get some more training. As of level six, here are the skills 
                      you can invest in:</font>

                                                are still rather dangerous. I

                  <div><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wow, 
                    I cannot believe I finally made it to level 9. It seemed to 
                    take forever. Between the transition from phase 3.5 to phase 
                    4, time began to slip away. I apologize for the wait on this 
                    article, and hope you enjoy this final installment of "The 
                    Monk's Canon." Not only we will discuss the tactics of the 
                    Monk at these levels, but I have also managed to gather up 
                    the specifics on each skill the Monk can train. </font> 
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
                      off, at level 7, you will find yourself coming into your 
                      Monk abilities. As before, you will still want to continue 
                      pressing on through group combat, but you may want to try 
                      some solo combat in relatively safe areas. For the most 
                      part, I found myself combating in the Deserts of Northern 
                      Ro. This area is an excellent place for a moderately skilled 
                      warrior to do combat, either grouped or solo. When grouped, 
                      you may want to try and combat giant tarantulas (formerly 
                      giant spiders), sand scarabs (formerly scarabs), orc raiders, 
                      rattlesnakes, pumas, jackals, and the occasional madman. 
                      </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
                      difference at level 7 is to try and be as efficient as possible 
                      with your group. Do not take extra members into the group 
                      unless you find yourself defeated often. As for soloing, 
                      always use the consider command (/con) before entering combat. 
                      Typically, creatures that you consider and give the message 
                      "risky, but you might win" are safe opponents to solo, but 
                      be cautious. If you decide to solo, always keep yourself 
                      near the guards or another zone. If the creature begins 
                      whoop you, run to a different zone or the guards. Also, 
                      if you are soloing in Northern Ro, the guards will not attack 
                      a puma or a madman, so need to run to the guards if one 
                      of those is on you. </font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
                      7 levels of solid fighting in limited areas, I began to 
                      get curious about the world outside of the areas I had been 
                      fighting. You might just find a boat ride to the Dwarven 
                      city of Kaladim fun and relaxing. Combat can be very repetitive 
                      at times, and taking a little journey to another place can 
                      be a good relief. NOTE: If you decide to stay in that area 
                      and fight a lot, make sure you get a wizard to "Bind" you 
                      to the city. This is very important because if you were 
                      to be killed without being bound, you would come back to 
                      life back in Freeport. Better to come back to life at the 
                      closest possible location to your corpse. After you have 
                      done some adventuring and done much combat to make it to 
                      level 8, time to go back and do some training. I suggest 
                      you begin some heavy investing in your Mend skill.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                      level 8, soloing creatures should become easier. Do not 
                      forget to consider everything you fight just in case. At 
                      this level, you should be able to solo pumas, jackals, orc 
                      raiders, some tarantulas, and some rattlesnakes. With a 
                      well-rounded group, you should be able to take everything 
                      in Northern Ro but deverishs and Dorn (an NPC human). Also 
                      at level 8, you will be able to train in a new skill, Sneak. 
                      The sneak skill allows you to quietly bypass NPC's without 
                      being detected. The sneak skill is something I would not 
                      necessarily spend your training points on (except the first 
                      point to learn it), rather I would just practice it whenever 
                      you get the chance.</font>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                      also began to develop a philosophy about my character. I 
                      had never really thought about what my character should 
                      believe in, if anything. I began to, I assume, role-play. 
                      At level 8, I decided that my monk would combat any orc 
                      creature, regardless of the odds. This added a sense of 
                      fun to it. I said to myself, "Any time I see an orc, I will 
                      attack it regardless of my physical condition." While most 
                      of the time it was not dangerous, I did find myself dying 
                      to a couple orcs right after I had completed combat with 
                      a tarantulas. This element of role-playing can make the 
                      game more interesting for you and your party. After you 
                      have fought and fought some more, it will be time to get 
                      some training, and begin to explore Norrath without knowing 
                      what to expect. See the EQSS Class Reference section for 
                      a full list of the skills that you can attain, and the level 
                      (if applicable) needed to train in them. Farewell to you 
                      all, and thank you to all my fellow group members for the 
                      fun and experience! <!--<p>One Hand Blunt<div>Two Hand Blunt<div>Bind Wound<div>Block (Level 12)<div>Disarm (Level 27)<div>Dodge<div>Double Attack (Level 15)<div>Dragon Punch (Level 25)<div>Dual Wield<div>Eagle Strike (Level 20)<div>Feign Death (Level 17)<div>Flying Kick (Level 30)<div>Hand to Hand<div>Kick<div>Mend<div>Riposte (Level 35)<div>Round Kick (Level 5)<div>Safefall (Level 3)<div>Sense Head<div>Sneak (Level 8)<div>Swimming<div>Throwing<div>Tiger Claw (Level 10)<div>Fishing<div>Baking<div>Tailoring<div>Smithing<div>Fletching<div>Brewing<div>Alcohol Tolerance<div>Beg<div>Jewel Craft<div>Pottery<div>Common Tongue<div>Other Languages--></font>
