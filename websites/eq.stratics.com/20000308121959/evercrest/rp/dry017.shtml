Vinalrii blinked her red eyes. The crowd of dark elves watching her
awakening cheered. The sound flooded into her ears as she looked around,
trying to come to her senses.
<br><br>
She felt cold. She felt memories hiding just out of her reach. She also
felt absolutely evil. Alive, she was caring, timid, and compassionate, but
being undead, she instead was everything a dark elf should be. Hatred found
its way into her heart. What she could remember of herself disgusted her.
But now, she figured, she would make up for her past.
<br><br>
She smiled evilly at her cheering subjects.
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
The orc Lord Garish looked at Drysart apprehensively. He knew more of
what happened than even Rubicant himself. His teams of orcish spies had
informed him of the coming of Drysart and Vinalrii's child months ago. He
knew the commitments Drysart made to the woman and their child, and he
knew of their trial and their execution.
<br><br>
Actually, Garish respected Drysart. Even under stress, the wizard remained
calm and collected and handled himself well. Against his upbringing, the
wizard stood with honor beside Vinalrii, even when faced with death. No
orc had ever shown such behavior.
<br><br>
Conversely, Garish had seen Rubicant plot and plan with selfish motivations.
He'd seen Rubicant harass Drysart's family for years. Strangely, Rubicant
had always appealed to the orcish nature in Lord Garish.
<br><br>
But recently the view Garish had on the world changed. He no longer looked
up to Rubicant. He felt Rubicant killed Vinalrii solely so he could turn
her undead and rid her of her pleasant personality.  Orcs may be cruel
and ruthless, but if there's one thing they care about, its their family.
Rubicant had violated the sanctity of orcish respect.
<br><br>
Which is why Garish dragged Drysart to a secluded corner of Neriak and
returned the page that Rubicant had been trying to steal from the wizard.
<br><br>
Drysart looked at the page. He had not seen it for quite some time, and
had almost forgotten about it. He looked at it for a moment, then up at
the orc.
<br><br>
Sensing what the wizard was about to ask, Garish interrupted, "It's about
your father, Drysart."
<br><br>
"Father?...  What about him?"  The wizard sat down at Garish's urging.
<br><br>
"Entonius Demonslayer, your father, was a necromancer."
<br><br>
"A necromancer? Impossible! He was a high elf! No high elf has ever known
the study of necromancy."
<br><br>
"He wasn't just any necromancer. It was said his powers almost rivalled
those of Miragul himself. This parchment holds the foundation his studies
were based from."
<br><br>
Drysart sat quietly and looked at the page. He didn't have anything to say.
If what Garish said was true, it would certainly explain many of the things
the wizard remembered from his childhood. The dark elves visiting his
home, the business his father had with them.  What happened to cause them
to turn?
<br><br>
Garish looked at Drysart for a moment. "The Queen must be eliminated. She
knows what's on that parchment. The power of necromancy that the dark
elves haven't discovered yet. She will lead the Drow against the light
races. And with this power, they will win."
<br><br>
"Vinalrii won't do that. She hates the dark elves. She's not evil."
<br><br>
Garish leaned in to Drysart and raised his voice, "She's not Vinalrii
anymore. Vinalrii is dead. Rubicant turned her into the Queen that Neriak
needed. She must be destroyed."
<br><br>
Drysart blinked and stood, "Dead or not, she's still Vinalrii," the wizard's
eyes narrowed, "and I love her. I will not let her be destroyed." Drysart
turned and was ready to storm from the area until his eyes met those of
Megaera and Barishi who had heard the whole exchange. Slowly, he turned
back to Garish.  "Where's my son?"
<br><br>
******
<br><br>
Not too long later, the party emerged from the hidden entrance to Neriak.
Megaera, Barishi and Drysart.  All were of low spirits. The child they
came to save was not even in Neriak.
<br><br>
The boy had been taken to Mistmoore to be trained and raised, or so Garish
said. He had told the party to wait near the entrance, he would be along
before long.
<br><br>
So they waited. They didn't wait long before they saw the figure of the
orc arrive from the darkness of the forest. Over his shoulder was the
Queen, struggling to get free. Garish dropped her from his shoulder
and handed the Queen, her arms and legs tied, to Drysart.
<br><br>
"Only a trusted advisor such as myself could get her from Neriak, this is
your only chance. Do something with her, because if she gets back in
there, she's won't be fooled out again.... She must be destroyed."
<br><br>
Drysart flashed Garish an angry look before turning away.  The party with
the Queen departed Nektulos, and returned with her to Rivervale.
<br><br>
Garish turned back into Neriak. It wouldn't be long before Rubicant found
out what had happened.
