                      a fightand your opponent cannot, you should almost always 
                      be victorious. Healing also increases the effective level 
                      of party by almost 1-2full levels. A group of level 10 characters 
                      with a good Cleric caneasily function as a group of level 
                      12 characters with respect tothe individual difficulty and

                      have the health totake the damage that blue or white enemies 
                      will dish out. Atmiddle-high to high levels, you are almost 
                      impotent solo. You justcan't do enough melee damage without 
                      double attack or dual wield tokeep up with enemies that 
                      are striking you for 40-50 damage twice around. Even with

                      can, they still have a melee attack which can add up the 
                      damagein a long fight. The real damage output of a cleric 
                      is theirspells. Start to think of Healing as indirect burn. 
                      The AI thinksthis is true, and so should you! If you keep 
                      a fighter fighting,they're going to do MUCH more damage

                      Burn. When aWizard or Magician casts burn (especially area 
                      affect burn), it hadbest be from maximum range or you can 
                      expect a very bloody mage bodyto hit the floor in the near

                      more mana trying to heal them. This isa vicious cycle. Your 
                      defensive buffs make your healing spellsabout 20-50% more 
                      efficient. Use them on almost everyone who willget into 
                      combat (Pure casters like buffs, but don't really need themif

                      they can pull the next onefrom the cleric (who can survive 
                      for quite a while) and finish thatone with much less danger 
                      for the tank. Try not to get two enemieson your primary

                      come in basically two types: Support caster and Combatcaster,

                      casters are usually Dark Elf, High Elf, or Erudite. Theseraces 
                      have lower physical statistics (Str, Agil, Stam) and generallycan 
                      achieve slightly higher wisdom (and thus more mana). Most

                      and tanking for the group. This is a true test for aCleric. 
                      The ability to perform all the duties required while inmelee 
                      range with an enemy or two can stress test even the mostbattle 
                      hardened player. The natural Combat casters are halflingsand 
                      dwarves, because they have tremendous physical attributes 
                      (Str,Agil, Stam). </font></p>

                      Humans are bestat this, considering their balance. The Gnomes

                      lacking in Strength andStamina. This reduces access to bigger

                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strength: 
                      On the obvious side this is the statistic that determinesyour 
                      damage cap and adds a little to your chance to hit. Moreimportant 
                      is that Strength determines your maximum carryingcapacity. 
                      As a cleric, you are going to run short every time. Youcan 
                      wear plate at 75 Strength but you would pretty much have 
                      topass on looting and summon your food and water in small 
                      amounts. Allof a Cleric's equipment is heavy. Their armor 
                      is heavy, theirshields are heavy, and their weapons are 
                      very heavy. You can neverreally go wrong with extra points 
                      in Strength, even if you don't planon doing much melee. 
                      The carrying capacity is key. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stamina: 
                      This determines your hit points as well as the rate atwhich 
                      you tire. Some warn against putting points into Stamina, 
                      but with heavy plate armor, each point of health gained 
                      fromStamina is much more effective because of the additional 
                      protectionthe armor provides. Other classes do not have 
                      this advantage. Itis also important because of the weight 
                      of the weapons that clericsare usually swinging around - 
                      they will tire you quickly if youneglect Stamina. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wisdom: 
                      This one is a bit obvious. Wisdom determines mana gainedper 
                      level. It also provides better resistance to spells and 
                      ischecked on a failed skill roll. This is the last statistic 
                      youshould put points into, and only after you decide what 
                      type ofcleric you are going to play. Having a large pool 
                      of mana is notthe end all be all of effectiveness. It really 
                      only helps inemergencies and to some degree at high levels. 
                      If you have 25 pointsput into Wisdom, and you're playing 
                      well enough that you do not dropbelow one bubble, you may 
                      have made the wrong choice on statistics.I (a Combat Caster) 
                      personally put only as much as I feel isabsolutely necessary 
                      because I feel that the points better serve mein combat 
                      survivability rather than providing me with extra manathat 
                      I rarely use. Support casters should probably go maximumwisdom.</font></p>

                      you're planning on playing a Support caster, recommendations 
                      arefor high Wisdom (more mana), and a bit into strength, 
                      so you can getsome decent armor layered on. Armor is more 
                      important than agilitynow. A Cleric in Chain with 95 Agility 
                      will not last as long as aCleric in Plate with 85 Agility. 
                      If you can, go for the Strength towear Plate. We calculate 
                      that you'll need about 90 Strength forfull Plate. However, 
                      you can go partial Plate and Chain forprobably 75-80 Strength. 
                      Keep it in mind. </font></p>

                      you're playing a Combat caster (with a Dwarf, Halfing, orsomething 
                      else), we recommend that you diversify point allocation. 
                      Combat Clerics need strength for Plate, good Stamina for 
                      combatviability, and Wisdom for spell-casting. Dwarven Clerics 
                      mightconsider adding a bit to Agility, but that's not a 
                      requirement,because of their enhanced Stamina. </font></p>

                      most important statistic for a Combat Cleric isDexterity. 
                      This is the statistic that determines your ability tojoin 
                      the melee without ending up with dead party members. Dexterityaffects 
                      your ability at Channeling. With a high dexterity,Channeling 
                      allows you to cast faster and occasionally throughtattacks 
                      by an enemy that is actively attacking the Cleric. Do notignore

                      Agility. This depends also on your choice of Cleric 'type'.</font>

                    you want a good shot of how boring EQ can get, soloing a clericis 
                    your gig. Clerics are a group class almost exclusively. Justlike 
                    every other class they can solo to level 13 without too muchproblem 
                    but after that point, you begin to see exactly how littledamage 
                    you are doing to the creature. As enemy health and damageincrease, 
                    fight duration increases as does recovery time. Basicallyit 
                    gets to the point where you have two choices. You can eithermelee 
                    the creature for a long period of time and heal during andafter 
                    the fight. This allows a somewhat shorter recovery but fightstake 
                    sooooo long that I am often AFK while fighting from boredom. 
                    The second option is using your burn with melee. This finishes 
                    themob somewhat faster and is my preferred method but makes 
                    for longrecovery times because of the mana inefficiency of 
                    the damage. Onceyou get past level 12 these methods become 
                    so time inefficient thatall but the most antisocial will realize 
                    that Clerics are a groupcharacter. </font>

                      may suggest that Clerics should solo undead after this point. 
                      This would be a great idea, if it worked. You can solo undead 
                      thatwill give you decent experience, but you will be running 
                      back foryour corpse often. 95% of all the undead at your 
                      level will be indungeons (or outdoor micro-dungeons and 
                      ruins). This invariablymeans you are going to be fighting 
                      multiple enemies which is alosing situation, regardless 
                      of whether you win, or die. Even if youwin, the recovery 
                      time will make this method of gaining experienceinefficient. 
                      And dying... well, that's never good. Usually, if youmanage 
                      to find a location with a single undead opponent of thecorrect 
                      level, you still have to deal with little green annoyingstuff 
                      (we call it chafe or trash) that will attack you whilemeditating. 
                      Once you hit that meditate button, you will have everypiece 
                      of green chafe within two rooms all over you. You don't 
                      getmuch recovery done when you have to fight a rat down 
                      to half andthen chase it down as it runs at full speed around 
                      corners andthrough doors that you can't burn through. No

                      first thing you must learn is when to heal and when not 
                      to heal. If a Cleric runs out of mana, combat becomes 2-3 
                      timesas dangerous as it was. Clerics must conserve mana 
                      to keep youroptions open as combat progresses.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Healing 
                      most often is a 60% health twitch response. However, a 60%twitch 
                      heal may be premature. The enemy can be naturally drawn 
                      offit's initial target by a more dangerous foe (Monks draw 
                      enemies offfighters almost 100% of the time after 5-10 rounds). 
                      If you twitchheal the primary target, then you're wasting 
                      that mana on a targetthat is no longer in danger unless 
                      they can manage to draw the enemyback onto themselves.</font></p>

                      heknows how combat is likely to progress and who will be 
                      in the mostdanger as the fight goes on. Healing in most 
                      situations is ajudgement call, and panicking and responding 
                      to somewhat low health will only be more likely to hurt 
                      the party than help it.</font></p>

                      a good Cleric becomes amazing if the group knows howto distribute 
                      damage by 'taunting' with different effects (Burn,special 
                      attacks, skills, etc). Please read Grouping 101 and 201

                      a good group in a tough fight will often let people ridedown 
                      to about 40-50%. This may seem risky and dangerous, but 
                      iteffectively makes Healing a dual effect. Cleric healing 
                      can be usedas a taunt to pull an almost frenzied monster 
                      back off a Tank (whichis not attacking now) and onto the 
                      Cleric. Then another tank stepsin and takes the enemy off 
                      the Cleric. Remember, if you're going todo this, everyone 
                      had better know this is going on, otherwise yourgroup may 
                      panic and bug out.</font></p>

                      who is somewhat familiar with Clerics might say that onlybad 
                      Clerics use Direct Damage. They should instead be saving 
                      manafor healing. This is oversimplifying the role of a Cleric, 
                      and is adiscredit to the class.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simple 
                      fact: Burn can be as much of a lifesaver as your healing. 
                      If an enemy is going to dish out more damage in a slightly 
                      extendedcombat sequence than you can easily or safely heal, 
                      it's time forthe group to 'light up the enemy'. Basically, 
                      all the casters gointo nuke mode, chain casting burn at 
                      the enemy trying to reduce itto slag before it does the 
                      same to a party member. In manysituations, this will include 
                      the Cleric! If this is a part of amultiple enemy engagement, 
                      the Cleric must be a bit more careful asthere still will 
                      be a need for Healing later in the sequence. Lighting up 
                      an enemy can become very addictive forgroups. This is a 
                      very inefficient method of combat, as it incurs asevere 
                      recovery time, and thus should only be used when the party 
                      isin extreme danger.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      most common usage of Cleric burn is as a taunt. Lightapplication 
                      of burn can turn enemies off of one player and on toyou. 
                      This is a form of healing in itself, as you prevent furtherdamage 
                      to a party member. This works the best on intelligentopponents 
                      (greater undead, and most demi-humans) as they are mostlikely 
                      to notice the cause of the 'ouchie'. Burn should be usedsparingly 
                      but it is not without its place.</font></p>

                      from their very effective anti-undead arsenal, Clerics haveamazing 
                      point blank area affect damage in their Word of Pain series. 
                      These PBAOE spells don't do a lot of damage (about 3 damage 
                      perlevel of caster on average) they have one very important 
                      effect. Area affect spells draw enemies onto the caster 
                      like flies to rawmeat (think about it, it's very apt). For 
                      a normal caster, that'sdeadly, but as mentioned above Clerics 
                      can take the added heatbecause of their armor.</font></p>

                      the group is rushed by a few targets, the enemies will all

                      a tank, therest of the party has a little while to get their 
                      act in gear andpull a few of the enemies off. If this is 
                      a pure caster, the partyhas only a few rounds to get the 
                      enemies off before they frenzy andkill the character. In 
                      either situation, the Cleric has theadvantage in being able 
                      to launch WoP (or later versions), whichwill pull any enemy 
                      not already being attacked onto the Cleric. This can be 
                      a lifesaver. No one character can survive beingattacked 
                      by many many opponents simultaneously for very long, butthose 
                      in heavy armor will obviously last the longest.</font></p>

                      or having another tank pull the enemy off of the cleric. 
                      The latter is the safest, as it gives the Cleric free reign

                      is likely the best judge ofhow well a combat situation is

                      are one of the few classes (others being Bards, Fighters,and 
                      Paladins) that can wear Plate armor. This armor is just 
                      trulyamazing, providing immense AC as well as the best damage 
                      absorptionin the game. Upgrade your armor to the best you 
                      can find, steal, orpurchase as often as possible. It is 
                      more important than some ofyour spells. Even if you are 
                      playing in a Support Cleric, the factthat you can stand 
                      up to damage if an enemy turns on you isextremely important. 
                      Your group needs you in combat and healing,regardless of 
                      the number of enemies on you. You are not a Magician,Wizard, 
                      or Enchanter. They need serious protection during combat. 
                      A Cleric that begs like a caster for protection is going 
                      to get hisgroup killed. A Cleric that refuses to cast while 
                      engaged in meleeis even worse.</font></p>

                      expect to ever really have more than you can spend hand

                      yourselfborrowing money for armor and spells. You can reduce 
                      the amount youspend somewhat in a supporting role by skimping 
                      a little on armorbut still you will feel the pinch when 
                      you need to buy that nextcircle of spells. The only way 
                      you can really keep up in the lowerlevels, if you do not 
                      have a group to support you, is to sell yourservices. There 
                      are always warriors willing to shell out littlemoney for 
                      some healing or others willing to pay for their disease 
                      tobe gone. It won't get you fortune or glory but most of
