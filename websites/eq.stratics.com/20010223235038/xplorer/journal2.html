<p><a name=4><b>Journal Entry - 990724 - 3:34pm CET</b>

<p>Hey all.

<p>Almost passed out in the hospital :). They wanted to take a hose and run it down my nose to the stumach, it didn't go that well though, so they aborted it (thank god, I thought I was going to die :)).

<p>Anyway, been resting now for a day or two, and it's time we get this journal moving again.

<p>When I logged in on Monday (I think) Newf was online and she came and gated me to West Commonlands (I did hunt in the karanas for about an hour first though, but it's nothing to talk about, no pelts :)). Having my Polar Bear Skin and some junk in my inventory I wanted to make it to Rivervale, to both activate the Leatherfoot raider's quest, as well as sell off some of the stuff to the amiable merchants.

<p>Once there I went looking for Marshal Anrey, the leader of the Leatherfoot Raiders.

<p>Upon hailing him I got the following message:

<p>"Stand at attention! You don't look fit enough to toe wrestle my grandma! You cannot be in my squad!! Are you [petitioning] or are you a [visitor]"

<p>At first when I got that "You cannot be in my squad!!" I thought I weren't good enough for him, faction-wise, but things only got better...

<p>Telling him I was peitioning, he asked me where I was [from].

<p>I tried telling him several times that I was from the city of Kelethin, but he didn't understand that. So I swallowed and told him I was from Rivervale...

<p>"So you are from Rivervale?!! You must be some kind of inbreed. No halfling from Rivervale would look, smell and act anything like you. Well, inbreed, if you think your (you're? :)) stout enough to be a Leatherfoot Raider you prove it!! You travel to the Everfrost Peaks and get me a Polar Bear Pelt. Then maybe, just maybe, I will let you wear the cap of the Leatherfoot Raider."

<p>It was clear he had doubt in me, and I smiled handing over the Polar Bear Skin (not pelt) to him.

<p>"So I see the young troll has become a young warrior. You have stepped up to the challenge of the Leatherfoot Raiders, but to be truly sure that you can join our ranks, bring me the Dirk of a fallen Neriak Dragoon. Only then can I be sure that you can truly be one of the few and bold, the Leatherfoot Raiders."

<p>Grrr... who is he calling a troll? He's the one with a cockyness (if that's a word) the size of one :).

<p>I left Anrey for now and went to the thicket, to try selling some stuff away. Auctioning that I'm looking for a medium quality bear pelt I actually received a reply from a person named Wizlor. He would let one go for 1pp, and considering the time I've spent looking for, I found it to be a fair price :).

<p>Going back to Rivervale my luck continued when I saw a barbarian female, named Jallaila, auctioning out one of those Blackened Iron Medallions for 15pp!

<p>I quickly checked my bank account and only found 13pp :(. I told her to save it for a couple of seconds and I started to auction out all kinds of items that I had saved. My luck shined upon me once again, and I was able to sell off two lightstones, for 1pp a piece. That brought me to exactly 15pp and the medallion was mine!

<p>Being flat broke again, I decided to goof off a bit in Rivervale. With the help of a wood elf, named Genwen, I was able to reach the highest top of Rivervale, and I was able to get a great aerial photage of the town center and the surrounding areas.

<p>Genwen did the drastical though and jumped, trying to land in the small stream that runs through Rivervale. He missed it with just a yard or less, and ended up with a gruesome death, counting at 434dmg (ouch!!! :)).

<p>I also met up with Wintereyes and by this time she'd gotten herself some very neat armor, including the Bloodstained Tunic (looked cool). She couldn't stay for long though, so with only having a kill or two from level 16, I set sail... err.. foot to the West Commonlands again.

<p>There I met up with a half elven female, named Tamasai, who wanted to group up with me. We tried taking on the dervs, but as the camp was pretty filled up with people we decided to go for the wisps and kodiaks.

<p>Since EQ Druids posted their "snare - panic animal" tactic kodiaks and other animals for that matter have become much easier to take on. All you have to do now is to open with a snare followed with a panic animal. The critter will then try to run away from you, but as it's snared it won't get far, and you'll be able to make some nice hits in it's back, without any retalliation. I prefer this method before kiting. The spell effects of panic animal are great, with the hovering skulls and all. It also helps a lot to raise your melee skills when fighting something harder than a risky blue.

<p>I didn't get to kill much though, and I had to log out, before hitting 16.

<p>Back the next day I found the West Commonlands to have quite the bear infestion. I had about 5 young kodiaks on screen at the same time, and I decided to pick one. I quickly became aware of their social capabilities and I had no choice but to zone to Kithicor. Sure, I could probably have fought down 2 or 3 of them, but since most of them were green, and that I didn't want to sit down and heal, I put safety and time in the first line.

<p>When I zoned back they were no where to be found, and I was able to take on a white kodiak by myself. I opened with a snare and threw the panic animal. Once it started to run I threw a DoT on it and engaged in melee, repanicing whenever it wore off. It worked great (as always :)) and before I knew it, I was level 16!

<p>Woohoo... only three more painfull levels to go, and I'll get both an upgrade to ignite and the magnificent teleporting spells. At 19, I'll never need to do the RunnyGorge run again, feels weird :).

<p>I also had the fastest loading time to West Commonlands ever when I reentered it - 20 seconds! That direct line in school surely helps with my travelling :).

<p>At this time a drow necromancer, named Uenar, was forming a group at the derv camp. I decided to join in, and it soon turned out that it was only going to be me and Uenar, for now :).

<p>We had little trouble taking the dervs down now, even though the camp was pretty stuffed up. Most of the dervs are green now, and won't join if they are low enough in levels, which is excellent... for me :).

<p>Soon an Ogre friend of Uenar joined up, named Kackarot. He was speaking trollish (Ogreish?) and I enjoyed my time I spent with these two guys. It became pretty easy at the dervs now with a hard hitting Ogre in our ranks, and soon we began thinking about giving the Oasis a try. I don't like that place too much, since there's no loot (at least not from the crocs), but I agreed that it was a good idea, as with Auriga giving me money in the near future, I might as well concentrate on the experience alone.

<p>Before we went I headed back to Rivervale, to sell off my heavy loot and get that Words of Derivation from my bank, as Uenar found use in such an item, he being a researcher and all.

<p>Once we arrived in the Oasis we all bound at the spot and began moving towards pillar 1. There we brought in a couple of deepwater crocs, but my friends weren't pleased with the spawning rate, so we ventured across the sand banks of this zone. Krackarot pulled a couple of orcs (which proved to be quite a bit more powerful than their thicket cousins).

<p>It became harder though when we were intercepted by a desert madman and a lesser mummy, and our hp meters began tumbling down in a rapid pace. Uenar and his pet took care of the mummy, while the Ogre (as I called him :)) and I dumped most of our mana on the burning madman.

<p>We finally made it through, but not by much. I said we'd better get a move on before we met up with any more of these nasties, and before I was able to click enter to send the message, another popped out of the blue. Thankfully it concentrated on the Ogre (which obviously had a mass of hp) and we were able to take the madman down before it took down the Ogre.

<p>Things went slow after this fight though, and after some aimless wanders I decided I was more comfortable in the West Commonlands. So I said good bye and headed for the zone.

<p>Btw, LJ never spawned this time.

<p>I bound myself near the Kithicor zone entrance of West Commonlands and I carried on with my white kodiak hunting. They were on a good mood now, since they always yielded some kind of pelt (mostly grizzly skins, as weird as it seems :)), and a drow, named Korin, bought my HQ ones for a price of 2pp.

<p>The spawning came to and end though and I found myself mostly running around and exploring (I hate it when that happens, it's not good for my levels :)).  I decided to go back to Rivervale, and check up on Sephy's adventures, now in the shape of a wood elven druid, like myself :).

<p>I couldn't stay for long though, as the time was almost 9pm. I had time to throw a SoW and a levitate on Sephy, but that was it.

<p>Back the next day I gated to West Commons again. Even though I was going to get some money from Auriga at some time now (damn timezones!), I still felt that I should try to make some of my own, just in case someone auctioned that or that item I'd been looking for. I've heard the wisps are one of the best sources of money at my level and I thought I'd give it ago.

<p>There was a great abundance of wisps when I arrived and I think I killed 3 or 4 of them in just a matter of minutes. There were three more over at the lake and I took them down one by one without taking much damage myself. Most of them carried Burned Out Lightstones (useless?), but I did get 3 lightstones, and 1 greater lightstone!

<p>There were some problems attached to the wisp who carried the greater lighstone though. I had just finished up killing another one and found myself ready for this one too. I checked my outside camera for any other players, or griffons for that matter :). I opened with a stinging swarm and it started to float towards me. I engaged it in melee, and let my Glowing Wooden Crook do the rest. All of the suddenly, in the middle of the fight, this drow female appeared and began nuking. I wasn't going to give up on the wisp, so I too began to nuke.

<p>I got the kill and looted it, which gave me the greater lightstone. The drow had vanished once I stood up again and I thought of telling this "kill stealer" a thing or two.

<p>Thanking her for all her help, and informing her that I was now carrying a greater lightstone didn't really brighten her day (it wasn't supposed to either :)). She replied in anger, and informed that I was an anti social screwball :). The conversation continued in /ooc, but it diminished soon, and changed into a wiz - enchanter discussion (don't ask me how :)).

<p>At this time a person auctioned out an FS Scimitar, for the price of 7pp! I've seen these things going for over 20pp in the thicket. I bought it, thinking I'll either be able to make a small profit, or just keeping it as a spare in case of death.

<p>The drow was resting near this person and as I approached she said something in the lines of "Ahh.. here comes to roleplayer". She was obviously refering to my roleplaying colors. I'd found this weird, as she'd been telling me I had stolen her kill, and that she'd called me an anti social screwball (a.k.a kill stealer :)). I wondered if she, or I, had missunderstood the situation. We started to talk (in roleplaying mode, as weird as it seemed), and correctly, there had been a missunderstanding.

<p>It seems that she'd already taken down a wisp, and mesmerized the other one (which I later attacked), so that she could sit down and rest. I'd seen the wisp, but not her (you all know of this bug, monsters are seen from a wider distance than players). Once I DOTed the wisp the mezmeration broke and it was now tagged to me, dooh. I offered her my greater lighstone, but she rejected it, saying that it wasn't necessary.

<p>We even grouped up at the dervs, and we became quite the team too.

<p>Note: Yilbiku, as she's named, is not a drow, but a Erudite (damn those shapeshifting forms :)).

<p>With me, buffed up for melee and her camp controlling spells, we were able to take derv after derv with a very safe tactic. Whenever I was engaged by one too many I'd just run in circles till she'd mesmerized one of them.

<p>What seems very strange though, is that the druid has one spell that beats every lull spell of the enchanter - harmony.

<p>This spell is AE, costs little mana, it's rarely resisted and has a long duration - it's the perfect camp control spell. It baffles me that the druid has this spell, and not the enchanter.

<p>Oh, speaking of spells... a warning to all druids:

<p>It seems that with the recent patch, treeform has been up for a bit of a change. We can no longer move around in it, and casting as a tree is considered to be an exploit. Now, the problem is that when you use treeform, for healing purposes, it doesn't go off (the graphics) when you click on the tree icon to cancel it. The people near the camp will see you as a wood elf again (if you are one that is), but people who have been near the camp, but still at some distance, will still see you as a tree when they approach. When they see you casting and moving, they might call for a GM. The second problem that follows is that the GM will in his/her turn, also see you as you're still in treeform! 

<p>I've had people on me twice now, but luckily for me, there were no gms around to come and give me the "official warning".

<p>This was also posted by some player in the EQSS forum, and the answer he got from an official gm was to NOT use treeform until they have the problem resolved! Totally unacceptable.

<p>I will, and hope others, will continue to use treeform, even though they haven't fixed it. Heck, if I would be caught by a gm, when I had already cancelled treeform, and he'd given me the "official warning", or banning me for that matter, I'd have some real material for this journal to rant about :P.

<p>On the other side of the coin, a person showed me a way to become movable while in treeform. I haven't tested this myself, but he/she demonstrated to me that all you have to do is to throw a snare on yourself. You'll be able to move at a slow speed at first, but once the snare is over you'll be travelling at a normal rate. I wouldn't recommend using this though, as any player can spot a moving tree miles away, and if there's a gm online, you're in bad luck :).

<p>Anyway, back to the story. After a while, a monk, named Kazlur, joined our forces, and it became even easier to take on the dervs. The experience was not as good as it had been a level ago, but it was still good. Yilbiku had to leave soon though, and I too decided to leave the group for Rivervale. It had been awesome, but I was too encumbered to do any real fighting.

<p>Back in Rivervale I sold off my loot and decided it was time for an environment change. I'd been around east antonica for quite some time now, and I needed some refreshing eye candy. I also wanted to get my hands on one of those HQ Lion Skins, and Korin (the bearskin buyer :)) had told me that the best way to get one of those was to kill the lion patriachs and matriachs in East Karana.

<p>I also met up with Nexxis in Rivervale. She'd just made the RunnyGorge treck and she looked nice in all that bronze plate armor. Unfortunately she was a couple of levels ahead of me, but we'd keep in touch.

<p>In East Karana (skipped the part with the RunnyGorge, it's routine now. All these camoflauge runs have put my diviniation from 20 to 60 now :)), I bound myself and headed towards the hill with the lion pride.

<p>The Lion Patriarchs coned blue to me, and they were quite the hazzle to take down. They often hit for an awful 20-30 damage, so I had to come up with some kind of tactic. The panic thing didn't really work here, as even though it just ran a short distance, it would surely attract more lions (there are a bunch of them in East Karana). So, it all came down to open with a DOT and buff my self up with a damage shield and whittle it down with melee.

<p>I did good when I only got to fight one at the time, it got worse though when one patriach and two matriachs teamed up on me :). I DOTed one of the matriachs and used a panic animal on it. Then I did the same with the other one. I guess that would keep them running a while. I then started to DOT and melee the patriarch. I got it down, but I was way low on mana when the other two came back. I quickly looted the corpse and found one of those yellow skins! The matriachs beat me up pretty good, and at the same time I lost my SoW... and my Skin Like Rock. I quickly came down to one bub in life, but I made it in time for the zone border. I sighed in releif and checked out the pelt.

<p>Ruined Lion Skin :(

<p>Also, at one time when I was meditating in East Karana, on the bridge, I was disturbed by some really powefull hits. It seemed that Droon (huge Cyclop) had made it to the bridge and started to take his anger out on me. I quickly did the jump run procedure and made it to the zone border with only 30hp remaining... phew :).

<p>When I was meding on the brigde in North Karana, after the lion fight, Aiin finally came online. I told him I had 30pp to spend and wondered if he had any items for sale. Sure he did, he'd give me an LJ Tunic and a Savant's Cap for that price! He did his teleporting stuff and appeared in front of me in just a matter of minutes.

<p>The LJ tunic is great, with an AC of 12 (!) and a +5 on Stamina. I had some mixed feelings with the Savant's Cap though. Even though it gives me a very well needed +3 on both wis and int, it has no graphics! Atherion looks so cool in a leather cap, and it really bothers me that the cap doesn't show up on the model. And I can't ignore this either, as I always play in chasecam :). Oh well, guess I need to get one of those dragoon dirks and get me that Leatherfoot Raider's Cap asap :).

<p>I'd also spoken to Chalise at this time. She was going to try out Lavastorm with one of her friends. Lavastorm eh? It's about time I try out that place for real now. Chalise was waiting for her friend in Freeport. With Aiin around, I asked where he was.

<p>It seemed that he was just about to zone to Beholder's, coming from East Karana. I told her to hold it and tell him to meet me and Aiin at the bridge, as Aiin was teleporting me to WC anyway. Her friend appeared after a minute or two and Aiin started to teleport us.

<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

<p>You have entered West Commonlands
<br>You have joined the group
<br>a hill giant says "Hit By non-melee for 1 damage"
<br>a hill giant was pierced by thorns.
<br><font color=red>a hill giant slashes YOU for 90 points of damage</font>
<br>a hill giant says "Hit By non-melee for 1 damage"
<br>a hill giant was pierced by thorns.
<br><font color=red>a hill giant <font color=yellow>kicks</font> YOU for 30 points of damage</font>
<br>Aiin says 'move'
<br>You tell your party 'mama!'

<p>:)

<p>Of course there just had to be a hill giant walking around the druid ruins :). He began ripping us a part, but Aiin soon took control of the situation and brought the HG on a merry chase. He told us to go for the zone. Scared as I was I quickly made it to the kithicor zone.

<p>Once I arrived in Kithicor I was told that Chalise's friend had made it out allright and they were both on their way to Lavastorm now. At first it was ment that I was going to come with them, but as always, time had run away. I made plans with Chalise that we might be able to group together on Friday, when I had returned from the hospital. She agreed, and I zoned again, this time to Rivervale.

<p>Back in Rivervale I put away my old snakeskin tunic, told my friends goodbye and logged out.

<p>Too tired to continue with the rest of my story... stay tuned :)

<p><a name=3><b>Journal Entry - 990718 - 1:22pm CET</b>

<p>Waaah!!! I think I'm going mad again.

<p>There's not one single Medium Quality Bear Pelt in all of Norrath, nor is there any kind of lion pelts to be found (except for that _one_ rare ruined lion pelt I have found so far).

<p>When I logged in yesterday, Saturday, Tarrew Marr was filled with people, and most of my friends were online. Thalandin was one of them, and he was busy exploring the icey plains of Everfrost. I thought I'd might as well acquire that Polar Bear Skin (not pelt) while he was there, and he agreed on helping me out. I told him to meet me outside of Blackburrow in a couple of minutes.

<p>I needed to go to the bank first and get rid off some of the pelts I was holding so off I went for a short stop in South Qyenos. On my there I was intercepted by an NPC called Tovax Vmar and his pet skeleton. They both coned green, but it was a pain fighting them. His pet didn't really score many hits on me, Tovax himself was the problem. He kept poisoning me, draining me of whatever I had and kept scoring some nasty hits on me. I concentrated on Tovax and got off two DOTs and a couple of Ignites. Thankfully I had thrown a Shield of Thistles on me and when I had about 2 bubs of life he dropped down. Without having Expulse Summoned memorized I was forced to take his pet down with melee and ignites. I was rather low on mana, but it was enough to knock it down.

<p>I was hoping of looting a book, such as "Controlling your Pet 101" :), but the loot was a joke. I'd killed this superstrong green NPC and his pet, and all I got was a couple of silver and a rusty dagger... grrr. 

<p>I continued along the path, sat down outside of Qyenos, healed up and removed any diseases that I had. After that I proceeded to the bank and put all my pelts (except for the quality pelts) in the bank.

<p>Once back at the Millers I found a person named Spunky who was probably liked by the Millers. I told her I'd give her one of my HQ bear pelts if she could talk to Chanda for me. Turned out Spunky wasn't liked by her either. Spunky told me she'd go to the Miller's Farm and work on her faction though. We agreed to keep in touch.

<p>With that, Thalandin and I proceeded to BlackBurrow. As we zoned, I started to count down once we got inside and if I'm correct, it took less than 10 seconds to hit the Everfrost zone border, and we didn't see a single Gnoll either. The top level of BB can be compared of the newbie section of the misty thicket I guess, not counting those countless trains :).

<p>Ahh... the icey plains again, it's spectacular. The snow reflected my lightstone in a very nice way, and it felt just like Christmas, with the polar bear cubs, the gnoll pups and the ice goblins ;).

<p>We killed a couple of cubs (I felt awful), but all they carried as loot were polar bear pelts. I'd checked twice, and it was a Polar Bear Skin that the Leatherfoots in Rivervale were after. I reckoned it must be buyable in Halas though, and off we went.

<p>With the help of some friendly barbarians we found our way to the entrance of Halas. There were some merchants just outside the entrance, and indeed they sold the white polar bear skins, for the price of 2gp 4sp. I bought two of them, one for me and one for Thalandin.

<p>It was getting darker now, and we decided to treck to West Karana to hunt the lions and bears. I remembered I was bound there and I told Thalandin to meet me there.

<p>There were a lot of Hill Giants around and I had to move from one place to another while I waited for Thalandin. Once he appeared we began hunting. He went linkdead after just a couple of minutes though, and I didn't see him anymore during the night. It became tough hunting animals without Thalandin's tracking, but I was able to get myself another Low Quality Bear Pelt. Now I'll be able to make a belt for Thalandin too.

<p>I didn't get any more quality pelts during my 2 hour hunt though. I'd been auctioning about them and once I heard from a person who two hq lion pelts. Once we had tracked each other down (took about half an hour, I kept running in circles... dooh! :)) I find myself almost buying two HQ _cat_ pelts for 2pp, dooh... :). There were plenty of others who wanted to sell me their HQ cat pelts too, and at one time I popped and became a little harsh on one of the players. I came to my senses and apologized for my behaviour though.

<p>Hunting for pelts is not sane, nor is it logical. I've killed tons of lions so far, and I don't know how many Puma Skins I have received so far :). It's also very dangerous, with the treants patrolling the area. I heard they kill anyone in sight for attacking bears, much like Holly Windstalker in Qyenos Hills. I had one treant sneaking up on me at one time, but when he came close enough I had already killed the bear (thank god I hit for 22dmg with my Glowing Wooden Crook), so I just started to whistle and went along with my business :).

<p>A note on treants. These things look at me amiable, but do they look creepy or what? They are supposed to be servants of Karana and Tunare, but just make them dark blue and you've got the killing machine of Innoruk, both in power and appearance :).

<p>I also checked out the Miller's Farm that Spunky had talked about. There were lots of scarecrows around, and they coned white to me. When inquiring about the difficulty of them through an ooc I was told "very". With that I left and met up with Spunky, who had gotten herself a nice faction. She was able to make me a cloak this time (ac 6, very good) and I gave her my 2nd HQ bear pelt as a token of my appreciaton.

<p>Once back in West Karana again I resumed my killing spree of animals (Oh Tunare, forgive me, but those bearhide boots are really nice). I didn't have much though, so finally I sat down at one of the towers and remained there, chatting with my friends, until I had to log out.

<p>I did have my Polar Bear Skin now, and all I would need now was a Dragoon Dagger. I knew that they were retrievable from the dragoons in West Commonlands, but none of my friends were capable of taking them out. Even Aiin and Silvok would have problem taking one of them down, and they are level 40! Gual couldn't really knock one down either, as it would be hideous for his faction (damn troll :). Newf (who is now 30ish in level) would keep her ears and eyes open for one and so would Chalise.

<p>Also talked to Teslanu (I bound him and his group in Rivervale a while ago), who was in Crushbone (can get a dagger from Dvinn). They'd try getting one, but they'd sell it for about 20pp. I also talked to a person named Vixtor, who agreed on selling one for 15pp once he got one (I think).

<p>Now to the next problem, how do I get there?

<p>I guess I could ask Newf to go get one, as she have the teleporting spells. That would be the least time consuming thing to do, but I wouldn't like to bother her too much (she's done more than enough for me anyway). I'll give her a tell next time I'm in though :).

<p>Another thing. I also recalled seeing a person auctioning out some very nice items in Rivervale some time ago. He was online yesterday and upon asking this Torent, as he was called, I made deals with buying a Lizardscale Mantle and a Blackened Iron Medallion as soon as I would get the money from Audriga.

<p>I'm to check every hour tonight whether he is online or not, and I hope we can come to a quick transaction (I hope he's not like in Felwithe :)). Last time I saw him he was in North Karana, so it won't be a long treck, since I'm bound close to the zone.

<p>So, if all goes well, I'll have four new items (blackened, lizardscale, bearhide boots, dragoon dirk) and enough money to buy at least 5 or 6 spells from the 5th rank. I won't be buying those spells in some time though. I just checked my experience meter and I'm one bubble from 16. So, if I keep up with this current slow leveling I'll see level 19 at the end of the summer. Hopefully, I'll come to my senses and find a zone I'm comfortable with, so that I can level up and get those teleportation spells.

<p>One zone that I'm thinking of is Lavastorm. Even though there are deadly lava pools, and some Dark Elvish guards between that zone and the rest of the "mainland" I think I will give it a go. I'm mostly playing during non peak times, and I should take advantage of that. The good thing about Lavastorm is that I will both be gaining that experience I want and the gold that I really really want (since I'm now an equipment junkie as Chalise told me :)).

<p>On another note, I checked EQ druids and found something called "Black Embroidered Sleeves". Is there anyone out there who knows whether they actually turn out as blackened armor (such as the Banded Orc Vest) or if it's just the old patchwork graphic (or even no graphic at all?)? I'd appreciate any information on this.

<p>Well I guess that's it for now. I'll be playing EQ on Monday and Tuesday, so expect an update on Tuesday. On Wednesday and Thursday I'll be in the Hospital for some testings (I have a screwed up stumach), but I'll be back with more on Friday - Saturday. Untill then, cya!

<p><a name=2><b>Journal Entry - 990717 - 1:01pm CET</b></a>

<p>Woohoo! I passed the driving test! Well... at least the theoretical one. The practical one is still to come :). It won't be next week though, so I'll have 5 days (5x5 hours) to do some EQing.

<p>Anyway, I've actually had quite some time to play. You might think I've powerleveled to 19 as I told you I would, but... no :).

<p>With SoW, Bind and a beautiful character I can not help myself to explore the lands of Norrath, having a chasecam on my wonderful Atherion ;). Now, I have been trying to powerlevel, but explorations have come first.

<p>Last Monday, I realized that I was well ahead of my schedule for the test, so I dropped home early, drove to school and plugged in my computer to their network.

<p>When I logged in I found myself on the tree stump in the thicket where I had camped a day or two ago. The time was at about 4pm my time, so the empty friend's list didn't come as a chock to me (about 400 players on Tarrew at the time :). I moved on checking my other friends though (that can't be placed in the friend's list, damn that 20 friend limit!), and I found Frutti online.

<p>On an earlier treck to the Karana's, I'd seen Frutti and Tyrell being grouped up. It seems that they've known each other for quite some time. Heh, Norrath isn't as big as they want you to beleive it is. This whole game session was not recorded by me though, due to a screenshot error (and I have no chance to remember it without the screenies :). I think I was mostly fighting griffs, reavers and stuff with them though, nothing much to talk about, I hope :).

<p>I asked Frutti what he was doing (he was now level 20), and he replied that he was just trying to max out his spell skills. He couldn't level ahead anymore now, as Tyrell was still fighting off her teens (she was probably at level 16-19 at this time).

<p>That gave me a wonderful idea. What if he helped me kill griffons and stuff? That would give me lots of easy experience (and hence I would be able to gain up on both Tyrell and Frutti, level-wise), while Frutti would be able to max out his spell skills by healing, emergency nuking and buffing.

<p>He agreed on the idea, but told me he wouldn't be on for more than one hour. With that in mind I quickly made it to Rivervale, placed my selling items (derv rings, lightstones...) in the bank and gated to East Karana.

<p>Your gate is too unstable, and collapses.

<p>Uh...?

<p>I'd never seen that message before, and it took me a while to recover :). I dunno whether it's a new message implentation or not, but it sure as hell beats the hell out of "Your spell is interupted", and it would make it more exciting during a combat situation.

<p>I threw another gate and soon the loading took place.

<p>Woah, a direct line sure beats a 28.8 modem. It only took me about 32 seconds to zone to East Karana now. I also figured out that if there would be commercials, it would have to be shorter than 20 seconds, as after that the computer starts working on handeling the data.

<p>It was raining once I got there, and I was ripped off again, not having a beautiful blue sky. Frutti was waiting for me at the Gorge Houses (as they are called).

<p>Frutti knew his way around and we crossed the plains of East Karana and made it to the river with no incidents. There we hunted some gnoll reavers, as there were no griffawns spawning at all.

<p>My exp meter didn't move much though, and during this time I had lost con twice (due to a network thing... I solved it by having ICQ running meanwhile I played though. Read more about it in the tech journal on EQSS). Once I had reconnected for the second time Frutti was about to leave.

<p>Oh, btw. During one of my lost cons I was in the water swimming. I was sure I would drown, but it seems that you are not requiring any air while you are link dead. This is a great thing, give Verant an applause!

<p>[Insert applause here]

<p>Without Frutti around, and the fact that it was dark, I started to dislike the Karanas again. I guess I could have been kiting undead reavers, but if there's something I don't enjoy much, then it's kiting.

<p>Fortunately, there were a drow wizard around, named Bloodburst, who was also level 15. I swallowed my roleplaying colors and decided to join up with this Tier'Dal. We decided to take on the bandit camp near the druid's circle.

<p>Once we got there it was all spawned up (not many hunt these bandits *shrug*) and I seized the opportunity to try out the Harmony spell, which had been updated for the better. Throwing it on a camp we were able to pull out a bandit one by one, without the rest teaming up. It wasn't working 100% of the time down, so once in a while we saw ourselves running towards the zone :).

<p>During one of our escapades to the Gorge we were attacked by a Gorge Minotaur. It was blue for us though, so with just a little damage shielding melee and a nuke or two from Bloodburst, we took it down. It even looted a mino axe, Thalandin will be pleased :).

<p>I also bumped into a quest unknowingly. When we killed Talus Holton, the bandit leader, I looted a Staff Segment, Words of Derivation and a key, labeled H.K. 401.

<p>H.K obviously ment High Keep, but I didn't know what to do with it. I've been asking around though, and followed a discussion over at the Druid's Grove. It seems that you are supposed to give the key to some bank cleric over at HK and that you are given a second staff segment. No one knows what to do after that though. I'm curiously following any updates on this. If you have any information on this then email me at xplorer_21@hotmail.com.

<p>Talus Holton was coning blue-white for us, but he was a bugger to kill. Thank god I had both my Endure Cold/Fire on, or else I would not have made it (had 1 bub of life after all his nuking).

<p>Soon, both a Half-Elf Druid, named Leoo, and Shaska joined up with us. We tried the bandits for a while, but I didn't see one small change on my exp meter. So, I suggested we'd do the river tactic, which Tyrell had previously taught me.

<p>It took some time to get the group where I wanted, but after that we were rolling in reavers and the occasional griffawn. At this time I've also forced my swimming up to an amazing 11 or 12 points. I'll be able to cross the Ocean of Tears in no time :).

<p>The team had to split up after an hour or so though, and I decided to head home to Rivervale to sell off some of my loot. Without Derin or any other person around, I decided to do the RunnyGorge treck alone.

<p>It wasn't that hard though. If I just stay camoed (thank god the gorge is considered to be an outdoor area) there's nothing that can hurt me, except for that rare Evil Eye :). Runnyeye is even easier. I just renew my camo outside the entrance and jump in. The few seconds I'm in Runnyeye (just two or three turns to the left and you're safe) is no problem for even the weakest camo (varying duration.. pain).

<p>Once back in Rivervale I was finally able to sell off my RTS (and thus being able to pay back Aiin the money I owe him for the Glowing Wooden Crook). Silvok, who happens to be a friend of both Aiin and Tyrell, bought it for 20pp and by that I'm free of my dept (ok, so there's 2pp missing... shhh... don't tell Aiin, he won't notice it anyway :).

<p>I also saw a person holding that so called Priest of Discord Staff (a mix between the RTS and the Skull of Jen'thra something). It seems the staff is called "Staff of Writhing", so all of you happy go along necromancers who care about your appearance, go looking for it :).

<p>Oh, I also talked to Marshal Ghobber, and I was chocked when I was finally given a Squad Ring!!! I couldn't beleive it first, and when I saw him saying something else than "You are in good standing... blah blah... keep up the work.. blah" I thought I'd attacked him by mistake and that he was now cursing me to death :).

<p>It was a bit wierd though. As soon as I was given my Squad Ring my faction standing with GuardiansoftheVale got worse, I have no clue why though...

<p>Ah well, I finally got my Squad Ring. I dunno whether I can actually use it or not though. Some people say it's impossible to refill it at a cleric's guild, some say it works. I've also seen people selling these rings for 15pp a piece, and that the ones who buy them are able to refill them, as well as the seller is able to claim himself a new ring. I need to elaborate a bit on this...

<p>The time was running away and I found myself not having enough time to go to the Karanas and hunt again (no use to gate there just to log out :). So I went to the thicket and sold of some of my dervish rings (I have an infinite amount of these, at least it feels like that :). I also did numerous Sense Animals and See Invis'es so to raise my divination (I think it's at 50 now).

<p>I was still ahead of my schedule on Tuesday, and I decided to skip the afternoon for some more EQing. I'd been doing great so far, scoring just one or two points below maximum on all tests, so I felt pretty relaxed about it.

<p>Ryynne was online when I logged in, and he convinced me to come see the vast sandy plains of North Ro. It didn't take long crossing Kithicor and the Commonlands now with a direct cable (30 seconds loading time, I don't even notice them :). I've seen the passage to North Ro on a numerous occations, but once I entered it I had no knowledge on that it would be so far stretched into the mountain wall.

<p>Soon I zoned to North Ro though, and I bound myself to the entrance. Once I exited the tunnel I thought I had come to Tatooine (Star Wars :)), with all the sand banks, and strange sandstone towerlooking thingies. I checked around with caution and made sure there were no sand people, or a Mos Eisley around :). Following Ryynne's description and following the wall to the right I came across a derv camp. Ryynne was here fighting with some of his friends. All of the people there seemed to have some small problems with the crazy spawns of thugs and the wandering madman. 
The Madmen were pretty fun though. I've heard stories of these guys blasting anything within sight. And I must tell you, they do burn with quite a punch. Endure Cold/Fire is a must around these parts.

<p>With Ryynne only being level 12 something I couldn't team up with him. His friend, Creson, who was a level 16 Enchanter, offered to team up with me though.

<p>We stayed at the camp for only a couple of minutes before we decided to try out the caimans and deep water crocodiles in the Oasis. They are told to give huge amounts of experience, so off we went.

<p>Even though North Ro was huge, we didn't have much trouble finding the zone border to the Oasis. We bound near the zone, in case things went bad.

<p>What first struck me in this zone was the abundance of trolls and ogres. At least 50% of the players here were icky smelly figures who were constantly scratching their behinds (nice animation :)).

<p>We placed ourselves at what people refer as the "1st pillar" (I think) and brought in caimans and ordinary crocodiles. They aren't too strong, but they can score some really hard hits. With one of us rooting or snaring, and the otherone DOTing, we could take these things down without much damage on ourselves. It got harder though when we started to feel more confident. Creson decided we could pick on one of those deepwater crocodiles (who coned red to me), turned out we couldn't :).

<p>All kinds of spells were resisted by this beast, and I couldn't even snare it for a safe getaway. I used my newly made macro called "Help me!!! Help me!!!" and fortunately it was working :). Suddenly the deepwater croc was surrounded by a bunch of trolls and it was slowly, but steadily, going down. Creson hit the dust though :(.

<p>After that we decided to stick to caimans, and deep water crocs, coning yellow to me (and thus white to him). We did better now, but it was about to get worse...

<p>LJ!
<br>Waah!
<br>Lockjaw at 1st pillar, zone!!!

<p>:)

<p>I was the first one to spot him in the zone, and as soon as I shouted "Lockjaw!" people were swarming in to watch the fun (and perhaps to get lucky). For you who does not know who Lockjaw is then I can tell you that it's a very big and a very aggressive crocodile who spawns during the hour in the Oasis. It's thanks to him I'm wielding my Glowing Wooden Crook (rare loot).

<p>Lockjaw was pleased with the attention he got, and became busy molesting half of the people in the zone, including Creson. Once he zoned for safety he came after another person, and once he zoned or died he continued to molest the next one... and so on.

<p>I was clever enough to leave a good deal of distance between him and I, and I was left alone while I watched the chaos :).

<p>Someone wacked his hide though, and everything went back to normal again. One person auctioned that he wanted to buy the staff, if any, for his 20pp he had in his pocket :). I have to know if it worked :).

<p>Creson and I killed some more caimans now, but it didn't seem like a long time before LJ decided to come back again, this time even more aggressive than before.

<p>Atherion, Run!!!

<p>:)

<p>I felt a rush going through my body as I ran towards the zone border and checked my outside camera view (I even got a screenshot off :)). There was I, looking like a small strike of paint, compared to this oversized, hungry, aggressive, lethal, crocodile :). I did the jump run procedure though, and mixed with SoW I was able to zone to safety.

<p>On the other side of the border I met up with some fellow adventurers, one named Berannon. I was just about to zone back when he said something like "Hey Atherion, nice site. Enjoyed reading it".

<p>Woah, a player who actually recognized me from this journal, nice (*waves to Berannon*). Unfortunately I lacked the time to stay chatting, and I had to zone back to check on the LJ situation.

<p>He'd been slain by some powerful monk once I returned, and everything was once again put back to normal. I must take a moment of my time again to salute to Verant for implenting this very hillarious crocodile. It makes zone mongering something more than just wack-attack-fetch. I'd like to see more of these kinds of NPCs in the feature, as they offer a great deal of excitement to the average player. I wish there were NPCs like these in the Karanas, that would be fun. I wouldn't like to find NPCs like these in dungeons though (Ambassador Dvinn (Crushbone), Drow Nixx (Paw) to name a few), as it's very cramped and by that it means certain death. Here in the Oasis, people have a way to avoid it though, and, if lucky (or SoWed :)), be able to run away from it.

<p>At this time Creson and I invited another player, named Githean (Drow Fighter I think). With him we could take on even the strongest deep water crocs, but the experience was in no way to be bragged about.

<p>Lockjaw spawned once more before I decided to leave the Oasis for now. I'd gotten a bub of experience during 2 hours or something, and I guess that was fair, considering the situation. What made me leave the Oasis was the shortage of loot though. None of the crocs leave anything sellable, nor gold (which is logical. I cringe when I see some animals leaving coins as loot :)).

<p>I made it alone through North Ro, and once again I considered North Ro to be a somewhat easily navigated zone, despite the vast plains of sand.

<p>While I was on my way through the tunnel I heard that Gual, who was now in Nektulos Forest, was coming to meet me. Cool! I was finally to see the hideous troll that had inspired me to buy EQ.

<p>I sat down in a tree near the entrance to Nektulos and awaited his arrival.

<p>Soon, this huge moving pile of metal, of both shiny and darkish color approached... scratched his butt, and said hello :).

<p>Gual looked awesomely cool, wielding a Gigantic Zweihander (nice name :)). We talked for a while, and he informed me that another one of our old friends, Arjuna, was now under the name of Audriga (I think it was that, gotta check my friends list). He also told me to talk to him if he could give me any money, as Gual had given him about 150pp (!) just a day ago.

<p>He also let me try on one of his bracelets, but they turned out as plate, and if I could choose I'd choose chain looking bracers (chipped bone bracelets... drool). I asked him if he could get me any chain looking bracers. Gual didn't know for sure at the time, but he could give me some Bone Arms, right here right now, for free!

<p>While Gual trecked through Nektulos again, to get to the bank of Neriak I was grasping for breath. He'd give me Bone Arms, that's what Aiin uses, and he's level 40. Wow.

<p>The bone arms had an AC of 5, and +5 on Strength, and a -4 on Dexterity (a pain..). Atherion looked awesome when I tried them on, he looks stylish with those green arms :). Time was running by though, and I had to leave. I thanked Gual as much as I could and sat down and camped.

<p>Now some of you might not like this "twinking" or what the term is for giving items to a low level character. I don't really think it's right either, but looking at the fact that I'm playing under a whole bunch of other rules than U.S and Canadian residents, I feel ok with it. Gual told me before giving me any items, that it is much more fun to quest for the items if you do it yourself, rather than buying or being given the items. Sure, I totally agree with that, but let's review some facts here.

<p>First off, and most importantely, I can't stay around and treck to a dungeon, camp the critter or whatever for some hours (or do a really complex quest for that matter :( ), as I'm paying by the minute here.

<p>Secondly, I'm mostly online during non peak times, and it's hard to find this group of players that you can group with all the time, and thus relying on them as friends. It would be to the border of impossibility to just group up with 5 other random players and go questing for some item, there'd more than one fight on how to do the loot order (not even to talk about who gets the item).

<p>Questing for items works well if you are a group of good friends. You quest together, and give the item to that person that needs it the most, and after that you just go looking for the next item that will work on the next person. I will, unfortunately, never ever experience such a situation, due to my timezone, my rates and my slow leveling.

<p>So the bottom line is, no, I do not have anything against twinking (or what the heck it's called). Sure, it's annoying to see that barbarian in full bronze at level 11, or that level 15 druid with bone arms and a glowing wooden crook (cough... erhrmm...), but considering my options, this will be the way I will acquire items in the future, through gifts or purchases.

<p>Yesterday, being Friday, I had finally passed my test and at 5pm my time, I was once again sitting in school. I had plotted the day very carefully, and my plan was to go to the Karanas ASAP and kill bears and lions for quality bear pelts and a high quality lion skin. With the bear pelts I would then be able to make bear hide armor (excellent for druids) at Chanda Miller in Qyenos Hills. With the lion skin I would be able to make excellent lion gloves in Kithicor Forest, due to some Halfling named Ghen or something. 

<p>Of course, I rarely follow my plans.

<p>Back in Rivervale I met up with Teron (Derin) again. He was a level 13 monk now. I asked him if he wanted to go animal hunting, but he was more thinking of going to Befallen.

<p>Then I came with the idea of going to Paw. We knew we wouldn't be able to kill the High Shamans for the RTSs, but we could kill some nobles here and there for some snakeskin, which is proved to be great armor for both druids and monks.

<p>Teron thought it sounded like a good idea and soon we were doing the RunnyGorge treck again. Before we went we took the opportunity to knock that Nillipus guy down. He was white to me, and yellow to Teron. He didn't seem to be much of a problem in the beginning, but soon both Teron and I were down to our last bubs of life. When he finally hit the ground came the disappointment though, no loot at all (not even the smallest case of JumJum juice :)).

<p>We experienced little problem going through the Gorge. I did spot a wandering Evil Eye though, but he didn't notice us.

<p>I'm getting more and more used of the Karanas now. I can find myself around with ease now in both East and North Karana, it's the mobs that scares me :). Once we came to South Karana we had to know the loc for Paw, but others we were finding our own way just fine.

<p>Once inside I bound and came to the knowledge that Teron could not bind himself, being the Monk he was. I asked him about where he was bound and he replied that he was bound in Rivervale. Rivervale huh? Long treck, hope you don't die...

<p>With both of us being equipped with a map of Paw (the good thing about EQlizer :)) we quickly made our way to the noble plateu (where one noble spawns). We were surpriced when a gnoll guard attacked us, even though it was green. We took it down with ease though.

<p>When standing a short distance away from plateu we coned both the gnoll shaman, the guard and the noble. All except for the noble were green, wereas the noble was blue. I threw a damage shield on both of us and DOTed the noble.

<p>Ack!

<p>All three of them were coming to get us and we positioned ourselves in a combat stance. We both went for the noble, but soon another shaman came and joined in, and Teron found himself struggling against them both. I on my hand, had both the guard and the noble against me. I tried hard and long to get in a invoke lightning. Once I did I got the message that it was an outdoor only spell.. grrr, I hate dungeons.

<p>I took the noble down though and things were starting to look brighter. Then yet another guard came thomping in and wondered what was going on. It became too much, and soon Teron's life was dropping too fast. He yelled out a heal and I dumped my remaining bub on him healing, it was of no use though.

<p>With the situation turning to the gnolls I called out a run and made it for the zone. Teron just dropped and the shamans started to give me their attention. With a drowsy on me I panically followed the markers on my map and with more luck than skill I was able to find the exit. Just as I was about to zone the guard had intercepted me and stunned me. I helplessly saw myself spinning around as two of my bubbles were swiped down under a matter of seconds.

<p>You are unstunned.

<p>Huff! C'mon! *Bashes the keyboard*. My adrenaline kicked in and with shaking fingers I was able to reach the zone border.

<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

<p>Phew... I was now looking at the sky of South Karana through the burrowed hole of Paw, with just having 1 bub of life. Teron reported that he was now in Misty and was on his way.

<p>I decided to make it for the bridge, there I'd be safe until Teron came back. I threw a camo on me and began venturing North.

<p>I think that the Karanas is the only zone yet that I've actually found use of this skill, called Sense Heading. Having it at 80, I can now navigate without much problem. I did get lost once though, but with the use of a friendly player giving the loc of the bridge, I was actually able to use the /loc command to find it.

<p>Teron was in North Karana now, and I sat down and meded back my mana. That's when it happened. Have you ever started to sweat when you throw a friends list, or a /who all Druid when you aren't getting a response? Then you go out of med window just to see those gawdawful numbers turning icky red...

<p>SERVER NOT RESPONDING

<p>Argh, it is responding, it's just that the whole school network had blown a fuse or something. Maybe there was some employee over at the community house (that's where the cable goes), and didn't like the fact that I was using up valuable resources, constantly sending and receiving information? Oh well, I was just about to pack my bags and go home when everything started to boom again, and I could log into EQ once again.

<p>Teron had already recovered his corpse at this time and told me to gate back to Paw. Once inside we made it to the plateu again. It was rarely empty now, and we could take a single spawn after a single spawn.

<p>Once when a shaman spawned we got a wooden totem as loot. I mixed them up with the clay totems when I started to play EQ, thinking it was the clays that gave you those +10mana. It turns out it's the wooden ones, and now I had one of those too. I've checked the vendor's price now and it stands at 1pp at a bad merchant, so I hope I'll be able to sell it for 3pp to some player.

<p>After we'd killed another noble again (still no snakeskin) we both gave up on Paw. Teron wanted more experience and decided to do that treck to Befallen. I didn't complain about the experience (as I didn't care :)), but I wanted the bear and lion armor more than the snakeskin, so I dediced to try out the Karanas.

<p>I didn't know what Karana to try out though (South, North, West, East?), but since Chanda and Baobob Miller where in Qyenos, I thought of getting West Karana a go.

<p>During my treck there I had a close encounter with a Hill Giant. I'd just passed a lot of griffons in North Karana and I decided it was better to put on my camoflauge. So I sat down and memmed it, and when I look up I see this Hill Giant coming my way, being about 5 meters away! Thankfully, it didn't notice me and I could throw on my camo, phew...

<p>Once in West Karana I imediately bound, thinking that this would be a great place to be bound at. I'd be just a stonethrow away from both Qyenos and the other Karana zones.

<p>I decided to go to Qyenos and log out there, as the time was soon 9pm (I have to leave school at that time.. sigh :)). During my treck I spotted a lot of lions and bears and thought that I had come to the right zone. After I had killed a couple of bears I finally got myself a Low Quality Bear Pelt, yay! All that was missing now were a Medium Quality and a High Quality Bear Pelt. I also killed a couple of lions, and on one I found this yellow skin. I was unhappy when I saw that it was only a ruined lion pelt and not a HQ lion skin though.

<p>When I was about to zone to Qyenos Hills I saw a Junth McMannus, either being chased or chasing a little gnome. I put on my camoflauge and investigated the situation. It turned out that this little gnome, whose name was Xinra, was not attacking this Junth because he was a bandit or something, but just to the fact that he was tall :). I told him I was considered to be of a medium small sized race, and with that he let me pass to Qyenos Hills :).

<p>In the Qyenos Hills I announced that I was selling those dervish rings again (price: 5gp) and that I wanted to buy pelts. No one was selling pelts, but people really wanted to buy my rings :). In less than a minute I was out of my 5 rings. I did discover a 6th ring in my bank later on though.

<p>Anyway, time was swooping away (if that's a word) and I was forced to log out in South Qyenos.

<p>Once at home I logged in again, thinking I'm ought to use up those 3 hours that I have on Fridays :). Thalandin was online at this time too, and we agreed on doing some bear and lion hunting in West Karana to get us some neato armor.

<p>Thalandin was level 10 now, and had grown acustomed to the lands near Qyenos. Upon inspecting his equipment I saw that he'd been to Blackburrow himself to get a pair of Onyx Earrings. He was still missing out on some good leather boots though, and he looked silly with those default brown ones :P.

<p>Woah, I have to tell you, tracking rules! With Thalandin's tracking abilities we were able to hunt grizzly bears, brown bears, lioness, lions and a bunch of other things... constantly! The luck shined upon us and we both found ourselves a HQ Bear Pelt, no sign on the MQs though.

<p>After an hour or so Thalandin had to leave and we decided to go back to Qyenos. I had been talking to some people about MQs and HQ lion skins, but their prices were too steep (how's a 3pp for an MQ sound to you?).

<p>So, with my HQ and LQ bear pelt I made it to the Millers. Once I was there I cursed over the fact that I only had plat with me, and no gold coins. Grrr... obviously, they only took exact amounts in gold. Off to Qyenos again then... sigh..

<p>Once I returned (after about 20 minutes...) I had 40gp with me and thought that would be enough. I asked her about a belt and gave her the LQ bear pelt and 5gp.

<p>Tada!

<p>Woohoo, a bearskin belt, with an ac of 4, awesome. Now for the boots... oh.. she needed the MQ for that. So how about the cloak then?

<p>No?

<p>Obivously, I have to have better faction with the guys before asking for any more services... sigh. I coned Chanda and shockingly as it was, she looked at me apprehensively. God lord she didn't attack me :).

<p>Oh well... no need to go MQ hunting then if she won't make me any armor... sigh.

<p>With that I started to aimlessly walk around in the Qyenos Hills, thinking on what to do now. The time was close to midnight already, and I was thinking about hitting the sack, just when...

<p>...Auriga came online!

<p>He was level 14 now, and was in North Karana. I asked him about the money and he told me he could give me 90pp next time we met up with each other. Woah! 90pp! I'm rich! Hopefully I'll be able to buy myself both a Lizardscale Mantle and a Blackened Iron Medallion (ok, so I've done some research on the equipment side :).

<p>I had to leave at this time though, but Auriga and I decided to try to do the "transaction" on Sunday, when he wouldn't be working (damn timezones!).

<p>And that's where I am right now. So... afterwords. Well, with the Bone Arms I've become very very equipment freaky. I'd do anything to get myself some high level druid armor that turns out as chain, cuz boy does it look cool on Atherion? I'm also interested in buying a lot of wis increasing material, such as the aforementioned Lizardscale mantle and the blackened iron medallion. I still need to save some of my money for the rank 5 spells though, I heard they cost a lot of money.

<p>I've also done some checking on quests. But I've tried to be as modest about it as I could, cuz I don't want to spoil the game by reading every quest there are. I did check up on the quests in Rivervale though, and I found the Leatherfoot raider's quest to be something in my interest. For that I would need a Dragoon Dagger and a Polar Bear Pelt. I hope Gual could help me out on the Dragoon side, but I guess I could go get that Polar Bear Pelt in Halas the next time I log in to play.

<p>Speaking of towns, I must not do the same mistake I did last time I went to Qyenos, missing out on visiting Erudin. I'll do that this weekend for sure, as I'm dying to know what the most "civilized" city will look like.

<p>That's it for now.

<p><a name=1><b>Journal Entry - 990703 - 11:11am - and 990710 - 2:13pm</b></a>

<p>Hey all,

<p>Did you know that it's forbidden to run a stop sign? :)

<p>I'm halfway through driver's school now and I finally have some time to work on the journal. You might think I've been sloppy with my EQing too and only been at the boring dervs, but boy are you wrong :). Can you spell <nobr>E-v-e-r-f-r-o-s-t?</nobr> That's as far as I've been by now. Read on.

<p>It all started one week ago. When I logged in in Rivervale again I checked my friends list and saw that Derin was online. He was fooling around in High Pass and it got me thinking about going to Qyenos. With both of us having bind now (Derin was level 14 at this time) and me SoWing we could probably take the Karana treck with little problem.

<p>Derin agreed and he returned to Rivervale. He also informed me that Sephy was now a Gnome Wizard or something (and he told me he'd found his class as a ranger, yeah... right :).

<p>Once Derin returned we sat down and buffed up. We decided to do the Runneye/Gorge treck, as it would probably be safer than going through High Pass and then have to treck through the whole East Karana (which is far from safe :).

<p>I was now playing with my 28.8 modem again, and those commercials could sure come in handy :). With my 28.8 I have an extreme downloading phase, compared to when I'm using my school's line. The information flows down pretty good in school and my computer is actually forced to keep track on everything. Now when I use my 28.8 modem my computer have to wait during the loading time to download the itsy last pieces of information, thus making commercials a good thing :). It couldn't come true though. The majority of the people playing EQ are mostly using 56k modems or better. I'm not sure how it's on a 56k modem, but with a cable modem you wouldn't get to see much commercials (or wouldn't like to see commercials, as it would, for you, increase zoning time).

<p>Anyway, from the thicket we zoned to Runnyeye. But before we did, I threw a camo on us. Even though camoflauge is considered to be an outdoor only spell, it does not stop working once you enter a zone which is considered to be an indoor one. If it runs out inside, you can't recast it, that's it.

<p>So, with SoW and camo on we safetly stuck to the paths turning right and soon, after only a couple of seconds of running, we hit the zone border. Before we zoned I saw a strange sight. I saw my old friend Darelduin sitting down and meding, now in the shape of a High Elf wizard again. Derin obviously knew him too, as he said "Hi" in Swedish to him. I had asked Darelduin on an earlier notice if he was a Swede (at that time he was a druid too), but he said no. Wierd... maybe there's a Dureldain as well? :).I didn't take much notice to it at the time though, as I was more than busy keeping myself alive.

<p>It was daylight when we entered Beholder's Maze, and it was much more appealing now, with the blue sky and all. I thought we'd come to the wrong place, as it looked so much different at nighttime, when I had last been here, running from Evil Eyes :).

<p>This time we hugged the wall, taking all the paths to the left. I tried to climb the wall as Derin, but at one time I fell down for 131dmg as a result. Atherion looked really helpless when he fell down in a rapid pace, with his arms waving :). I decided to stick close to the wall, and walk on the ground. We spotted some Muddite Minors, but they coned blue, and didn't seem to be very aggressive. I also spotted a minotaur who was being occupied by some high level people.

<p>Soon the "canyon" ascended and the blue sky was more and more covering my monitor, and soon we zoned.

<p>Phew! I made it through Runnyeye and the Gorge, I guess it's not too much of a slaughterhouse :). It's fairly easy to find your way around, and with SoW and camo on I guess one could make it through fairly safe, alone.

<p>You have entered East Karana

<p>Woah!!! I don't think I've ever seen a zone that has looked so "druidish" before. Unlike the Faydark and the Thicket, this place has a sky. It was raining when I first arrived, but it would change soon, and this beautiful blue sky filled up the screen. It's more forest looking, but at the same very plains looking as well. The roads are what I first laid notice to though. Have you ever thought that the paths in the Faydark and the thicket has been very unlogically placed, twisting every yard or so? Well, the paths in Karana are broad and do NOT twist, wonderful :).

<p>We bound ourselves and rebuffed at the zone border and got ready to cross the mighty plains (forest, whatever) of the Karanas. After only a couple of steps we'd lost each other though :). A Lion Matriach attacked me but Derin appeared and we could take it down. I don't know whether it coned green or blue, but anything above green would probably eat me alive, having only a couple of points in 2h blunt. It felt strange meeting up with lions and stuff here though. With the rain (and thus the grey default sky) and the spruce and pine looking trees a lion didn't exactly fit in :). On a more thorough examination, the karanas is mixed with a lot of different trees, anything ranging from swamp looking trees to spruce looking combinations... *shrug* :).

<p>I also saw Maksatpa, probably being grouped with some other guys. She and her group was fighting griffons, and what an impressive sight it was. I don't know how they can stay in the air with only one wing flap every 4 seconds though :).

<p>As the roads were eveything but safe (lots of bandits, icky "animals", griffons, carrion spiders, etc...) we climbed the mountain to our right and continued along it. We passed a druid circle, inhabitated by several treants. They look like murder trees with red glowing eyes, so I was very pleased when they coned amiably to me.

<p>We continued though (I dunno whether the trees liked Derin or not) and soon the mountain took us to a body of water. We followed it to the left (south I think) and soon I gazed on one heck of a sight - the bridge of Karana. I have to give some credits to the graphic guys over at Verant. It was an amazing creation, and it actually fitted to the area. It could have been a creation by the gnomes, but I felt something druidish about it :). And instead of turning out to be like a futuristic freeway thingie in the middle of a medieval setting, it actually seemed to boom with magic activity, I liked it.

<p>North Karana wasn't much different from the East. It had tons of griffons though, and Derin and I had to run with Camoflauge and Sense Invisible to make our trip a little bit more secure (I actually don't know whether griffons can see through camo or not).

<p>I still had an enormous loading time, and I guess it could be because of the size of the Karana zones. Sheesh... without SoW we'd never made it across within 2 hours :). I don't even want to think about how it would be like to just leave the road and run around and actually explore the zones. Heck, you could get lost forever if you don't know how to work the /loc command (which I still suck at).

<p>In West Karana the area turned out newbie'ish, compared to the other Karana zones. The griffons disappeared in number, and only an occasional Hill Giant could be seen over the horizon. We also found a wisp or two to fight, including the rare bandit. 

<p>I guess this has been deliberately made by the constructors of Norrath. It has it's good sides, but bad ones as well. First off it's practically made. After you've been in zone x and leveled up all you have to do is to go to the zone y to the east. It reduces the zone nuisance to players, but... it proposes "zone mongering". This is a good thing for those who want to level safetly and steadily, but I can still see some problems with this. 

<p>People _are_ becoming more and more level oriented in EQ. With this layout of zones, few people will be interested in travelling to places far far away. The only reason would be to go to just that extremely good zone which is made just for the levels a-b.

<p>This is the way I've been playing EQ so far, and by that I have in no way played Everquest the way that I would get the most out of it, fun- and excite-wise.

<p>Now I'm not saying that it would have been better with having, let's say... Solusek B (one of the deadliest dungeons in the game) just a walking distance from Qyenos. No, what I would like to see are zones that are not "level 1-10" and "level 11-20", but instead much more mixed in difficult. 

<p>As it is now, you could allow a feature for players telling what difficulty the zone has once they enter it.

<p>You have entered East Karana.
<br>You are now in a hard difficult area, watch your back!

<p>Let the Karanas, for example, have basically the same things in the zones. Make it so that players would be rewarded to actually explore the zones, and let the zones have unique places (not camps :) to go to, without making it like it is now. For me, the Karanas (and various other zone combinations) could be compared as ladder system, where each zone is resembled as a step, and I don't like that all.

<p>Anyway, back to my story. Once we finally came to the Qyenos Hills we bound once again and saw ourselves in a zone which could be resembled to the thicket in difficulty (see the pattern here? :). Turning and heading right from the entrance to West Karana we soon came to what looked like a Gnoll jaw, sticking out of the mountain wall. This was nothing near of what I thought BlackBurrow would be like. It looked more like an elevator system where the game wanted you to go down to zone monger level x-y, sigh.

<p>Some of you might disagree with me on this, but let me tell you that there are some remarkable sights of unlogical thinking in this game. For example: How in Tunare's name can Blackburrow be located just a hill away from Surefall Glade? It makes no sense. I mean, why don't the Royal Guards of Qyenos just amass their whole staff of guards and go thomping? That, so called, "infestion" would be gone before they even knew what hit them.

<p>It's the same in every town, almost. Kelethin and Felwithe got Crushbone just a short distance away. Rivervale got Runneye and Beholder's Maze.

<p>Now Crushbone is pretty ok, because the Faydark is huge, and I guess a balance between the elves and the orcs could be accomplished during a short period (afterall, we are in the Age of Turmoil). I still think that Crushbone was placed there because it's just practical to place it there.

<p>The Rivervale situation is acceptable though. The guardians have put up a wall in the middle of the thicket and by that they can resist the onslaught of the goblins. The goblins in their turn can withstand the vale patrol because of their king, the shamans and the evil eyes, thus making it like a very slow war, such as the situation in WWI with all the trench thingies. I don't think Runneye was placed there as a practical cause either, because the level variation between the thicket and Runneye varies a good bit.

<p>What I mean is that dungeons should not be close neighbours with towns. Dungeons are, imho, places were "evil" have amassed without much resistance by the "good", hence they should be located a good distance from towns.

<p>With these "goody goody" located dungeons, people do not tend to favor travel. Take Paw for an example, it's in South Karana, which is a couple of zones away from any town. It has zilch people whenever I'm online (the record stands at "6" so far). I have yet to see the situation during peak times, but I wouldn't count on it swarming with people there.

<p>Anyway, drifting away here :). Let's go back to the story. On our way to Surefall Glade we came upon some strange ruins. Obviously it was swarming with undead, anything from a putrid skeleton to those gawdawful dread corpses. Our comunication was not exactly on our peak and instead of standing still thinking about how to act, I just ran for it.

<p>a putrid skeleton hits YOU for 16dmg.
<br>a putrid skeleton hits YOU for 9dmg
<br>a putrid skeleton tries to hit YOU, but misses!

<p>What the? How could it still be hitting me when I'm standing at the firecamp with Chanda and Baobob Miller? There wasn't a skeleton in range... maybe he DOTed (Damage Over Time) me?

<p>Oh well, Derin seemed to have the situation under control and we engaged the skeletons again. The dread corpses weren't more than a nuisance now at level 14, and with help from a fellow wood elf, we took them all down.

<p>At first when I saw Surefall I thought it either was another dungeon or Qyenos itself. I never thought Surefall Glade would be located in some kind of cave, ugh. When I later entered the place it had this dark feeling over it too, lacking a sky. That was a huge disappointment for me, and it got even worser when I found out that it didn't have a bank either.

<p>We bound outside Surefall and agreed on trying out Blackburrow for a while, since that was one of the reasons we'd come here: getting the Onyx Earrings (1ac 2agi).

<p>Before we ventured in we buffed up with everything we knew. Heck, my effect list covered a whole row of icons :).

<p>Blackburrow turned out to be pretty ok though. On the first level you couldn't tell if you'd entered Blackburrow yet, as there was green grass, a waterfall and a sky (I think). A train of gnolls convinced me that we'd come to the right place, and we began venturing down in the search of encountering a Gnoll Commander.

<p>While it had been a Sunday trip on the "surface", it differed a lot when we came down in the tunnels. A couple of Elite Gnoll Guards spawned and after a tough battle we had no choice but to retreat. I threw a camo and tried making it for the entrance, but I couldn't find myself out of this tunnel maze. Derin still had his gnoll on him and later I saw him go down. With that I had no choice but to gate to safetly.

<p>I was down to less than 2 bubbles so I threw a treeform on me (to heal faster) and sat down at the Blackburrow entrance. Derin had almost made it out, and was already inside fetching his corpse. We filled up our bars and decided to bind just inside Blackburrow. That way we would take away the gruesome loading time and use it as a safe getaway.

<p>Derin had already been acustomed to the area and used the hole at the waterfall to drop down into to save some walking time. He told me to do the same, but the pool of water underneath got me thinking. Then I realized I had levitate, and with a glimpse in my eyes I floated down and hit the bridge :).

<p>The next few minutes we're to become a total mess of fighting. Thankfully we'd invited an elven ranger to join our ranks, which btw had a very cool _black_ vest. Upon inspection I saw that it was a "Banded Orc Vest". Too bad it didn't work on druids :).

<p>Aldafea, as his name was, turned out to be quite the fighter, wielding his 2h sword. With a couple of buffs and a damage shield he could go on his own, leaving me and Derin to defend ourselves against the mass of gnolls.

<p>The "Commander room" was cleaned out of gnolls, and it looked like a major battlefield, and in the middle, Aldafea was standing, wielding his 2h sword. Woah did it look cool? :).

<p>After being interupted in my meditation a couple of times from annoying patrolling gnolls we finally saw a Gnoll Commander spawning. He didn't turn out to be much of a problem, and when I looted it I saw an Onyx Earring! As the other's already had one or two, I got to keep it.

<p>We didn't get our hands on another commander though, and Derin had to go soon. I was already tired of Blackburrow (I still hate dungeons) so I gated to the exit when Derin had logged out.

<p>Not knowing what to do I took the time to explore the Qyenos Hills a little. The area was not much unlike the West Commonlands or the Karanas, with it's blue sky and lush green grass. The hills drove me nuts though, as I mostly use chasecam. Going down a hill I couldn't see much below me, and climbing up on a hill I couldn't see much above me :). There wasn't much to check out though.

<p>I also remembered that I had a couple of Cutthroat Insignia Rings (derv rings) lying around in my bank. I could always sell them, as those would probably be pretty rare around these parts. Auctioning out a price of 6gp ("normal" price is 2-3gp, or so I've heard) I imediately got 2 replies. Hmm... maybe it was too cheap anyway :).

<p>As the rings were in the bank they guided me to the bank of Qyenos.

<p>Ugh, Qyenos... At first, it reminded me a lot of Wayrest (a town in Daggerfall), with the banners and the city walls. But inside it reminded me more of a dungeon. There were no huge areas to walk, instead everything was just placed in a cluster of houses everywhere, with just very narrow paths to walk.

<p>And people say Kelethin is a bad place for newbies? :)

<p>Once we finally came to the bank I sold a off 3 of my 5 rings (I gave away a lot of them in West Commons). I later announced a price of 1pp, but people weren't buying that (nor the rings :). I did sell off 2 rings for the price of 1.5pp though, which was pretty good.

<p>The bank itself was pretty dull though. The banker windows were pretty cool, but I didn't like what I saw in the background. This big safe was occupying the whole wall. A safe? Some people may argue with me, but I didn't think it fitted in.

<p>I also saw the clocktower. I dunno what to think about this one :). It's one of these unique things I've been ranting for, but it felt somewhat high tech for me. But maybe it was a gift from those tinkering gnomes, who knows? :)

<p>While I was sightseeing I also met up with a Wood Elf named Twen. He'd been grouped with Thalandin the other day in the West Commonlands. We decided to group up for a little bit and he'd show me around.

<p>Out in the Qyenos Hills we encountered a gnoll named Gnasher Furgutt. As soon as I saw his name I recalled something about a ranger's quest I'd been reading about weeks ago. We took him down easily (he only being blue) and indeed his corpse yielded a head and a note.

<p>As soon as he was dead we saw a shout across the zone from someone named Amnion, whether anyone knew the location of Gnasher. I told him we'd just killed him, and he asked whether I was going to use the head and the note or not. As I knew this quest involved an executioner scene and that it was an interesting quest, I would. Amnion was nice enough to come with me and help me solve it, as well as giving me the background story of the quest.

<p>It seems that there's a barkeep in Qyenos who are having Blackburrow ale smuggled into his bar. Now, Gnasher Furgutt is the person he meets to deliver the beer. The ranger Larsk Juton in Surefall knows about this and sends you to stop this meeting by killing Gnasher. By getting the note you now have proof that the barkeep is up to no good. You're told to report this to Captain Tillin in Qyenos, and Tillin hates gnolls. Let the fun begin :).

<p>Amnion grouped up with me, as he wanted the faction increase as well, and since he was kind enough to help me with the quest, that was the least I could do to him. When giving the head to Larsk I was given some exp, some silver, a tattered cap and the faction adjustment. After that I gave him the note and I was rewarded with some more exp, some more silver and some more faction adjustments. It was now when I was told to go to the captain in Qyenos. No, not to Qyenos again :).

<p>I was still like a lost kitten in Qyenos, but Amnion knew his way blindfolded. We came to the arena, and I saw that by stepping on the bloody floor you went PK active. Eww... if this had been UO there would probably been 10 kEwLd0oDs waiting for me to do that wrong step. Fortunately, there were none around and we made it to Captain Tillin.

<p>I hailed him and gave him the note. He said there would be an executioner to deal with this matter soon and I was rewarded with some more exp, some more silver, some more faction adjustment and... a Medal of Merit (+5 charisma).

<p>Amnion showed us the way to the bar where the rumble would take place and I got my screenshot button ready. Soon a female, dressed in full silvery plate and wielding a _big_ axe, came and started to fight the barkeep. It was fun as long as it lasted, cuz it only took 3 or 4 hits to turn out the lights on the barkeep :).

<p>All in all this has probably been my most enjoyable (and rewarding) quest so far. I made tons of exp, made somewhere around 1gp in money, received a tattered skullcap (1gp) and the medal of merit.

<p>I thanked Amnion and Twen for accompanying me. They were going to some Temple, and I was bored out of my socket with Qyenos, so I gated back to Surefall.

<p>Now came another time when I didn't know what to do. I couldn't go bear hunting for bear pelts (and this being able to make bearskin armor at Chanda Miller), because there seems to be some NPCs wandering about in the hills, killing anyone fighting bears. That wouldn't be a good thing to add to my druid record :).

<p>I thought about disconnecting and call it a night (I had already played for about 4hrs anyway), but then Wintereyes contacted me. I asked her if she could show me around in the icey plains, and sure she could. Cool :)

<p>As to get to the Everfrost Peaks, one must cross Blackburrow. So, she picked me up outside of Blackburrow and we got ready to make a run for it. It turned out to be easier than I thought though, because we never left the top level. In about 10 seconds of running, we were zoning to Everfrost :).

<p>Woah, the icey plains were nice. It was dark once we got there, and my lightstone made some cool reflections to the bright snow. Unfortunately this zone was also missing out on a sky layer. Instead it had this dull greyfog, not much unlike the ones in Misty and the Faydark.

<p>Wintereyes informed me that there was a wood elf killer in this zone too, named Tundra Jack. I saw him from a distance in the snow rift and he looked apprehensively towards me, not a good sign. He even had a pet polar bear, so fighting him was not an issue. It would be cool though to return to him in about 10 levels, charm his ice bear, and by that kill him :P.

<p>Anyway, Wintereyes went out fetching mammoth calves. Phew... those things are big, and hard hitting! They coned blue though, but I'd never been able to take one down by myself. I felt stupid once we'd killed a couple of them though. I felt like a poacher taking the tusks. And when I took a screenshot of Atherion standing over a dead calf it just struck me... I was a druid and I had my roleplaying colors on... ehehehe.... what? :)

<p>I walked around for a bit and checked around what other things you could encounter here. The snow goblins looked freaky, with them being all blue and all. The Snow Orc Troopers looked cool though, with their skin being dark purple and having a white fur tunic on their body.

<p>We decided to leave the frosty plains after a while and I was once again in Qyenos Hills. Wintereyes needed to leave and I didn't know what to do again. I explored the Hills a little bit more, but there was nothing that caught my eye. So, with the time being 2am in the night, I decided to call it a night.

<p>As you noticed, I've turned on my roleplaying colors again. I'm no longer powergaming for levels, so I might as well try out and roleplay my Atherion now. It's been going quite ok, with only minor incidents. One thing bothers me though. Being a Wood Elf I don't feel like I should be talking Elizabethan English (thou's and thee's), nor should I speak like a ruffian, with the ye's and the speakin'. And I can't talk like a troll either :).

<p>So all this leaves me to plain and simple... English. It doesn't bother me too much, but it's times like these that you feel like it would be fun to be a troll, "not speakin like dem hummies!" :). I'll keep working on my Atherion though, at this time (one week later) I've spent a total of 4 days and 10 hours, and I'm in no way throwing that away for an impulsive feeling :).

<p>Logged in the next day, not really knowing what to do. Derin had already gotten his Onyx Earrings and had now travelled back to Butcherblock.

<p>I didn't want to venture into Blackburrow again, so I threw an auction message across Qyenos Hills, that I wanted to buy some Onyx Earrings. A player named Egon replied and told me he sold them for 2pp each. Hmm... 2pp seemed pretty much at that time so I told that I'd contact him later.

<p>As I was running back to Qyenos to check my fundings and grab anything that I could sell I bumped into Gnasher again. Woah, I thought. I can get another one of those medal of merits and maybe sell one for good money in Rivervale (as all halflings have sucky charisma).

<p>I snared him and engaged him in melee. I soon found out that my 7 or whatever in 2h blunt wasn't enough, so I quickly snared him again, ran away a bit, and equipped my scimmie. It went better now and soon he was down to half a bubble... that's when I saw my lag meter going red....

<p>Server Not Responding

<p>Dooh... I tried to get connected to the login server, but that didn't work either. Apparently, my modem had done one of those flipflops again, and I had to restart my computer.

<p>When I finally returned, Gnasher was dead and no one had looted him (thanks, whoever stumbled across it :).

<p>With the note and head I did the whole procedure again. When I had given Tillin the note I checked my inventory... but the other medal of merit couldn't be found. It turned out that the LORE ITEM means that you can only keep one at the time... dooh...

<p>While in Qyenos I took out anything that I could sell, anything ranging from rusty scimitars and worn greater staffs. I checked around for a good merchant in Qyenos, but I couldn't find one. All the people at the market stands looked at me apprehensively and would only give half the price of what the item actually was worth (rusty scimitar for 6sp? yeah right...). I cursed Qyenos again for being such a hostile town, and headed for Surefall.

<p>Just as I zoned to Surefall I was told by Derin that there were no merchants in Surefall... great. Turned out there was a fletcher there who looked at me amiably and was more than happy to give me the full price for the items I sold. The mammoth tusks sold for 2gp 5sp 3cp which was pretty good, and already did I have 2pp 8gp.

<p>I also took the time to find the druid's guild and used up 36 of my remaining 66 practise points on 2h blunt. I thought of just giving it 6 points and I thought that would take me to at least average. I was pretty disappointed when this wasn't the case. It seems that each practise point only gives exactly one point increase in a skill, ugh :). Oh well... with my 36 points I was able to boost it up to bad, but it costed me 1pp as well.

<p>When I left Surefall I bumped into Gnasher once again. I thought I could always sell my medal of merit BEFORE giving the note to Tillin again. Unlucky was I though, when Gnasher only had his head as loot :(.

<p>Anyway, with my remaining 1pp 8gp I was able to buy an Onyx Earring from Egon (thanks for the barter :), and I decided that my time in Qyenos Hills were at an end.

<p>I love the areas around Qyenos, but I hate the fact that there is only a bank in Qyenos. I've been doing everything to avoid Qyenos so far, but it's pretty impossible. From Surefall you'd have to treck a whole zone (Qyenos Hills) which takes about a couple of minutes. Then you need to zone to Qyenos, which takes another 2 minutes. After that you have to go to South Qyenos or whatever, and that zoning takes an additonal 2 minutes. Then when I've been there I gate back to the fireplace outside of Surefall, which takes an additional 2 minutes. That is 10 minutes total, just to get to the bank and back. If I had a cable modem or something it wouldn't bother me, but with this 28.8 modem I just have to get out of Qyenos :).

<p>So I decided to get myself back to Rivervale, alone. It was daylight and the sun was shining when I entered the West Karana, and it was very beautiful. When I walked to the houses to my left this flute tune kicked in and it was so nice that I took the time to meditate up to full mana :).

<p>When I was halfway through the West Karana I came across a small farm. It was night now so I approached with caution. It seemed the inhabitants looked at me apprehensively, and I decided to stay clear from it and any other farms in the region.

<p>Later I saw two bandits standing on the road in front of me. They both coned blue, and I decided I'd probably be able to knock them down with a damage shield and a couple of lightnings.

<p>It went better now, waving my staff, and with the help of my spells I took them both down without loosing more than 2 bubbles of life. One even yielded a bronze weapon, which I later sold for 2-3pp.

<p>In the plains of North Karana the difficulty tuned up and I made sure that I had my camoflauge up at all time. It was still night so I didn't take the time to explore, instead I carried on, following the roads which read "High Pass Hold". Without any problems, I made it to the bridge which would lead me to East Karana.

<p>There was a person named Banelor there who sold some RTSs (Runed Totem Staffs, +5hp +5mana dmg: 9 delay: 37) for the price of 15pp. I thought it was a fair price, so I told him to try keep one for me until I had enough money.

<p>I knew my way from here with ease and I was soon at the druid circle again. I coned the treants again, and now they looked at me indifferently, and not amiably, as they had when I first trecked these plains. I messaged Soma for an explanation and he told me it was because I had my camoflauge up. Phew... I thought I'd killed an animal by mistake.

<p>At the entrance to the Gorge, two persons, named Pagar and Sivilar, escorted me safetly to the Misty Thicket. Next time I'll be able to do it by myself :).

<p>Awww... what a sight it was, the thicket :). Green lush grass, and not one single mob that could hurt me :). On my way to Rivervale I gave some belts to Budo, but I was still not entitled to wear one of those squad rings.

<p>I had about 5pp in the bank now, and since I didn't have enough time to treck to the dervs, I thought about giving my trade skill a try. And it's called "Binding and SoWing at the bank, donations accepted!" :P

<p>I'd never thought I would get more than a couple of gold for a bind and a SoW. Woah, was I surpriced when I made 10pp in less than 30 minutes? :). 

<p>I now had enough for that RTS Banelor had auctioned for in the Karanas, but I had forgotten his name at the time (checked my screenshots later :) so I couldn't contact him. There was a druid in Rivervale who sold one though, but he wanted 20pp for an RTS, and no less. He did offer me to give me one for my 16pp and my two wis rings... yeah, right :).

<p>Time had flown away and I decided to call it a night.

<p>The day after that I logged in once again. Derin was level 15 and in Crushbone now. Thinking that I would probably not have the time to write the things I'm writing right now I decided to go to the Dervish camps. That way I could sum it up to you that I'd been at the dervs all the time during driver's school and by that I would be able to study my drivers thingies right now, turned out I didn't :).

<p>The dervs were filled up with mobs and there were no other players around. I killed a couple of wisps, but I only got one ordinary lightstone and some burned out ones.

<p>A Halfing druid, named Hawkens, was looking for a party and I offered him to join me. Now we were two druids who didn't know what to do :). Then I suddenly came with the bright idea of going to Lavastorm (and I who wasn't supposed to go travel now when driver's school was coming up :). He thought it was a good idea, and we began our journey.

<p>We made it to the Nektulos entrance with little effort and we prepared ourselves to make a run for it, passing all the guards that would perhaps be located all over the zone.

<p>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

<p>I was prepared to be KOS (killed on sight) as soon as I entered the forest, but it turned out that both  Hawkens and I were safe where we were standing. I shouted across the zone if there was any drows around that would betray their own kind for some money, and sure there was :).

<p>A dark elf rogue, by the name of Fenia, appeared.

<p>*Xplorer stops typing and comes back one week later, Saturday the 10th*

<p>Okay, let's see if I remember this correctly.

<p>She scoffed at me, offering her 2gp a person to take us safetly to Lavastorm, but with some bartering she agreed.

<p>Hawkens lost connection at this time, and didn't come back. Fenia and I decided to make it without him. I threw a camo on me and a See Invis on Fenia, and off we went.

<p>Following the road we finally came to the critical area, the bridge. Luckily, my camo hanged on and I could safetly slip through the guards standing there.

<p>Nektulos forest was as dark as the thicket, if not even darker. I don't remember off-hand what creatures I saw, but I think I passed one or two fire beetles. I also saw some troll players, and boy do they look cool? :)

<p>Anyway, we safetly zoned to Lavastorm and I gave Fenia her 2gp. She said something about "not much of a profit, but a profit still" and off she went, disappearing into the shadows again.

<p>I have to tell you; Lavastorm is creepy! When I arrived it was night and there was this icky music playing through my speakers. I thought that there'd be a Giant Dracula waiting for me, and I sure wasn't moving to check it out :).

<p>When I had just bound myself where I thought I was safe a goblin scout came running towards me. Not liking his redish color I quickly made myself up on the wall, avoiding him at all cost. Up in safety I coned him.. it was blue.

<p>I didn't want to risk fighting where my binding place where so instead I threw a camo on myself and started to contemplate on the situation. The goblin soon ran away again and I sat down to meditate.

<p>A drow elf, named Saddith arrived. Noticing she was in the same guild as Soma (Seekers of Lore), I hailed her and tried to get as much information as possible about Lavastorm. As we were talking the goblin came back and this time it spotted me. I imediately threw an ignite on it and I was more than shocked when I saw that it resisted it 100%. Shaking my head in dispair I threw a lightning on him. Boom... 6pt of damage... argh. Saddith joined in though, and with the help of her elemental tank, we were able to take it down. 

<p>Hmm... fire not working on nothing here? Ick.

<p>After I had rearranged my spell list (replacing ignite and lightning with whirling wind and cascade of hail, and throwing a endure fire on myself), we decided to group up.

<p>Saddith guided me to the entrance to Najena and told me that this was a good fetching place. I wasn't sure about that, because the lava pools nearby really looked scary. It did turn out to be a good place though, as both eles and fire drakes where spawning here and there.

<p>Lavastorm also became a much friendlier place overall when the sun came creeping in. For a moment, I grew fond of it.

<p>While fighting a fire ele I tried out my expulse summoned for the first time, and it did a whooping 86dmg on the eles, making them go after me with just a couple of nukes... dang :).

<p>The fire eles varied greatly in power though, and we were forced to make it for Najena when a yellow one came after us, right after we'd fought a fire drake.

<p>I didn't stay in Najena for long. A connection failure made me go offline with a big skeleton standing right nearby. After I came back it was still lying there. At this time I didn't have time for anymore EQing so I had to log out. I threw my gate and sat down near the wall and camped.

<p>Lavastorm was a really scary place, and without my powerful fire spells (and the fact that your corpse might just "vanish" when dropping into lava) I decided to leave Lavastorm the next time I logged in.

<p>(Note: I have no idea when I've been playing these sessions, I only have my screenshots to go on, so excuse me if you get lost in the timeline somewhere, I sure have :).)

<p>When I logged in again I saw Thalandin online. He was now level 9 and in the Qyenos area. I guess he'd finally taken that trip, and was now able to train up his kick (which he got at level 5) and his spell skills.

<p>I also saw Darelduin again, in Lavastorm :). I asked him for sure this time whether he was Swedish or not (as I'd seen him in Runnyeye with Derin). He confirmed it and I was more baffled than ever. I do recall talking to a Darelduin (or a Dureldain) before, thanking him with giving me supplies in my early stages. He was at that time a human druid, which I found strange. That Darelduin said he remembered me though, so I dunno.

<p>Anyway, I wanted to get out of Nektulos, but I was uncertain whether I should go with the camoflauge run now or do as the rest, cram the right wall. Darelduin told me it was safer to go with the wall and off I went.

<p>I stayed camo just in case, and on one occasion I passed a big bulky creature named a Stone Guardian. It vaguely reminded me of the iron golems in Heroes of Might and Magic.

<p>When I came to the river I didn't really know what to do. The water seemed dark and with my zero points in swimming I didn't know whether I would be able to pass it or not. I checked my inventory for a bat wing (reagent for levitate) and indeed I had one of them in my reg bag.

<p>*Casting Sound* 
<br>Your feet leaves the ground

<p>Cool, I floated across the river with a good margin! After that I threw my camo on and now I had no trouble trecking the rest of the Nektulos Forest.

<p>When I finally came to the East Commonlands I decided to make it directly to Rivervale. I thought I'd be better off meleeing scarabs to death in the thicket, and by that raising my 2h blunt. I also didn't want to stay around travelling, as I then would have more things to write about while I was (am) in driving school :).

<p>Once I came to Kithicor it was broad daylight and I was finally able to make that pathwalk. It wasn't much to talk about though. The zone is as boring as the thicket, with the fog and all. All I saw were a couple of spiders, and a mass of bixies.

<p>Once in Rivervale I saw a person auctioning out a Darkwood shield. I heard that they are great shields for druids and I asked him about his price. He told me the bid was currenlty at 140pp.

<p>140pp? Geez, and I thought the 120pp for the Glowing Wooden Crook was too much :).

<p>Anyway, I went to the thicket and started to hunt some scarabs. I thought about buffing myself up with all the shields I had and then just go melee. Turned out I'm still too weak to take them out by melee only. And the main reason for that is that the delay for my staff is way too high.

<p>After a couple of fights I finally abandoned my tactics and headed for the West Commonlands instead. There are far more things to bash there, and the average color of con lies at white for me.

<p>At the dervs I grouped up with a bard named Sevaras. He was level 15 and could take on most of them all by himself. That brought me to be able to only worry about my 2h blunt skill. It didn't raise much though. I did get it to 41 though (and replaced the "bad" with "below average"). Soon after I also hit level 15, which came as quite a surprice (don't really check my exp meter anymore :).

<p>We also grouped up with some other guys (I've forgotten their names.. grr) and we had the camp for ourselves. Being a full group I took the freedom to play around a bit, sending young kodiaks and other beasts to help us in our fight, they turned quickly though :). Still it's fun to throw in an emergency young kodi who beats on an annoying orc for 26pts of damage :).

<p>When I logged in the next day (whichever day that was :)) I talked to Derin. We agreed on meeting in Rivervale and off I went (currently being in Kithicor).

<p>We both had items to sell and the auctions spread across both Rivervale and the thicket, from anything ranging from the simplest derv ring to a dwarven tunic. Except for selling, I spent 30 minutes conjuring bottles of water. My meditation, channeling and conjuration all maxed at 80 and I was ready to go someplace.

<p>But where could we go? Derin was level 16 at the time, and most dervs coned blue or green to him. Lavastorm was totally out of the question and we didn't want to go all the way to North Ro or the Oasis.

<p>Paw sounded ok though. Even though it lied zillion miles away, it would be a great place to hang around, getting snakeskin armor and Runed Totem Staffs, or so we thought at the time :).

<p>Before we went I did a short stop at the Druid Farm and allocated one of my practise points on Dodge. I'm curious on how this will affect me, melee-wise.

<p>The Gorge was swarming with chasm minotaurs once we got there, but thanks to the gorge, being an outdoor zone, we stayed camoed all the way to the Karanas. There we took the bridge to North Karana, and in that zone, we followed the river south, which soon brought us to the bridge which would take us to South Karana.

<p>This bridge was even cooler than the one in East Karana. With the teleportation runes for the wizards standing closeby, it really fits to the area. Sure it looks wierd with a "magical" stone bridge in the middle of nowhere, but it looks really nice :).

<p>We bound ourselves as soon as we appeared in South Karana and after that we continued south. For the first time I finally saw use for the Sense Heading skill, thank god I have it maxed at all times.

<p>While looking for the runed mound of Paw we came across an Elephant. I had my radio on at the time, but Derin told me that it was making thumping noises as it walked by us, cool.

<p>We also came across an undead cemetary or something, and it was really creepy with heavy spawns. Going further we came across our first Aviak. For you who don't know, an Aviak is a blend of a "bird" and a human. It looked at us apprehensively (or threatingly), so we decided to take it slowly to Paw.

<p>Once there we saw a couple of splitpaw gnolls hanging around. We tried one for starters and we had no problem getting it down (it being in the 5 level range or something).

<p>It was the same inside Paw too. Everything was coning green, and we thought it would be just too easy getting an RTS from one of the shamans. The first shaman we saw coned green and we took it down with just a couple of blasts. I sensed something was wrong, it couldn't be THIS easy, could it?

<p>Aiin informed me that the RTSs were taken from the High Shamans, dooh. He also told me that it would probably be too hard to get one, as there were some freaky NPCs deeper in the dungeon. All I needed to hear was that deeper dungeon thing. If there's something I won't do, then it's to wander deep within a dungeon, especially the ones being indoor only. I have no interest at all in trying to retrieve a corpse which is lying near a high level NPC, without being able to throw a camo on myself :).

<p>With that information I threw a message to Newf. I'd talked to her earlier about getting an RTS for me, and indeed she had one lying around for me. She would even give it to me for free! Woohoo, that's 20pp worth of money :).

<p>She agreed on coming and picking me and Derin up at Paw and after that leading us to Lake Rathetear, where there were other High Shamans spawning, also carrying RTSs.

<p>Newf was currenlty in Steamfont, but it didn't take long for her to treck through half of Norrath with her teleportation spells and SoW and SoC (Spirit of the Cheetha, <nobr>SoW x 2</nobr>).

<p>After giving me the staff (thanks again Newf!) we continued to Lake Rathetear. On our way we came across a Cyclops, but we were able to leave it undisturbed. We also came to the Aviak village, which could be best described as a climbing playground for children :).

<p>At the zone border to Lake Rathetear, Newf infromed us that it would be best to bind on this side, instead of the other. Trains were frequent in Lake Rathetear and you wouldn't like to die and end up at the train again and die again, and again and again and again...

<p>This is what scares me the most with EQ. It's never happened to me. But what if? With my slow computer (ram-wise and connection-wise) I'd be down to a bubble before I'd be in full control of Atherion, just to huff huff away a couple of yards and die again? The only thing left to do in such situation would be to turn of your modem in panic and hope to get lucky next time you log in. If not you might be dropped down all the way to level 5, where you stop loosing experience :).

<p>My idea for this would be to have characters going invisible to any kind of monster for a period of 60 seconds upon reconnection to the living world. Any form of action, such as spellcasting, attacking or looting would make you visible again. This would take away any kinds of exploits, such as reequipping yourself imediately after you've died, or exploring areas you would normally not be able to explore. It would just be a mean to get away without loosing your levels in an uncontrollable state.

<p>Anyway, inside Lake Rathetear I was surpriced on the layout. Just a turn away there was a camp, containing dry bones at night, and gnolls at day. It was the perfect place for campers, as there would be an easy way to evade any kind of train, due to the short distance to the zone border.

<p>Down below the camp the lake itself lied calmly, and there were even a couple of those small boats lying around at the little dock. Derin and I didn't have any time to go exploring though, as we were fighting both the things we wanted and those things we didnt want to fight.

<p>Newf had left us and gone on with her own adventure and both me and Derin were too focused on getting RTSs anyway :). There were a lot of other players around though, so the competition was kind of tough.

<p>The night fell in and the gnoll spawns were relieved by undead spawns. A couple of dry bones made us all running towards the zone (and I do mean all of us :).

<p>Once I finally had finished zoning (I have extreme loading times at home) Derin told me he had to go. Drats... here I was, in the middle of nowhere, without my favourite cleric :).

<p>I didn't want to stay and end up with a risky corpse retrieval on my own, so instead I called Newf for help again. She told me to put my camo on and go north toward the Aviak village, and continue north from there and after a while I'd probably hit the bridge to North Karana.

<p>I gave it a go, but I freezed in panic when a couple of Aviaks (all trained up and all) killed three players within seconds. I just couldn't move any further. I ran back to the zone border to Lake Rathetear and prayed with all my heart that Newf could come and pick me up and bring me to safety :).

<p>I know I was probably disturbing Newf in her own adventures, but she came anyway, and helped me all the way to East Karana. I just wish that I had about 1000pp in the bank, because then I would be able to repay Newf all the things she's done to me :P.

<p>Back in East Karana I found Soma to be there too. He was grouped up with a couple of 18-19 level guys (being 17 himself). They were fighting Crag Spiders. I saw a chance to quickly raise my 2h blunt (as crags are red to me) and I offered to group up with them. After had been informed ten times that I wouldn't get any experience (who cares? ;)) I was greeted to come join them.

<p>They were near the High Pass entrance, fighting crags and named gnolls. Just as I had been invited we got intercepted by lots of monsters, including 2 crag spiders, a lion and a named gnoll.

<p>I quickly threw a damage shield on the troll tank, thinking he'd be ok. Soma had gotten himself in trouble by getting a spider frenzied on him. The cleric of the team was engaged himself with the named gnoll and I was forced to try healing both Soma and the troll myself.

<p>It didn't go well though and I soon found myself in need to gate. Luckily I had bound at the Gorge entrance before I teamed up with them, and I was brought to safety.

<p>Three of them died (Soma included :)) and the cleric was down to half a bubble (don't know if he made it out or not). They didn't seem to hazzled about their deaths though and all Soma said was "See? Sometimes things happen and get hectic" :).

<p>Hehe, I just wish I could be online for 24 hours if needed and not worry about corpse retrievals or death at all :).

<p>Anyway, it was time to log out at this time. I said farewell and checked my 2h blunt skill... still "Below Average" :(.

<p>Phew... and that brings me to what I've done this week. I won't go into much detail though (as I've already spent half my day writing :).

<p>Anyway, I logged in in East Karana again and went to the bridge. I met up with a wood elf female named Tyrell and she gave me some hinters on how to kite griffawns and the likes. We even grouped up for a while, so that I could get used to the area and see how the tactics works.

<p>She was wielding a Glowing Wooden Crook and I was curious on how she'd gotten it. She told me her son had given it to her as a gift. Tyrell also said that he might consider selling one to me for 80pp.

<p>80pp!? That's a bargain, compared to that guy who bought one for 120pp :). Unfortunately I only had 28pp in the bank at the time, so we dropped the issue for now.

<p>The griffawns weren't spawning so she showed me the way to the gnoll reaver camp instead. We fetched a couple of them and took them down in an orderly fashion. We even took down some of the undead reavers (coning yellow) which gave me some good experience (still only half a bubble through level 15 :). I were even able to dodge a couple of times, which was nice :).

<p>During our down times (medding, healing, whatever) I took use of the river and started to swim around a bit. It was cooler than I had thought and I continued to swim around untill I had a score of 4 in it :).

<p>Speaking of downtimes. I also used my treeform frequently to get myself to heal faster. Too bad Verant has taken away the moving feature (and I who was just about to feedback them that they ought to add a beeping sound to it when you back up while in treeform, just like a lorry... sigh.. oh well). I did experience a faster regeneration than before though, and I can heal up faster than I meditate now.

<p>Tyrell soon informed me that her son didn't have any crooks at the time, but that his friend could sell one to me for just 50pp (!!!). I wondered who this friendly person was and she said that I should try to get the additional 20pp as soon as I could and then talk to Aiin.

<p>Aiin? as in, Aiin Wildfire? :)

<p>I told him "Hi, I am a friend of Tyrell :)" and he just replied with a smile :). I told him I'd get my additional 20pp as soon as I had sold off the RTS I was currently wielding. I tried to auction it out in East Karana, but 20pp seemed to steep in these areas.

<p>I dunno why, but Aiin arrived in East Karana. He was bedecked in almost full chain looking armor, including those legendary chipped bone bracelets. He was an equipment questers dream, having a staff of observer and all kinds of devices that brought his attributes to sky rocket (he is level 42 after all :).

<p>Tyrell needed to go to Rivervale, that was why Aiin had appeared. I saw it as an opportunity to get back to Rivervale safetly, and there be able to sell of my RTS. I tagged a long and pooof! we were in the Misty Thicket.

<p>No one wanted to buy an RTS in Rivervale nor in Misty either, and I became more and more frustrated of having a Glowing Wooden Crook hanging around in Aiin's inventory for just a dime compared to the real price. I tried to sell off anything I could, ranging from fire beetle eyes to my old worn staff. I pressed my total currency from 28pp to 28.5pp... sigh :)

<p>Aiin was about to leave and I asked him if he would agree on taking it on credit. There was no way I would betray him as that wouldn't sound to good here in my journal :). I was shocked when he agreed and handed over his Glowing for just the 28pp I possessed!

<p>Atherion has a Glowing Wooden Crook!!!

<p>I thanked him as much as I could and promised him I'd get the remaining 22pp as soon as possible. He smiled and teleported to wherever he wanted to go :).

<p>I was way over my time at this point and I had to leave fast. I thanked Aiin and Tyrell again and before I had the chance to log out a druid asked me if he could buy that staff from me for 50pp :).

<p>Yesterday (today being Saturday 990710) I tried to sell my RTS again, but with no luck. I found Tyrell online and I decided to gate back to East Karana.

<p>Once I got there she was gone though (she said something about a cold, too bad). I threw a shout across the zone about looking for a party in the 14-16 range. A wizard named Otto responded that he and another person named Shaska were near High Pass, and that I could group with them.

<p>They were right at the zone border to High Pass and I had a long treck from the Karana bridge. The running on the High Pass cliff was eerie, with monuments and strange paintings in the walls. After 10 minutes of SoW running I finally arrived and we decided to give High Pass a go.

<p>As soon as we'd zoned we were in a fight with a couple of gnolls. They mostly coned blue to white though so we didn't have much of a problem taking those guys out. It turned out though that I became the tank, and I didn't like that, as I was the only one with the healing capabilities.

<p>Oh, I have to tell you, High Pass is confusing! I downloaded a map some time ago of it, and it must be the most inaccurate map of all time :), or at least the worst detailed of all time :P.

<p>I thought High Pass would be small, but with huge areas to walk around on. High Pass turned out to be a very narrow place overall though, with paths going here and there, up and down, within and beyond :).

<p>Shaska had to leave soon though, his friend had met up with us and they went alone. Otto and I stayed around near the West Gate and picked on the gnolls spawning there. There was a Gnoll Flamefister or something spawning though, and it coned yellow for me, and red for Otto. It had gotten me by surprice and I hadn't had the time to put on my damage shield. My glowing wooden crook helped a lot though, so with a couple of 20-30 dmg hits and some lightnign strikes from Otto we were able to take it down, but I was already down to 2 bubbles.

<p>Then came the next spawn of a white gnool soothsayer something. I was about to zone but the gnoll had a trick up his sleeve - he rooted me!

<p>Without any debuffing spells I was forced to defend myself with my crook. Thankfully my dodge kicked in three times (!) and after what seemed like an hour, I was free from the root. I was down to 1.5 bubbles at that time and I panically made it to the zone. While I was running two other gnolls who had spawned near the entrance taged up on me and I felt like the pigs in "Lord of the flies" :).

<p>I made it out okay though, and soon Otto zoned too. We decided to try on the tactics Tyrell had taught me, about taking on griffawns and gnolls near the river. I threw a SoW on Otto and told him I'd gate over there. He told me to be cautios though, as he didn't remember whether he had bound me in High Pass or not... dooh! :)

<p>*Casting Sound*

<p>Woohoo, no zoning... phew :). I made it to the bridge and sat down and meditated while Otto trecked the plains of East Karana.

<p>While I was waiting I received words from Raddor and Talus. Raddor was level 19 now, and was frequenlty fighting in High Pass Hold. Talus had moved on and made a new character, a gnome necromancer by the name of Ryynne. He'd made 8 levels in just three days.

<p>When Otto finally arrived (long run) we went south down the river and camped the gnoll camp. I brought in both undead and normal reavers, and we only experienced little problem with the undead ones (dropping myself to 2-3 bubbles, but others it was fine).

<p>Otto had found a real tank for us, by the name of Rezzo. He was a level 14 Paladin (I think) and he turned out to be just the thing we needed. We took on gnolls easily now, with him buffed up with my damage shield, and me and Otto acting like heavy artillery.

<p>We did however end up in a bad situation after a while. While Rezzo had just fetched a gnoll, both a griffawn and a lion spawned and they all tagged up on him.

<p>We considered our options and decided to stay and fight, as both the gnoll and the griffawn was blue, and the lion green.

<p>I imediately charmed the lion and by that made the griffon occupied with something. After that I threw a damage shield on Rezzo, who was dealing with the gnoll. So far it was pretty organized, but I dunno whether Otto threw one too many lightnings on the griffawn or not, because soon it became frenzied on him. The lion turned too soon too, and instead of just meleeing him down myself I charmed him again and threw him against the griffawn. The griffawn hit it for 30dmg and it dropped. I tried to heal Otto but then I realized I was out of mana, damn! I should have saved that mana instead of been charming that lion for the 2nd time.

<p>I told Otto to root the griffawn, but it didn't stay rooted for long, and soon Otto hit the dust. The griffawn attacked Rezzo, which already seemed to be in trouble against the gnoll (a weapon wielder). I told him to stick on the griffawn, and we both tried to finish it. Rezzo dropped down to 1 bubble though and started to run, with me after trying to score a hit or two on that griffawn.

<p>Soon Rezzo dropped too, and I was alone against the griffawn and the gnoll. The gnoll became passive though once Rezzo dropped, and after 10 seconds it came around that there was a filthy wood elf around that needed to be wasted.

<p>The griffawn was down to less than 20% of health and I was trying so badly to finish it. I was missing with my swings though, and at 3 bubbles of life I started to run like I'd never run before. The bridge was in sight and I threw out a shout that there was a griffawn coming to it, just in case some people were medding there.

<p>Surprisingly, Otto was waiting for me there, and he had rememmed his lightning spell (or is it a cold attack? It sure looks like a lightning strike). I stopped next to Otto and saw that I had regenerated just enough mana for an ignite. With me and Otto, doing a combined Ignite Lightning strike it finally hit the dust and we sighed in relief. I guess my SoW had been too much for the reaver, because it was no where to be seen.

<p>Even though both Otto and Rezzo died, it was a very fun battle. We had slayed our first griffawn and I had finally used the Charm Animal spell in a somewhat efficient way. The only mistake was that I shouldn't have charmed it again, it wasted too much of my mana. If I had meleed it down I would have haid enough mana to either dot the griffawn or ignite him twice, and both had been enough for it. Without the lion we had taken the griffawn and gnoll with ease.

<p>Rezzo was bound in Rivervale, and he now had a long way to treck. But he didn't think it was too much of a problem though. Now he'd been able to buy some of his new spells which he'd be able to use at the next level (just being kills away).

<p>I had to go at this time though, so I said farewell and thanked them for a nice time.

<p>Phew! and this is where I stopped playing :). It's taken all day (again) to finish up on my work on this journal, but it's been worth it. I know I didn't get into too many details (Paw, South Karana.. etc), but I'll have to live with that.

<p>Now time for some afterwords...

<p>I'm becoming more and more fond of my Atherion now. With SoW, Bind, Shield Of Thistles, Stinging Swarm, Charm Animal, Panic Animal, Snare, Ignite and my Glowing Wooden Crook there's nothing that I can not do. Sure, wizards nuke harder, fighters hit harder...  but they are far from close to be the varying fighter that the druid can be. We can get aid from animals, we can travel, we can damage shield and we can tank somewhat good.

<p>Sure, there's been a lot of rants and raves about the druid recently about Druids not being able to fight properly, and that they are having trouble at later levels. Sure, I can understand some of those thoughts at even this level, but I knew that druids wouldn't be the best in anything. They are the jack of all trades when it comes to spellcasters, and THAT is why I chosed to be a druid.

<p>They aren't the best in anything, but they are the best in "using" it all. 

<p>Anyway, about travelling. I've now been to 24 different zones of Antonica (not counting the South, West and North zones of Qyenos and Freeport), and I must tell you... exploring in Everquest beats the hell out of Ultima Online and all the "Kal Ort Por"ing :).

<p>Sure, it's time consuming to run and zone all the time (especially with a 28.8 modem), but if there would be a rune system in Norrath we'd all be zone mongering and owercrowding the "best" zones. When I was in Paw there were 5 other people in there except for me and Derin. It's one of the greatest places for people from about level 9 to 15 (?) to level up. They practically have the whole zone for themselves. The bad side of it is that it's just that... million miles away from home. With a rune system we'd have people everywhere, camping the goodies (such as "Hythlot level 4").

<p>So, what am I to do now then? Well, since I still have yet another week of driver's school (theoretical test on Friday the 16th, and a practical driving test three weeks from there) I'll try to concentrate on powergaming and reaching level 19. Then I'll have my teleportation spells and I'll be able to explore the surrounding zones from the ring zones (without becoming a Kal Ort Por system :). At that time I'll probably have enough time to write in detail on the zones, and I'll probably be in school at the time too then, so loading times won't be an issue.

<p>Anyway... cya for now.
