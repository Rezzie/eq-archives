                    The magician is a strong solo class. Many magicians solo their 
                    characters to post level 50 without feeling any real need 
                    to group. While there are advantages to soloing (e.g., no 
                    experience sharing, no need to look for group, etc.), going 
                    solo is not always the most efficient way to advance after 
                    you hit level twenty or so. Around level twenty the nature 
                    of the game shifts so you can no longer easily solo difficult 
                    mobs. The shift in the nature of the game is subtle at first 
                    but becomes very apparent by the mid-twenties and impacts 
                    your solo leveling efficiency: </font></p>
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
                      quality of mob improves significantly.</b> The mobs post 
                      level twenty tend to hit very hard, double attack, dual 
                      wield, cast stronger spells and have great tolerance to 
                      your melee attacks. The mobs are more social and will usually 
                      come to the aid of one of their kind. The mobs get smarter 
                      as well. While they are impressed with your pet, they know 
                      who is pulling the strings and will tend to prefer you to 
                      the pet if you get too close. The result is that white and 
                      yellow mobs are very difficult to solo now and you may be 
                      limited to killing one or two blues (if even that) safely 
                      at one time with little safety margin left at the end of 
                      the fight. </font>
                      <p></p>
                    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
                      game shifts you from the outdoors more to dungeons.</b> 
                      Post twenty there are still many outdoor areas to hunt. 
                      There are, however, fewer mobs in these outdoor areas at 
                      your level and a lot of the really good loot is below ground 
                      in the dungeons. The dungeons tend to be far more crowded 
                      with social / smart mobs and have fewer safe places to pull. 
                      There is a much greater tendency to pull multiple mobs or 
                      be caught by several patrolling mobs while you are trying 
                      to take on the one mob you intended to engage. The result 
                      is more multi-mob engagements and the resulting deaths if 
                      you cannot manage the inflow of mobs or quickly escape. 
                      Deaths at this level are a real issue since you now lose 
                      significant experience when you die. The partial bubble 
                      you lose at these levels can take hours to make back up 
                      (not to mention the lost time weaving your way through the 
                      dungeon to try to recover your corpse). </font>

                      magician's melee skills and hit points have not kept pace 
                      with the mob's.</b> Your melee skills increase slowly and 
                      by the mid-twenties you have a very hard time even hitting 
                      a blue. Even when you can hit them, you have so few hit 
                      points that you cannot afford to wade into melee for too 
                      long. The mobs on the other hand have superior weapon skills 
                      and appropriate melee health levels. The result is that 
                      your pet must do most of the melee and you must cast damage 
                      spells or heal your pet to win the fight. In both cases 
                      you will use a significant amount of mana and can spend 
                      a long time down between fights while you heal and recover 
                      your mana. </font>

                  Overall, then, starting in the twenties you see a decrease in 
                  your solo leveling efficiency due to: 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>

                      harder escape in those situations) </font>

                  The impact on your soloing level efficiency does not mean you 
                  cannot solo, far from it. It means that there is a value in 
                  the safety and efficiency of a group and our mid-twenty magician 
                  should consider what groups and partners make the most sense 
                  for him or her.

                  <p><b><font color="#050056">The Warriorcentric Group vs. Magiciancentric 
                    Group</font></b>
                  <p> The traditional answer to what group makes sense is the 
                    warriorcentric group. We have all seen these balanced groups: 
                    A warrior or two to tank and absorb damage, a cleric (or other 
                    healer) to heal the tank, an enchanter to control the flow 
                    of mobs to the tank, a wizard to provide air cover if a the 
                    tank gets in trouble (or another caster shows up), a shaman 
                    to buff up the tank, and a tracker (a ranger or druid) to 
                    pull the right mobs to the tank. In this group the warriors 
                    are at the center and everyone supports them. This is a melee 
                    group and very efficient. The magician can play several roles 
                    in this group (though not as well as the primary class choice). 
                    In many cases the availability of the right classes will limit 
                    the group leader's preferred choices and open up a spot for 
                    a magician in the group. These groups are a lot of fun and 
                    completely address the magician's efficiency issues. 
                  <p>The magician's rub with the traditional well-balanced group 
                    is that he really does not need all those group members (nor 
                    do they really need you). They are there to support the tank. 
                    In reality you can almost solo a small stream of the mobs 
                    if you just had a little help. There is no need to spend the 
                    time and effort to round up a full group if you can form a 
                    small group that supports you. So the issue becomes can we 
                    find a good partner class or two to form a small group supporting 
                    the magician that can efficiently allow the magician to take 
                    on several higher-level mobs with a high probability of survival. 
                  <p>The group we are looking to form would have the magician 
                    at the center of the group with other classes supporting the 
                    magician's weakness (a magiciancentric group). The group should 
                    be small (you can almost solo anyway) to minimize sharing 
                    the experience (your pet takes minimal experience in a group 
                    regardless of whether you do more than 50% of the damage). 
                    The group / partner should allow us to handle multiple blue 
                    mobs, a white / yellow mob (possibly two), or a shallow red 
                    mob. We should be able to handle these mobs safely with minimal 
                    downtime. The goal here is not to duplicate the full warriorcentric 
                    group's ability to handle a steady stream of high level mobs, 
                    but to allow an extension of our soloing ability from the 
                    pre-level twenty era and increase our leveling efficiency. 
                    We want to understand what classes the magician should lean 
                    towards when there are only a couple of people in an area 
                    to pick from to form a magiciancentric group.

                  <p> To understand how we best form a strong magiciancentric 
                    group, we should start by understanding what magician weaknesses 
                    we have to bolster and what magician strengths we can build 
                    around. Magicians have several weaknesses: 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>No ability to control a crowd.</b> This is the 
                      primary weakness. When the young magician solos in the wide-open 
                      space of the East Commons it is very easy to find a good 
                      spot, pull to the spot and take down one mob at a time. 
                      In the post level twenty world it is not that easy. Mobs 
                      are very social and in dungeons tend to quickly group on 
                      a solo player. A magician and an earth pet can usually handle 
                      two blues with some difficulty providing that both mobs 
                      will stick on the earth pet (the pet's root spell helps). 
                      If one starts chasing the magician, it becomes difficult 
                      to assist the pet and take the pet's mob down (which can 
                      lead to a dead magician or wasted pet). In the post twenty 
                      world you cannot effectively melee a mob for an extended 
                      period of time and help out the pet. The pet needs to be 
                      the magician's barrier so he can cast and support the pet 
                      and multiple mob situations make this difficult. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>No real escape ability.</b> Magicians have very 
                      few escape options. Early on our gate spell works fine. 
                      You bind just outside the zone and gate when things get 
                      bad. In the "one mob at a time" world that escape strategy 
                      works fine. When the magician and pet are battling several 
                      mobs or a high level mob, things can get out of hand quickly. 
                      The gate spell takes a long time to cast so if you do not 
                      start casting the moment you get into trouble you will not 
                      likely make it out. The magician has no SOW to go fast or 
                      snare / root to slow down the mob. The solo magician, then, 
                      must either carefully select his battles or fight near a 
                      zone. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>Significant downtime after a battle (even with 
                      blue mobs).</b> In fighting two blue mobs there is not much 
                      safety margin left at the end of the fight. Most mana is 
                      gone and sometimes health is down too. The magician's pet 
                      is usually low on health as well. Now the magician must 
                      sit and med for an extended period of time to recover and 
                      move on. There are several reasons for this: 
                      <p> 
                      <ul>
                        <li><i> &nbsp;Magicians have very low hit points and need 
                          to burn more at this level.</i> While you can go toe-to-toe 
                          with a blue mob for a little while, you do not do a 
                          lot of damage with your staff and mostly provide your 
                          pet the ability to get the bonus from hitting the mob 
                          from behind or extending the pet's life a few extra 
                          rounds. The magician will need to burn more to kill 
                          a mob than he needed to in the past. The burn will quickly 
                          deplete the mana, especially if a couple of big spells 
                          only do partial damage. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li><i>&nbsp;Magicians have only two real buff spells 
                          to aid a pet.</i> The burnout spell and damage shield 
                          are a great help to the pet. The magician, however, 
                          has no other way to bump up the pet's statistics, increase 
                          the pet's effectiveness, or significantly reduce the 
                          mobs ability to fight (the malaise line is a help but 
                          still gets resisted a lot). Without these kinds of buffs 
                          to increase the pet's melee efforts, the magician has 
                          to spend more mana to bring down the mob. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li><i>&nbsp;Magicians have only bind wound to heal themselves.</i> 
                          With no heal spell, a magician that is taking hits while 
                          a mob is chasing him around has a significant downtime 
                          to heal. It is not unusual to have to hold off one mob 
                          while your pet is finishing off another. With hard-hitting 
                          mobs, a magician can quickly lose his health and need 
                          to spend downtime recovering health. 
                          <p></p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The magician has one real strength: he can deal significant 
                  damage to one or two mobs very quickly. This is what make the 
                  magician so effective solo. This damage has four parts: 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>&nbsp;Direct damage spells.</b> The magician has the 
                      second best direct damage spells (only the wizard is better). 
                      This allows the magician to quickly bring down a mob. The 
                      necro and druid have DOTs that work well, but they must 
                      hold the mob off long enough to let the DOTs take effect. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li><b>&nbsp;Damage shield.</b> The magician has one of the 
                      best, if not the best, damage shield. It cannot be resisted 
                      and starts to hit for significant damage in the mid twenties. 
                      Shielding an earth pet can soften a mob very quickly. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>Pet damage.</b> The magician's pet is an effective 
                      melee combatant. Unlike the magician, the pet can hit hard 
                      (including double attack and duel wield) and frequently 
                      on blue mobs. It has a harder time with white and yellow 
                      mobs but still hits. Melee is efficient and also not resistible. 
                      You investment in mana to cast a pet is very well spent. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>Pet damage absorption.</b> The magician is not 
                      effective while he is being hit. The pet absorbs damage 
                      and draws the mob while the magician cast spells from a 
                      safe distance. Having the pet take the damage gives the 
                      magician the time to cast his direct damage spells and bring 
                      down the mob. 
                      <p></p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  In searching for a small group, the magician needs to look for 
                  partners that can control crowds, provide escape, reduce downtime, 
                  and benefit from strong damage capabilities. There are a variety 
                  of ways for partners to accomplish these goals and we will look 
                  next at a comparison of potential partners. </font>

                  <p><b><font color="#050056">Group Selection Framework</font></b>
                  <p> Each class has something to offer in support of a magician. 
                    Some, however, offer more than others do. We need to develop 
                    a framework to evaluate our potential partners and guide us 
                    in-group selection. The framework should allow us to evaluate 
                    each class based on their ability to correct the magician's 
                    specific weakness. 
                  <p>The criteria we are working against, then, are control of 
                    crowds, provide escape, and reduce downtime. Each of these 
                    criteria can be broken down one more level in to groupings 
                    that allow us to evaluate each class's spells, skills, and 
                    abilities to bolster the area: 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Control of Crowds.</b> This area breaks into two additional 
                      groupings. The first is control prior to engagement and 
                      the second is control during engagement. In the prior to 
                      engagement segment are the lull spells, harmony spells etc. 
                      They allow us to calm the mobs ahead of time and then pull 
                      the one we want. A bad pull here, however, can cause a problem 
                      so we would put slightly more value on a partner that can 
                      control crowds during the engagement. The "during engagement" 
                      segment includes the mesmerize spells, fear spells, charm 
                      spells, memory blur spells, taunt skills, etc. They allow 
                      us to control the mob once we start the engagement and allow 
                      us to continue working one mob at a time during the engagement. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li><b>Provide Escape.</b> This area also breaks into two 
                      categories. The first is mobility adjustment, which includes 
                      snare spells, spirit of the wolf spells, root spells, darkness 
                      spells, etc. These spells slow a mob down or speed you up 
                      so you gain a mobility advantage and can escape. Quick escape 
                      is the other category. This category includes wizard and 
                      druid evacuation spells, group gate spells, and group random 
                      teleport spells. These spells allow the caster to remove 
                      the group from a dangerous situation through teleportation. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li><b>Reduce Downtime.</b> This area breaks into several 
                      categories that either increase your mana efficiency or 
                      allow you to use less mana during or after the fight. 
                      <p> 
                      <ul>
                        <li><i>Increase mana efficiency is the first category.</i> 
                          Recovering mana is usually the largest cause of downtime 
                          for a magician. The breeze / clarity line directly increases 
                          your mana regeneration and falls into this segment. 
                          Partners that can cast strong direct damage (or DOT) 
                          spells are also in this segment, as they will allow 
                          you to share the casting of damage spells and conserve 
                          your mana. You essentially spread the mana use out across 
                          you and your partner so each of you has more mana left 
                          at the end of the fight. Also a partner that can deal 
                          significant melee damage will require you to cast less 
                          damage spells and increase the efficiency of your mana 
                          usage. Since mana loss is such a large cause of downtime 
                          this segment receives significantly higher weighting. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li><i>Heal / hp regeneration spells fall in the second 
                          grouping.</i> While the magician and his pet are not 
                          usually hp limited for downtime, saving your mana by 
                          sharing the pet healing duties is helpful. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li><i>Increase in direct damage spell efficiency is the 
                          third grouping.</i> The enchanter's Tashani spell allows 
                          your direct damage spells to hit more often and be resisted 
                          less. You, therefore, save the mana from having to recast 
                          on resisted damage spells. This spell also allows your 
                          pet to hit more often on his damage spells and brings 
                          the mob down faster thus reducing the number of direct 
                          damage spells you must cast. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li><i>Increase pet effectiveness is the last grouping.</i> 
                          This grouping includes buffs for pet strength, agility 
                          or other statistics as well as debuffs cast on the mob 
                          to allow the pet to kill the mob more quickly. You then 
                          need to spend less mana to help your pet bring the mob 
                          down.

                    enchanter breaks out as a very strong partner with the druid 
                    / ranger segment as a close second. Then there is a third 
                    segment of necromancer / cleric / bard followed by the all 
                    other segment. We can now develop specific strategies on how 
                    to group with the first two segments. The third segment deserves 
                    some attention also with some specific thoughts on clerics. 
                    Classes in the fourth group really do not make strong additions 
                    to the magiciancentric group (although they are great additions 
                    to a larger group) and I will leave it to the reader to form 
                    their own strategies around those classes. </font> </p>

                                  The enchanter makes a strong partner for a magician. 
                                  The enchanter's mesmerize and charm line of 
                                  spells are the strongest crowd control capabilities 
                                  in the game. The Tashani spell in not resistible 
                                  and when combined with the magician's malise 
                                  line significantly reduces a mob's resistances. 
                                  With resistance down you can again take on yellow 
                                  mobs and use significantly less mana, as your 
                                  spells are not resisted as much. With breeze 
                                  and clarity your mana regeneration allows for 
                                  little downtime between engagements and the 
                                  enchanter has a wide array of buffs and debuffs 
                                  to help you pet quickly cut through mobs. The 
                                  only area that the enchanter lacks in is providing 
                                  escape. His ability to control crowds and root, 
                                  however, still makes escape a high probability 
                                  during most engagements. The enchanter's spells 
                                  work both indoors and outdoors so he is a partner 
                                  that can help in a dungeon and in the wide-open 
                                  areas. A magician with one enchanter partner 
                                  can take on a wide variety of situations with 
                                  little to no outside help. There are several 
                                  aspects of enchanter / magician group to consider: 
                                  </font> 
                                <p>

                                  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Pulling.</b> 
                                    The goal of the pull is to leave the enchanter 
                                    open to do crowd control if needed. If you 
                                    are pulling at a camp or in a dungeon it is 
                                    possible that more than one mob comes in the 
                                    pull. Ideally you would like to work on a 
                                    single mob and pull by having your pet initiate 
                                    the attack with a pet attack command. This 
                                    method focuses the mob on the pet and leaves 
                                    both magician and enchanter free. More than 
                                    likely, however, you will need to choose a 
                                    safe spot and send the magician out to pull. 
                                    The magician should us a low level damage 
                                    spell (or a summoned throwing knife) to pull 
                                    and move the mob back onto the pet. The pet 
                                    then will take over and taunt or damage the 
                                    mob back onto itself. If more than one mob 
                                    comes the enchanter is free to mesmerize or 
                                    charm the extra mobs as needed. </font>

                                    Selection.</b> There are really two pet choices 
                                    for this group. In dungeons you are best to 
                                    use an earth pet. The earth pet will root 
                                    and keep the mob from running and also has 
                                    the highest hit points so makes a good shield. 
                                    Outdoors a water pet works well. It still 
                                    has the high hit points but also has a strong 
                                    ice spell and in the open spaces you may be 
                                    less concerned with a runner. Enchanter's 
                                    pets are optional. While the magician's pet 
                                    is not easy to handle, the enchanter has no 
                                    control on his pet. Outdoors two pets are 
                                    usually helpful; in a dungeon they can be 
                                    a problem. </font>

                                    and crowd controller. Prior to the pull the 
                                    enchanter should buff the magician's pet. 
                                    As the mob is pulled back to the pet the enchanter 
                                    should cast tashani to lower the mob's resistance. 
                                    After the magician hits the mob with malise, 
                                    the enchanter should apply any debuffs. The 
                                    enchanter should then hold his mana and watch 
                                    for additional mobs. As new mobs appear it 
                                    is the enchanter's job to hold them with mesmerize 
                                    or charm them and turn them on the first mob. 
                                    When the pet is done with the first mob it 
                                    can move onto the next. The enchanter should 
                                    control the flow of which mob to go to next. 
                                    If things go bad, the enchanter can use his 
                                    burn spells to help bring down a mob (this 
                                    may be needed against a yellow or light red 
                                    mob that is chewing up a pet). If things are 
                                    getting out of had and the flow is too high, 
                                    then the enchanter should control as much 
                                    of the crowd as possible and call for the 
                                    group to run with the pet staying behind to 
                                    hold as many mobs as possible. Overall, the 
                                    enchanter should buff and be alert for new 
                                    mobs entering the engagement. </font>

                                    Role.</b> The magician is the primary damage 
                                    dealer and pet healer. One of the big differences 
                                    between grouping and solo is the experience 
                                    that the pet takes. Solo, you lose half you 
                                    experience to the pet if you do not out damage 
                                    the pet. In a group you lose a negligible 
                                    part of the experience to the pet regardless 
                                    of how much damage you do. This opens up new 
                                    tactics that involve healing the pet. The 
                                    magician should damage shield / burnout the 
                                    pet, malise the mob, then allow the pet to 
                                    engage the mob. In a single mob situation, 
                                    the magician should let the mob do most of 
                                    the work and save mana in case things turn 
                                    for the worse. As the pet gets down to 50% 
                                    or so, the magician should heal the pet. Another 
                                    note is that healing a pet does not aggro 
                                    the mob so this method keeps the mob focused 
                                    on the pet. If the pet is losing ground fast 
                                    the magician should heal once then burn the 
                                    mob with direct damage. After two nukes, he 
                                    should evaluate the situation and if things 
                                    are still going bad the enchanter should do 
                                    the next burn. They key is to keep the mob 
                                    on the pet as long as possible then shift 
                                    him to the magician so that the enchanter 
                                    can keep looking for new mobs and have mana 
                                    for crowd control. With breeze or clarity, 
                                    the use of mana does not create as much downtime 
                                    so you can afford to let the magician burn 
                                    more than his share. The magician should also 
                                    nuke the runners if you are not using an earth 
                                    pet (earth pets can root to stop the mob).

                                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                                      multiple mob situations the magician may 
                                      want to nuke sooner to bring down the pet's 
                                      mob. With more than one mob to deal with, 
                                      the enchanter should have control of the 
                                      mobs other than the one the pet is attacking. 
                                      The magician should use the assist command 
                                      and help the pet dispense with the first 
                                      mob. With the tashain and malise spell on 
                                      the mob, the magician's direct damage spells 
                                      should routinely hit for full effect. Let 
                                      the pet do some initial damage to prevent 
                                      the mob from immediately aggroing on the 
                                      magician. But then hit the mob with several 
                                      direct damage spells to get the mob down. 
                                      After the first mob is down, heal the pet 
                                      and have it attack the next mob. The magician 
                                      and enchanter should coordinate how many 
                                      mobs they can handle this way, but if either 
                                      group member is down below two bubbles of 
                                      mana, it might be wise to back off and regroup 
                                      before moving on to the next mob. </font>

                                    selection.</b> The number and type of mobs 
                                    to pull and engage is a function of the risk 
                                    you are willing to take. With escape options 
                                    limited, you are relying on the enchanter's 
                                    ability to control the inflow to allow you 
                                    time to escape. In general you should try 
                                    to pull one mob at a time and then manage 
                                    the stray mob that shows up. It may be hard 
                                    to do this in many situations. I generally 
                                    do not like to try to deal with more than 
                                    three blue mobs at once (a typical mob camp). 
                                    Once white and blue is also fairly safe. If 
                                    you pull a yellow mob you generally can park 
                                    any blue mobs that show up and decide if you 
                                    have the resources to engage them after the 
                                    fight with the yellow. The same is true for 
                                    a red mob. But if you are pulling a red mob, 
                                    you should be prepared to run sooner if anything 
                                    other than a blue shows up. Fighting near 
                                    a zone or guards helps and lets you stay in 
                                    the fight longer, but you should not attempt 
                                    to overreach your capabilities, experience 
                                    loss at these levels is fairly time consuming 
                                    to regain. Escape sooner rather than later 
                                    if there is any question. </font>

                                Overall, then, the enchanter / magician group 
                                is a strong pair. The magician can deal damage 
                                and the enchanter can control the mob flow. While 
                                the pair is somewhat limited in their escape options, 
                                the enchanter's ability to control flow makes 
                                escape still a very high probability.

                  <p> The druid / ranger classes also make a strong partner for 
                    the magician. Their ability to use the harmony spell allows 
                    crowd control prior to engagement and since harmony cannot 
                    be resisted ensures that the initial pull should go well. 
                    Their spirit of the wolf / snare combination allows you to 
                    have significantly greater mobility than most mobs and facilitates 
                    a high probability of escape (this combination can also help 
                    to control crowds after the pull as well). The druid succor 
                    line of spells can also allow your quick escape by completely 
                    removing you from a bad situation. Their DOTs and direct damage 
                    spells also allow you to bring a mob down fast if needed and 
                    spread out the mana usage to reduce downtime. The ranger gets 
                    his spells later in life, but has good offensive melee damage 
                    that he can add significant damage prior to getting some of 
                    the more useful spells. The only drawback to this pair is 
                    that some of their spells are outdoor only. Even with this 
                    drawback they still are a good pair indoors as long as you 
                    realize the limitations and are cautious about your pulls. 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>&nbsp;Pulling.</b> Given the druid / ranger's tracking 
                      skills and harmony spell they are clearly the choice for 
                      pulling. Outdoors finding a mob camp of blue to yellows 
                      is an ideal situation. They can harmonize the camp and choose 
                      one mob to pull back to a safe spot. In this situation the 
                      group should be located in a safe space well out of the 
                      aggro range of the remaining mobs. As the druid / ranger 
                      pulls they should snare the mob and bring them back to the 
                      pet / magician team. In a more open area the druid / ranger 
                      should track specific mobs in the general area of the group 
                      and pull them quickly back to the engagement location to 
                      avoid dragging other mobs with them. As they get near the 
                      engagement location the magician should have the pet buffed 
                      and then use one of a variety of strategies to use to engage 
                      the mob. Indoors a similar strategy works, but you must 
                      be more careful in the pull since the harmony spell does 
                      not work indoors. The druid / ranger needs to pull single 
                      mobs from close by and if the pull goes bad they need to 
                      root or snare the extra mobs to give the group time to escape. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>Pet Selection.</b> If the pet is going to tank 
                      then the water pet is a good alternative. Indoors, if you 
                      do not need the earth pet's root spell, then the water pet 
                      is the clear choice. Outdoors if you plan to kite then the 
                      water pet or fire pet should be used to allow you to take 
                      advantage of their damage spells. Outdoors the water pet 
                      also allows you to use the pet as a tank and provides the 
                      group the most versatility. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>Druid / Ranger Role.</b> The role of the druid 
                      / ranger depends on the engagement strategy you are going 
                      to use. There are two basic strategies to use: 
                      <p> 
                      <ul>
                        <li><i>&nbsp;Kiting the mob.</i> In this situation, the 
                          druid / ranger is the bait. Their role is to pull the 
                          mob and get it back to the engagement area. They should 
                          SOW the group (along with the pet) and buff the pet 
                          prior to pulling. As they bring the mob into the ambush, 
                          the magician should send the pet in to run behind the 
                          mob and hit it. Turn the pet taunt skill off (/pet no 
                          taunt) and the druid / ranger then moves in a square 
                          around the magician. The pet will hit and burn the mob 
                          as the mob follows the druid / ranger. Once the mob 
                          turns on the pet the magician can take over and hit 
                          the mob with a direct damage spell to bring the mob 
                          to the magician. The druid / ranger then takes on the 
                          role in the center of the square and snares any new 
                          mobs that come into the area. The druid / ranger basically 
                          has the role of crowd control and evacuation if things 
                          get out of hand. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li><i>&nbsp;Pet tanking.</i> In this situation the pet 
                          will take most of the damage. As the druid / ranger 
                          pulls back to the ambush spot, the magician should command 
                          the pet to attack the mob. The pet should begin taunting 
                          and hitting the mob so that it quickly comes off the 
                          druid / ranger onto the pet. Prior to the pull, the 
                          druid / ranger should buff the pet and the magician 
                          should damage shield the pet. Once the pet is on the 
                          mob the druid / ranger should DOT the mob and then assume 
                          an over watch role to snare / root any new mobs that 
                          enter the fight. The druid / ranger can also heal the 
                          pet without aggroing the mob and can share in the burning 
                          if things get bad. 
                          <p></p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  Pet tanking works in all cases whereas kiting is generally only 
                  useful outdoors where you have lots of space. 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;<b>Magician Role.</b> The magician is still the 
                      damage dealer and pet cleric regardless of the strategy 
                      used. The tactics, however, vary somewhat based on how you 
                      choose to engage the mob: 
                      <p> 
                      <ul>
                        <li>&nbsp;<i>Kiting the mob.</i> The magician's job during 
                          kiting is the keep the mob focused on him to allow the 
                          pet to hit from behind. As the pet engages the mob when 
                          the druid / ranger returns from pulling, you should 
                          attempt to malise the mob. The mob is focused on the 
                          puller and malise will not usually pull the mob onto 
                          you. As you take over the role of kiting the mob, you 
                          need to do enough damage so that the mob will focus 
                          on you. With just one mob you can run ahead with your 
                          SOW and turn and watch the mob. If he is following, 
                          stand and wait for him to approach you. As he gets near 
                          you, run of 90 degrees from your last path so that you 
                          end up working a square with the druid / ranger in the 
                          middle. If the mob turns on the pet hit it with a bolt 
                          spell to pull it to you. 
                          <p>When another mob shows up, the druid / ranger should 
                            snare it and move it near the first mob. When the 
                            two mobs are near each other you can use your column 
                            line of spells (or a rain spell) to hit both of the 
                            mobs at once and turn them on you. The column line 
                            works well since it hits in one wave over a very narrow 
                            area. Casting the spell will not likely pull other 
                            mobs in the area. Keep using the area spell to keep 
                            the mobs after you. The druid / ranger can keep adding 
                            mobs to the kiting track as they show up. The druid 
                            / ranger may need to take over kiting duties to allow 
                            you to meditate if needed. 
                          <p></p>
                        <li>&nbsp;<i>Pet tanking.</i> In the pet tanking case 
                          you can focus on healing your pet or burning the mob 
                          down if things are not going well. The druid / ranger 
                          should be available to help with the healing or burning 
                          if needed. The pet's damage shield and boosted statistics 
                          will help in wearing the mob down. The malise spell 
                          also helps reduce the mob's resistance so you waste 
                          less mana on spells cast on the mob. This strategy is 
                          the best one to use indoors and can reduce your downtime 
                          by sharing some of the healing and burning with the 
                          druid / ranger. 
                          <p></p>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    <li><b>&nbsp;Mob selection.</b> With the druid / ranger partner 
                      you need to be more selective in your choice of mobs. It 
                      is much more difficult to control the crowds (especially 
                      indoors where harmony will not work) so ensuring a good 
                      pull on a single mob is very important. Several blue mobs 
                      outdoors should not be an issue. More than two mobs indoors 
                      can be a problem. You should be able to take on a single 
                      white or yellow mob (and potentially a blue if it shows 
                      up during the engagement). A single light red should be 
                      possible, but your pet can get in trouble fast and it is 
                      much harder to get your damage spells to hit. Dual healing 
                      the pet may be your only choice. 
                      <p></p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  The druid / ranger makes a good selection as a partner. Their 
                  abilities, however, truly shine outdoors. They can provide the 
                  magician a way to pull selected mobs at camps and then provide 
                  the group enough of a mobility advantage to ensure an escape. 
                  Indoors they also are good partners, but many of their advantages 
                  are decreased. 
                  <p>Ideally the best-rounded magiciancentric group is a magician 
                    with a druid and an enchanter. In this group all the bases 
                    are covered. The druid can pull from camps with harmony outdoors. 
                    Indoors he can still pull, but then the enchanter can provide 
                    crowd control if the pull goes bad. The enchanter's superior 
                    crowd control allows you to take on multiple mobs and the 
                    druid's ability to increase the group's mobility can ensure 
                    escape. With several options for healers, burners, and melee 
                    (with a ranger vs. a druid) you can reduce the group's downtime 
                    significantly by sharing the mana drain across the party members. 
                    This group can handle multiple mobs up to several whites or 
                    yellows and safely engage a light red mob with high probability 
                    of success or escape. When possible this threesome should 
                    be the magician's choice for group support.

                  <p> The necromancer, bard, and cleric are second tier partners. 
                    Each of these classes has some benefits as they play the roles 
                    of the enchanter or druid / ranger above. The cleric provides 
                    a slightly different role as a partner. 
                  <p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>The Cleric Partner.</b> The cleric / magician group 
                      can provide a different strategy for playing either indoors 
                      or outdoors. The cleric provides very strong buffs for a 
                      warrior type pet. Using an earth or water pet buffed by 
                      a cleric creates a very formidable defensive shield. Buffed 
                      with a magician's damage shield, the pet can inflict a fair 
                      amount of non-resistible damage on the mob. The cleric can 
                      also use his lull or soothe spells to try and pull a single 
                      mob from a group (with varying success). The cleric can 
                      also use his root spell to slow down the mob's ability to 
                      get to the group while you focus on a single mob. With a 
                      heavily buffed and damage shielded pet, the magician and 
                      cleric can sit back and heal the pet without causing the 
                      mob to aggro. If another mob shows up the cleric can root 
                      it while the magician burns the first mob down and turns 
                      the pet onto the second mob. There is little margin for 
                      escape, so this group works best near a zone or with a safe 
                      pulling area where you can be sure that you won't have to 
                      deal with more than two mobs. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li><b>The Necromancer Partner.</b> The necromancer can play 
                      some of the enchanter / druid role in a group. The necromancer 
                      can mesmerize a mob and park it while you work on one mob 
                      at a time. With clinging darkness series and fear you can 
                      kite with two pets vs. one. The necromancer has strong DOTs 
                      if you chose to let the pet tank. The necromancer, however, 
                      doesn't really need you that much and may prefer to solo 
                      versus group with you. He can benefit from the added safety 
                      of a partner but is very strong by himself. 
                      <p></p>
                    <li><b>The Bard Partner.</b> The bard can provide many benefits 
                      though his songs. The problem is he can only twist two or 
                      three of them a once. He can mesmerize, heal, adjust mobility, 
                      and provide short escape teleports. He is, however, not 
                      fire and forget and he needs to be playing the songs to 
                      get the benefit (i.e. the druid can SOW and move to heal 
                      the bard needs to keep playing the song to get the benefit). 
                      He can fill the roles in kiting or tanking situations and 
                      makes a good secondary partner. 
                      <p></p>

                  </ul>
                  <b>Conclusions</b><br>
                  Overall the warriorcentric group provides solutions to most 
                  of the magician's issues. It is not always possible or desirable, 
                  however, to join this type of group. With an enchanter and druid 
                  group, the magician forms a team that supports his weaknesses 
                  and provides ample benefits back. This magiciancentric group 
                  can bring down multiple mobs of higher levels with a high probability 
                  of survival and restore much of the efficiency in leveling with 
                  a group. </font>
