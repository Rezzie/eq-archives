They are a valuable asset to any group inthe role of the healer.  In addition, Clerics are given special powers tocombat the undead forces of Norrath.  No other class can stand up to theseevil forces as early as the Cleric.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>      </tr></table><br><br><a name="create"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>    <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Creating a Character</font></b><div>The point at which you actually create your character, the choice of raceand starting attributes, truly defines your character and is the mostimportant part of your overall character development. Don't underestimateit.<p>There are two distinct aspects of a Cleric that must be considered at thisearly stage. The first, and most obvious aspect, is that of spell casting. ACleric is first and foremost a spell caster, and as such you need to makesure he or she will be ready to handle that role. In this aspect, Wisdom isof prime importance. There is, however, another aspect to the Cleric, that ofthe Warrior. While the Cleric's role is primarily that of a spell caster,you will find that they can hold their own in melee as well. They willnever be as good as a true Warrior or even hybrids such as Rangers andPaladins, but they do have more skill in this area than most spell casters.Exploit this slight advantage. In groups, you can help beat on your enemywhile maintaining your healing role. By doing so, you help kill the creaturefaster, and the creature is allowed to do less damage to your party.To exploit this advantage, you need to tweak up your Strength and Stamina abit.<p>So where does all this leave us? It leaves us with 3 separate attributesthat we may need to adjust with our starting points;however, splittingthose points up among 3 attributes is typically unwise. So let us forgetabout Stamina. Stamina affects our total hit points. While at early levelsthis may help, in the long run, it's just a waste. Clerics are not expectedto take the brunt of the attacks. That's what fighters and monks are for.Your typical "tanks" as they are called. So let's leave Stamina alone. Thatleaves us with Strength and Wisdom. This is where your race makes adifference in how you adjust your attributes. Some races will have highStrength and low Wisdom. If this is the case, then you will want to put mostof your points into Wisdom to bring it up. Some races will be opposite, andyou should put some points into Strength to bring it up. Other races arerather well-balanced. In these cases I suggest putting most into Wisdomsince it is of prime importance.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td> </tr></table><br><br><a name="train"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Your First Training Session</font></b><div>First thing you need to do with your new character is find your guild andhand over your letter.

In addition, you will soon be replacing this with somepatchwork armor, so don't worry if you lose it. Once you have turned inyour note, you will receive some experience and 5 training points.

These early levels should be used notonly to gain experience, but also to learn how to effectively use yourchosen class. As indicated in the Spell Strategies below, you will want topurchase the spell Strike as soon as possible. Once you have this you willneed to use it often during combat to learn effective spell timing. Spelltiming is learning to time the casting of your spell in between hits fromyour enemy, thereby avoiding having your spell interrupted.<p>As is always emphasized in EverQuest, make sure to CON (CONsider) everytarget before engaging it. By doing so you will quickly learn what you canand can not handle. For 1st and 2nd level, I suggest that you stick totargets that CON as "looks like you would have the upper hand". These willgive decent experience while not being unbeatable at early levels. Levels 3and 4, you should start trying to concentrate on "looks like an even fight"type targets. These will maximize your experience gains. During all levels,however, don't just run around looking for these types of targets. Kill anytargets of opportunity that are equal to or weaker than your target type.<p>Early on, start practicing your spell timing. Once engaged in combat, try totime your casting of Strike in between the enemies hits. When engaging easytargets that offer little threat, you should also practice "on the flyhealing". This is done by hitting F1 to target yourself. Then heal yourself,being sure to time the casting between hits (because your target will stillbe hitting you). Then hit F8 to toggle back to your enemy. Practice thisoften enough so you become proficient. Being able to do this effectivelycould very well save your life in the future.<p>As you get closer to level 5 you will want to start focusing your hunt ontargets that give decent loot. Spells aren't free, and soon you will beneeding to shell out at least a platinum or two on spells.<p>For Dwarves, you will want to start focusing on Large Skunks and LargeSpiders. Skunks are typically level 3 or 4, and large spiders typicallylevels 4 or 5. This means you should be sure to CON the target first, and besure it is not "looks like quite a gamble". The skunks will occasionallygive scent sacks which can be sold for 1 gold and change, and Large Spiderswill occasionally give spider silk which again sells for 1 gold and change.In addition, they will both give excellent experience because even theweakest ones will be "even fights".<p>For Humans, you can start earning money a little early, and continue to doso by killing Fire Beetles and Klacknacks. They will very often give firebeetle eyes which can be sold for around 2 silver each.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>    </tr></table><br><br><a name="strat"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Training Strategies</font></b><div>Properly and efficiently using your training points each time you level canmake a huge difference in how a character turns out at high levels. Youshould have already spent your first 5 points on your 1H Blunt skill, sothat you could maximize your weapon skill at low levels. As you fight, your1H Blunt will continue to rise on its own. Each time you level for thefirst 2 or 3 times, you will want to use your training points on 1H Blunt.In some cases you will find that you can only train a few of your pointsbefore "Reaching your limit in the chosen skill". This is fine and meansthat you are getting good training on the field. Simply save the extrapoints. You will want to continue to train 1H Blunt each level in thisfashion until the guild master starts charging you for the training. Thisshould happen around level 5 or 6. Maybe a little earlier or later. Inaddition, when you reach level 4, you will want to spend that 1 point onChanneling. This is an important skill that is used when casting spells,when scribing or memorizing spells, and is used to help prevent beinginterrupted when casting. By training one point in Channeling, you will"Learn the basics", and from now on the skill will go up on its own. Don'twaste any more than 1 point in this skill, as it is one that rises fastthrough use. Any extra points you should have before level 8, you shouldspend on either 2H Blunt or if you wish, on a trade skill. I suggest 2HBlunt since this allows you more flexibility in choosing a weapon; however,now that trade skills are functional, you may want to play with them.<p>When reaching level 8, you will want to dump all 5 of those new points intoMeditation. Here is one skill that different people are of differingopinions on. Some will say to only use 1 skill point such as you did inChanneling. The reason I tell you to use all 5 is because Meditation is anextremely important skill. It allows you to recover mana quicker; however,at low levels, I find that it doesn't work so well, and has a tendency torise slow. By putting 5 points into training you start out a little betterand will rise faster in the skill. Besides you will usually have the extrapoints at this stage anyway.<p>By now you will have stopped training in 1H Blunt and your 2H Blunt (if youchose to train it) should be fast approaching the point where pay isrequired as well. Should you find yourself with skill points that are trulyextra and lying around, spend them on some of your weaker magic skills suchas Conjuration, which for a Cleric tends to be low. This is because we havevery few spells that use it. Those spells however are handy, and you willwant to be proficient lest you waste precious mana trying to summon foodand water.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>        </tr></table><br><br><a name="spell"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>     <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Spell Strategies</font></b><div>From the very beginning I recommend buying only the spells you absolutelyneed until you have money to spare. The reason for this is that Clericshave the worst of both money situations. They must spend money on spellsand on decent armor. In addition, due to the fact that Clerics get each"spell rank" at higher levels, their spells tend to cost more. Your rank 3spells will cost around 6 platinum per spell on average.<p>At rank 1 (levels 1-4) I recommend that you buy only Strike, and I suggestgetting that as early as possible. This spell makes hunting much easier, andwill start to teach you the basics of "Spell Timing" - that is, timing yourspells between enemy hits.<p>Rank 2 (levels 5-8) is a little tougher. Here, there are lots of good spellsand some fun ones as well. Of prime importance is Light Healing, and HolyArmor is a close second. The spell Summon Water is an absolute must get andis also cheap. I suggest buying Summon Water first thing after making level5. By doing so you will no longer be buying water, and you will be able tosave your money faster; therefore, getting the other spells you need faster.Next I suggest getting Light Healing followed by Holy Armor. In addition,the spell Ward Undead is excellent if you should be hunting undead. If youcan spare the money I suggest getting it, but it's not a priority. Anotheruseful spell is Gate, but you can live without it, if you can't spare themoney.<p>At rank 3 (levels 9-13) spells become expensive. First off, buy yourselfSummon Food. This is a cheap spell (one of the only cheap ones in thisrank), and you will save more money by no longer having to buy food. Next onthe list of priorities would be Center and Hammer of Wrath. Get Centerfirst, as it is the king of all buffs at your disposal (at this level),adding 50 HPs to the target's max HP. Root is another useful spell that youwill want to get when money allows.<div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>    </tr></table><br><br><a name="weap"><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>      <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=2><b><font color=050056>Weapon and Armor Strategies</font></b><div>Clerics unfortunately have to worry about both armor and spells. You dohowever get one break, and that is on weapons. As a Cleric, you can summonvery decent magical weapons for your own use starting with the spell Hammerof Wrath. This allows you to concentrate your money on just spells andarmor.<p>The first type of armor you will want to get, and early on, is patchworkleather. This can be bought relatively cheap from other players (usuallyaround 2-4gp per item), and offers rather decent protection. As a Cleric, youwon't be playing the role of "tank" all that often, and because of this, youcan usually get away with wearing cheaper armor than warriors. Just becauseyou can wear plate armor, doesn't mean that you have to. Yourmoney should be spent on spells first, and only if you have extra moneylying around should you waste it on improving your armor beyond patchwork.<p>Adventuring in dungeons with groups can be a great way to increase yourarmor, because most often you can find armor on monster in these depths.<p><div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" height=5 width=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></td>      </tr></table><br><br><table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 bordercolor=908070 width=80%>  <tr>            <td><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1></td>  </tr>   <tr>            <td align="center"><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;<div>Author: <a href="mailto:agathorn@stratics.com">Agathorn</a> (Edited by Cold Rain)<div>&nbsp;</td> </tr>   <tr>            <td bgcolor=f0f0f0><font face="Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica" size=1>&copy; Copyright 2000 Stratics.
