This has reduced the frequency of weapon procs from pets. To make this change we simply removed an artificial multiplier to pet proc chances, no stats or attributes were changed.<br><br>Pets wielding the Sword of Runes will proc with that sword as often as they do with any other procing weapon, but it will only proc against its intended target, summoned creatures.<br><br>Magician and necromancer pets (and because they use the same spells, shadowknight pets as well) now have the ability to duel wield without a weapon, if they are powerful enough. This will happen with some regularity with pets cast from 39th level (52nd for shadowknights) spells and above.<br><br>No other changes to the duel wielding ability of any other pets was changed. This ability was not given to any other pet because magicians and necromancers are primary pet classes, the others are not.<br><br>-Alan</font></blockquote>And then Absor responded with the following:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>I thought I answered it very clearly previously. Enchanters did not get nerfed. They were not ignored. It was decided that only the two mentioned pet types would get the dual wielding without weapons ability.<br><br>I'd be really interested to see if any other enchanters feel as you do...</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>So the specter level 59 necro pet will be duel wielding/double attacking??

Will enchanter pets be made to dual-wield automatically at the levels you mentioned, just as mage and necro, and shadowknight pets now do?</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>In a word: No. <br><br>The enchanter pets consist of a floating sword and shield.

Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<br><br>- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <br><br>- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<br><br>- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <br><br>- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<br><br>- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<br><br>- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<br><br>- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<br><br>- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<br><br>- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <br><br>- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<br><br>- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<br><br>Remember!

They are killed as soon as server comes back up. What a shock, it is during american prime time. Then EXACTLY 7 DAYS LATER TO THE HOUR they spawn again and are killed by the SAME competing guilds again!<br><br>On servers where uber mobs have a 15 minute life span, Asian guild NEVER get a shot at these.<br><br>Please make the spawns 7 days and 12 hours. NOT 7 days EXACTLY. I am so tired of this. <br><br>It is already bad enough that EVERY patch is during asian primetime (what is up with the 3am patch!) so we lose at least 52 play days a year out of 365. My poor guild never gets a weekend plane raid so has had to live with weekdays. I can't tell you how many plane events have been planned and booked a month in advance only to be canceled due to a friggin patch.<br><br>Please be more sympathetic to Asian players! We pay our money too.<br><br>Thanks for taking this issue into consideration</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>After having addressed many times I wonder if I should keep trying or give up, but I'll give it another short:<br><br>EverQuest is played all over the world. ANY time that we take the servers down will be SOMEONE's primetime. We try to take them down when the fewest number of people will be affected, that will mean taking them down during off-peak time for the America's. <br><br>It's a matter of math. How can we affect the fewest number of people possible? If *peak* was at 4am my time and the low point were at 8pm, we'd take them down at 8pm even though it was primetime here. <br><br>I realize as an off-peak player you don't like this, any more than Americans who play during off-peak like it, but until peak time moves to a time other than the time it is, our scheduled patches will be in the general viscinity of when this one is taking place. I'm sorry, but there is really no other option that makes sense. I've seen people argue that we should stagger patch times so that it falls in someone elses peak every time, but that does not meet the goal of affecting the fewest number of people possible.<br><br>Now, that said, no spawn is "exactly 7 days", nor is it exactly "three days". Any spawn over two hours has a +/- modifier that adjusts its spawn time. That means that the seven day spawn could very well pop up anywhere from six to eight days after it was killed.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>And then Gordon Replied with:<br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>It's plus or minus a percentage of the total spawn delay. That means that a two-hour spawn would have a variation of minutes, whereas a 7 day spawn could very well have a variation of days days.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Absor addressed the issue of balance yet again in this rather lengthy thread over on the <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034692.html target=_blank>Official Everquest Fourms</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>I found a very lengthy post from Gordon addressing issues about the change of content. Gordons response is the standard fare from the VI line, I think he makes good points, but I think there is another principal that he does not discuss: the tradition of the game patch. Now I dont know if this is because many EQ players who do not like the constant changes are new gamers, or came from the FPS and RTS genre, but historically, strategy games often update AI's, "nerf" powers, and make other changes in a game in order to provide a challange for players. And those are not even persistant, changing games, they are meant to be static.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>An interesting thread. Perhaps a bit over my head, intellectually<br><br>I think it's wrong to imply that you can only do one or the other, either increase the power of the monsters OR decrease the power of player characters, if your goal is to make the game harder (and that's IF...).<br><br>The real world answer is that you do both as the situation requires. In the case of one bit of the picture being off, say an item or a spell that makes one class or character type or tactic too powerful, relatively, you obviously reduce the power of that item. If you want to make the world as a whole more difficult for the heroes in it, then you can do either, really. Obviously the preferable method is to increase the AI for the monsters, or find other clever ways to make them more powerful.<br><br>That being said, don't go overboard. If we do something that reduces the power of an item or spell or somesuch,it's done in consideration of the whole. I like to picture class balance as a sort of sea (ok, I've never pictured it that way until just now...). Waves are expected, even desirable. But when you see a tsunami, what do you do? Do you raise the ocean or lower the wave? Keep in mind that if you raise the ocean you'll drown the world...<br><br>I love bad analogies. <br><br>Alan</font></blockquote>

Admit the spell had its intended functionality before. Your statement made it sound like the way the Rage series has been operating was due to a bug. That's not true and I think everyone knows it. The Rage series spells were designed with the full knowledge that draining empty mana would not cancel them, that was part of the design.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>It was working that way due to a bug. But it was also working pretty much as intended. The two are not exclusive ideas. The bug is fixed. Now we need to fix the "as intended part".</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>2. Admit the mechanics changed for a new spell line and VI did not anticipate the effects of changing the mechanic (which is obvious from Torpor). Promise us better QC in these regards.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>I have admitted that it was changed to make it so that spells that use mana continuously couldn't use mana that didn't exist (I will neither confirm nor deny anything about any new spell lines). We're not hiding it. And we did not anticipate this particular effect to occur with the change in the mechanic. I won't promise better quality control in the future. I will promise that we will work on having better quality control in the future (a subtle difference. The trick here is that if our quality control improves, most people would never notice. You can't see all the problems that we catch, only the ones we don&#8217;t).</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>3. Do NOT leave us with a gimped replacement or no fix.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>I have no intention of that. I'd like to see the spell working mostly as it was. But this is also a chance for thecommunity to voice its opinions on this particular spell, at a time when we know we have to change it. Let's keep this thread to that purpose.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>4. Above all, do NOT flee the thread. The more you talk to us, the calmer we are. The thing we're most afraid of is being left with no replacement, like the other two times this has happened.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>I'm not going anywhere. It's my job to stay here and talk.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>5. Go /bonk the live team. They deserve it.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Not really. There are a LOT of spells and spell effects in EverQuest. Missing one on a change like that (of the many changes that are made) isn't too bad. Besides, some of these guys are a lot stronger and tougher than I am<br><br>Please, let's keep this thread to the topic at hand.

I had just dinged 50 and as an Enchanter I rarely use my pet but I was paired up with a shaman and we both had our pets out to simplify things. I got done and was running back to the zone in Lake Omen and I started getting hit by a goblin soothsayer. I do a few 360s and see no mobs around me but I get the familiar "Taunting Master" or what ever the pet says. But the goblin still hits me, My pet might have eventually killed him but I was not going to sit around and wait to find out. Right before I got to the zone I noticed I was still getting hit with no mobs in sight.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>The key thing I'm looking for here is a way to reproduce this consistantly. If anyone can make this happen whenever they want, then please let me know. I remember this pesky bug from beta. I haven't had it happen to me since.<br><br>I've made people aware that this is happening, but we need to be able to reporduce it in order to fix it...<br><br>Alan</font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Both Abashi and Absor posted on the subject of pets no longer requiring weapons. This discussion is pretty important to Magicians and Necromancers. You can view the original post on the <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034001.html target=_blank>Official Everquest Forums</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>A while back magician pets were given the ability to wield weapons. This was a workaround for the fact that these pets were unable to duel-wield properly. <br><br>After the next patch, pets summoned using necromancer or magician spells of 39th level or higher should duel wield, even without weapons. This will also include the shadownight pets that are the same as necromancer pets of 39th level or better. So these pets will be duel wielding properly henceforth.<br><br>Alan</font></blockquote>Abashi followed up with the two following posts:<br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Just one clarification, the "auto dual wield" ability is based upon a calculation of both the dual wield skill and the level of the pet. So, it is possible that you could get good summon at 34th that auto dual wields without weapons, or a bad summon at 39th that doesn't.<br><br>As a note, no change is being made to their likelihood to dual wield. The change is only going to remove the requirement of handing your pet weapons to get them to dual wield at the higher levels.<br><br>-Gordon</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>We were told this was impossible on Jan 28. We were told that this would be impossible to code around.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Well, it was impossible on January 28th, as the game engine didn't distinguish between pets and other NPCs.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>Please explain what changed.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>A good deal of reengineering was done prior to Kunark's launch to create the 59th necro summon that dual-wields without weapons. Additional code was put in as part of the last patch to further differentiate between pets and other NPCs for the proc changes. <br><br>Given these changes I figured that it would be a good time to address a minor annoyance.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>While I know this discussion is a couple of days old, you can discuss this issue with other EQ Players on our <a href=http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/forum/everquest/showflat.pl?Cat=1,2,3,4,5&Board=eqwestwood&Number=421107&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5 target=_blank>Westwood Tavern</a> fourm.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Abashi took some time to post a rather lengthy reply to a customer who posted some points on the state and direction of the changes that EQ has taken on since release. You can view the original thread over on the <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034311.html target=_blank>Official Everquest Forums.</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>This is the retail version of EQ, the classes and races should have been balanced before you released it.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>That's easy to say, and for the most part it was true. However we *have* been adding content to the game with every patch, including tons of new zones that over doubled the worlds size since release. Every time we add something, we run the risk of creating an imbalance that needs to be addressed, or else we have a broken game that people will not play. Make no mistake: People will not play a broken game.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>All the patches should only be adding content and bug fixes, not plugging up ingenious strategies which the players found and which you didn't think of.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>It goes without saying that 300K people can discover strategies that weren't found by the 40K or so that were in all phases of the beta, and the 2000 people that were in for all but the last month of beta. Additionally, many of these "ingenious strategies" that you speak of were created by us attempting to add more content by way of items, quests, abilites, etc., to the game.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>We players are not here to find crack's in the design of EQ for you.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>No, you are here to have fun. However that aside, you will still find cracks in the design of EQ for us throughout that process. I'm thankful we have a dev team working to address those cracks as they are discovered, or again we'd have a broken game.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>If you truely don't like how we players play this game, or the strategies we come up with, then keep them in mind for when your designing EQ2, but dont punish us here and now.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Again you seem to be saying that it would be better to leave gross imbalances in game that cause people to leave rather than correct them. I have to respectfully disagree, and say with some authority that this will not be the case with any game we make. These games are designed to last in the marketplace for a number of years, and need to last that long to cover development costs, both past and present. If they do not draw enough subscribers or last long enough, the game fails and future development is hurt by it. We won't sit around and watch a game fail when we can do something about it. Now EQ was never in jeopardy of that because we've always addressed these problems as they came up, but if we left every problem, or tried to address them all in a "positive" manner by increasing the power of "A" through "Y" because Z is overpowered, it would not be long before everything in game was elavated to broken proportions.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>Maybe you should realize that this game you created has taken on a life of its own when boxed it and sold it.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Actually it took on a life of its own over a year before release when the community was formed by people interested in the game. As with anything alive though, things are in a constant state of flux. Things change, and we have to change with them to be sure that everything stays in line.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>thats exactly my point. Don't do anything. So what if warriors found a way to solo blues up to 60. So what if every other warrior is doing it 3 weeks later. How does it hurt anyone?</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>So what if all classes found a way to do it? Should we leave it then? Suddenly you have everyone in the game running around without a need to group. Classes become meaningless as one class can do pretty much anything that the next class can. Class A is no longer dependant on class B for good or services in order to advance. That alone would reduce the social impact of the game by making it unnecessary for people to meet each other. Suddenly we'd have 300K people playing a single person game on our servers, with nothing really to hold them together. Aside from the hardcore players, the game would be dead within 6 months.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>Always ADD never TAKE away because when you take away (nerf) you punish.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>And *never* make a policy absolute, with exception to the policy of *never* making a policy absolute. Once you completely block out a particular course of action you limit yourself for no good reason other than it being "policy".<br><br>As mentioned above, the policy of buffing up A-Y every time Z is overpowered is not at all suited to this environment. We would be constantly increasing every classes abilities, or the power of their spells or items, because of "inequities" cited by one class or another. <br><br>Can we agree that as long as we have a class-based system, where classes have complimentary strengths and weaknesses, that there will always be people who believe that the strengths are not strong enough and that the weaknesses are too severe? </font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>If Verant really does really not like this new strategy, then they should tip their hat to the player who discovered it, and remember to make that strategy impossible in some future EQ game.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>That's certainly the policy advocated by the ever-quoted "mudwimping" article, an article that I personally disagree with. As I mentioned above, absolutes are dangerous. Completely ruling out one reasonable course of action and exclusively increasing power or abilities of the game as a whole is a BAD thing to do. It's as bad as exclusively decreasing power or abilities. Neither is an appropriate course of action. That article gets a lot of mention because it suggests a course of action that is popular with socieity: more, more, more, never less. <br><br>There's a quote that suits this situation quite well, so I'll paraphrase: What is right is not always popular, and what is popular is not always right. It basically speaks to the fact that people do not always make the choices that are best for them. I'm sure that we could adopt the suggestions in the mudwimping article and please a lot of people in the short run, but as soon as something came up that completely unbalanced the game, invalidating a class or two, and we decided to leave things as is or enter the "enhancement death spiral", there would be no peace.<br><br>Let me string a series of analogies together. I'm sure they all have their flaws, but I think that the point is sound.<br>Imagine if:<br><br>- banks have a policy of *always* taking the customers word for it in a disputed account.<br>- paying taxes was voluntary (some argue that it is, but still)<br>- we released all of the "innocent" people from jail.<br>- *everyone* has a college degree<br>- *everyone* has at least a million dollars<br><br>These are situations that are pleasing and popular to those who are to be affected, but what happens when they are applied to everyone across the boards? Would any of this be right? Yes, if *I* have a problem at the bank I'd like to know that they'd just take *my* word for it. Yes, *I'd* like paying taxes to be voluntary for *me*. Yes, if *I* was in jail, I know *I'd* be innocent of any crime that would put *me* there so *I'd* like to be released. Yes, *I'd* like to have a college degree. Yes, *I* would like a million bucks.<br><br>But everyone?! NO. *I* can vouch for what is good for *me*, but I know that it's not good for global policy. No, I wouldn't like the idea of banks taking everyone's word for it, as I know that fraud would increase to the point of critical failure and that the entire economy would collapse. No, I wouldn't want paying taxes to be voluntary, because then very few would, government programs would fail, we'd have no standing army, and the government would collapse. No, I wouldn't like everyone who say's that they are innocent to be released from jail. That's why we have a court system. No, I wouldn't want *everyone* to have a college degree, because then a college degree would be meaningless. No, I wouldn't want everyone to have a million bucks, because inflation would run out of control, milk and bread would cost thousands of dollars per unit, and the money would all be in the hands of the top 1% within a month anyway, putting them that much further out of *my* reach. <br><br>One final analogy that fits better than the rest. Imagine if:<br><br>- we increased the power of a class/item/ability, etc., every time "enough" (whatever that means) people complained.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>So to answer your question, Verant should only add content, or leave things as they are.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Well, while I appreciate your ability to state your opinion in a manner that is appropriate for this forum, I must respectfully disagree with the points that you've made.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>

It's therefore essential that we keep raising the bar to provide challenge to those that have figured out how to overcome previous challenges. Obviously, we don't intend to make unbeatable encounters, though we could rarely do that when we tried, but we still need to provide a challenge.<br><br>There's actually two issues here. One, making new content more difficult, which I think should be expected by everyone, as what would be the point if things did not get more difficult as you progressed.<br><br>The other issue is making old content more difficult by reducing the effectivness of tactics that allow a challenge to be overcome without risk. This is a different issue entirely, as some people apparently don't expect this. Here's the short of our intentions: You play the game to have fun. You have fun by overcoming challenges. A challenge is something that has the prospect of failure. Failure must have consequences to be meaningful. Overcoming the challenge without failure yields a reward, whether tangible or ideological. Basically, discovering a way to do something without risk (or with less risk than intended) negates the challenge and creates a situation that we must address in order for the game to be fun.<br><br>-Gordon</font></font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yesterday, Absor and Abashi both addressed the recent change to the rate at which weapons that have procs will fire when wielded by pets. You can view their post on the <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/033226.html target=_blank>Official Everquest Forums.</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Alright everyone, here's what happened.<br><br>As all weapon-wielding pet users probably knew, up until recently pets would proc weapon effects much more frequently than player characters. We recently changed this so that they now proc effects with just about the same frequency as player characters with the same dexterity. The exception is targeted (meant for only one type of enemy, such as summoned creatures) effects, which will now proc about half as often as they do for player characters, but will still proc on anything (this, as you know, is a bug).<br><br>Shortly we will be fixing this bug so that pets with targeted proc items will only proc on the appropriate target. Atthat time, we will bump up the proc rate to match those of any other weapon proc for the pet.<br><br>This only effects weapon procs, not innate procs.<br><br>No pet attributes were changed.<br><br>All pets currently have the same dexterity. It is possible in the future that we will modify the dexterity of pets based on level and type to make them more flexible for their masters.<br><br>I'm sorry that we didn't mention this change earlier.<br><br>Alan</font></blockquote>Abashi responded a little later with:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Another possibility that fixing the targeted proc issue has opened up is the ability to give mages bigger and bettersummoned weapons with target-specific procs as they won't proc on everything.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>And finally, Abashi responded with:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>Why didn't you boost the proc rate on PCs instead?</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Because the proc rate on PCs is appropriate given that PCs can seek to buff up their own dexterity. Pets all have pretty low dexterity, which we'll probably scale up in the near future given this change. <br><br>A pet with maxed out dexterity will proc nearly as much as it used to.</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#050056" size=2>Didnt Abashi PROMISE he would post ANY and ALL nerfs in the server patch message????</font><br><br><font face="Verdana" color="#a00000" size=2>Indeed, of course mistakes do happen and things fall out of the loop. Given the difference in old procs versus new ones, it would be unreasonable to assume that we were trying to slip this one in, don't you think?<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>What do you think about this change? You can discuss this change with other Everquest players on the <a href=http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/forum/everquest/showflat.pl?Cat=1,2,3,4,5&Board=eqwestwood&Number=419851&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5 target=_blank>Westwood Tavern</a>

The following changes were made:<br><br>- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the minimum.<br>- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.<br>- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.<br>- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<br>- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br>- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<br>- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.  <br><br>In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>You can discuss todays patch message with fellow EQ Players <a href=http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/forum/everquest/showflat.pl?Cat=1,2,3,4,5&Board=eqwestwood&Number=419081&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5 target=_blank>here</a> in the Westwood Tavern forurm!

If you click on either device and then click on the driver tab you can determine which version you are using.<br>(An accelerator card will sometimes be located in the Sound, Video, and Game Controllers section.)<br><br>After you find out what video card or sound card you have, please visit our main Web site (<a href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a>), visit the support section and examine the sound and video FAQ&#8217;s. This will usually have locations for the latest drivers for your cards from the manufacturers&#8217; web sites. Please download the latest driver for your card unless it has been recommended to download an older set of drivers. Sometimes, an older set of drivers is more compatible with your system and you will have to shuffle around until you find out the correct driver.<br><br>When you download the driver it will ask you to either save to a disk or open file from its current location. You should check "save this file to a disk", and download to your Documents section. Open up your Documents section, and find the drivers you downloaded. Open up the download, which should be in zipped form.<br><br>Normally, you would download the driver or drivers to your desktop in zip form. Your computer should have an unzip program already installed. If you do not have an unzipping program please download the trial version from www.winzip.com . You should unzip the download into your Windows temp folder. Make sure you know the exact location of the folder. It should be extracted into the windows directory as: C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\DRIVER NAME AND VERSION NUMBER.<br><br>Please read the Readme.txt that is in the download that you have done. Follow the directions carefully, as they are almost always the best directions to correctly install the drivers for your card. It is highly advisable that your print these instructions out, if at all possible, before the installation.<br><br>Sometimes old drivers still present in your system will cause problems. Usually these drivers will not display themselves in regular Windows so you have to go to Safe Mode to remove them.<br><br>If you have Windows 95, reboot your computer. You can enter safe mode by hitting F8 when the message &#8220;Starting Windows95&#8221; appears. <br><br>With Windows 98 Reboot and hold down the left control (ctrl) key after you reboot your computer and you should, after a short period of time, see a menu which has an option for Safe Mode. Please choose the Safe Mode option.<br><br>Once you get into Safe Mode right click on My Computer, left click on Properties, go to Device Manager, and left click the plus button next to Display Adapters. If there are any listings for cards you no longer have or multiple entries for your current video card then remove them.<br><br><br>Good Luck<br>David Starr<br>Verant Interactive Technical and Customer Support</font></blockquote>

This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and other updates.<br>- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument skills.<br>- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.<br><br>Thank you for your continued patience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>

We need to stress the importance of updating your system to play EverQuest as well as increasing your performance with the following changes: <br><br>                          1. You must update to DirectX 7.0a.You can download DirectX 7.0a from the following location:<br>                          <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Update/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DX7Aeng.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Update/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DX7Aeng.exe</a><br><br>                          2. Update your Sound and Video drivers. These drivers must be updated AFTER you update to DirectX 7.0a. If your Sound or Video drivers are not updated after updating to DirectX 7.0a, this may cause the game to be unplayable. See our Video and Sound FAQ at<br>                          <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_video.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_video.shtml</a> and <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_sound.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_sound.shtml</a> for more details.<br><br>                          3. In addition to updating these drivers, you will need to make sure that you are not running any programs in the background while playing EverQuest (virus scanners, MP3, ICQ, IRC, E-mail, etc...). If you shut down any virus scanners before entering EverQuest, be sure to turn them back on when you exit the game.<br><br>                          4. Make sure that you have at least 300MB of space free on your hard drive.<br><br>                          5. If you have a Sound Blaster Live sound card and you are noticing a "Quick Flash" or a "Momentary Hesitation" in game, turn your hardware acceleration down one notch from Full (or 3/4). <br><br><br>                          If you are experiencing any problems after you have made these changes, please email your dxdiag.exe and your dbg.txt to eqtech@verant.com.<br><br>                          To run dxdiag.exe, please do the following:<br><br>                          1.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hello and good morning/afternoon/evening EQSS readers!<br><br>Recently in my Lead Editor's Letter I stated that the Editorial Team would be looking at EQSS current article content to see what documents are either out of date, due to EverQuest changing, or needed for the site.  In doing so I decided to start at the beginning, Class Newbie Guides.<br><br>All of us have started for the first time in Norrath and can relate to what it must be like logging in with no idea what to do next.  While some players just log into the game and ask questions how to play, others come to EQ Stratics first to find out tips on what to do in this new world.  I promise the new player will love you forever for having taken the time to share your gaming experience.<br><br>Unsure what a Class Newbie Guide should cover or where to start?  I would recommend writing a guide completely from a single races starting aspect. One reason is stat point application, another guild location, further more hunting grounds and so forth.  With that in mind, a Class Newbie Guide should cover the following topics:<br><br><ul><li>Character creation (recommend) stat point application<br><li>Guild location<br><li>General navigation in starting city<br><li>Training and skills (such as skills that do not increase without a point applied, or special class skills like Harm Touch)<br><li>Navigation to hunting grounds<br><li>Hunting and Monster tactics<br><li>Useful quests and life through the first 10 to 12 levels<br><li>Tricks of the trade (such as how to quick change between weapons and instruments for bards.)</ul><br>Even if you see that we already have a newbie guide for a certain class, please feel free to write your own. When a player is starting out it is hard to give him or her much too advice!<br><br>--Onnie<br>Lead Editor, EQSS

You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play EverQuest.  Please refer to <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml</a> prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<br><br>Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about for some time.  The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the past.<br><br>*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br><br>The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight.  All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the windows.<br><br>The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided.  Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.  <br><br>As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the window.  You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<br><br>*Spell Changes*<br><br>-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br>-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br>-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item.  The effect was checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br>-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br>-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.<br>-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br>-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<br>-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<br><br>-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat.  In addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<br><br>*General Fixes/Changes*<br><br>-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people who were fighting pirates.<br>-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since they do not have the piercing skill.<br>-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.<br>-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br>-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br>-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items.  Please check your items to see your changes.  Note:  Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br>-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct loot.<br>-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br>-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br>-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.<br><br>-- Repaired the Forager Bag.  It was causing people to lose weight when placing items in the bag.  It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<br><br>-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50.  Previously, creatures above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill.  Now, most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted.  As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature below 50th.<br><br><br>*Client Enhancements*<br><br>-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br>-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total number of available socials by 108.<br>-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate incorrectly.<br>-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher resolutions.<br>-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider.  Users should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an adjustable clipping plane.<br><br>-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads when linkdead.  In addition, these same players will no longer show as "LinkDead" in the /who list.<br><br>-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game.  /usercolor:  Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green and blue respectively.  All changes will be automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name indicating the server number.  As such, you will now be able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom options.<br><br>-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and character name.  For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br><br>-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:  AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on automatically when assisting.  Defaults to "TRUE".  ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the "Soandso is inspecting you" message.  Defaults to "TRUE".<br><br>-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced.  You can now set two keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game.  In addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference.  Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.<br><br>-- Added the /note command.  /note will append the following text to a file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory.  For instance, typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next line in the notes.txt file.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>You can discuss todays patch with other players at <a href=http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/forum/everquest/showflat.pl?Cat=1,2,3,4,5&Board=eqwestwood&Number=415174&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5 target=_blank>The Westwood Tavern</a>.

Before you do this I would want you to make sure you know what video card and sound card driver versions you use. <br><br>Here is two ways to determine what sound and video game drivers and cards you have.<br><br>Click on start; go up to the run box. In the Run window, type DXDIAG than hit ok. This will launch the DirectX diagnostics tool. Click on the tab that says Display to see what video card you are using and what is the latest driver you are using. . Click on the tab that says Sound to see what sound card you are using and what is the latest driver for the sound card. If you are using a 3D-accelerator card it will show up as another Display number. You will have a Display 1 and a Display 2. Please copy the information down for both.<br><br>Please write this information down on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil. Remember to write down the number of the driver version you are using.<br><br>Another way is at your desktop right click on My Computer. Scroll down to properties, click on properties and go up to device manager. Please click on device manager. In the device manager, if you click on sound, video, and game controllers, you can determine what audio device you are using. If you click on display adapter you can see what video device you are using. If you click on either device and then click on the driver tab you can determine which version you are using. If you are using a 3D-accelerator card it will most likely show up in your sound, video, and game controllers section.<br><br>After you find out what video card or sound card you have, please visit our main web site and visit the support section and examine the sound and video FAQ&#8217;s. This will usually have locations for the latest drivers for your cards from the manufacturers&#8217; web sites. You may want to write that information down as well.<br><br>Now for the update information:<br><br>For the full version download for DirectX 7.0a, go to this URL. 6.3MB download. <br><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Update/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DX7Aeng.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Update/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DX7Aeng.exe</a> <br>If you have DirectX 7.0 on your system already, there is a DirectX patch to upgrade to 7.0a. 234KB download. <br><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Patch/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DI7AENG.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/win98SE/Patch/7.0a/W9X/EN-US/DI7AENG.exe</a> <br><br>It is up to you what you will want to download. I would recommend the full version of DirectX7.0a. <br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>At this time I do not recommend downloading Direct X 8.0. Please do not download and install it this brand new DirectX version. Many of the Video and Sound Card manufacturers have not made drivers that work with EverQuest and DirectX8.0. Please note there is a difference between compliant and compatible.<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>After you have updated to DirectX7.0a please try to play the game. If you have problems we recommend that you reinstall your video card drivers and sound card drivers. Since you have written them down, you will have a good idea of what version number you need. If you have visited our web site looked at the Video and Sound FAQ&#8217;s under support, you should now know what web site you need to visit to download the proper or latest Video Card Drivers. There is a chance that after the patch you might again need to update and/or change your driver versions.<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>There is a slight chance you might want to reinstall or uninstall DirectX due to corruption issues. An uninstaller is available off the Www.downloads.com web site at<br><a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10107-100-2023210.html?tag=st.dl.10001_103_1.lst.td_2023210">http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-10107-100-2023210.html?tag=st.dl.10001_103_1.lst.td_2023210</a> <br><br>Follow the directions carefully.

Imagine a soldier-to-soldier combat and vehicular warfare game set within a massive persistent environment," said John Smedley, President and CEO of Sony Online Entertainment Inc. "'PlanetSide' is a logical extension of Verant's online capabilities."<br><br>In the game, players assume the roles of mercenaries and reside in a distant galaxy where little semblance of law exists. In PlanetSide, these mercenaries rise within the ranks of one of four specialized corporations that offer both character development and professional growth.<br><br>"'PlanetSide' expands the first-person action genre into an entirely new universe," said Kevin McCann, producer of the game. "Both team-minded players as well as independent rogues are going to find a place within this game, which represents the culmination of years of Verant's work."<br><br>"We've created a persistent world where you work to capture bases and<br>increase your worth over time - a place where you can return again and again, where your accomplishments are recorded and translated into statistics, merits, and other rewards."<br><br>More About "PlanetSide"<br>The "PlanetSide" continents measure approximately 64 square kilometers, varying from arctic wastelands to scorching deserts. Players work to capture various technological bases - using both soldier-to-soldier as well as vehicle-based combat - to eventually influence the control of the continent toward their chosen corporation.<br><br>There are four primary corporations that offer professional growth<br>opportunities and steady income: the mining industry, the technological industry, the science and research industry and the military industry. These corporations "sponsor" players - offer a starting apartment and a Personal Computer Terminal where they can access job assignments, news, and e-mail.<br> <br>"PlanetSide," published by Sony Online Entertainment, is due to ship the third quarter of 2001 for the PC platform.<br><br>The game is currently featured on the cover of the December issue of "PC Gamer" magazine. Six screenshots from PlanetSide are available for FTP download at www.filekey.com/linnpr/PS-Screens.zip.<br><br>About Verant Interactive<br>Verant Interactive Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony Online<br>Entertainment Inc. Known for its best-selling massively multiplayer online role-playing game EverQuest(r), Verant is committed to developing cutting-edge online games and communities such as Tanarus(tm), Sovereign(tm), Infantry(tm) and Star Wars Online(tm). <br>  <br>About Sony Online Entertainment<br>Continuing to deliver break-through interactive gaming, Sony Online<br>Entertainment Inc.

Verant has given us a canvas with people and places to work with, but not a great deal of history and lore.  These gaps we strive to fill through the telling of stories and singing of songs.<br> <br>-Ry Skylark</font></blockquote>

As of today we are hosting the <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/tools/main.shtml">UO Tools of Douglas Portz</a>. Douglas is the creator of several tools such as <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/tools/uohome.shtml">UO Home Owner</a> that will allow home owners to use all house related house commands, <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/tools/uorudder.shtml">UO Rudder</a> that will allow sailors to easily navigate their boat and <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/tools/uotamer.shtml">UO Tamer</a> that helps tamers with giving commands to their pets. Douglas is also working on UO Stable Master, a tool that will keep track of where you've stabled your animals.</li><br><li>Although the <a href="http://support.uo.com/uopro.html">UO Pro program</a> has been discontinued by OSI, all these tools are created in that spirit; their use promotes and is in keeping with the spirit of the Ultima Online product, community and value system. There is nothing you can do with these tools that you could not do with macro keys in the UO client. All that these tools do, is simulate typing a command in the UO window and pressing enter. No UO client code or data stream is being changed or monitored. Nevertheless, since neither of these tools have the official UO Pro seal of approval, <b>use of these tools is at your own risk</b>. However, judging by the type of tools that were UO Pro approved, I cannot imagine someone getting into trouble because of using these new tools.</li></ul></font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><font face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056>Greetings friends!<br><br>The Stratics Message Forums are scheduled to be down for maintenance starting in the late afternoon on Monday, November 6th, 2000. The forum software we are currently using is going to be upgraded and a great many new features will be added. The downtime is expected to last no more than a few hours, but we are leaving ourselves with a fairly big window. In fact, I am only going to say that the forum will be back online sometime prior to Tuesday morning. In all likelihood the forums will only be down for a couple hours barring any unforeseen issues arise. This is a <B>major</B> upgrade and it requires a lot of work on the server.<br><br>There are actually two phases to this upgrade. The first phase is a hardware upgrade. The second phase is a major software upgrade. Our software upgrade is schedule for Monday, as described above. The hardware upgrade is being done today (10/03/00). Once both phases have been completed, you will finally be rid of the darn lag that has plagued us for months during peak usage (generally during the day between 12:00pm - 5:00pm EST). We thought we had it beat a couple months ago, but the volume our forums generate is such that the server simply could not manage the load anymore. You all are simply too rough on our poor server! <g> Without going into boring details, we are going to make some major modifications to our forum software and our hardware back-end which the software runs on. The end result will be much better performance for you.<br><br>Features you can look forward to in the new upgrade:<br><br><ul><font face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056><li><B>Improved interface</B> - An improved and easy to use interface. In-Post Polls - Polls built directly into the forums!<br></li><li><B>Enhanced Private Messaging</B> - An enhanced PM Control Panel.<br></li><li><B>A Private Address Book</B> - Store registered users in your address book.<br></li><li><B>Multiple Skin/Color Schemes</B> - Choose from a large number of different skins. You'll have at least a dozen skins to choose from.<br></li><li><B>Member List</B> - Look up registered members.<br></li><li><B>Time Offset</B> - allows you to set the forums to your own time zone.<br></li><li><B>Improved Search</B> - The search features have been repaired.<br></li><li><B>Send to a Friend</B> - Now you can forward posts to friends.<br></li><li><B>Enhanced "Jump To"</B> - Fixes previous issues the jump feature had.<br></li><li><B>Comprehensive Help System</B> - A vastly improved help system.<br></li><li><B>Quick Views</B> - Shows new messages posted within 24 and 48 hours or the last 7 days.<br></li><li><B>In-Forum News/Announcement system </B>- Keep up to speed with current events like never before.<br></li><li><B>Improved Who's Online</B> - See who's online and what they're doing!<br></li><li><B>New "Subject" Page Links </B>- Links in the subject lines to multi-page threads. Helps you read threads much more quickly.<br></li><li><B>Superior Security</B> - Secuirity features have been enhanced as well.</li></font></ul><br>We have also made some dramatic improvements on the back-end, which will help speed up the forums. This is where the bulk of the downtime will be spent, migrating data from one large database to many smaller more compact databases.<br><br>After this upgrade you can expect even more new features to be added on a regular basis from here on out. Some examples include an "Ignore" option that allows for you to place troublesome users on your own personal ignore list. This list then blocks or filters out any message from the person. This is very similar to "/ignore" in most online titles. We will also be adding more colors and more icons than ever before; spoiler mark-up tags, special "mark all read" options and much, much more.<br><br>It should be pointed out however that if you have or know of, a web site that links to our forums. The URL used to reach our forums will be changing. So please be sure to update your links or inform those sites you know of to update theirs starting on Tuesday. If ever in doubt on how to reach your favorite forum because of this URL change, simply visit <A href="http://boards.stratics.com">http://boards.stratics.com</A> and you'll find a complete directory of all of our forums, services and features.<br><br>It has been a while, but we have been working diligently to try and improve the speed, performance and feature set of our forums and starting Monday we are going to take a MAJOR step in that direction. So again, please be aware that come Monday afternoon the forums will be coming down for maintenance and we will have them back online as quickly as possible. As soon as the hardware upgrade is in place participating in our forums will no longer feel like a chore, it will be a lot more fun... The fun is only beginning folks.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Stratics Community Development<br><br></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this upgrade in the <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=408792&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5">Westwood Tavern!</a>

In short, it's not something we're considering changing.</font><br><br><font face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056>>>>Agreed.

The example in your post is not a large enough model to see the difference. You could certainly proc 5 times in a row even with minimum dex, but the chance is far less.<br><br>Remember that previous successes or failures have nothing to do with the chance of future successes or failures. The fact that you just proc'd does not make the chance of your next proc any closer or further away, probabiltywise. <br><br>Regarding the random number generator, people think that because streaks happen that there's some problems. Random does not mean equal and regular distribution over the course of the sample. In any 10 flips of a coin you still have a .1% chance of never having it come up "heads". The fact that you may sit down and flip a coin 10 times and not get "heads" doesn't mean that your coin flip isn't random.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>

I want to thank all of you who have shown great support for this event, and to those who were not able to make it this year, I send my best wishes and sincere desire to see you at the next EQ FEST!<br> <br><b>WEATHER</b><br> <br>The weather for the weekend will be a chance of isolated t-storms with lows in the 50's and highs in the low 70's.  Be sure to bring adequate protection from the elements.  The Friday night social gathering is all inside, but Saturday and Sunday will be out in the open. (We will be under a very large Pavilion style tent on Saturday.)<br> <br><b>EQ FEST CONTESTS</b><br> <br>I am seeing several people sign up for the contests who are not on my list as attendees.  As such, there will be a secondary sign-in sheet located at the front table which you will need to fill out and return to me after the Friday Night Social Gathering.  If you will not be attending Friday night, you may fill it out first thing Saturday morning and give to me prior to the contests.<br> <br><b>ADMISSIONS</b><br> <br>Based on the above statement.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  If you have not paid your registration, or made special arrangements with me, you will not be able to enter the private area where EQ FEST 2000 will be held.  This does not mean you can not come to the Texas Renaissance festival, it just means you will not be able to take part in the EQ related festivities.  Although I hate to see anyone miss out, it would not be fair to those who paid their admissions to allow this.  The web site was very clear on the admission policy and cut off dates.<br> <br><b>PUNCTUALITY IS A VIRTUE</b><br> <br>For those of you who are attending the fest, it is very important that you be on time for the Friday night dinner and the start of the event on Saturday and Sunday. This will insure that you receive all the necessary information you will need to have a well planned weekend. I want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to take part in all events.<br> <br>Thanks again for all your support! I look forward to seeing you all this weekend, and for those not coming, next year!<br> <br>Guntar Pontdecardon<br>EQ FESTIVAL 2000</font></blockquote><br><br>I look forward to seeing you all there!

It's nice to see a good opportunity for straight-forward discussion here on the boards.<br><br>>>>Doesn't exactly paint a trustworthy picture, does it?<br><br>Maybe it does paint a trustworthy picture, but perhaps not in the same fashion as what you would have hoped. I do think that players should and can trust that we'll do what we can in order to ensure that EverQuest remains a game that people want to play. Afterall, it's been shown that people do no like to play games that are too easy and where there is no challenge in playing. It's been shown that there is no feeling of accomplishment that comes, for instance, in obtaining an item that "everyone" else has, or has relatively unrestricted access to. <br><br>It's one of those things that can have a positive and negative effect. As has been said before, to make an omelette, you have to break a few eggs.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>

Its secondary resist will be removed completely. It will have a longer duration.

Surely, nothing intentional was implemented along these lines. Absor himself sat and watched songs sing for a good deal of time today and never got a message "Your song has ended abruptly".

We spent a good deal of time today looking into it, and were unable to reproduce any spontaneous ending of the song.<br>The only time we were able to get a song to "end abruptly" was when the bard was stunned. The message wasn't displayed to the bard, but to people around the bard.<br><br>I know that Absor was going to look at it tonight from home on a 28.8K modem to see if it's latency-related, but baring that we'll probably have to call it until someone else can offer evidence on a way to reproduce it. <br><br>Here's what we know, no intentional change has been made by the programming staff in regards to this. The programmers are also very confident that no other changes made would create this problem. As of now, I've only seen one person with first-hand reports.<br><br>We'll of course be open to hearing from anyone else with insight on this issue.<br><br>-Gordon</font><br></blockquote>
