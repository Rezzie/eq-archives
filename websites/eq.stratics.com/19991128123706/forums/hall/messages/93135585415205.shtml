My last response to this never came through (which is probably just as well since I talked too much!  hehe) so I'll try this again.<p>Cliff notes version:<p>I don't have a problem with it because when I'm IC, I'm IC.  Therefore if I'm with a group and I'm with 3 girls and 3 guys, well I'm with 3 girls and 3 guys.  Not 1 guy playing a girl and 3 guys and well you get the idea.  If you are doing it for other reasons than the RP aspect then I think that's wrong, but how would I know since I try to stay IC all the time and don't really get involved with the people behind the characters I'm RPing with (there are some exceptions of course).<p>I don't do the whole marriage/relationship thing online either.  I have one IRL, don't need it in game either.  That's not to say my character doesn't have friends, and very good ones at that that she cares about deeply.  It just will never go beyond that for her.  Both because that's what I choose for her and because of her background/history.  I think that's taking it too far and I agree that its "lame".  But its lame to me.  If other people are into that, great for them.<p>Being a female playing a female character, I have personally never had anyone ask me if I was really a female.  I think this is because I RP with a great group and I try to stay IC as much as possible.  I've also never had anyone give me special favors because I was female.  That's not to say people haven't helped me immensly and gone out of there way for me.  I've been very lucky to meet some great people IC.  But no one has ever "hit on" my character and I think that people have been generous to my character because of how she is IC, not because she is a female.<p>Just my 2 copper on the whole subject.  Play what you want to play and play it the best you can.  You'll be rewarded with a great RP experience and no one should care if you are a male or female behind the character.<p>Elphaba<br>Magician of the 15th Circle
