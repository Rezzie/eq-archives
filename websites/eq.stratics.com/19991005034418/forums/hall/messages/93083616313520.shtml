More (Necro-based) discussions with GZ:<p>I have put in excerpts from emails which the Necro public would find useful.  They are in this message from most recent to oldest (which is occasionally why one question that is asked later was already answered)).<p>Note: Looks like my guess that Lich is the final in the 'Dark Pact' lines was correct.  I assume we take on Lich form (similar to how COB we take on Dread Bone form), and perhaps a few other traits as well... (i.e. in Dread Bone form we gain their sight, etc).<p>Again I'd like to applaud GZ for taking the time to answer these questions.  I doubt he will continue to be able to do so, as more and more people are inundating him with similar messages <g><br>--------------------<br>> Can you explain what the Lich spell does?<p>    Call of Bones, but a lot more so.<p><br>> Can you also get that spell via a quest instead of research?<p>    Now - no.  Soon, yes.<p><br>> Any possibility of upgrading the Blood line at 49?<p>    Possible - have to check my numbers.<br>-------------------<br>> BTW - on another note - Shamans are complaining that while their scourge<br>was<br>> lowered in duration, the damage was not upped?  I have not tested it<br>myself<br>> (as I am still at work) - but I'd assume same thing would have occurred to<br>> Necros...<p>    I believe it was - I will have to check.  It would be the same for both,<br>however.<br>--------------------<br>> I saw in the patch that it said beguile/charm for necros/shamans were<br>being<br>> removed for a while because of lack of practical use (or something to that<br>> degree).<br>><br>> While I agree the level limits hindered their use (i.e. when I cast<br>beguile,<br>> my level 44 charm, on a level 40ish creature, I got the message 'That<br>> creature is too high level to use with that spell' -- but beguile did work<br>> on Sand Giants which were level 32-39), they were still useful (and even<br>> more so) and fun spells.<br>><br>> It was actually one way I could really help a party out - for example, we<br>> were in SolB last night, and our puller pulled 4 (instead of 1 or 2).. So<br>I<br>> could beguile 1 to fight another, effectively reducing the fight down to<br>us<br>> fighting 2 (course when beguile wore off I was pretty much dead <g>).<br>><br>> I hope your plan was to increase the effectiveness of these spells, not<br>just<br>> remove/replace them.  Most 44+ necros I know only have 4 level 44 spells<br>and<br>> 3 level 49 spells :(<p>    The spells were removed because Necromancers (and Shamans) could not<br>charm anything near their level - the pets that they can summon are almost<br>always better than anything they could hope to charm (because of the charm<br>level limit).  Because of this, and because of some of the inherant trouble<br>that can come with the charm spells, I decided to remove them from the<br>Shaman and Necro.  I did not remove the undead charming, which works very<br>well.  On a similar note, Shamans did not lose their animal charming.  I<br>will make sure to replace it with something interesting.<p>    As for the 'few spells' - most of the high level ones are researched.<br>They are a bit harder to find - but still very nice.<br>---------------------<br>><br>> Vampiric Curse level 29 DOT that gives you health (so like a drain over<br>> time) and damages.<br>> Circle of Death level 49 DOT that gives you more health over time and<br>> damages.  I did not understand their functionality because they didn't<br>work<br>> previously (tomorrow's patch should fix this).<br>><br>> So COD used in conjunction with Call of Bones (or whatever) would be a way<br>> to perhaps keep your<br>> health near max (probably in practice it will still decline, just slower)<br>> yet regen mana a lot quicker.<br>><br>> Is that analysis correct?<p>    Very much so.<p><br>> And COD is 49th and will be in tomorrow?<p>    Yep.  :)<br>--------------------<br>> Finally.. the patch mentioned research had been fixed.  Could you<br>elaborate?<p>    Actually, I think it said a few of the research ones which had bad<br>recipies were fixed.<p><br>> Also, I still don't see our level 49 Drain in the research books.  Is this<br>a<br>> quest spell?<p>    Yes.  I am going to add it to the books though as well.<br>--------------------<br>> #6 Call of Bones bug: while in Call of Bones form, we are aggro to undead<br>> (including skeletons), and our name does not show up on top of our<br>> character.<p>    The change in form does not change what undead think about you - this is<br>not the purpose of the spell.  As for the name, I will check that out.<br>Thanks.<br>--------------------<br>> #5 A solution to summoning pets texture 2 meg limit: Call of Bones turns<br>us<br>> into a Dread Bone skeleton.  Enchanters have a spell that turns them into<br>a<br>> Wear Wolf.  So, it would be neat if our 29th pet summoned a Dread Bone<br>> looking skeleton, and our 49th into a Wear Wolf.  That would be leaving<br>the<br>> textures unchanged, but giving us the appearance of new pets.<p>    I have been waiting for some new code before I change appearances.  If<br>it doesn't come through soon, I will just change the appearances and call it<br>done.<br>----------------------<br>> #2 Ignite Bones bug: when you ignite a creature it is made smaller and<br>turns<br>> into a skeleton - when the spell wears off the creature retains this<br>smaller<br>> size (i.e. a Sand Giant becomes a mini-sand giant in appearance, yet still<br>> is 'large' as far as collision-detection is concerned).<p>    This is a display bug - we should have it fixed pretty soon.<br>-------------------<br>> And most importantly - fix DOT's so that they do not steal the corpse/exp<br>> while in a group - while not in a group it has never stolen<br>exp/corpse/loot.<br>> While in a group it happens so frequently that I am asked never ever to<br>cast<br>> dots.<p>    We have some of our guys in testing workin on this.<br>-------------------<br>><br>> Rank 1 pet: skel<br>> Rank 2 pet: zombie<br>> rank 3 pet: mummy<br>> rank 10 pet: spectre<br>> rank 11 pet: blah<br>><br>> That way you can just use the current textures/animations, just let us<br>> summon other things.  That would be very impressive :)<p>    This is zone based.  Meaning only certain ceratures in any one zone -<br>the 12 player races, the 8-12 monsters and the skeleton and elemental.  That<br>maxes it right there.<p><br>> What Sojourn did was it allowed you to summon different things based on<br>> level (as well as level of creature you killed..i.e. you would have to<br>kill<br>> a high level creature then try to raise it from the dead)..  So a high<br>level<br>> person could create a zombie, wraith, or (if lucky) a vampire..  All with<br>> the same spell.<p>    I would do that for us if we didn't have the hardware limit.  Believe<br>me.<p><br>> Anyways.. I digress.  If the only problem was the 2 meg limit on textures,<br>> then the ability to summon different things would be neat..  Unless I did<br>> not fully understand the problem - perhaps the problem is the fact that<br>per<br>> zone the total is 2 meg.. So with the other monsters that exist in a zone<br>> (plus pcs) it is not possible to allow crosses of spectres, zombies, etc<br>in<br>> every zone.<p>    Yep.<br>-------------<br>> The help guide suggests Int primarily for a Necro and Dex secondly.<br>><br>> I agree to that - I wondered if you did.<br>><br>> Dex for 2 reasons: #1 since some necro spells go off in hth combat.<br>> #2 dex is nice so that it helps you resume casting ability if you are hit<br>> (and those 50th level crits hit you regardless, so dex seems to make more<br>> sense than agility as what is important for a necro after int).<br>><br>> That is my reasoning behind why the Verant guide puts Int then Dex as the<br>> most important attributes for a necro.  Do you agree or am I missing<br>> something?<p>    That sounds about right.  Dex is good - not as good as int, but still<br>pretty good.
