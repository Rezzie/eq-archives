At this                  point, my understanding is that the responsbile parties haven't                  acknowledged responsibility for the issue yet. <br>                 <br>                 Web users wouldn't really notice this timeout which is why I suspect                  that there haven't been too many complaints. Real-time games are                  another matter. I would suggest that Canadian customers having                  this problem be very firm with their ISPs on the issue. <br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font><br>               </blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem957119092,8760,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Online            Gaming Groups</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 11:24 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font>             <div> This in from Dragons:<br>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><br>                 How does Everquest OGGs Stack Up To Other Games?<br>                 ----------------------------------------<br>                 The online gaming world is vast and teeming with life. In this                  world you have solo players and you have guilds of players. But                  there is a 3rd category of group that is very very rare yet very                  visible and active. That group is know as the OGG's (Online Gaming                  Groups). Everquest has some like The Syndicate. Other types of                  games do as well. OGG's are a special kind of entity going beyond                  what a normal guild offers. How do Everquest's OGG's stack up                  against those from other game worlds? What makes an OGG different                  from a regular guild?What does an OGG offer to the gaming world                  its in? Well Gamespot has released the following article discussing                  what is an OGG, sharing the most prevalent ones and then discussing                  how they stack up.

Both have been extremely well done, and both exhibit an                  intellegence and creativity that your past work didn't even hint                  at. The new kunark zones and the amazing capabilities of characters                  past level 50 make the rest of the game pale in comparison.<br>                 <br>                 Now we've gotten to the subject of my post: What about the rest                  of the game? Kunark is stunning but there are still zones in the                  "old game" that aren't even near fully utilized.<br>                 <br>                 Will work on the "old game" be abandoned in favor of doting on                  the new and expensive-to-create Kunark?<br>                 <br>                 Will we ever see graphical enhancements to the "old game" to bring                  it at least a little more in-line with the current majesty of                  Kunark? Will "The Hole" ever open!? Will Odus ever be worth going                  to? Will NPC's which previously just stood around (and there are                  a lot of them - the majority in fact) saying nothing when you                  hailed them ever start saying things?<br>                 <font color=a#00000><br>                 First, thanks for the compliments -- Kunark was an opportunity                  to learn from our mistakes and do better. And in the future, we'll                  top Kunark. <br>                 <br>                 Now, to your questions.<br>                 <br>                 1. No, we will not be updating the graphics on the old zones.                  This is primarily for two reasons: a. Resources are limited and                  I really think most of our customers would rather see new content                  as opposed to re-doing older content, and b., as was mentioned                  in this thread, it's not really appropriate to change the system                  requirements on the existing lands, which upgrading the graphics                  significantly would. That said, we have at least one minor way                  we're going to be upgrading the original world soon.<br>                 <br>                 2. The 'old game' will definitely NOT be abandoned. The EQ Live                  team will continue to address crowding issues by revamping the                  lesser used dungeons and other zones. In addition, many of the                  zone mechanics that are being tried in Kunark, should they prove                  successful, will be used in the older zones when they are revamped                  as well.<br>                 <br>                 3. The Hole is still on target for May, probably late May. After                  the Hole comes the Warrens, which is also on Odus. And we will                  continue to add free zones after that.<br>                 <br>                 4.

As for not being allowed to bind                  in this zone, I think that even some of our bigger critics will                  agree that allowing binding in this zone created a bit of a balance                  issue. <br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font></blockquote>               <br>               <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037072.html" target="_blank">EQ                Events</a><br>               <blockquote><br>                 I've been thinking, about creating a tounament, a fighting tournament.

I am of the opinion that many areas                  of Norrath, especially dungeons, are underutilized. In order to                  promote these areas as well as the art of the Dungeon Crawl, I                  intend to periodically lead expeditions to these locales. The                  last expedition to Befallen was a great success with over 40 participants                  combing the dungeon. I am looking for hearty adventurers to join                  me in these expeditions. Be forewarned that dungeons are dangerous                  and have their own unique challenges (i.e. locked doors, traps,                  large groups of monsters, etc.). Also, it will be a Dungeon Crawl                  (meaning we will be moving from room to room, not camping in the                  same spot). Therefore, power levelers, campers, and people that                  run at the first sign of danger may not find this experience to                  there liking. However, for those who enjoy joining a band of adventurers                  and conquering a dungeon while focusing on fun, companionship,                  and defeating foul beasts, please come out and join me. <br>                 <br>                 Target: Runnyeye Citadel, a goblin stronghold located between                  Misty Thicket and the Gorge. It is a huge dungeon that I know                  very little about. It contains hordes of goblins as well as some                  other exotic creatures like Evil Eyes and Gelatinous Cubes.<br>                 Level range: 15-30th. Groups will be formed the day of the event.                  Rough group ranges will be 15-20, 21-25, and 26-30. <br>                 Rallying point/time: The Wall in Misty Thicket at 8 pm Pacific                  time (Wednesday, May 3rd). Please be geared up and ready to go.                  It is encouraged that you bind yourself in Rivervale beforehand.                  The dungeon is roughly 1 minute travel time from the rallying                  point.<br>                 <br>                 Any questions?

When I arrived I ran into my good friend Alondal Lifebringer.                  He was quite nervous and a bit shook up so I offered him a mug                  of ale at the tavern but he refused, now even more concerned as                  I had never seen Alondal pass up ale we walked over to a bench                  where it was a bit more quiet and I asked him what brought him                  such fear. He told me that he had just returned from the wedding                  of Nyplid Ironwolf and had witnessed the most terrifying of things.                  As Nyplid and his beloved were exchanging vows he felt a sudden                  jolt of darkness enter his mind he told me. Then he said that                  his spine tingled from top to bottom as the night sky became darker                  and a flash of red light lit up all of Norrath for a brief moment.                  Then he told me that his vision was blurred as a darkness so dark                  fell in front of him that all he could see was blind dim light.                  Then suddenly everything restored to normal and it was all gone.                  But at further investigation he found that Nyplid was missing.                  He heard one last agonizing scream as the fire from where Nyplid                  had stood faded. He says he was so frightened and worried about                  his dear friend that he ran all the way from Lake Rathetear to                  here and planned on continuing on to his home of Felwithe. I gave                  him some extra food and drink I had and wished him well on his                  journey. I felt a haze overcome me as I thought about what I had                  just heard. Than I realized that something truly horrid had happened                  to my dear friend, Nyplid Ironwolf had been captured by evil forces                  and I knew not what to do at all. I ran to the inn to write up                  this note which you are now reading.

They                  could come to a consesus on various issues relating to Character                  skills, abilities and spells. They wouldn't have direct control                  over the design/code of EQ. Instead, they would submit their findings                  to the design/code team. Together aggree upon what would be best                  for EQ overall. Instead of just the whims of a few, EQ could draw                  upon a vast pool of RPG knowledge/experience.<br>                 <font color=#a00000><br>                 Your assumption seems to be that a "team of experienced gamers"                  and the "design/code team" are two different groups of people.                  Everyone on the design/coding team *is* an experienced gamer,                  and *is* experienced with EQ from the perspective of a player                  as well. In addition to this, we also rely on the opinions of                  those on the Test Server, *and* the opinions of EQ players who                  make suggestions in game and on boards such as this.<br>                 <br>                 "Consensus" however is not an easy thing to find in a large group.                  Certainly people can agree on broad concepts such as "My class                  is too weak", but the method for addressing the concept varies                  greatly. <br>                 <FONT color=#050056><br>                 >>>For example, most think a Ranger should be the most powerfull                  Archer in the game having only to rely on his blade for close                  encounters<br>                 <font color=#a00000><br>                 I'd have to disagree that "most" think this. I would agree that                  "most" think that archery should be more powerful, but I don't                  think that people believe that rangers should be archers first,                  and melee second. Human nature is to want to have all of the advantages,                  and none of the disadvantages, or in other words, to have your                  cake and eat it to. Given that rangers are balanced, perhaps a                  better question would be how many rangers would be willing to                  lose (meaning that they'd no longer be able to do things that                  they can now) melee abilities in exchange for stronger archery?<br>                 <br>                 Being honest up front, though the question is more fair than just                  asking "how many want stronger archery", it's not something that                  would be done for EQ at this point. We honestly are not interested                  in drastically redefining a class at this point, and a redefine                  is what would be necessary to make an "Archer" class. <br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font></font></font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><FONT color=#050056><font color=#a00000><br>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></font></font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956905414,14818,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EQrealms            Is Back</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 12:03 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:ivan@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ivan              Thely</a></font>             <div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               From Dantes De'Durre:<br>               <br>               <blockquote><br>                 EQrealms (<a href="http://www.eqrealms.com" target="_blank">www.eqrealms.com</a>),                  after a very long leave of absence and some serious effort to                  produce a much better site, is now back and brand new!<br>                 Our knowledge database is now fully developed and has about 500                  peices of armor, 300 weapons, 200 mobs, and many more are being                  added daily.

We, your players,                  are trying to figure out what your goal is for hybrid melee in                  the expansion. Frankly, a lot of us are confused.

More is taken into account                  than skills. A level 60 hybrid with a 2HS skill of X is better                  with his sword than a level 40 warrior with the same skill value.                  In fact, all of the hybrids will be better at melee at level 60                  than a level 50 warrior. They of course will not be as good as                  a level 60 warrior, but this should be understandable. <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><br>               </font><br>               <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036436.html>Rogue                Disciplines</a><br>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               <blockquote><br>                 >>>Where are our other diciplines(sp?)?

In this game, game balance is required                  for there to be a challenge.

In the end, we'd be constantly tuning things up, trying to reach                  a point where each class felt that they were powerful enough,                  yet when each individual class was enhanced, other classes would                  still feel that they get the short end of the stick. <br>                 <br>                 Though it's somewhat taking it to extremes, the end result would                  be a game where every NPC had 1 hitpoint. At that point, every                  class would finally be immensely powerful, yet the game would                  be awfully boring.<br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><br>               </font><br>               <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036504.html>Choppy                RoK Framerates</a><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               <blockquote><br>                 <font color=#a00000><br>                 As Brad mentioned in another thread, the swaying trees really                  have nothing to do with the framerates that people are getting.

It might be advantageous for the                  person you are trying to taunt the critter off of to back off                  a bit and let you get a bit of a head start before jumping back                  in.<br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><br>               </font><br>               <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036590.html>Proposed                Corpse Command</a><br>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               <blockquote><br>                 What I'm proposing is a simple yet handy command, executable by                  players.<br>                 /new_corpses_command<br>                 <br>                 Result:<br>                 --------------------------------------------------<br>                 Loramae's corpse0 (hateplane) (3 hours 42 minutes) *old*<br>                 Loramae's corpse1 (hateplane) (23 hours 59 minutes) *new*<br>                 --------------------------------------------------<br>                 <br>                 Basically, it lists corpses in Norrath for the player.

Keeping it simple though, I think an online timer is enough.

This project was a labor of love for us,                  and I would like to say a few things about it for those of you                  who may be curious as to what it has to offer.<br>                 <br>                 A little more than one year in creation, The Ruins of Kunark expansion                  adds breathtaking new zones, graphics, and enhanced abilities                  for high-level characters. The expansion is designed to take advantage                  of today&#8217;s higher performance computers, and offers an amazing                  and immersive visual experience, which we hope will captivate                  and delight Norrath&#8217;s inhabitants. In addition to offering                  amazing new vistas, The Ruins of Kunark will allow players to                  interact with many new creatures and monsters, including the new                  player race, the darkly enigmatic Iksar, the reptilian rulers                  of this forgotten continent. <br>                 <br>                 The team responsible for The Ruins of Kunark includes the experienced                  development staff of the original EverQuest game, as well as the                  new EverQuest Live Team, who will be responsible for the ongoing                  development and maintenance of the game after the expansion. The                  Ruins of Kunark represents the fruits of years of experience of                  the original staff, integrated with the fresh new ideas of the                  EQ Live Team. As a team we have learned much, and grown with the                  help of our players, and we feel that it shows in this product.                  As a result, the lands of Kunark offer great adventure and excitement                  for everyone in Norrath, from lower level players, all the way                  up to the 60th level characters now possible with the purchase                  of the expansion. <br>                 <br>                 We encourage you to take ship and explore this fascinating and                  dangerous new continent with us. We feel that the expansion will                  offer players both new and old a truly remarkable and rewarding                  experience. If you are one of the many thousands who have already                  opted to explore these uncharted lands, then we eagerly look forward                  to seeing you there. We have made every effort with the Ruins                  of Kunark expansion to provide the most compelling and complete                  content possible, and we hope that you will find this addition                  to the continually evolving world of Norrath to your liking. <br>                 <br>                 Though we expect that the launch of the expansion will proceed                  smoothly, we will maintain the staff here at Verant Interactive                  around the clock to insure that everything will be performing                  as expected. As we anticipate customers in record number over                  the next few days, we ask for your understanding should any problems                  arise. We will do our utmost to resolve any issues quickly, and                  with a minimum of downtime or inconvenience. <br>                 <br>                 In closing I would like to thank our loyal players, without whom                  this expansion would not be possible. We sincerely hope that you                  enjoy the new continent of Kunark as much as we enjoyed creating                  it, and we look forward to the future of EverQuest and hope to                  see you there as it unfolds. <br>                 <br>                 Welcome to EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark!

Upgrade your CPU/Computer<br>                 <br>                 The level of 3D sound can also affect overall framerate, depending                  on your system's configuration (which sound card, etc.) so you                  might want to experiment with those settings as well.<br>                 <br>                 Bottom line, Kunark pushes the EQ engine a lot harder, hence the                  better visuals. Even though this was perhaps a non-issue for you                  with the rest of Norrath, when you're on Kunark you might now                  need to adjust your display settings.<br>                 <br>                 -Brad<br>                 <br>                 ps. just to be very clear, the animating trees do not measurably                  affect your framerate.<br>                 <br>                 pps. framerate is how fast your screen is updated and has little                  to do with 'lag', which is generally another word for 'latency'                  which has to do with internet performance (timing issues, sending                  data between your client and our servers). <br>                 hope that helps <br>                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><br>               </font><br>               also some info on the Kunark zones in this <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/036180.html>thread</a><br>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               <blockquote><br>                 <font color=#a00000>Just so everyone knows:<br>                 There are zones for ALL levels in Kunark, 1-60.<br>                 <br>                 The newbie zones, btw, are certainly more easily accessed by Iksar                  (who start out in Kunark, of course), but are still accessible                  by other races.<br>                 <br>                 -Brad<br>                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><br>               </font><br>               <br>               <br>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956851880,31044,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Kunark            Zone Guides</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 9:11 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font>             <div> This update from Elof DragonHeart of <a href=http://www.eqlinks.com>www.eqlinks.com</a><br>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               <blockquote><br>                 Kunark Zones are in!!

Veeshan's Peak makes the planes look easy. There                  exists a non-negligible chance that not only will you die there,                  but you might not be able to raise the necessary forces to allow                  recovery of your corpse. It is *very* dangerous. <br>                 In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety in the zone, as                  sometimes follows when we've assisted in corpse recoveries in                  other zones due to claimed bug-deaths, we're not going to risk                  that for Veeshan's Peak. Veeshan's Peak is incredibly dangerous,                  and in order to guarantee that everyone is operating under the                  same set of conditions, we've elected to make the zone "enter                  at your own risk". <br>                 <br>                 That said, there are no known bugs in the zone that would cause                  the death of a character, and it was tested extensively in the                  Ruins of Kunark beta. We will certainly investigate and eliminate                  any bugs that are reported, but we won't be reimbursing items                  or experience, nor will we be moving corpses or people within                  the zone.<br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=#a00000><br>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956803149,59320,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Wednesday                  [ April 26 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Kunark            Shots</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 7:39 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:baladur@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Baladur</a></font>             <div> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><br>               <blockquote><br>                 We (NWGN - <a href=http://www.nukewinter.com>www.nukewinter.com</a>)                  have posted up 14 new screenshots of the ruins of kunark, detailing                  our adventures to this point.

EQVault now                  provides a link to the original post with every quote, which makes                  it easier for people to come and commment.

What I think would be helpful is                  if more people here would provide the information that they have                  knowledge of. I'd really like to see more of a community develop                  here.

Not only do we have                  to estimate the number of people on at peak, but we have to come                  up with a figure for how many people executing the /movelog command                  are actually peak players. That's why we open registration during                  peak hours, but it never stops a non-negligable percentage from                  off-peak from logging in to run the command.<br>                 It also doesn't take into account the number of people who have                  more than one account who'll run it for all of them. I know a                  few people who have upwards of 4 accounts, who only play one at                  a time.

We now                  figure that we can safely move more people without risk of overcrowding                  the destination servers.

This island is the home of The Tangrin, a giant                  ape. This ape is rumored to con red at level 51, he hits for around                  200 points, and drops "some kind of hairy armor". I dunno if anyone                  has killed him yet on our server but someone told me he went down                  on Fennin (but of course they could have been making it all up                  too :)<br>                 <br>                 Anyway, I'd like to get some 50ish groups together to take him                  out.

From the outpost, find the bridge that leads off                  the island it's on, go off this bridge perfectly straight, run                  all the way to the end of the zone (sow and invis will help so                  the spider people don't see ya). At the end of the zone when you                  hit the mountain/cliff, turn left and follow the hill. Eventually                  the grass will turn icky and you'll know you're near the swamp.                  Just keep following the zone edge hill till you get there... In                  the swamp, keep LEFT following the zone edge hill. SOW and Invis                  will be needed as you'll be running past an entrance to Calibis.                  You'll know you're there when you see the stone tiled floor, don't                  go near the entrance just run past it, keeping left the whole                  way. I didn't run into any trouble at all. Just keep left the                  whole way in the swamp and you'll get to the field of bone. Approx                  running time from the outpost to the Field of Bone should be around                  20 minutes total, with SOW on.<br>                 <br>                 I'd also like to humbily request that any of the big guild types,                  please don't kill this guy before us.

Please remember that warriors, rogues, and monks are considered                  essentially well-balanced without these disciplines, and as such                  they are something extra.

Nothing that I can see.                  <br>                 <br>                 First off, why does it drop when you are hit even if you don't                  hit back ? <br>                 <br>                 Secondly, why does it overwrite SoW ? Verant doesn't need to stack                  actual spell effects to make them stack as being 'on' or 'off'                  - surely one spell can supersede in effect without overwriting                  (as Serpent Sight and Ultravision appear to 'stack' without combining).                  <br>                 <br>                 These may not be the best ways to change it, but I do not see                  how it can remain like it is without the 'play nice' policies                  being compromised and lots of people dying.<br>                 <font color="a00000"><br>                 It works just like invisibility. We wanted to give people the                  means to travel faster without that travel method turning into                  another offensive tactic. <br>                 <br>                 It overwrites SoW because it has the same effect and it does more                  to that effect. It's the way the spell hierarchy works. This really                  can't be changed. <br>                 <br>                 We'll probably have to make the spell group-only in the near future.                  I'll send a note to GZ. <br>                 <br>                 I think that this might be a good time to mention that the "Scale"                  spells are not upgrades to spirit of wolf. They are a spell of                  a different line that happens to have the same effect. The purpose                  of these spells is to allow faster travel in the huge Kunark zones.                  It is not meant to be the offensive spell that SoW has become.                  <br>                 <br>                 - Gordon<br>                 <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956648795,46053,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Tunare            Party in Kelethin</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Tunare [ 12:46 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote>Kereihana, owner of Kereihana's General Store, is throwing                  a cool party in Kelethin on the Tunare server.

Below is                  a complete copy of the six volumes which were found upon the Court                  Chronicler in the Court of Pain.<br>                 <br>                 1. Genesis of Fist and Tail<br>                 <br>                 The Swifttail Caste, Fists and Tails of Cabilis<br>                 It was in dawning of the Sebilisian Empire that the art of fist                  and tail was forged. In the beginning, the pugilists of the great                  tribes were nothing more than warriors without weapons. Soon we                  would be forged into weapons.<br>                 Grandmaster Tynn was the father of our disciplines. He came to                  the empire from an unknown tribe. Some say he was a ronin who                  wandered the worlds of Norrath where he formed the basis of the                  city of Sebilis with no rebirth. He entered to form a caste which                  did not exist. He was quickly challenged by the warlords. He spoke                  his words and they did not listen. He knew the only way to make                  them understand was to challenge their finest in The Gauntlet.                  He called for four of the finest warlords and allowed them arms.                  The warlords agreed, thinking his challenge as easy task.<br>                 Grandmaster Tynn quickly dispatched of the warlords with nothing                  more than fist and tail. He fought in a way never displayed. His                  victory earned him much respect and Emperor Sathir soon commanded                  him to form the Court of Pain and raise an army of monks. Tynn                  formed the Swifttail Caste.<br>                 Soon the way of fist and tail had hundreds in it's ranks, climbing                  the rungs. Tynn showed them they were not warriors, but monks.<br>                 They would don shackles as testament to the Age of Snake when                  the Iksar were a race enslaved. Inner strength and harmony were                  taught. The Swifttail were born.<br>                 The Swifttail were disbanded during the End Days. It was not till                  the rise of the new empire under Emperor Vekin did the caste reform.                  Grandmaster Glox, a former disciple of Tynn, came to New Sebilis                  to rebuild the Court of Pain. In honor of Tynn, all masters now                  drape themselves in a robe like he wore.<br>                 <br>                 2. Before Green<br>                 This is known as the Age of the Snake. The snake race known as                  Shissar, slithered upon Kunark. The Iksar had yet to unite. Our                  people had yet to learn the Black Arts and the ways of Fist and                  Tail. Divided, the Iksar were enslaved by the snakes. In the centuries                  before the Green, the Iksar were slaves of the Shissar. They ruled                  from the ancient city of Chelsith which rest deep within the land                  now known as The Overthere. From here would sprout much evil.                  The Iksar were tortured like Frogs and suffered at the hands of                  the Shissar. The Iksar who showed genius were to help the snakes                  in their dark rites. These few were the seeds of rebellion. The                  Iksar began to plot a revolt, but a greater force would strike                  first.<br>                 The Shissar were an arrogant race. The power bestowed by the gods                  was not enough. They made pacts with other gods and demigods.                  They found the rifts of time and space and used them to gather                  magic items once held by the guardians of the planes. The Shissar's                  disloyalty and blasphemous pride would bring the wrath of the                  gods upon them. No power could stop the force to come. A green                  cloud formed in the skies above Kunark. The could began to descend                  upon the land. From it's green core, the face of death began to                  form. It was of no god they knew of. It opened it's giant maw                  and spoke in tongues unknown. From the mouth of death rushed forth                  a green mist. The Shissar shaman began to cast spells in hopes                  of shielding their city and the necromancers began to assault                  the mist with great weapons. All were futile. The mist rushed                  forth. The first snakes to be swallowed by the mist had their                  scales and flesh rot and fall from their bones. Horrid screams                  of suffering could be heard from within the mist. A river of flesh                  and blood flowed. The Iksar stood and gazed upon the gristle that                  was once the Shissar. With the Green Death came the liberation                  of the Iksar.<br>                 The season is now 0 A.G, After Green.<br>                 <br>                 3. Talon Southpaw<br>                 Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist ever to walk within the                  Court of Pain. His speed rivaled that of the great Grandmaster                  Tynn. He could often be found within the local taverns demonstrating                  the awesome speed of his fist.<br>                 Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this caste. Although quick                  with fist and tail, the speed of his left arm was not to come                  to blossom for a couple decades past his rebirth. It was to follow                  his captivity by the accursed Samak.<br>                 Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon went on a wandering                  retreat into the dangerous outlands of Kunark. He was not seen                  from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to Cabilis he told                  of his captivity within an ancient city of Iksar now claimed by                  the Samak. He told of intense torture. He survived the ordeal.                  He escaped from the claws of the Samak with numerous scars which                  proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars were never                  to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars                  underneath were for no lizards eyes. his great perseverance gave                  him an inner strength no other monk could lay claim to.<br>                 He now possessed incredible, almost blinding speed with his left                  arm. He could tap a foes arm with his left and strike with as                  if having a third arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails.                  All the empire under respected or feared him. None would spar                  him outside of the taverns. with grog comes stupidity.<br>                 Upon his death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn removed his hands in                  a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze upon Talon's                  body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic which would stay                  within the Tower of Kurn. His body was dusted. This is his tale                  as told by Rinmark.<br>                 <br>                 4. Venril The Chief<br>                 Venril Sathir of the Kunzar<br>                 The greatest lizard to walk upon the land was Venril Sathir of                  the Kunzar tribe. All that is known of his youth was that he was                  a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This was during the time                  of division among the tribes of the Iksar. He was said to have                  never been a mere broodling. He was forever a master of combat.<br>                 Venril would soon slay his father and take his rightful place                  as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the Kunzar on many expeditions                  into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He sought knowledge and weapons.<br>                 In his late youth, he find the hidden library of the necromancer,                  Kotiz. He would come to open a large book which opened into a                  small room. Climbing into the book he finds a floating book. The                  Unholy Writ of War is it's title. Made of Iksar skins and containing                  great knowledge of combat. Venril becomes the books master.<br>                 Venril soon shows signs of dark knowledge. He begins to wield                  the forces of the dark circle and his knowledge of combat tactics                  becomes supreme. He trains his army new tactics and even raises                  the bones of the fallen to fight yet again for their master. His                  army grows and marches to all corners of Kunark.<br>                 Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He shall soon plot the                  union of the entire Iksar nation. He no longer wishes to be just                  Chief, but rather, Emperor. Under his direction the four remaining                  tribe states of Iksar shall unite and a new age shall dawn.<br>                 313 A.G.<br>                 <br>                 5. Captain of the Sea<br>                 Captain Vlzk Irontail, Master of the Sea<br>                 370 A.G.: Vlzk, student of the 5th rung, becomes the youngest                  Iksar monk to attain the title of Tynn Master. He takes his place                  among the masters of the Court of Pain.<br>                 371 A.G.: Master Vlzk becomes the only Iksar monk to be promoted                  to the rank of Captain within the Iksar Navy. He is promoted by                  the great Emperor Rile. This act solidifies the alliance between                  the monks and the Legion and ushers in a new age of disciplines.<br>                 372 A.G.: During a coastal patrol being conducted by Captain Vlsk,                  a fierce and sudden water spout hits and splinters his ship. The                  Navy searches for survivors and none are found.<br>                 406 A.G.: During a Deep Range Patrol, a group of Legionnaires                  is greeted by Captain Vlsk. He has survived in the Outlands with                  no aid. His once proud tail has bee ripped from his body of a                  Trakanasaurus. He becomes a hero. The blacksmiths are ordered                  to create a tail make of iron. He is now Captain Irontail.<br>                 Captain Irontail is promoted to Captain of the Iron Guard, a roving                  coastal armada. He is also rewarded with great items of magic.                  In his honor, the Baron and the Arch Duke create an awesome weapon                  called the Storm Sabre. They also create a lesser blade for all                  who serve in the Ironguard--The Tynn Foil.<br>                 406 A.G.: During the Infamous Battle of Timorous Deep, Captain                  Vlsk Irontail is defeated as well as most of the Sebilisian Navy.                  A horde of dragons descended upon them. The navy was vastly outnumbered.                  So was the end of the great Captain Irontail. Long live his spirit.<br>                 <br>                 6. The Crusades of 1312 A.G.<br>                 This is the time of the scattered and defeated Iksar empire. The                  great dragon, Trakanon and his allies of scale have left the empire                  in rubble and our people are divided yet again. the once grand                  city of Sebilis is claimed by the one who descimated it.<br>                 The remaining Iksar are scattered among the outlands of Kunark.                  Their places of refuge are now the dwellings of dark denizens.                  In the wilds, a few castes come to unite. One of these are the                  remnants of the Crusaders of Greenmist. They are lead by a powerful                  shadowknight named Nok Nilok.<br>                 The army of shadowknights number in the hundreds. Within their                  ranks are a few mystics and legionnaires. The tribe names itself                  after their leader, they are to be named, The Crusaders of Rok                  Nilok and they shall purge the lands of Kunark.<br>                 The Crusaders burn across the Dreadlands and death comes quickly                  to those who dare stand in their way. They slay many giants and                  many goblins. There shall be no prisoners of slaves. The empire                  shall be rebuilt by the hands of the Iksar. All other shall perish.<br>                 Kamors Castle is the first major objective of the Crusaders. It                  has now been taken over by goblin clans. The Goblins soon find                  themselves under siege. for twenty days they hold ground until                  the Crusaders choose to assault as a band of goblin deserters                  flee. A swift battle ensues and the castle is reclaimed.<br>                 The Crusaders now set their sights on the city of Cabilis. While                  the march is designed, Rok Nilok discovers something very evil.                  Nothing is known of his discoveries. No record exists of it's                  evil. All that is known is that Rok Nilok made a pact and soon                  shall suffer for it.<br>                 During the battle for Cabilis, a strange rain falls which shrinks                  them to the size of dolls and their heads are set aflame. Nilok's                  head burns red. And the goblins squash the would be emperor and                  his minions.<br>                 <br>                 -Valus and Sebrn of Druzzil Ro<br>                 Valus@stratics.com                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956640669,82529,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Shadow            Knight Unholy Weapon?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Official_EverQuest_Forums [ 10:31 PM              PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> found at: <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EQ                Message Boards</a>                <p>               <blockquote>There has been a bit of an uproar in the SK community                  recently by the supposed discovery of a new SK sword called 'Hellfire'                  which looks like a soulfire/fiery avenger.

I'm really concerned about what I've heard about the Iksar                  so far. I'm not concerned about them lacking anything, on the                  contrary, it's about how good they are! I have an already established                  Monk on Veeshan and I thought that the Iksar (to make Human Monks                  still a good choice) would have some setbacks like lower agility                  and/or dexterity. But from what I've seen and heard so far they                  seem to be superior to Human Monks in all aspects! I'm hoping                  you can shed some light, or at least give something that will                  make Human monks viable. Because I really could care less about                  being Neutral-evil or having an experiance draw-back. I normally                  wouldn't care except that this IS an expansion so people who created                  Monks along time ago didn't have the choice to pick an Iksar,                  and alot would rather not take on a new monk (including me) and                  start from scratch. So please tell me there is something good                  about being a Human Monk!<br>                 <font color=a#00000><br>                 There are indeed some compelling advantages to Iksar monks. Some                  of the ways that they pay for this are not as obvious as others,                  but they do pay for it beyond the usual XP and Faction problems.<br>                 <br>                 -Gordon<br>                 </font><br>               </blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956442261,23911,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Gordon            on 2H Damage</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 3:24 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:yendi@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Yendi</a></font>             <div> Found <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/034730.html" target="_blank">here</a>                on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro" target="_blank">Everquest                Forums</a>:<br>               <blockquote><br>                 If damage is (as Abashi has said it should be) calculated by damage/dly                  ratio, why do 2h weapons ALWAYS have a VASTLY superior ratio to                  1h weapons?<br>                 <font color=a#00000><br>                 Because you can't dual wield when wielding a 2H weapon. The damage                  and delays mentioned were completely arbitrary and were just listed                  to make the problem understandable by everyone. The problem itself                  is entirely mathematical.<br>                 <br>                 The problem as I explained it is that IF a person wields a 1H                  weapon of an equal ratio to a 2H weapon, they will do more damage                  with the 1H weapon than with the 2H weapon just by virtue of it                  being faster.

This will                  allow them to download Kunark-related updates when they are required.                  <br>                 <br>                 If you have not installed EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, you                  will not see a "K-Patch" button. <br>                 <br>                 In addition to the Kunark-related changes made today, a bug that                  lowered the maximum damage of two-handed weapons that was introduced                  earlier this week in the Emergency Update was also corrected.                  Finally, the art update yesterday implemented a solution that                  we've been promising: Male barbarians can now see their shields.<br>                 <br>                 We continue to appreciate everyone's patience while we get the                  servers ready for Kunark. <br>                 <br>                 Thank you.<br>                 <br>                 - The EverQuest Team<br>                 </font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956407587,2793,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Roleplaying            Server Reminder</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Morrel_Thule [ 5:46 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:kang@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Kang</a></font>             <div> We recieved this in the e-mail from Aaron:               <blockquote>Let it be know that ALL Roleplayers are migrating on                  over to Morrell-Thule!Verant needs to know how many of us there                  are so that we can warrant our ownserver.

It's ugly, we don't                  like it... but that's the truth.<br>                 <br>                 John Smedley</font></blockquote>               <br>               <br>               /e is still waiting...<br>               Alethal La`mort<br>               EQ Stratics<br>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956293259,14360,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Wedding            on Tarew Marr</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Tarew_Marr [ 10:00 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <blockquote>                 <p>On The Tarew Marr Server, in Northern Freeport at the Big Temple                    called Temple of Marr, the building with many floors not the                    one with only two and the lady for the SoulFire Quest.

In addition, I'm currently writing a supplement                  to the manual that will have a few corrections, plus new information                  on some melee-specific abilities in the expansion.

This discipline lasts                  for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse                  time for this discipline will decrease as the rogue gains additional                  levels.<br>                 <br>                 Of course some of that data doesn't make sense out of context,                  but it might give you an idea as to what we've been working on.<br>                 <br>                 In the spirit of the additional information released by GZ concerning                  spells, here's a taste of some of the things that melee types                  can look forward to:<br>                 <br>                 Warriors: Kicks with integral stuns!<br>                 Rogues: Full speed (think RUN) sneaking!<br>                 Monks: Regen HPs as if you were sitting, but while feigned!<br>                 <br>                 There's more, and to be honest those aren't the best things we've                  done, but we're not prepared to come clean on it all just yet.<br>                 <br>                 Anyway, I'm back to writing. <br>                 <br>                 Everything is clicking around here and we're right on track for                  bringing the Kunark Zones online.

Right on Sunday night at Midnight? The reason I ask is because                  I am contemplating taking a personal day off to explore Kunark                  all morning/day/night of Monday the 24th. Most likely, I'll pull                  an all-nighter from Sunday night straight on through Monday. The                  last time I took a day off to play Everquest the freaking servers                  were down the entire day. What a flipping waste of a personal                  day!                  <p>I'd like to not be disappointed this time around if I can help                    it.                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">It's too early to nail down a specific time                  for certain, however I think we'll probably aim for early in the                  morning during off-peak hours.                  <p>- Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956208330,5936,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Guild            War</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 10:25 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote>At 2 pm Eastern on Saturday, April 22, the Silver Daggers                  and the Heroes of Faydwer will stage a friendly guildwar. It will                  be a one-day event, lasting as long as we need it to, in Qeynos                  Hills. Here are the rules as we've discussed them.                  <p>1) No DOT spells. This is due to exp. loss if you die from                    these spells. <br>                   2) No using the zone's NPC's in anyway to cause damage to the                    other side. No training NPC's and no charmed NPC's. Caster pets                    are allowed. <br>                   3) Non-participants must be listed beforehand, so that they                    are not attacked. Anyone who attacks a non-combatant is disqualified.                    Also, non-combatants cannot assist with buffs or heals in combats                    between guilds. <br>                   4) No bind point or corpse camping. Also, in battles between                    the guild, one death is all you get. No one can die, get their                    corpse and rejoin the battle. Everyone is allowed to get their                    corpse, but no one can reenter the fights.<br>                   5) No looting.                  <p>Type of fights to take place: <br>                   1) Assassin - One player, the target, from the Daggers will                    be accompanied by a group of 6 members of the Daggers, who are                    to escort him from one end of the zone to the other, i.e. from                    Qeynos to urefall glade. The other guild puts a group of 6 into                    the zone, with the purpose of killing the target. If they succeed,                    roles are reversed, and the Heroes have a target to protect.                    Best 2 out of 3 tries at this. <br>                   2) Group hunts - Each guild has a group of 6 that enter the                    zone from opposite ends. They are to hunt each other, in what                    ever way they see fit. Whichever guild has the last man standing                    wins. We can do ultiplegroups if we have enough people who want                    to. <br>                   3) If there are enough members on both sides, we get together                    for one big Braveheart-esque battle, a huge scrum.                  <p>To WAR!!!!                 <p>Haemish<br>                   Clan Chieftan<br>                   The Silver Daggers                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem956207944,9554,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>More            on RoK Shipping</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Patch_Server_Announcement [ 10:19 PM              PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote><font color="a00000">Due to some unfortunate problems                  we have encountered with the order processing software we are                  using people may experience delays in receiving Ruins of Kunark.                  It is still our goal to ship every order that was placed before                  yesterday by Monday April 24th. Due to these problems there may                  be people that do not receive the disk on time. We DO NOT expect                  this to affect very many people. As of today, we have shipped                  out most of the orders we have received. Anyone that does not                  receive the disk on time will be getting a free month of EverQuest                  to compensate for this fact. Again, most people should receive                  it by the 24th. There will be certain restrictions to this based                  on when the order was placed. We will announce more information                  in the next few days.                 <p>We sincerely apologize for the problems we have encountered.

A                    person wielding a one-handed weapon of a given ratio was able                    to do more damage than when wielding a two-handed weapon of                    the same ratio.                  <p>We would like to stress that no change has been made to the                    amount of damage done by people wielding one-handed weapons.

Since magic shoulders allow large races to bash                  magic with a non-magic weapon in their offhand, shouldn't magic                  shoulders allow non-magic shields to bash magic as well? I consider                  this a bug, the 'magic shoulders' rule should apply to all items                  in the offhand, including nonmagical shields.                  <P>This isn't a bug. The Bash skill requires a magic shield. The                    Slam skill requires magic shoulders. Hitting a magic creature                    with the weapon in your off-hand requires a magic weapon. Bash                    essentially turns your shield into a weapon, which is why it                    requires a magic shield.

Although I was disconnected before the zone crashed,                  I did catch his toast-                 <p>King Tearis Thex shouts, 'To all of you, I give my best wishes.                    Though I am your King, It is not necessarily I who has brought                    you here today.

May your                    blades prove strong, your bows aim true, your hearts remain                    pure and the Mother, may she bless you with every year being                    twice as good as the past. To old friends...'                 <p>The King smiles at Firiona, raising his glass to her and her                    comrades.                 <p>King Tearis Thex shouts, 'And for our neighboring comrades                    of Kaladim and Ak'Anon, may your realms remain forever free                    of plague and war.

Friends, brethren, let it be done!'                 <p>The elf tosses the glass, shattering it on the ground at his                    feet.                 <p>The King turns back to the crowd, nodding towards the still                    gathered people.

We must unite and wage war on the                    High Elves and Wood Elves. We must help the Iksar&#8217;s take                    back the lands that were once theirs. The time has come for                    an all out war on the elves (if that is what thy think thy are                    lol) of Greater Faydark. I Lord Zzalik Vonblood Under the Hand                    of Innoruuk, along with several other Knights and Priests of                    Innoruuk will be honored to lead my entire fellow Dark Elves,                    with the aid of the Ogres and Trolls, into war.                 <p>The first thing we must do is all join forces in the &#8220;gathering&#8221;.                    This gathering will take place early Saturday the 22nd (about                    10am EST). Once we have enough people interested we will start                    to gate groups over to greater faydark, where we will have others                    binding to the zone. Once binded we will aid our allies on these                    lands, the Crushbone Orcs. Under Crushbone&#8217;s command the                    orcs will be valuable. Ambassador D&#8217;Vinn has informed                    Lord Crushbone of the War. The orcs have been constantly fighting                    the High Elves and the Wood Elves for years now. We will free                    the orc lands of these infantile. Once everyone is in Crushbone                    then we will march on the city of the Wood Elves. I will have                    two elite platoons at my side. We well take out the guards in                    an effort to give you added safety to that of the orc villages                    outside of Crushbone. If you are or know anyone who can kill                    guards please let them know. If we can get enough help we can                    see about taking out much or most of the city.                 <p>Please aid the darkness and that of your god, whom ever your                    Deity is. The lands of these creatures is very rich in coin                    as well as items so if you join the War you can reap the treasures                    War can bring.                 <p>Lord Zzalik Vonblood, Under the watchful eye of Innoruuk                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955926446,4592,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Brand            new very rare spawn in North Ro? - Erolissi Marr server</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 4:07 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:sayree@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Sayree</a></font>             <div> From Casan:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>It's called "a widow mite" and it looks exactly like                  a widow hatchling.

The following is                    a brief rundown of post level 50 magic that you can expect to                    see in the EverQuest exansion.

Time                  has conspired against me - it seems days, not months, that I have                  been sequestered in my Tower documenting the spells that our intrepid                  adventurers bring back from the Ruins of Kunark. While the cataloging                  of these new magics remains far from complete, it is my belief                  that you might appreciate some details of what we have so far                  discovered.                  <p> Before I pontificate on the specifics, I would be remiss if                    I did not mention my amazement as to the potency of our recent                    acquisitions. These are not spells for apprentices - far from                    it. Only the most devout in the priesthood and the mightiest                    of the magi should even attempt the invocation these high magics.                    Hearken well - these new discoveries will forever change the                    way that we regard thaumaturgy in Norrath.                  </i></blockquote>               <p>See <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/p_archmage.html" target=_blank">Arch                  Mage Answers</a> for a class-by-class description.               <p>               <blockquote><i> I hope that this correspondence has proved useful                  - I am sure that the meat of it will provoke much discussion amidst                  your circle of scholars.

It is with great pleasure, I stand before you the citizens of                  Norrath, welcoming you to join us in the Second Annual Celebration                  of Light and Dark. The event will start on Sunday April 30th,                  2000 on the Fellowship's picnic grounds in the Lesser Feydark,                  just follow the wall of the Lesser Fey left to the first set of                  tents before the Nybright Sister's camp. The celebration's festivities                  will start at 4pm EST and after the festivities we will all embark                  for the lands of Kunark. After previewing the lands a few days                  before hand, we will decide where and how best to meet in Kunark                  (or travel there).                  <P> We plan to have a language fair of languages including dragon                    and other archaic languages. We will also have a lotto of items                    for sale from various people in the guild. We will again have                    a duel to crown the Champion of Light and this year we will                    have a Champion of Dark, as well. Winners of each fight will                    be crowned and reign till next years festivities. Galarun won                    this title last year and has since retired the adventuring life.                    So it is with eager anticipation we await the crowning of a                    victor to reign till next year and have him/her try to retain                    their title at next year&#8217;s celebration. Fights are to                    the death or till the opponent yields. Honor and Chivalry are                    to be foremost in the minds of the Champions of Light. The Champion                    of Dark may use any means at their personal disposal to obtain                    their title. Of course, they must fight the Champion of Light                    for the title of Grand Champion of the Celebration of Light                    and Dark.                  <P>The Fellowship of the Griffon is one of Xegony's eldest guilds                    and we have recently merged with Wisdom Seekers to enhance our                    two guilds in Norrath, making the new lands of Norrath and Kunark                    an even brighter land to explore.. With the anticipation of                    this New World dawning, we look forward to seeing all our old                    friends and new alike join us in this Celebration of Light and                    Dark and on our expedition of these new lands.                  <P>If you would like to contribute to running an event at this                    Celebration contact Clang Gloryseeker in /tell or contact Elanna                    to help with the language fairs.                  <P>Our previous Celebration of Light was held in the beginning                    of May, 1999 just outside Kaladim.

It all began in Greater                  Faydark, beneath the grand city of Kelethin, where shouts of a                  party arose. 2 finely dressed wood elves (the Oakwynds) and their                  dwarven friend Thubr Axebringer were having a celebration of sorts.                  After much drinking and carousing, twas heard that the great king                  of the Elves, King Tearis Thex, was to speak to his people that                  night. Once gathered around Felwithe, twas revealed that Firiona                  Vie had returned to her homeland. Twas a bittersweet homecoming                  though, as evil reared its ugly head this night. A troll and ogre                  attacked, led by a Tier'Dal caster. The battle twas ugly, with                  few lives spared in the process. The abominations struck down                  Lorisyn Oakwynd, who had come to speak with Firiona Vie. Much                  sorrow was felt by all, as his sister Lyirae Oakwynd swore revenge                  upon those who had slain her brother.                  <P>*OOC* It was a great event, and I'd like to thank the GM's                    involved.

It was really fun to make a Griffawn                  attack another one but it takes time to set up. You have to buff                  and med and then get a SoW (because you don't want to be at normal                  speed when charm breaks!) and then find the intended mobs.                  <P>None of this is a complaint but intended to show that it's                    not just a walk in the park. The problem is that when charm                    breaks, the ex-pet is almost always in mid-battle and then both                    come after you like a bat out of hell. Sometimes the mob your                    pet was fighting is really low in health and you can destroy                    it with a quick DD or DoT before you run. Unfortunately for                    some reason you don't get experience. My guess would be that                    Verant has it so that once the charm breaks your ex-pet has                    all the credit for damage done. I think this is extremely ridiculous                    and unfair to the enchanter who spent his time setting all this                    up. You also don't get xp if you kill the pet instead. So basically                    you have to kill both mobs after charm breaks just to get xp                    for one! If you're having any trouble understanding this dilemma,                    imagine that you are in a group and someone drops out right                    at the end of a battle and then gets the xp instead of the group!                    With how bad enchanters pets are (and believe me my pet sucks!)                    it would be really nice if you could look into making charm                    work like you were responsible for the damage....since you were.                  <P>                 <font color="#a00000">This isn't a bug. When a creature dies,                  the system checks to see what entity gets credit for the kill.                  If that entity is a pet, the credit for the kill goes to the pets                  owner. Since charm broke, and the entity that did the most damage                  is no longer a pet, you don't get the experience. Your choice                  in this case is either to kill the former pet first, or recharm                  it so that it is your pet when the first critter dies.                  <P>                 <P>- Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955751109,6131,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Shrink            issues</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 3:25 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font>             <div> Found at the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032480.html">Everquest                Gameplay Board</a>,<br>               <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>The                  recent patch changed it so that an ogre must have shrink cast                  on him 4 times to become the size of a gnome. I was told that                  this was to fix a bug with shrink prior to the patch. The change                  unfortunately will now make the larger races have to beg for 3                  to 4 casts of shrink in order to accommodate others of the zone.                  The spell's mana cast remained the same and will force shamans                  to lose more mana. If this spell was changed with potions, the                  larger races will be forces to buy triple the amount of potions                  causing less rooms in bags. I would just like to see a change                  or two made:                  <P>1) Make shrink cast with less mana -OR- have a shorter casting                    time. (I am not sure of the current casting time or mana use.)                  <P>2) Give potions more procs.                 <P>                 <font color="#a00000">This spell was changed indirectly by a fix                  that was made in another area.

Prizes have been extreme weapons such as the legendary                    &#8220;Fanged Skull Stiletto&#8221; and items removed from the                    game such as the beautiful &#8220;Cryosilk&#8221; Robe.                 <p>Test of Flight<br>                   This is an archery tournament designed for all levels. The archers                    will fire upon a GMPC that will match his level to the level                    of the Archer. A flight of 20 arrows at 100 paces, most arrows                    landed wins the event. In the case of a tie, the archers will                    each fire a single arrow, and the archer doing the most damage                    wins the tiebreaker. Preliminary testing completed on Xegony,                    about to be started on all servers.                 <p>Test of Steel<br>                   This is a single melee vs. melee combat with very simple rules.                    You must hit with steel, and you cannot cast spells. Preliminary                    testing still in progress on Veeshan, prize is set to be the                    infamous &#8220;Gleaming Bastard Sword&#8221;. All Skills such                    as &#8220;Lay of Hands&#8221;, &#8220;Harms Touch&#8221;, and                    &#8220;Mend&#8221; will be allowed.                 <p>Test of Faith<br>                   This is another single competition designed for any class that                    is capable of casting &#8220;Greater Heal&#8221; before level                    50. This is still in its design stage, and a server will be                    designated shortly for preliminary testing.                 <p>Test of Mystics<br>                   This is open to any class, but rules forbid melee. This is still                    in its design stage, and a server will be designated shortly                    for preliminary testing,                 <p> Other Events                 <p>City Invasion &#8211; Qeynos<br>                   The ultimate challenge for a guild, the City of Qeynos still                    has not fallen to this date in Everquest History. Background                    is that Antonious Bayle has left for a diplomatic meeting in                    High Pass Keep, and a guild of players is going to sack the                    city. To achieve victory, there are 10 designated NPC&#8217;s                    that must be taken by force of arms within 4 hours (real life                    time) before the return of Antonious. These 10 are the 7 non-primary                    caster Guildmasters (Q-Cat is not part of this Event), the 2                    Lieutenant Guards, and the Corporal. Since this is a signup                    event, a guild must prove ability to repel such firepower and                    slay the Lieutenant in Northern Qeynos (No small task I assure                    you). Primary Testing on Xegony and Veeshan for this event has                    already been accomplished, and the first attempt at this event                    should take place within the week. The Leader of the Guild that                    takes Qeynos will receive a title. The title will be &#8220;The                    Conqueror&#8221; or a very similar title.                 <p>Rules for other cities may follow in the near future.                 <p>This is what we have planned in the near future. If you have                    other ideas for events, we would like to hear them for all levels                    of play. Let us know what you think.                 <p>-Aikbach                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955679025,3351,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EQ            Trading Post</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:23 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri</a></font>             <div> <br>               Tim Ramsey dropped me a line regarding a new site: <a href="http://www.eqtradingpost.com">The                EQ Trading Post</a>, a site dedicated to trading on EverQuest.<br>               <br>               Please check it out ;)                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955678732,431,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Elder            Tribunal URL Change</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:18 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:ruri_kagato@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Ruri</a></font>             <div> From Zaneb:<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>A few changes have been made to the server that our                  site is hosted on.... the URL is now <a href="www.eldertribunal.com">www.eldertribunal.com</a>.

The Cleric loses Hit Points in a similar manner to damage                    over time effects that does not interrupt the casting of further                    spells.Level 12 spell. <br>                 <P>Greater Empathy<br>                   Rodcet Nife only<br>                   Received by followers of Rodcet Nife but at a later level than                    Empathy to Quellious followers.<br>                   This spell is similar to Empathy but the Hit points and Stamina                    of the entire party are collected into one pool that is shared                    by the entire group.

If the tank takes enough damage the entire party will lose                    the shield not just the tank.

All druids                    got was just two not-worth-the-time-to-get weapons. I'm sure                    you have commented on this before but I never seen anything                    on it so I'd like to know.                  <P>2: Why cant player bought houses be implemented?                  <P>I understand that the world is not really big enough for every                    character to buy tuns of houses and place them everywhere. But                    with the new land coming out, I was thinking it would be a lot                    better to implement them. If you made it so that you could have                    only one house per account, and all houses were just little                    huts (architecture according to your race) and make it so they                    come with chests that you can open up with a key (open up like                    you do a forge), and lock the door as well. It would make Everquest                    a lot more fun, in that you will have something else to do other                    then kill mobs all day. I wouldn't know how hard this would                    be to put in, but please consider it, if not, tell me what would                    be wrong with that, please.                 <P>                 <font color="#a00000">As to "why there isn't any", the answer,                  as simple as I can make it is the same reason that there aren't                  quests in other areas that there probably should be: We haven't                  put them in. Yes, it is entirely possible that we will put in                  druid class-specific armor at some time, in the same fashion that                  it is possible that we'll put in class-specific quests for gnome                  necros, or dark elf clerics.                  <P>The point I am trying to make is that just because something                    isn't in at present doesn't mean that we have no intentions                    of putting it in, just that we haven't put it in *yet*. EQ is                    an evolving game. New quests go in in nearly every patch. I                    do imagine however that druid-specific armor hasn't received                    much priority at this point due to the fact that the of adventured-armor                    available for them at that level is probably superior to class-specific                    armor we might put in.                  <P>Please trust that we have every interest in providing you with                    the content that will keep you interested and playing. We don't                    like hearing about people quitting because they feel that they've                    run out of things to do.                  <P>Regarding housing: At a certain point in the development process                    the team has to start making decisions in regards to what features                    will be in the game. This lets them put some ideas to rest while                    allowing them to spend more time and devote more effort to things                    that are approved. Back in beta, it was decided that player-owned                    structures would not be a part of EverQuest, much like horses.                  <P>- Gordon                  </font></font></blockquote>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955661567,6939,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Religion            Bug?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 2:32 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font>             <div> Found this on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/032095.html">Everquest                Gameplay Boards</a>,               <P>               <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>My                  enchanter started out in the beginning as a worshipper of Erolissi                  Marr. Another person that I was travelling with at the time, a                  wizard, started out worshipping Solusek Ro. Around the same time                  (level 24 I believe), both of our religions were changed to Tunare.                  We petitioned then and the guide told us they'd log it as a bug,                  but that there was nothing they could do. Well, back then, it                  didn't really matter and I simply role-played out my chosen religion                  rather than the bugged religion I was set to. Now, with this new                  deity-specific items, I'd like to be changed back to what I originally                  chose, Erolissi Marr.                  <P>Is this possible?                 <font color=#a00000>There was a bug a while back that would cause                  the deity name to change spontaneously, but this was just a display                  bug. It didn't change what deity you actually have selected, because                  that is based upon a faction that is created at character creation.                  As for the Deity that is displayed, the GMs were correct in that                  they do not have the ability to change that.                  <P>In other words, should a deity-specific item be implemented,                    it will take into account your original deity, not the one that                    is displayed now were you affected by that bug.                  <P>- Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955648138,601,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EverQuest            Stratics Trade Articles Updated</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 10:48 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> We finished editing the Trade Articles.

At                  that time it was decided that we didn't want people changing faith                  as a matter of convenience, to get whatever benefits that a particular                  religion might grant at that specific time. <br>                 <br>                 With that in mind, several other design decisions were made for                  EQ that now makes changing faith impossible even if we decided                  to allow it through a complicated quest or what have you. It's                  burried too deep into the core faction code for all of our work                  since then to be unraveled. <BR>                 <BR>                 Your initial faction is set through your choice of race, class,                  and deity. Other factions that you affect as you build that character                  are affected based upon your own faction. The entire faction system                  would basically have to be redesigned to support it, and with                  thousands of other NPCs and factions to consider, the work involved                  and the potential for problems makes it prohibitive. <BR>                 <BR>                 I still maintain that this deity-specific items issue is no different                  than if we added new items restricted by race or class. Sure,                  I've seen people say that if they ever had the idea that weapons                  or items would be restricted by deity, then they would have chosen                  one. However, knowing all the potential aspects of the game prior                  to playing it is not required in order to play the game.

By the same logic that we do not allow people to                change their race or class selection based upon new items or spells                in the game, we likewise won't be allowing the change of deities                based upon the same.               <P>EverQuest is a game that is subject to change, and when a person                  makes a choice that choice not only affects them in the present,                  but for the future as well.                <P>               <font color="050056">But the players should not be penalized because                Verant has introduced new rules.                <P>               <font color="a00000">No one is being penalized, as current items                are not being made deity-specific.

Though I can't specifically                announce the size of the random component, I can say that the window                for a dragon-type spawn is in excess of 24 hours. That means that                even if they had it timed before we did this, they'd have to sit                around a LONG time.                <P>- Gordon                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955573935,4419,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Terror            Forged Mask blues</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 2:12 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font>             <div> Found this at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031799.html">Everquest                Gameplay Boards</a>,               <P>               <font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>Ok I am a calm                individual but this pisses me off to no end.                <P>You changed the Terror Forged Mask without any in-game warning.                  So people like me heard from a friend of this cool mask out of                  Paineel that cast Call of Bones. So I spent 36 real hours and                  lost 2 bubbles of XP doing the quest. Now you retroactively change                  the mask and all masks that have been obtained to the Fear effect.                  This goes against the precedent you have set with the Mask of                  Deception. You said you would not change the Mask of Deception                  retroactively because those people had worked hard to get the                  item. I have a feeling I know what went through your heads (Verant's                  thinking hmm well only a few clerics have the Mask and clerics                  in large are not a very vocal class, so we don't need to do the                  extra coding to let the ones that have the mask now keep it) This                  is false advertisement. Have us work our asses off for an item                  then you go "Oops so sorry but were nerfing you because we screwed                  up".                <P>               <font color="a00000">The same day that the terror mask was first                found, we announced that the spell effect on it was a mistake and                that it would be changed back. In addition, the NPC that hands it                out had his quest dialogue changed to tell people acquiring it that                the mask would soon lose its current spell effect and gain the power                of fear. Though it is true that we try to keep existing items as                is, there are cases where an item is so severely overpowered that                it must be changed in order to maintain the integrity of the game.                This was such an example.                <P>All of that said, I'm sorry that you are upset. It is next to                  impossible for us to insure that every player is made aware in                  advance for every issue in the game.

This is a                    name taken from a ritualized war that the Aztecs would have                    with the tribes that lived in the surrounding area. They were                    wars that were conducted in times of peace so that warriors                    could "prove" themselves on the field of battle, as well as                    to capture human sacrifices to offer up to the sun. (This is                    a simplistic explaination of what the "War of Flowers" or "Flowery                    Wars" where. It's some damn intersting reading and I suggest                    if you have any interst in this sort of stuff to do a search                    on the web about it.)                  <p>This war will take place in 3 zones: <br>                   West Commons. <br>                   East Commons. <br>                   Desert of North Ro.                  <p>Object and Rules: <br>                   1. Each team will pick 4 players that are their Standard Bearers                    (Standard as in a flag) <br>                   2. The Standard Bearers will be of levels 9th-11th, 16th-18th,                    23rd-25th and 37th-39th. <br>                   3. Each Standard Bearer will be given an object (standard from                    now on) that must stay in a lootable slot. <br>                   4. Each Standard Bearer MUST stay in the 3 war zones with his                    anonymous and roleplay turned off so his/her location can be                    verified at all times. <br>                   5. The war is won when 1 team has killed and looted all the                    opposing teams standard bearers. <br>                   6. Teams will be Good vs Evil. <br>                   7. Out of Range healing is acceptable. <br>                   8. CR will not be respected (except as stated in rule 11) <br>                   9. If the Standard Bearer leaves Norrath for any reason, he                    is in essance dead. Wether LD, RL or whatever. <br>                   10. If a Standard Bearer leaves the 3 zones, wether getting                    killed and returned to his bind point by a MOB, accidentally                    zoning, gets knocked out of a war zone by something like a wiz                    spell or any other reason, they are dead and must surrender                    their standard. <br>                   11. If a Standard Bearer is killed and his Standard is not looted,                    then the Standard Bearer will be afforded standard CR privilages.                    If the Standard Bearer does not return to his corpse within                    15 minutes then he is dead and must surrender his Standard.                  <p>With Hate, <br>                   High Priestess Mlaria Thex<br>                   Ministry of Hate                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955528979,618,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Where            is RoK Shipped From?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 1:42 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> found at: <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EQ                Message Boards</a> <br>               <p>               <blockquote>Where are Kunark Orders being shiped from??                 <p>                 <font color="a00000">Zomax is shipping from two distribution sites.

As a follow up to their                  freshman effort, the HJS staff takes us into the mind of the community                  by covering several hot topics from the forums, and FAQ's and                  flames, treating them all with equal wit and penmanship.Surprised                  at the quality coming out of this tiny young staff? Don't be -                  we're talking about the same group of admins who as total rookies                  to the network invented the "Developer Musings" application; read:                  the single most popular interactive feature released in the last                  10 months at Stratics and fast becoming a standard feature of                  beta sites on the network.This month in the Hero's Journal:                 <ul>                   <li><b>What Was That</b>: A Design article showing one way you                      can deal with Player & Character Perception</li>                   <li><b>Family and Clan</b>: A Design article dealing with how                      families, clans, and titles could work.</li>                   <li><b>The Role of Assassination: An article discussing assassination's                      merits and problems in a game world</b></li>                   <b>                    <li><b>Consequences</b>: An Editorial delving into socialization,                      communication and consequences in MMORPGs.</li>                   <li><b>The Bard's Corner</b>: Along with Poetry, song verse,                      and some comics!</li>                   </b>                 </ul>                 <b><br>                 <br>                 <a href="http://hj.stratics.com/lore/journal/volume1/journal1.html">Head                  on over to Hero's Journey Stratics</a> and enjoy the work they've                  put into their latest release, we think you'll be every bit as                  glad you did as we were.<br>                 <br>                 <br>                 -----------------------------------------------<br>                 <br>                 Ian "Ethos" Armstrong<br>                 Head of Network Development<br>                 Stratics - <a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a><br>                 </b></blockquote>               </font><b>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </b></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955504476,8167,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Kithicor            Killed On Innoruuk!!</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 6:54 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:kang@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Kang</a></font>             <div> From Burlabus Gravereaver:<br>               <br>               <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Recently, on the Innoruuk server, sixteen members from                  Order of the Charred Heart and House of Pendragon and friends                  banded together to defeat one of the toughest, hardest-hitting                  mobs in Norrath. No, not Lord Nagafen, not Lady Vox, but Kithicor,                  the despised level 50 Wood Elf Ranger who lives in Kithicor Forest                  with his bear, Thumper.<br>                 <br>                 Now, you may be asking yourself what does a wood elf ranger have                  that puts him in the ranks of Nagafen and Vox?<B> Well, Kithicor                  hits for 554 with 265 dmg arrows, 100% mr and 32000 hps, in a                  word, ouch!</B><br>                 Our group buffed up, attacked, and executed an extremely detailed                  plan.

They work much better now.<br>                 - The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<br>                 - The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from                  "Outdoor only" to "Night only". It may now be cast in dungeons.<br>                 - Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians                  to inscribe the Malosi spell. It was not intended for magicians                  under level 50.<br>                 <br>                 *General Changes/Fixes*<br>                 <br>                 - Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity.

The "Call of Bones" effect was placed                  on this item by mistake.<br>                 - The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<br>                 - The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<br>                 - Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<br>                 - Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor                  of Ro (Paladin) quests. They have been fixed and Paladins should                  have a much easier time of obtaining their armor.<br>                 - Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<br>                 - Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate                  action of the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your                  spell line-up.<br>                 - Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the                  instrument in use.<br>                 <br>                 *Kerra Ridge*<br>                 <br>                 Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped. The target level-range                  for the zone has been slightly increased. In addition, many new                  quests have been added to the zone. The faction for Kerrans has                  been changed so that those who killed them indiscriminately before                  today's update can take part. Be warned that the Kerrans still                  do not like everyone.<br>                 <br>                 *Paw*<br>                 <br>                 Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment. In addition,                  item drop percentages have been increased.<br>                 <br>                 <B>*The Plane of Hate*</B><br>                 <br>                 The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp.                  Take care in your exploration of this zone as many things have                  changed.<br>                 <br>               </blockquote>               </font>--Kang                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955426258,8840,"></a>      <table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td colspan=2><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_t.gif" height=10 width=60></td>       </tr>       <tr>          <td align="right" width=1% valign="top"><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/title_l.gif" height=30 width=20></td>         <td bgcolor=030034 width=98%>           <table align="left" border=0 bordercolor=908070 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width=100%>             <tr>                <td><font color=ffffff face="Veranda" size=2><b>Monday                  [ April 10 ]</b></font></td>             </tr>           </table>         </td>       </tr>     </table>     <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Scheduled            Downtime have Data Patch?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 9:10 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> found at: <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EQ                Message Boards</a>               <p>               <blockquote>I was just wondering if Verant said if tommorow's server                  downtime will include a data patch.

Players have                  to learn how to react in certain situations, and those decisions                  directly affect the difficulty of an encounter. For instance,                  I've seen a group of 18 attack and kill a dragon. I've also seen                  a group of 40+ fail to kill the same dragon. There's no way that                  an automated system can take group size and tactics into account                  and always provide an accurate /con statement, nor would we want                  it to.                  <p>I mean that we don't want to tell you in advance what the outcome                    of a battle will be to a mathematical certainty.                  <p>The /con message should represent the difficulty of an encounter                    assuming that the entity engaging in it is using the appropriate                    complement of people and tactics. Sometimes a solo player is                    the appropriate complement, sometimes it's a group.                  <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955425997,4839,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Technical            Issues board?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 9:06 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> found at: <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EQ                Message Boards</a>               <p>               <blockquote>Why is there no response from Verant on the Technical                  Issues board?                 <p>                 <font color="a000000">I know that I've seen a few posts on the                  technical issues boards, but you are correct in that there are                  not enough.                  <p>We're currently working at expanding our customer-service and                    tech-support areas, and should be able to provide a viable presense                    there soon.                 <p>-Gordon                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>                 </font></blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955425927,334,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Un-Dead            Spells or Skills?</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 9:05 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:Alethal@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Alethal</a></font>             <div> found at: <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">EQ                Message Boards</a>               <p>               <blockquote>wow, i mean a no mana cost once per day ability to annihiate                  one undead mob at later levels.                  <p>                 <font color="a00000">Well we won't have this in the form that                  you ask, but there is a pretty nifty anti-undead spell that clerics                  can look forward to at later levels.

The assembled forces                    of Oboo and their supporters were informed of the result moments                    later by messenger. The reaction was instant and vicious. Bands                    of rioters, led by Cania, Snowmaj, Twowolves, and Lilu, stormed                    southward and engulfed the Qeynos gates in a fury of veangence.                    Hezlan and his (uncharged) companion Gehnus, were brought down                    by the raging mobs quickly, and cries of vindication were heard                    throughout the city. Other guards quickly fell to the invading                    forces until Corporal Lancot responded to the situation at the                    gate after being warned by several citizens. The mob dispersed                    quickly at the counterattack of the guards.                 <P> But the bloodlust of the mob of Oboo was not completely satisfied.                    Several demonstration leaders infiltrated the city this time,                    and distracted Corporal Lancot and Lt. Dagnarok by engaging                    them in lengthy conversations about gnolls. Vyvyd, Strako and                    Tanaman performed this dangerous task to prevent these defenders                    from re-joining the fray. Meanwhile, the rioters returned to                    the gate and took their full veangence out on the remaining                    guards.                  <P>The Bears of Oboo spokesman, Maccoloch, addressed reporters                    after the mob finished defacating on the Qeynos steps: "Today                    we sought out to ensure that justice would be done. The court                    system, run by the man, did not give us justice. So took it                    upon ourselves to bring (Hezlan) that foul murderer to justice."                  <P>"We respect everyone's right to 'get upah', and 'get on down',                    but Hezlan and the thugs who supported him did neither. That                    just doesn't fly with the Oboo." Maccoloch added, "Whaaaaaaaassaaaaaaaap                    now, Hezlan?" The rest of the Oboo then stumbled back into Qeynos                    Hills, blindingly drunk but chanting happily. <br>                   <br>                   __________ For more information on the Bears of Oboo and event                    background, visit <><a href="http://oboo.tripod.com">http://oboo.tripod.com</a>.               </blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955397932,9453,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>CTC            Raffle</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Cazic-Thule Server News [ 1:18 PM PDT              ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font>             <div>                <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2><b>CTC                  Raffle</b>: April's Raffle was the biggest success of all time.

(It was located on the                    island with the bonfire.) I wish I could remember the guild                    and the name of the fallen.                  <P>From what I could discern (I dared not interrupt), the guildmate                    was killed in RL in a horrible car/plane accident. Since it                    would have been supremely hard for them to all attend a RL memorial,                    they held it in Norrath. His corpse was there (Human paladin,                    full plate), and the guild (45-50 people) was assembled in a                    circle. Prayers were read, memories were reflected on, and in                    general it was really touching.                  <P>But what I thought was the most emotional was a silent 21 firebolt                    salute from 7 of the guilds wizards. they all stood atop a rocky                    crag, and simultaneously let loose with three 7-bolt volleys                    across the zone of Lake Rathe. They were all sent in the same                    direction, and all 21 bolts were visible for about 5 seconds.                  <P>A guide/gm was then summoned, who placed the corpse in the                    fire and then removed the character. I guess it was about as                    close to cremation or a funeral pyre as norrath can get.                  <P>It was quite a sight to see, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't                    feel a pang of emotion throughout the whole event.                  <P>=Tibbit=                 </font></blockquote>               <font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>                <P>Submitted by Brimstone of <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/" target="_top"><BR>                 Akalabeth</a>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955397443,7356,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Trading            post</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 1:10 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font>             <div>                <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>Hello                  <P>My name is Tim Ramsey.

We will not,                    however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats                    affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects                    of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah,                    but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a                    stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a                    year.                 <p> Anyway, here you go:                 <p> DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon                    will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you                    hit with bows                 <p> STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum                    and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive                    skills                 <p> STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can                    hold your breath                 <p> INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills;                    affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well                    as shadow knights                 <p> WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also                    rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills                    if your wisdom is higher than INT.                 <p> CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants,                    and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on                    certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)                 <p> AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills,                    how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you                    take when you are hit                 <p> -Brad                 </font></blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955315507,8891,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Problems            Connecting to EQ Servers</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 2:25 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:yendi@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Yendi</a></font>             <div> From the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/network_fs.html" target="_blank">Network                Status</a> page:               <p>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>There currently appears to be a                  routing issue that may impair connectivity to some servers, including                  the Chat Server.

Will Verant use new technology to remake EQ to make it faster,                    more dynamic, more features, etc?                 <p><font color=#a00000>We will both -- we will keep pushing the                    existing technology harder (you'll see a large difference between                    the older EQ zones and the Expansion zones) and we'll also introduce                    new technology when applicable.</font>                 <p>While I hate to think that they'll just let it fall by the                    wayside, what do you think is going to happen when the Star                    Wars game goes into full-swing development? I know they say                    that the EQ and Star Wars teams are separate, but once they                    get closer to te release of Star Wars, EQ will start to get                    less and less resources.                 <p><font color=#a00000>We will be working on EQ for a very long                    time, and Star Wars Online will not interfere -- they are totally                    different teams. (Blizzard, for example, has no problem working                    on 2 flagship titles, Warcraft and Diablo -- neither will we).</font>                 <p>Brad: Any plans for an EQ2 on the drawing board yet? I hope                    so, heh. I'd like to see what you guys could do with the latest                    technology and the experience you gained from EQ.                  <p><font color=#a00000>I wish I could say Xhen, sorry.</font>                 <p> Will the old "zones" ever be revamped or will new technologies                    give way to an EQ without zones? I understand that this is probably                    isn't feasible now, but are there any plans to "overhaul" Everquest?

I think this is totaly wrong and breaks every single                    thing you said about changing items. You gave up the right to                    nerf this spell when you made it an item. It can't be researched                    and can't be bought off NPCs. Its a droped off a mob with an                    insane spawn time, so now its a rare item. I usually smile and                    continue on with your nerfs (I have been a Necro since April                    99 and have seen plenty), but this is an item that alot of Necro's                    spent time or money on and should be treated like any other                    item. Nerf the drops from now on but if it is our book its our                    item. <br>                   I see two reasons for this nerf.<br>                   1. Your upset with the number of FAs comming into game and want                    to nerf sky. (heres a hint take the coffins off the NPC there,                    you've made them ridiculous to carry). <br>                   2. You cant think of another spell to give us in expansion so                    you'll nerf one give it back to us later. (hmmm how about a                    low lvl faction adjustment spell call it will bender or somthing)                  <p> I ask you verant not to nerf this Item/spell. you made it                    an item and said in the past you wont nerf it unless it unbalances                    game this spell doesn't do that. If your comment is it is not                    going live it is just being tested, well we all know how that                    works. *cough FD changes cough*                 <p> Zakrell Lu'Dan <br>                   Tunare                  <p>                 <font color=#a00000>I'm not sure where the rumor came from, but                  the spell hasn't been changed to self-only. As a precaution to                  insure that something inadvertent didn't happen, one of our testers                  checked it out.

In the past international players have had to wait                  quite some time to get EQ.

The prices                  are 'high' for two reasons:                  <p>1. The shipping is fast so you get it on or around the 24th.                  <p>2.

Back when development                  started on EQ, the development team had several goal for operation                  of the game. For example, they wanted to minimize the effect of                  internet latency. They also wanted to have each "area" have its                  own look-and-feel, with its own set of appropriatly placed NPCs.                  At the time, the "Zone" technology was the best technology available                  to meet the goals of the development team. Of course since then,                  new technologies have been developed, and though it makes sense                  that we would take advantage of them in future products, EQ will                  always have zones.

It makes no note of special skills, abilities, or attacks.                  For example, some encounters of a specific level might be more                  difficult than others. As people level up, they get stronger.                  However NPCs get stronger on a steeper scale. For this reason,                  the /con system goes from being representative of solo abilities                  to being representative of group abilities. The rate at which                  this happens varies for all of the classes. NPCs of a higher level                  MUST be stronger than a solo player, or groups will tear through                  them with no problems and no risk. For this reason, the /con system                  is not broken. At lower levels it fairly well represents the abilities                  of a solo player. At upper levels, it very closely represents                  the risk to a full balanced group.<BR>                 <BR>                 -Gordon</font></blockquote>               </font>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955205390,4410,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Clarifying            Your Purchase Options For EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 7:49 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:kang@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Kang</a></font>             <div> This <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/031107.html" target="_blank">Post</a>                was found on the <a href="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Offical                EverQuest Forums:</a><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Hello all,<BR>                 <BR>                 To clarify the different purchase options:<BR>                 <BR>                 If you buy the UPGRADE, you can use it to flag your CURRENT account                  for Kunark.

The event will start on Sunday April 30th, 2000                  on theFellowship's picnic grounds in the Lesser Feydark, just                  follow the wallof the Lesser Fey left to the first set of tents                  before the Nybright Sister camp. The celebration's festivities                  will start at 4pm EST and at 5pm EST we will all embark for the                  lands of Kunark. After previewing the lands a few days before                  hand we will decide where and how best to meet in Kunark(or travel                  there). The Fellowship of the Griffon is one of Xegony's eldest                  guilds and we have recently merged with Wisdom Seekers to enhance                  our guilds potential in Norrath making the new land of Norrath                  an even brighter land to explore. With the anticipation of this                  new world dawning, we look forward to seeing all our old friends                  and new alike join us on this expedition.

At level 9 a shadow knight                  has over 200 hit points and is fighting creatures with even more.                  Five points is a very tiny amount on either side, thus using this                  spell in combat regardless of cost is not terribly worthwhile.                  So why the double cost here?<Br>                 2nd lifetap drains 11 points at a cost of 36 mana (again, vs.                  the 18 for a necro) = 0.61ppm<br>                 3rd lifetap drains 45 points at a cost of 126 mana (vs. 63 for                  a necro) = 0.71 ppm<br>                 <br>                 What&#8217;s going on here? The other 2 hybrids get their spells                  at the same cost as their parent casting class. The amount of                  damage done at each of these levels (total points) is generally                  less than that done by a singe sword stroke. So why are shadow                  knights being dealt with this way? <Br>                 <Br>                 -DV<br>                 Just another Shadow Knight with no place to shop</blockquote>               </font><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Shadowknights weren't originally                  slated to get lifetaps. When we decided to enable lifetaps for                  them, they were too powerful. The increased mana cost was put                  in at that time. Don't forget that not only are you damaging the                  target, you are also healing yourself. So if you want to compare                  the lifetaps to the spells of the ranger and paladin, you have                  to take both healing and damage into account.<br>                 <br>                 Lastly, I noticed that you doubled the native listed mana compared                  to the necro as the SKs cost.

The problem is that the effect has a 30-second casting                  time. In almost all situations, it is better to cast clarity the                  old fashioned way (3 seconds), and med for the next 27 seconds...gaining                  more mana than the cost of the clarity. Actually, the wand indirectly                  costs more mana to use than simply casting clarity because you                  can't med (or do anything else) while it is casting the effect.                  In fact, it is downright dangerous to use in a combat situation                  because you can't be interrupted (or do anything yourself), unlike                  normal spell casting/meditation.<br>                 <br>                 So my question is: Was this intentional, or just a typo in the                  database (since clarity has a 3-sec casting time, 30 seconds seems                  awfully harsh)?

Per a post I read recently by Gordon, I think it                  was, plus mana items have a built in Anti-Twink feature. Cool,                  I think thats good. Before I ask my question I want to say I do                  NOT want a formula or exact numbers. Does this feature tapper                  off at higher lvls, or would say even a LvL 50 be effected by                  this? Such as a LvL 50 INT caster with 200 INT gets more mana                  from an item then a LvL 50 INT caster with 180 INT</blockquote>               </font><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Though not affected directly by                  a stat, the amount of mana received is affected by total mana.                  Now since someone with 200int has more mana than someone with                  180, this would have the *potential* to affect the amount of mana                  received from +mana items. However it is highly unlikely that                  someone would have so many +mana items, and so little total mana                  that the mana items would be scaled. The important thing here                  is that it does work correctly.</font></blockquote>               </font> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>2.

I know Duels cause you to come back OOM, but I thought we still                  came back with mana if a creature kills us in a regular fight.                  I died 2 times yesterday.

This one is a technical and fesability question.                  While low priority, I know many people who would love to see more                  graphics for weapons, armor and such. I know you can only do so                  much because of memory constrants on older systems and time required                  to make the textures and new looks. If you had the extra man hours                  to make the graphics (not fancy partical effects for everything                  including rusties, just things like make the Staff of the Wheel                  look different from a water crystal staff or Different looks for                  rare plate armor other then color) could this be implemented as                  an optional download? Maybe put an option to download a few new                  graphics every month or two as your people have the time to draw                  them up. That would let your people work on it as they have time,                  avoid a big single download, let the people who can not or do                  not want to use the new graphics use the old graphics, and quite                  honestly do something this game is ment to do, make a lot of people                  happy (btw I think it already does that REALLY good) I for one                  love to look different and for people to be able to see that I                  have achieved a rare or hard to get item.</blockquote>               </font><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>As we've mentioned before, EQ needs                  to continue running under the same system specifications as when                  it was released. That is what ties our hands in regards to new                  graphics. With the expansion, we do expand upon those graphics                  due to our ability to change the required system specs, however                  objects that can move into areas where they can be viewed by people                  with the old system specs must remain viewable by them. Optional                  patches don't work in this case, as people without the required                  system will download it, and then they will cease to run. For                  these reasons as well as others, global graphics have to remain                  more or less static.</font></blockquote>               </font> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>4. do you like soft or hard shell tacos?</blockquote>               </font><FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Soft.

Hezlan pled not                    guilty by reason of self defense, and the trial has been proceeding                    over the last two weeks.                  <P>The murder trial is scheduled to finish up Saturday evening                    at the Qeynos courthouse, and the rally will be held to coincide                    with the jury deliberations. The Bears of Oboo, a guild made                    up of barbarians and erudites, and the Reach of Oboo, a guild                    made up of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls, have decided to merge                    and join forces and voices in this rally for justice.                  <P>We are calling all members of the oppressed races of Norrath                    to join us in our protest rally.

Assuming                  that we don't adjust the experience curve for level 50, we fully                  expect many people to hit level 51 within minutes of logging on                  the day of release.                  <P>- Gordon                 </font></font></blockquote>               <font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </font></div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem955037989,797,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Mana            Items</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 9:19 AM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:zargon@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Zargon</a></font>             <div> Found at the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/030371.html">Everquest                Gameplay Board,</a><BR>               <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>Abashi,                  +mana items are broken.

All "newbies" of Levels                    1-5 are invited to appear at Wizard or Druid teleport locations                    and obtain a ride and escort to the Arena for this event. All                    "newbies" gathered in the Arena will commence the battle with                    the Twink at the same time. The "newbie" who slays the Twink                    will receive an item with immense magical properties depending                    on his class.

All "newbies" will be stripped of all buffs prior to the                    battle. They can re-apply their own buffs afterwards if they                    wish.                  <P> 2. Any newbie caught receiving buffs from anyone other than                    themselves will be removed from the competition.                  <P> 3. Nobody can heal the Twink. Anyone caught healing the Twink                    will be removed from the competition.                  <P> 4.

If it is useless                  and will never be updated, why not replace then with more useful                  skills? Maybe Climbing, Negotiating (used on a merchant to reduce                  prices, based on your Charisma skill {maybe for Enchanters also}).<font color=#a00000>                 <P>We've compensated for the problems with sense/disarm traps                    in different ways that balance the class. As much as we'd like                    to remove all traces of the sense/disarm trap skills, they are                    in the character files and therefore can't just be yanked out.                    "Climbing" wouldn't work out well since the world is already                    designed taking into account the locations that a player can                    or cannot reach. As for "Negotiation", the prices of items are                    already modified in regards to charisma.                 <P>                  <font color=050056>I have thought of a new skill. Could there                  possibly be a sort of skill similar to Crit. Hit in which you                  target a portion of the body for upped damage and possible disability                  with a greater chance of missing? For example, a Warrior may have                  a chance to cut off a finger, making the monster's attacks a bit                  slower, or a Rogue poking a creature's eye(s) out, causing blindness.                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>We have added subsequent effects to skills. For instance, Crippling                    Blow has a chance to stun the opponenet. As for additional effects,                    we'll consider them as we have a need for additional abilities                    and skills.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>With the new Expansion, there are new requirements. Because                    of these new requirements, I cannot play Ruins of Kunark. Does                    this mean I cannot even see the new weapons, spells, textures,                    etc.?                 <font color=#a00000>                 <P>Most of the new graphics/textures are based upon world geometry                    and objects in the Kunark lands, not on mobile objects that                    travel between the two. As such you won't have a need to see                    the majority of the new art if you don't purchase Kunark. As                    for the mobile stuff, you should be able to see all of that                    without a problem.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>Why don't monks get some sort of critical hit? Warriors get                    a Crit. Hit and Crippling Blow with melee and kicking (I think)                    , we Rogues get a Crit. Hit and Deadly Strike by throwing things,                    and Rangers get Crit. Hit (dunno about a Deadly Strike-ish attack                    for Rangers) using bows. Any plans in the future for monks in                    this field (Judo Chop, Groin Punch, Eye Gouge, etc.) ?                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>Because they are well-balanced without critical hit. They get                    things like the built-in haste to their unarmed combat speed                    instead. As for the additional skills you mentioned, there are                    currently no plans for any pre-50 skills for any of the classes.                    As for what happens post-50, people will need the expansion                    to find out.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>New classes ... any new ones planned (Witches {Warlocks for                    the males} or priests {possibly a pure caster form of cleric}                    )?                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>Nothing planned at present.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>Speaking of priests and religions, is there any possibility                    to convert religions? Maybe a place to which you make a pilgrimage                    and give an offering to the deity you wish to worship. Just                    a thought.                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>Factions are quite complicated and don't readily support a                    deity-change. As such we don't really have any plans to make                    this an option.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>I have been wondering something for a while now. When I have                    my dark elf form on, why do Dark Elves still hate me even though                    I have never even touched their faction? I think it is because                    I worship Bristlebane.                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>Illusions can only do so much to combat any negative faction                    that you have. It's the only way we could make them both useful                    and balanced.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>If it is, how can they tell? I don't know about other players,                    but I don't run about shouting, "Praise Bristlebane! Innoruuk                    sucks!" and other things of the sort.                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>In a way, you do. When you choose your deity, you are determining                    the way your character ran his or her life prior to you gaining                    control over it (from an RP standpoint). From a gameplay standpoint,                    this is another case where we had to make a choice, and that                    choice was that religion would be both useful and balanced.                    In order to balance usefulness, there must be a downside associated                    with it. As such, NPCs can see through your religion.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>So far, I have seen pictures of Cazic-Thule, Innoruuk, Tunare,                    Solusek Ro, Rallos Zek, and Mithaniel Marr. Any plans to have                    other gods make a guest appearance?                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>Take a look at our server list. Anyone on there is libel to                    show up at any time.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>Hair ... any guys with long hair on the way (doesn't really                    matter, just curious)                  <font color=#a00000>                 <P>No. Hair is part of the character model, and long hair was                    only built on to the female models. It is for all intents and                    purposes an extra appendage.                  <font color=050056>                 <P>In the Everquest Manual, it says that Veeshan is the ruler                    of the Plane of Sky. If this is so, why isn't Veeshan in the                    PoS?

The event will                    start on Sunday April 30th, 2000 on the Fellowship's picnic                    grounds in the Lesser Feydark, just follow the wall of the Lesser                    Fey left to the first set of tents before the Nybright Sister                    camp. The celebration's festivities will start at 4pm EST and                    at 5pm EST we will all embark for the lands of Kunark. After                    previewing the lands a few days before hand we will decide where                    and how best to meet in Kunark(or travel there). The Fellowship                    of the Griffon is one of Xegony's eldest guilds and we have                    recently merged with Wisdom Seekers to enhance our guilds potential                    in Norrath making the new land of Norrath an even brighter land                    to explore. With the anticipation of this new world dawning,                    we look forward to seeing all our old friends and new alike                    join us on this expedition.

Xps for lowlevels too!<br>                 Who: Open to all! Guildies & nonguildies. Lvls 1-50.<br>                 How: You kill clockworks. If you find a micro servo, you stay                  in the loot screen but DON'T LOOT. Give me a tell (Ceinwein) with                  your general location and coordinates. I run over, loot the micro                  servo, pay you 10pp (!), and randomly generate a prize for you.                  At the end of the event, I'll be giving out extra prizes for the                  people who found me the most micro servos. First prize is a TRUESHOT                  LONGBOW!                 <p>Runaway Clockworks are Lvl 1-5. They can be found in the newbie                    area near the druid ring. Watch out for the spiderlings ganging                    up. They can also be found near the dragon bones. Watch out                    for skeletons. The can occassionally be found on the path to                    Lower Faydark.                 <p>Small Rogue Clockworks are Lvl 5-9. They can occassionally                    be found on the path to Lower Faydark. They can also be found                    in the valley and on the ridges north of the windmills. Watch                    out for kobolds and skellies.                  <p>Large Rogue Clockworks are Lvl 8-12. They can be found exclusively                    in the area outside of the mino caves. Lots of nasties to watch                    out for here!                  <p>Different clockworks drop cash, blackboxes, blackbox fragments,                    cogs, and scrap metal. We are not interested in these. Either                    loot them to sell or destroy them. Clean up your corpses! It                    makes it easier to find you.                  <p>Feel free to team up. Just make sure you agree who gets credit                    for what kills. I have no problem with people splitting the                    cash rewards or trading prizes,etc.                 <p>But I need to know who gets "credit" for the running total                    towards the big prizes.                 <p>I have alot of small prizes and try to make them appropriate                    to the winner. Not all of them are great. You could win everything                    from a torch to a thick leather apron to a piece of cured silk                    or bronze armour to forged weapons to bows and much much more.

Such a pity it is indeed, that the world                    shall know my name, and that of your Queen's fall from history                    and of the Gods and Mortals alike!"                  <p>The shadows quickly retreat back to the corners and stones                    from which they came, their tendrils rising in the air and the                    sound of a thousand shrieks echo across the Lavastorm Mountains.                  <p>As the shadows slither away from view, the voice can be heard,                    faintly hissing foul words.                  <p>"You have evaded me this day, Children of Scale, but it shall                    not be the last battle which you will face!"                  <p>"Rend your viel and harness your power, it shall do nothing                    for you, as in the end, you all shall perish, dragon and mortals                    alike, your corpses shall rot at my feet.

Within the next 2 days the                    Login Servers will be coming down and we will be doing a patch                    that will add the EverQuest Store into the front end of the                    game. At that time, the first product we will be offering will                    be the EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark (RoK) upgrade for existing                    customers. This will allow existing customers of EverQuest to                    purchase RoK for $16.95 (Plus S&H). In addition, we will offer                    various shipping options depending on which country you live                    in. EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark will be launching on April 24th.                    We want to insure that this product is in everybody's hands                    on or before that date.                 <p>In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User                    Agreement and Software License to add in some additional Terms                    and Conditions that we will require everyone toagree to before                    playing EverQuest.                 <p>The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest                    Characters and Items outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay).                    Here is the text of this change:                 <p>"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items,                    coin orcopy righted material."                 <p>You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons,                    but first and foremost of them is the amount of trouble this                    is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there area                    lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being                    put in the middle of it, and we don'thave the time or the resources                    to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next                    reason is amore philosophical one and that is that we believe                    people should have to earn their items and characters in thegame                    rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the                    second point can be argued from other perspectives that we do                    in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours.                 <p>The next change to the User Agreement and Software license                    concerns our efforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and                    from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest                    as an ongoing business concern. We have developed the technology                    to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact                    back to us. Without getting into the specifics of this technology,                    I can say that we in no way will search a user's harddrive (aside                    from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry                    nor will we send back any information other than the fact that                    auser is in fact running one of these programs (specifically                    we are NOT sending information about everything the user is                    running back to ourservers).                 <p>It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the                    hacking community force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ"                    isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not                    something we can allow in a game like EverQuest where it affects                    other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, although                    this is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't                    the worst offender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring                    down our servers withanother malicious program. We were able                    to quickly identify what was goingon and insure this didn't                    happen again, but nonetheless the potential isthere and we need                    to be able to quickly identify and stop these types of programs.                    Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send                    any information back tothe Everquest servers other than information                    regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intended                    operation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available                    for some time, but recently we've found it's going to beneccessary                    to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those                    ofyou concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say                    that we feel it'sneccessary to do this but we want you to be                    informed that we are going totry these measures to protect both                    ourselves and the game's players.                 <p>Here is the text of this change:                 <p>"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files                    to you.

A singer had been seen                  in steamfont, accompanied by a dragon, and she told of Veeshans                  coming return. <br>                 <br>                 Again, word flew the taverns and bars of the world, and it was                  told that she and her dragon had been slain at the hands of Mayongs                  man, who then sent a pawn to the hell hole known as Dagnors Cauldron                  to employ a dwarf of almost godlike skills to retrieve an... item...                  from the ice Wyrms lair, Lady voxs own private treasures.<br>                 <br>                 When for a third time rumblings of the scales awakening reached                  by ears I abandoned by Crusade against the heretic lizards, and                  joined my companions in a rush to Permafrost. We arrived to find                  a young, frail rogue leading a High elven Lady of beautiful elegance                  and her company of guards, trolls and the like, deep within permafrost                  to Vox's nest... where we found the Dwarven rogue making his way                  out, carrying a shard whos loss had raised the Dragons ire such                  that her screams and roars shook the walls and caused the ice                  of the caverns itself to fall.<br>                 <br>                 The rogue, skilled as he was, was flushed with his success and                  fearful of Mayongs temper, and wished to leave quickly. That fear,                  perhaps, his downfall, as the Lady we were with began to seduce                  him, flattering his skills, speaking of his feat, until at last                  she held the Shard in her hands for "just a moment". She did not                  lie, for that moment ws all it took to seal the dwarfs doom as                  her guards moved with inhuman speed and slew him.<br>                 <br>                 Vox roared again. Her goblins cowered. The intruders in her realm                  had her treasure and vanished before she could rally her still                  considerable might. One of the less... bright of the races in                  the Ladys guard let slip a few words, enough to lead us to the                  Rathe mountains.<br>                 <br>                 We arrived to see a Dragon, blue as the sky, its wings stretched                  in triumph over the mysterious company. As we hurried to its place                  we caught the Lady thanking her guide, the rogue, as two more                  of her company shed their forms and took on wings... 2, then 3                  dragons soared above us, exultant in their triumph, the shard                  itself a shard of Veeshans own claws, a relic of great power.<br>                 <br>                 As she thanked the rogue, shadows gathered. Mayong, his prize                  torn from his grasp had not been idle as the dragons wheeled in                  the sky.<br>                 <br>                 Suddenly one fell, followed swiftly by its comrades, as the Undead                  lord who aspires to godhood slew all those he could see in the                  air. The lady, still concealed from him in elven form although                  doubtless a Child of Veeshan herself, spoke swiftly to the rogue.<br>                 <br>                 A sacrifice was required. Blood of one of the lesser children                  to open the plane of sky and allow Veeshans kin ingress to slay                  those who would usurp her and their rightful place on the world.                  He would die, of his own choice, by the shard, and rise again                  as their champion, soul claimed by the Wyrm Queen.<br>                 <br>                 Despite my fears, and warnings, the rogue took this path, perhaps                  flattered by the celestial attentions, perhaps hungry for reward                  and power, maybe even merely fearful of the consequence should                  he refuse.<br>                 <br>                 But he accepted, and the shard turned in his hands and slew him.                  When he rose he was known as the Claw of the Scale. The remaining                  children of Veeshan fled then before mayong could penetrate their                  cloak, and left their new catspaw on Norrath, the shard still                  in his possession.<br>                 <br>                 War is brewing, and this time I need no bards to tell me of its                  consequence.

As usual there were crowd control problems - I think maybe                  GM's should be given an AE sit down and shut up audience spell                  or something ;) - but it went off pretty well.

I think that even though                  I know that the vast majority of players love EQ and that the                  number of people who bitterly post on these boards is very small,                  that it still bugs me to hear false claims and allegations about                  Verant and our game. Some people say we don't care, or that we                  don't listen, or that we don't respect our customers. I've always                  been a person that is bothered by people believing things that                  aren't true about me (or my company, whom I represent). I also                  know that for every poster there are probably 10 or even 100 'lurkers'                  who just read boards, and I know that they appreciate when we                  post. Heck, whenever I do I see new names either post or email                  me, thanking me for the extra info. So I do what I can, and today                  it occurred to me to try to answer as many questions about the                  game as I could. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#050056>Whenever your inventory is full, and you have                  a stackable item in there, and you go to loot another stackable                  item of the same type, it says your inventory is full. So you                  have to manually pick it up and place it there. This is really                  quite annoying. Any chance of getting it fixed? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>No short term plans, no, but I'd love to see                  that addressed one day. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#050056>Why does it take 2 months to patch data? Why                  is the time interval in-between data patches (whatever that means)                  take over a month. Why is it when a response like "next patch                  it will be done" really means "next DATA patch" and not clearly                  stated "which will happen in over a month" <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>It doesn't always, but it certainly does take                  some time. Patching data can often be the most dangerous type                  of patch, because it's so easy to miss bugs, exploits, and other                  similar problems. So whenever we add a bunch of data to the game,                  we try to test it for a longer period of time. Also, moving data                  over from our test environment to the live servers takes more                  time than just moving code. Sometimes, when we've had a decent                  amount of downtime, for whatever reason, we are hesitant to move                  data over and have delayed the process in the past.<font color=#050056><BR>                 <BR>                 Can you give wood elves the /lapdance emotes (yes with animation)?<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>Hehe, no comment.<BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#050056>A Rogue cannot evade when the only other thing                  attacking the creature is a pet.

Why isn't                  the creature considering the pet a valid target to attack if a                  Rogue evades? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>I'm not positive, but I think the skill was                  intended to work in a group situation, and that we assume there                  are other characters attacking the target. <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#050056>Why aren't most items that have charged effects                  rechargeable? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>Because having items with charged effects                  allow us to place items into the game that would be too powerful                  were the charges infinite and/or rechargeable. That said, it does                  indeed make sense to have some charged effects items rechargeable                  and I think you'll see more in the future. <font color=#050056><BR>                 <BR>                 Are you ever going to reimplement fear and charm back into PVP?

Is it Verant's intention                  to balance classes with respect to dependencies? It's good to                  have classes that each need each other, but if there are classes                  that need others that don't need them, would that be cause for                  tuning? <BR>                 <BR>                 <font color=#a00000>In a sense, yes. Interdependence is key to                  EverQuest and has always been. Classes should need each other,                  and some classes should need other classes more than others (i.e.                  some race/class combos are better for soloing than others).

The film, a "story                  movie," continues the tale depicted in the text of Spawn of Afton:                  Part I. Near the beginning of the movie, the Lokai elder is heard                  chanting some words in Atrianese.               <p> Your task? Decipher these words into an English phrase (Yes,                  they do mean something) and send it to us. The first three people                  to unearth the correct translation will recieve an Atriarch mousepad,                  Atriarch stickers, and possibly other neat Atriarch-related loot!               <p> Read about the contest <A HREF="http://at.stratics.com/sections/contest/">here</A>                  or learn more about Atriarch at <A HREF="http://at.stratics.com">Atriarch                  Stratics</A>.

This one particularly                  bothered me, because it's the 2nd time it happened to Nameless.                  This time around I had them completely switch in entirely new                  hardware for the server because we began to suspect another piece                  of hardware in the configuration.                  <p>We do apologize for any downtime Nameless players have experienced.

The focus of this event will be                    the younger players of Norrath. Where most trade fairs feature                    thulian claws and oracle robes, our fair is to assist the lower-level                    players attain patchwork, banded, Runed Totem Staves, Skulls                    of Jhen'Tra, etc.                 <p>Everyone is welcome to come to ply their trade, but only evil                    players will be attending the following tournament in Neriak.                    An open battle will be waged in the Warriors' Hall in the Neriak                    commons. Sober players will wage a free-for-all battle to win                    a prize to be announced at the fair, while a drunken brawl will                    take place afterwards for another prize.                 <p>For those of you who are thinking, "But I don't have anything                    to sell!" Fear not, you can gather bone chips and bat wings,                    as higher-level players would rather purchase them than chase                    after something they don't get experience for (but you might).                    And as any trade fair, language exchanges will surely take place.                    Since this is sponsored by an evil guild, you light-dwellers                    can learn Teir'Dal or Troll (if you don't get eaten).                 <p>Dourden Del`Tiroth                  <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>               </blockquote>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem954714678,2367,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>EQ            Central 2000</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 3:31 PM PDT ] - <a href="mailto:yendi@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Yendi</a></font>             <div>                <p>               <blockquote>Hello All of Norrath.

Here is the original <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029892.html" target="_blank">thread</a>:               <p>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>I want to try something. I don't                  know if it will work well, but what the heck.                 <p> I want to spend some time today answering questions. Let me                    lay down some guidelines on the questions though:                 <p> 1. Keep them short -- one or two sentences max. Short, succinct,                    to the point, etc.                  <p> 2. No nasty flames, loaded questions, veiled insults, etc.                 <p> 3. Nothing situationally or contextually too specific. Keep                    questions to a more general level. No 'why does item (or quest                    or spell) a with stats b & c vary from item d'. To be honest,                    I don't know a lot of the game at that level of detail (no one                    person can, and my job is to understand the game as a whole                    more than to have memorized every quest, spell, and item), and                    that's not what I want to focus on here anyway.                 <p> Keep the questions at more of a global level. Ask me about                    the Vision(TM), or the philosophies behind game mechanics, etc.                    Maybe we can put together a FAQ IF this works out (I know stephenmcleod                    tried to do something like this recently). I think the key here                    is to keep the questions short and the answers fairly short                    as well. My answers will be pretty blunt and matter-of-factly                    as opposed to responding with a detailed essay.                 <p> I will try to answer as many questions as I can. This is really                    an experiment to see if I can be of some assistance in explaining                    issues, positions, viewpoints, etc. I can't guarantee I will                    get to every question, nor will I be able to focus on this thread                    after tonight.                  <p> Also, in addition to being unable to answer the really specific                    item/quest/spell questions, I may also be unable to answer some                    questions about the future (for example, what all will the EQ                    team work on post-expansion, or will there be an EQ 2, etc.)                    or about areas that we've chosen to keep private (for example,                    what is the exact topology of an EQ server).                  <p> Anyway, enough disclaimers and explanations. Let's give this                    a shot.                  <p> -Brad                 </font></blockquote>               <p>Sounds like a good opportunity.

Thank God it happens very rarely thanks to the                    RAID setup on our machines. Basically, 2 drives have to go bad                    around the same time for this to happen.                  <p> The chances of that happening, of course, is very small, which                    is why it's only happened 3-4 times in a year.                 <p> Typically a single drive goes bad, we bring down the server,                    put a new drive in, and rebuild it.                 <p> But if the RAID controller and/or 2 drives go bad, it's restore                    from backup time.                 <p> I assume this is what happened on the Nameless recently, though                    I've not talked to anyone one at EQ Operations.                 <p> In any case, what's with the 'it's happened twice on the Nameless!!'                    stuff?

Definitely moreso than with the original guide.                 <p> That said, we don't have total control. We are the developer,                    not the publisher (Sony), nor the company in charge of writing/creating                    the guide.                 <p> There is also another problem with strategy guides (and even                    manuals) when it comes to MMORPGs: these games change. The manual/strategy                    guide can't.                  <p> My view of strategy guides for games like these would be that                    they really be STRATEGY guides, that they are full of valuable                    information that is more timeless. For example, grouping tactics                    and such.                 <p> But let me tell you, the strategy guide makers want to put                    in list after list of spells, items, skills, and other stats.                    Which is all find and dandy, I guess, for single player games.                 <p> But it makes for problems in games that change and evolve.                    I'm also against 'spoilers' in general, but that's another topic.                 <p> Another thread mentioned that the original guide said Humans                    have an experience/leveling bonus or some such. The reality                    is that they are one of the easier races to level in that some                    other races have experience penalties.                  <p> But they didn't word it that way, for whatever reason (miscommunication?                    who knows).                 <p> Anyway, to make a long story short, we'll do our best to work                    with the outside companies that write manuals and strategy guides,                    and we seem to be having more influence in the Kunark guide                    than in the original. That said, things are going to change,                    miscommuncation will probably occur again (let's just hope to                    a lesser degree), and things will be wrong.                 <p> *shrug*                 <p> -Brad                 </font></blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem954617342,8718,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Gordon            on Teleports for Rangers</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 11:29 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:yendi@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Yendi</a></font>             <div> Found this post from Abashi on this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028515.html" target="_blank">thread</a>                of the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro" target="_blank">Everquest                Forums</a>:               <p>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>Wow!

Verant themselves have                  made that point to justify increasing the importance of quests.                  I agree, and would like to suggest Verant go farther by having                  quests give the best commodity: experience. Not the near-zero                  amount they do now for any high levels, but real amounts for all                  levels.</blockquote>               <p>               <blockquote><font color=#a00000>We're not at all opposed to quests                  giving out real (e.g. tangible) experience, however that's really                  not going to be possible given the current architecture. The problem                  is that we need to have the ability to store completion-info as                  part of the character. This would keep the same character from                  doing the same quest over and over again, which is what keeps                  us from doing things like giving out half-a-level for a tough                  quest. Tracking this unfortunately isn't possible without doing                  a player-wipe. The Quest engine could be improved in many other                  ways, but they all require the ability to know exactly what a                  character has or has not done.                  <p> -Gordon                 </font></blockquote>               <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem954605959,8097,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>Happy            April Fools!</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1>Community News [ 8:19 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:Manga@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Manga</a></font>             <div> Everyone here at Stratics wishes everyone of you a Happy April                Fools!<BR>               Don't forget Daylight Savings Time late tonight/early tommorrow                for you folks who observe this tradition! ;>                <div align="right"><font size=1><img src="http://eq.stratics.com/graphics/tikb.gif" width=5 height=5>&nbsp;<a href="#top">top</a></font></div>             </div>           </div>           </font></td>       </tr>     </table>     <a name="newsitem954596171,9979,"></a>      <table border=0 cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 width=90%>       <tr>          <td><font face="Veranda" size=2><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=3><b>'Naggy            Run' on Cazic Thule</b></font>           <div><font color=ff0000 size=1> [ 5:36 AM PST ] - <a href="mailto:sayree@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Sayree</a></font>             <div> From Eolyn<FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2>               <blockquote>Hail and well met fellow citizens of Norrath!
