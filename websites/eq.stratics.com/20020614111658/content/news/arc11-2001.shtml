Additionally, one good guild (Angerthas) and one evil guild (Da Bashin' Iggles) have also been invited. <br><br>Originally announced to occur in East Karana, this will take place on Luclin, in the Bazaar. Given the nature of the server, this is the best way to ensure that parties in attendance do not have any regrettable incidents happen. <br><br>Everyone please bring one gift. It does not have to be anything spectacular. It can be as simple as a full set of patchwork armor for a newbie/lowbie, up to such rare and wonderful items as a fbss. Cash gifts are welcome as are offers of powerlevelling, experience resurrections, and ports. I will kick things off by offering a gift, all interested parties will then roll for it (if there are more than one), and the recipient of the gift will then offer their gift in the same fashion. <br><br>We do not sympathize or empathize with the enemy in any way. This is just a simple seasonal holiday party and we hope you will see fit to attend. </blockquote>Thanks Kidknie!

Here is a snipit:<br><br><blockquote>EverQuest was originally released in 1999, nearly three years ago. It wasn't the first game of its kind by any means, though it was the first to feature a fully 3D graphics engine. Its impressive graphics drew many players to the game, who found in it a huge, detailed fantasy world and a surprisingly complex combat system. In short, many of those who started playing EverQuest years ago are still playing it now.<br><center><br><b> [ <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/reviews/0,10867,2834230,00.html" target="_blank">The Complete Review Gamespot</a> ]</b></center></blockquote>Go ahead and give it a read!

Read on:<br><br><blockquote>On Tuesday the 18th of December , in Tunare , a troll became stuck in a chimney in the Neriak Commons , the one on the BF weapons forge . <br><br>Curiousity and boredom caused said troll to become lodged into the chimney . He spotted a hole in the roof of the shop from within , and became curious . He climbed the rudge to the house and spotted a chimney . After a bit of trying , he climbed in and became stuck due to his tremendous bulk and the fact he was a nimrod . <br><br>Eventually , after three or four Santa jokes from dark elves wandering the city ( And countless more jokes from his guildmates ) , a GM by the name of Jaydrox answered his plead for help . Jaydrox also supplied the fifth such joke about Santa . <br><br>The GM , after teleporting to Grazzle , became stuck as well , and attempted to jump out but failed . So , he took the only way out he could - he dropped into the fire by some means . Moments later , Grazzle dropped as well , even though he had been suspended in mid-air for 45 minutes . <br><br>All in all , no prizes were awarded , but it was a good holiday laugh . <br><br>Merry Christmas , all , from Santa Troll </blockquote>Very Amusing!

He then thanked us and said he would soon return with his experiment. <br><br>Five minutes later a large spider named Mechanoid appeared in the zone and began attacking all. Finally a high level caster named Castback dropped two nukes on it and it died.<br><br>Mezmo then returned to the zone and asked if anyone had seen his experiment. I informed him of his experiments fate and he left. The GM event was weak, fun was had by no one. But it did happen.</blockquote>Interesting..

It is our hope that these new NPCs will help players by reducing the time it takes to find a bind from another player character.</blockquote>There ya go!

We are not taking any of our resources away from fixing programming bugs to work on content.<br><br>I also wanted to reassure you that we are working with NVIDIA and ATI to resolve the issues that are affecting a few of our customers that are using those cards. We dont have any firm news for you on this right now, but we are working on it.<br><br>Also note that I've reversed the order of the list. The list of fixed items is getting long, and really it's the list of things we are still working on that seems the most urgent. So I've moved the fixed issues to the bottom.<br><br>---<br><br>We're still working on some issues and we've fixed others. Keep in mind that we have a bunch of people working on things, so most of these items are on the top of someone's list. <br><br>While some of these issues only affect a tiny portion of our customers, we want to give a full and complete rundown of issues we are aware of. We will be keeping you updated as things change. Also, check the patch messages for more information. <br><br><b>Stuff in the works,</b> some of these will be fixed with the next patch (in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them): <br><br><ul><li>Reducing loading and zoning times<br><li>Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<br><li>Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<br><li>Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<br><li>Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<br><li>Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<br><li>Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<br><li>Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<br><li>New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely <br><li>New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working properly<br><li>There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone<br><li>A few players are being disconnected at random<br><li>Slow framerate on some fast computers*</li></ul>*Every bug has its story. This one begins as an incompatibility between EverQuest, AMD processors and Umbra (a technology that, ironically, speeds up framerates). There is a known problem in the Umbra engine that was causing the crashes that some AMD users were originally seeing in Shadowhaven. In our desire to make sure that both Intel and AMD users could enter the game, we introduced another condition that unfortunately slowed down framerates in certain circumstances. We have one person working on nothing but this at the moment and he's made significant progress. We expect this problem to go away soon.<br><br><b>Fixed since release</b> (in no particular order either):<br><br><ul><li>Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)</li><br><li>Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die</li><br><li>Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent</li><br><li>Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.</li><br><li>/follow bug that caused folks to crash</li><br><li>Transparency issues with i810 display adapters</li><br><li>Crash bug related to root and gate</li><br><li>Various item and content fixes</li><br><li>Crash problems in certain zones</li><br><li>K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. Shadowhaven is one of those zones.</li><br><li>A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.</li><br><li>Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans</li><br><li>Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working</li><br><li>Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor</li><br><li>A few people that dont have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing "Entering Luclin" when logging in and then crashing</li><br><li>A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game. </li><br><li>Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users</li></ul>Note: The inability to adjust gamma setting with some cards is an issue with cards that just don't support that ability. It's not really something we can fix in code. We are investigating to see if there are any possible workarounds out there for these older cards that are no longer supported by the manufacturer. <br><br><br><b>Tech Tip</b><br><br><ul><li>Pauses with Win 98/ME ONLY: A possible solution for those with a fair amount of RAM (technically, anyone with 128 megs or more) who are seeing pauses while the hard drive runs a bit, might benefit from this simple change (it's also easy to undo). It might also improve load and zone times.</li></ul>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file: ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 <br><br>For best results, change only this setting (don't change a bunch of other stuff at the same time) and see how it performs. And if it isn't better or seems worse you can just erase that line from your System.ini file. I should tell you that this change might make EverQuest better and it might also cost you some performance with your system overall, though this does not seem to be the case for most people. Keep that in mind if you decide to use this tip. <br><br>Thank you all for your patience. We are working hard to get these issues straightened out as soon as possible. <br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks for the update <b><i>Absor</b></i>!

Read on:<br><br><blockquote>On Sunday December 16th, I was hunting with my iksar shaman in the Field of Bone. It was a quiet day, with few people in the area, when a shout went out from one of our Hierophants. An ancient demon named Lozz Nasae had returned from whatever hell pit it came from. <br>I gave a shout for other hunters to travel with me to the Swamp of No Hope, the last place the demon was spotted. Only two other souls were brave enough to face the foe. Sslarr, a warrior and Corvastiz, a beastlord. <br><br>When we got there, we greeted the Heirophant and learned that this was the demon who had murdered his mate years ago. We found the demon and it was obvioulsy much higher level than us three. Luckily, a high level shaman was in the zone and came to help us. Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be a barbarian! <br><br>The tension was palpable, but in the end, the greater good must be served so we decided to work with him. With his buffs and heals we were able to beat back the beast, and slay it. <br><br>When we returned the head of the slain beast to the Hierophant, I was rewarded with a Book of Rings, which is wonderful for a level 15 shaman. MY friends also received items, and a good time was had by all! <br><br>(GMs...we need more events! they rock)</blockquote>Thanks Nick!

The conference will occur in #afterhoc. <br><br>Never been to a House of Commons before? Basically it is a developer chat, where the gamers and the designers sit down. Players get to ask the game's developers their questions via a live moderator. The designers then answer the question in the chat. It's a tried and true format for finding out what is in store for your favorite Massively Multiplayer games.<br><br>To join the chat, first boot up your favorite IRC client. Two of the most popular clients are <a href="http://www.mirc.com" target="_blank">mIRC</a> and <a href="http://www.pirchat.com/" target="_blank">pIRCH</a>. Once your client has been started, access one of the follow Stratics servers by typing /server *.stratics.com:  (Replace * with one of the following servers) and type /join #afterhoc. <br><br>irc.stratics.dhp.com - USA - Pennsylvania <br>stratics.frws.com - USA - Colorado <br>riot.tac.net - CAN - Toronto <br>stratics.truefear.net - USA - Texas <br><br>Or, feel free to use our own Java client via your web browser. You can access the Java client via the lefthand menubar of <a href="http://chat.stratics.com.">http://chat.stratics.com.</a> Our client connects directly to your servers and even allows you to select which channel you wish to access upon startup. <br><br>Hope to see you all there, and spread the word!!<br><br>Torsten - Antarion - Urbas<br>Assistant Lead Even Coordinator</blockquote>Thanks Antarion!

Bandwidth, in simple terms, is how much information is passed from their servers to your computer and visa versa. Bandwidth is very expensive, so a large sum of a game's monthly fee goes towards the data transfer between you and the server, thus allowing you to play the game.<br><center><br><b>[ <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/mmog/stratics/december01/stratics23/" target="_blank">Volume 23</a> ]</b></center></blockquote></blockquote>Interested in seeing previous articles?

The success rate to make for a tinkerer not at a trivial level for a next higher gadget is about 50% - hence, twice the price. <br><br>Please take a moment to look at the items and prices for tinkered contraptions at the Tinkering Compendium at www.eqportal.com/tinkering. You may find something you've always been looking for this holiday season. <br><br>This is a great time to come out and support your tinkerers on Erollisi Marr and hire one or two to make newly discovered Luclin items: The event will improve the tinkerers experience making Luclin items with less failure. Rebreathers and aqualungs will be some of the featured gadgets available. <br><br>A master fletcher is requested to support by making as many shaped ashwood recurve bows as possible - you will be reimbursed 40PP for each bow by the respective tinkerer needing them for catapults. <br><br>Whether a simple fishing pole or a spyglass is your desire, your patronage is appreciated. Again, join in this tinkering station event and find out who some of the tinkerers are on our server. Be safe and see you there. </blockquote>Neat!

However I am noticing in every single town i have visited with the Luclin models turned on there are NPC's standing around with the old model look still. Not all of the NPC's are this way but say about 30-50% of Firiona and Rivervale are this way. Why is the client loading both version of models? Couldn't load time be decreased if it was only loading the new models and not both the new models and the old models at the same time?<br><br>Just a thought, and the old models are starting to bother me hehe. I very much like the new ones. <br><br>Thanks<br>clint</blockquote></b>That's not too hard to explain.<br><br>If you look carefully, you'll probably notice that the NPCs you see that have the old models are 'special' NPCs. For example, the Qeynos guards. This has to do with the way the old models work. Those NPCs are completely separate textures. They are not standard character models with the nifty Qeynos guard armor placed over it, they are complete and separate textures. In Firiona Vie I imagine that the old models you are seeing are the High Elf guards, in Rivervale it's probably them lil' guys with the funny hats. The same thing goes for them.<br><br>Because they are not standard PC models, they didn't get replaced by the new models. In a way they aren't any different than Orcs or fire beetles. So they didn't get a make over with Luclin.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Ahh.. That does explain it :)

        [ 11:43 PM PST ] -</b></font><font color="ff0000" size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        <a href="mailto:eqnews@stratics.com?subject=EQNews">Sparrowhawk</a></font>
        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The latest patch message is up! Read on:<br><br><blockquote>December 13th, 12:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br><b>** Texture Cache **</b><br><br>In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the ability to cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that your computer is doing when you load up the game or change zones is building textures and putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time you log in or zone the game has to create the textures you need and put them into RAM for use during gameplay.<br><br>This, obviously, takes a little time.<br><br>We have added an option that allows you to save that information to your hard drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.<br><br>This does have a few drawbacks. It will require a lot of hard drive space to store these textures. In the most extreme case it could use up as much as 1.5 GB of hard drive space, though this would be the extreme. It could, however, easily use 500 MB of space on your hard drive. And because writing all this data to your hard drive takes a little time, the first time you use this feature it will take a bit longer to log in.<br><br>The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your hard drive when creating the texture cache. This is to prevent any problems with a shortage of space on your hard drive. But it also means that you will need to have plenty of hard drive space free to use this option; 500 MB plus the amount needed for the texture cache.<br><br>Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your first log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as it writes these files to your hard drive.<br><br>The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and logged in to create the needed files, the game can then read that information directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating them each time you log in or zone.<br><br>What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings above those that are recommended. If the game suggests that you only use ten models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good idea to turn on more models. This feature will not change that. Those recommendations are based on the amount of RAM you have available and your video card. The hard drive cache does not effectively add RAM to your machine, it just allows the game to save time creating the textures that your existing RAM and video card use.<br><br>There are two ways to activate this feature. You can check the 'Texture Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the eqclient.ini file. To activate it, add the following line to the eqclient.ini file:<br><br>TextureCache=TRUE<br><br>This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings. The more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater the potential decrease in loading times you will see using the Texture Cache.<br><br>Remember: This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain that you have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option on. The more stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more space you will need.<br><br>We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM and a lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less benefit you should expect to see by using the texture cache.<br><br><br><b>* Patch Changes *</b><br><br><ul><li>Fixed a pathing problem in the waters of Acrylia Caverns</li><br><li>More fixes for face and hair issues: Most notably a bug with Erudite male hair color arrows changing the hair style instead of the color.</li><br><li>Fixed a problem that was causing the % to crash some people when using in tells.</li><br><li>Addressed several potential crash bugs.</li></ul></blockquote>Nice :)

For instance, were a dupe bug to find its way into game and get posted all over the web, we'd immediately shut the servers down while we correct the situation. Some might consider that knee-jerk, but it's necessary for advancement in the game to mean something. <br><br>The situation with the Grey is basically the same type of thing, though not as severe of course. It had to be addressed first to ensure the integrity and longevity of the game. Sure, after that we can sit down and determine what the best way would be. You might want to see what changes go in (some tonight) before making final judgements.<br><br>-Gordon</blockquote><b><i>Absor</b></i> then returns to the thread with the following post:<br><br><blockquote>Obviously the changes we recently made in The Grey have stirred up some conversation. This seems like a good opportunity to break down the design process a bit and to show you how and why we do these sorts of things.<br><br>First let me talk a bit about AoE groups.<br><br>There are indeed several places in the old world where such tactics are used, and used effectively. AoE groups have been around since the early phases of beta. There is nothing inherently wrong with such groups.<br><br>But as the designers of the game it is our job to avoid setting up situations where one tactic becomes far too useful. That's what happened in The Grey.<br><br>Until the changes, it was possible to use an AoE group to pull and kill an extreme number of NPCs (upwards of 50+) in an almost continuous fashion with a lower level of risk than was appropriate. There were, essentially, three factors that contributed to this, factors that don't exist all together in any other zone. The addition of the light blue experience-giving NPCs made more low-hit point NPCs available to give experience. The Grey had a rather fast spawn rate, increasing the pool of available experience giving NPCs over time. Also the NPCs in that zone were given very low resistances in order to make casters more appealing to groups in the zone.<br><br>Looked at individually, these three factors all seem like good things. During testing this zone worked as intended. But when exposed to AoE groups, these factors created a situation that made such groups far too efficient in this zone.<br><br>So we changed the zone somewhat. Reports of let me quote one comment sent in:<br><br><blockquote><b>"Good job! You broke the GREY for casters completely!"</blockquote></b>are exaggerations. Rather large exaggerations at that.<br><br>Here are the changes that have been made.<br><br>Increased the hit points of all NPCs in the zone 8% (yes, that's 8 more hit points for every 100 it had before).<br><br>Reduced the spawn rates on the NPCs in the zone. There are still plenty of NPCs in the zone, but it might not be possible to pull and kill 30 or 40 at a time at a fast rate anymore.<br><br>Increased the resistance of the NPCs to moderate levels. Where they were practically unable to resist spells before, they now can resist spells some of the time. Cold and Fire spells might get complete or partial resists half the time, doing full damage the rest of the time. The initial changes to the zone had the average monsters being quite resistant to magic based spells, and after looking at the results the magic resistance has been lowered to a more appropriate level. This change should allow people to snare and root mobs more easily in The Grey.<br><br>Additionally, a resistant monster was added to The Grey. The new Shimmering Rockfiend is highly resistant to fire and cold based spells, and adds a bit more danger to pure AoE groups. This is tempered by the fact that the Rockfiend is fairly rare, easy to see, and the soloing casters in the zone will learn to recognize his threat and avoid fighting him. If you are pulling 40 monsters to your AoE group though, chances are you'll pick up a Shimmering Rockfiend or two and have to deal with them.<br><br>This in no way makes casters completely broken in The Grey. It doesn't remove the ability to effectively run an AoE group in this zone either. What it does is reduce the effectiveness of pulling massive numbers of NPCs and wiping them out with an AoE group. And the zone is still very workable for the balanced experience group, as well as soloing casters.<br><br>I wanted to set that straight. I wanted to clear it up primarily for those that have not experienced this zone before. Some of the rumors about how 'broken' this zone is are exaggerated, and I suggest that if you want to know how playable the zone is that you try it out rather than listening to rumors.<br><br>If further testing and play in the zone brings problems to light, we'll evaluate it and make appropriate changes. We want you to play in and enjoy our zones, and provide quality content for every class. We'll continue working toward this goal, and appreciate the insightful feedback we've gotten on this issue.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Any Thoughts on this?

Our host has been promising us that they will be correcting this problem since Monday morning. As of this writing the situation has not improved and yet they continue to assure us that something will be done. I have no higher priority <br>than to get this fiasco corrected and behind us. <br><br>We're doing everything in our power to see that happen. I hope you can remain patient. If not, that's understandable because I'm losing patience myself. But this is the first time we've had this type of situation hit since Stratics was started back in 1997. It is a temporary situation that will most assuredly be resolved and once it is, we'll be back to business as usual. <br><br>Regards, <br><br>Jhariden <br>Community Development <br>Stratics<br><a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a> <br>The Massively Multiplayer Network </blockquote>Just an update to this.. it appears that our host may have found the problem, and will be fixing it asap.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nulude Clobbersaurus of Druzzil Ro let us know about the possible discovery of a new zone! Read on:<br><br><blockquote>Last night, I was wondering through Shadeweavers Thicket when I came across an odd looking tunnel. Being the curious person I am, I decide to venture down, finding a few green mobs. I eventually reach the end of the tunnel, and find a big room filled with lava, with a rock path leading to a platform. On the platform are Firefall creatures (callers, guardians etc) and a named mob, guarding a tunnel slanting downwards behind it.<br> I hastily send a tell to my friend, Petercorbin, 57th Shaman, urging him to come quick. He does, and when he gets here, cons all the creatures blue (red to me heh) so he gets help from a nearby monk (also my friend) Goene of the 55th Circle, and Naldrin (hope I spelled it right??) 53rd Shaman. <br><br>We barely clear the room, but we took the mob (600dd, Dispells, Gates and Summons). He dropped nothing, very dissapointing after all that work. I get a fire resist buff and venture down into the pathway behind him, finding it filled with lava, and unsurpassable by myself (maybe a 60warrior with buffs etc could do it) so I start coming back out. As I do, I try to target a creature, the firefall, and the ring that surrounds the tunnel entrance replies "its locked and your not holding the key"...oooh...I thought, maybe a portal to the planes? a new dungeon with a dragon? so we stayed and slayed the firefalls some more (bout a 1min spawn time each) to no avail. I left heh, they're still in there I bet, tryin to get that key.<br><br>Nulude Clobbersaurus<br>Monk of the 35th Circle<br>Druzzil Ro</blockquote>Neat! Anyone have any more detail on this?

Although he cons indifferently to everyone, he does attack people. He has a heavy Dragon Breath, just the same as Gorenaire.  He conned even to a level60.  Within a few seconds we decided to move over to Dreadlands and show this dragon what happens if he messes with poor lvl35-50 in Dreadlands. We also knew that a level 60 dragon may not be really easy for the few of us.<br><br>We moved to Dreadlands and met a few hundred feet away from the dragon. He was looking very nice with his dark, almost black skin and the purple wings. He had serious similarity with Phara Dar.<br>We gathered around 12 members of our Guild and got around another 10 people that wanted to help. <br><br>Setting up 4 quick groups, we buffed and medded and got ready. Coloxion himself was well aware of our presence and started to move around a little. Soon after this we called the attack and a reasonable battle started. With an average of level53, one cleric and the mentioned people to help, we were just strong enough to slain him. Around 6 people survived. Quickly we rezzed and revived the dead people (since it was a GM-Event, the people did not lose experience).<br><br>The loot was estonishing! A Great Staff 2HB 9/36!<br><br>We knew (or hoped) there had to be more to come. But we did not know how much...<br><br>After a few minutes, the Lead GM Desilous appeared on us and congratulated us to our victory and handed out some VERY nice items.<br>The two persons that were holding position until we arrived recieved an item, the dragon slayer recieved one as well as the Raid Leader. He also let everyone roll twice and handed out an item to the winners.<br><br>The following items were given:<br><ul><li>Lodizal Shell Shield</li><br><li>Fungi Tunic</li><br><li>Another Fungi Tunic</li><br><li>Insigna Protector</li><br><li>Cloak of Flames</li><br><li>Another Cloak of Flames</li></ul>We were very lucky and recieved both CLoak of Flames, one for our little Warrioress Octavia and one for me (as Raid leader), which we in no way counted with.<br><br>All in all a very nice GM Event. Desilous managed to make a great battle with the dragon being just weak enough for us to slain him. <br>The items he handed out were astonishing and as mentioned, noone expected it in any way.<br><br>Great thanks and grats to this refreshing event!<br> <br>~ Taino the Earth Caller ~ <br>Guildleader, <a href="http://www.jollyjokers.com" target="_blank">Legend of the Jokers</a><br>Ayonae Ro</blockquote>Thanks Taino!

Read on:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><b><i>From Castersrealm:<br><br>"THE GREY GETS NERFED<br><br>The Grey zone in Luclin was patched live a short while ago.<br>Many mobs in there have had their resists significantly increased. Players are also reporting an increase in hitpoints on many monsters, and the addition of a new mob which is immune to Magic based spells. This can only have been done in response to the large numbers of AE groups which had been set up in the zone for fast exp gain.<br><br>So casters beware next time you hit the zone. <br><br>Submitted by Baelish, 6:27 PM EST"</i><br><br>Why is it that you always punish EVERYONE for the actions of a few??? I went there myself to check it out and it's true, not one ensnare landed, the necro with me didn't have one darkness land, including our epics (especially on the named critters), DD's didn't once do full damage, and DoT's were a pain to land.<br><br>This is getting really tiresome. Instead of just nerfing an entire zone like this, making snares impossible to land or nerfing magic damage, how about you take away the damn AoE spells causing such nerfs? Let's face it, spells like Pillar of Frost/Fire/Lightning (on the wizard side) and Lighting Strike/Blast (on the druid side) only get used for one purpose: TO QUAD KITE. They don't get used in groups, especially high end groups where keeping a mob mezzed on multiple pulls is most important. And they don't get used against single mobs.<br><br>It seems to me that this is the main source of the problem. A few people go out and quad like this to gain exp atleast 4 times faster than everyone else and the rest of us who don't get punished for it again and again. I was happily soloing 1 spawn at a time (since I can't seem to get a group at level 55) and was doing as well as the full groups of 5 and 6 who were dominating the pillars of the pyramid. Now, I can't solo a freakin skeleton or golem.<br><br>Now, as a Druid, I'd much rather see my quad kiting spells I never use go bye bye and be replaced by something more group friendly like more stuns, better healing, another DD line that's Magic or Cold based, anything that's alot more group friendly than these anti-social, spawn hog spells. And I'd like to see zones like The Grey go back to the way it was before you patched it with snares landing on everything (including named mobs) more often than NEVER (or almost never, I didn't land one but didn't get the "can't alter this mob's movement" message). <br><br>I'm basicly just sick and tired of getting nerfed on soloing single pulls because some schmuck decides to quad kite. It's bad enough I have to solo most the time because I can't find a group, I don't wanna have to suffer even more because of someone else's quad kiting.</blockquote></b>Well, we are not talking about quad kiting here.<br><br>No single group should be able to kill 40 or 60 experience-giving NPCs at one time.<br><br>I know this is a short answer for such a long comment, but really that's what it comes down to. We would rather not make such changes, but the situation in The Grey was too extreme to allow to continue.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>40 or 60? ... Sheesh.

Read on:<br><br><blockquote>This is just an update to move several things from the "not working" to the "Fixed" category and add a few to the not working category. Also added a tech tip at the end of the post.<br>We're still working on some issues and we've fixed others. Keep in mind that we have a bunch of people working on things, so most of these items are on the top of someone's list.<br><br>While some of these issues only affect a tiny portion of our customers, we want to give a full and complete rundown of issues we are aware of. We will be keeping you updated as things change. Also, check the patch messages for more information.<br><br>Fixed since release (in no particular order, by the way):<br><br><ul><li>Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)</li><br><li>Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die</li><br><li>Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent</li><br><li>Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.</li><br><li>/follow bug that caused folks to crash</li><br><li>Transparency issues with i810 display adapters</li><br><li>Crash bug related to root and gate</li><br><li>Various item and content fixes</li><br><li>Crash problems in certain zones</li><br><li>K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. Shadowhaven is one of those zones.</li><br><li>A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.</li><br><li>Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans</li><br><li>Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working</li><br><li>Slow framerate on some fast computers</li><br><li>Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor</li><br><li>A few people that dont have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing "Entering Luclin" when logging in and then crashing</li><br><li>A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game.</li></ul>Stuff in the works, some of these will be fixed with the next patch (again, in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them):<br><br><li>Reducing loading and zoning times</li><br><li>Crashes occurring for some people when logging in</li><br><li>Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character</li><br><li>Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users</li><br><li>Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.</li><br><li>Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated</li><br><li>Characters changing to wolf form look tiny</li><br><li>Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects</li><br><li>Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected</li><br><li>New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely</li></ul><i>Note:</i> Those without Velious should be able to access the Alternate Advancement interface by hitting the 'v' key.<br><br><i>Also note:</i> The inability to adjust gamma setting with some cards is an issue with cards that just don't support that ability. It's not really something we can fix in code. We are investigating to see if there are any possible workarounds out there for these older cards that are no longer supported by the manufacturer.<br><br><br><b>Tech Tip</b><br><br>- Pauses with <b>Win 98/ME ONLY</b>: A possible solution for those with a fair amount of RAM (technically, anyone with 128 megs or more) who are seeing pauses while the hard drive runs a bit, might benefit from this simple change (it's also easy to undo). It might also improve load and zone times.<br><br>Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file: ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1<br><br>For best results, change only this setting (don't change a bunch of other stuff at the same time) and see how it performs. And if it isn't better or seems worse you can just erase that line from your System.ini file. I should tell you that this change might make EverQuest better and it might also cost you some performance with your system overall, though this does not seem to be the case for most people. Keep that in mind if you decide to use this tip.<br><br>Thank you all for your patience. We are working hard to get these issues straightened out as soon as possible.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>He then returns to answer the following questions:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote><b>Can this Line be placed any where in the system.ini file? <br><br>Lineren_Wolfheart</blockquote></b>Place it in the section called [386Enh].<br><br>Also, you should check to see if there is already a line for this, and if so just change it from =0 to =1.<br><br>And I want to again emphasize that this is <b>only</b> for Win 98 and ME.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks again for the info <b><i>Absor</b></i>!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We received the following Wizards Faire notice from Dynamite Shortfuze of Fennin Ro.. Read on:<br><br><blockquote>Hail, Wizards of Fennin Ro!<br><br>I come before you once more, as I have in the past, with news of the Fennin Ro Rune and Language Faire! Wizards of all races and levels have come together in the past to share stories, drinks, food, and of course, Runes!<br><br>This month shall be no different: all are invited to attend, regardless of race or class! We did not have a faire at the end of November. It made no sense, as we decided to not have one in December (since everyone will be with their families and friends for the holidays). Instead, we will have one partway into this month of December, and the next will (hopefully) be held in January!<br><br>The rune trade is a simple concept: bring all your runes (used for wizard research) with you to the faire, as well as a list of all those which you need. If you have a rune that someone else needs, and you have no need of it, then give it to that person. Conversely, if you need a rune that someone else has, then it shall be given to you! It is a great way to gather all the runes you need for your research, as well as make new friends and get to know your fellow wizards! Since we began holding these faires on Fennin Ro, I know that I have made more friends than I can even begin to count, and as word spreads of the faire, that number is simply added to constantly!<br><br>The faire will be held at the Toxxullia wizard spires on Saturday December 16th, at 4:00 PM PST (7:00 PM EST). The rune trades will be conducted first, and once those are done, the language faire will begin. If you hope to get the runes you need, be punctual!<br><br>I myself will be unable to attend this month, as I will be away visiting family, but I am leaving the faire in the capable hands of my good friends and fellow wizards Saedyan and, if he can make it, Taedirk. These two have been to several of the faires and are quite familiar with the operation of them. They are completely capable of handling the faire I am sure, and I leave you confidently in their hands.<br><br>In the past, we have had people bring in some of their favourite treats for everyone to sample: we've had everything from Vodka to Gnome-Shaped Cookies! If you have something you're particularly fond of (I know Taedirk makes a delicious Lizard on a Stick), then by all means, bring it with you for all to share!<br><br>If you have some runes that you would like to have at the faire, but you cannot attend, then give them to a friend who plans to attend, or by all means, either contact me in-game or at <a href="mailto:fenninrunes@hotmail.com">fenninrunes@hotmail.com</a>, and I will be more than happy to see to it that your runes are at the faire. <br><br>Remember my friends, this is a community event; it is sponsored by no guild or group of people, just those who attend it. Please tell your guilds, your friends, everyone you know of the faire. We've had to cancel one faire due to lack of attendance, and I would hate to have that happen again. Remember, this is done for you, and it is you that must ensure it goes on.<br><br>Thank you again my friends. It is you who make the faire, it is you who are the faire, and because of you, the faire is magnificent. I hope to see you all come Saturday!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</blockquote>Thanks for the heads up Dynamite!

After installing the DirectX 8.1 upgrade and new drivers for my video and sound cards (NVidia 23.11, and the Soundblaster Live!  )  I ran DXDiag to see how it was working.  I consistently encountered an error in EQ, stating that "No 3D device Detected".  Also in DXDiag, the Direct3D test would fail when using the DirectX 8.  All the features (DirectDraw, Direct 3D, and AGP Aperture) were listed as enabled.  However, after digging on one of the boards, i found out that DXDiag is not reporting the status of the D3D.  If you hit the "Disable" button next to it, DXDiag reports that it is ENABLING the feature!  After you do this everything will work fine.  Just wanted to give everyone a heads up.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Lilweyen, on the Lanys Tyvl server</blockquote>Thanks Lilweyen!

Because of the high potential for duplication of items or even item loss when dealing with this kind of code, we've decided it was best to hold on to this feature until it was done. We plan to get it into the game as soon as we can. We decided that delaying the ship of Luclin for this feature, as much as we wanted to get it in, would be a bad idea because players often plan time off around the release of a new expansion and we didn't want to change the date and upset those plans.

Because we decided to make the new interface available to everyone, we had to make sure that it would work with all of the old commands. And since it wasn't a feature specifically for Luclin, we decided not to spend too much Luclin production time on its creation.<br><br>We also wanted to take the time to let folks try the interface and give us feedback before it is finalized. We just couldn't do that under the time constraints of producing Shadows of Luclin.<br><br>When we have a better idea when we'll be able to release the new interface, I'll let you know.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Hopefully it wont be too different :)

Then when I logged back in, I was on the old character model but with a NEW face! And on the old models I can't pick a new face so I will have to log all the way back out, turn the new model on, log in and try to guess which new face corresponds with my old face, log back out, turn on the old model again, and log in to see if I was right. Add to that the fact that I freeze up every other time I try to enter the character select screen, it could take hours to get my face back!! Arrgh!</blockquote></b>The old and new faces are linked. Each new face corresponds to an old face, ones that they were based on. So when your old characters are given their new models, they are given a face that was designed from their old face.<br><br>This also means that when you change your new face, you also change your old one. If you really want the old face back you just have to change the new face back to the one that matches your old face. So if you think that there is a chance that you'll want to revert to the old models, take a screenshot of your new face when you first log in with that character and change back to that face if you decide to use the old models. <br><br>But remember, in the near future we will be turning off the ability to change your face at will, so make your decision as early as you can.<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks again for the info <b><i>Absor</b></i>.

Bards are having trouble getting songs to start or to take hold.<br><br><i>Group Buffs</i>  there is a problem that seems to be preventing anyone from casting group buffs.<br><br><i>Crashing when Zoning</i>  some zones are causing some folks to crash and not be able to get back to play with those characters.<br><br><i>Bolt Spells</i>  some spells are not displaying their effects.<br><br><i>Mouse pointers</i>  something is up with mouse pointers. For some they get an extra, others get none.<br>- NOTE: Changing resolutions seems to fix this problem for some people.<br><br><i>Intel 810 and ATI Rage cards</i>  and possibly others, are displaying 'black boxes', often where a texture should be transparent.<br><br><i>/facepick</i>  sometimes after changing your face it doesn't stay changed.<br>- NOTE: This seems to be an issue with folks wearing helmets when making the changes. It might help to remove helmets before changing faces. It might also help to zone once before putting that hat back on.<br><br><br>I'm sure there are other issues being fixed right now, but those are the ones I have at hand.<br><br>I also have a few tips and suggestions for folks. But first I want to respond to this:<br><br><br><blockquote><b><i>-Cragganmore- wrote:<br><br>The back of the Luclin CD states: ADDITIONAL LUCLIN SURCHARGE REQUIRED. Is there some new monthly charge associated with EQ that has not been announced before? I have read all the web sites and do not recall seeing anything about this.</blockquote></b>There is no extra surcharge required to play Luclin. I honestly don't know how that got on the CD case, but it's not true.<br><br>And what are you doing reading the back of your CD case anyhow :)<br><br><br><b>Tips and reminders</b><br><br><br>DirectX 8.1 is required to play EverQuest. I wanted to make that clear. Problems like "No 3D devices found" and many others can be fixed by upgrading to DX 8.1. Run DXDiag.exe and make sure the version says "DirectX 8.1 (4.08.01.0881)".<br><br>For those using NVIDIA cards, the 23.11 drivers have proven to give much better performance in EverQuest. You can find a link to them here on our driver support page.<br><br>Clipping Plane! Remember, you can pull in your clipping plane if you are having problems with your framerate.<br><br>Choosing which models to load. Ester asked me to make sure that everyone understood that when we talk about going to the "options" to choose which models to display, we mean the options BEFORE you log in, not the options in game. This is done before you log in because it has to know what models to load before you log in.<br><br>Another tip for the more advanced computer user  It might be a good idea to turn off your swap file, run a defrag and then turn your swap file back on. It's nice to have an unfragmented swap file. If you don't know how to do this, then don't worry about it. :)<br><br>Oh! And, yes, there is a typo in the printed manual that comes with the game. I apologize to all of the budding young makeup artists out there for calling you Rouges rather than Rogues. :)<br><br>Alan</blockquote>Thanks for the updates <b><i>Absor</b></a>!

Our host was notified the minute the problems began and the word is that we are sharing a busy switch in the data center with another site. Our servers will be moved off of that switch on to our own switch tomorrow. At that time the slowdowns should be alleviated.<br><br>We've done absolutely everything in our power to get this matter resolved as quickly as humanly possible. No one is more frustrated about this situation as I am. I hope you all can remain patient just a little bit longer. We really do appreciate it and also apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you.<br><br>Warm Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Community Development<br>Stratics<br><a href="http://www.stratics.com">http://www.stratics.com</a><br>The Massively Multiplayer Network</blockquote>Frustrating is the perfect word..

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The New Patch Message!<br><br><blockquote>December 4th, 6:00 am<br>------------------------------ <br><br><b>*** Welcome to Luclin *** </b><br><br>"As you know, youngster, we of the League of Antonican Bards have made it our primary goal to travel to places before others. It is our duty to see what hasn't yet been seen and to make song of it when we return. We carry news, song and spirit to all of Norrath. We have also taken it upon ourselves to carry personal news in the form of letters wherever possible. And that's what I've called you here to talk about. <br><br>... <br><br>No, I am not assigning you the duty of establishing a mail route into Grobb. We've lost far too many young bards trying to do that. Recruitment of smart young lads and lasses is nearly impossible when they all think that we plan to send them out to become bard fillet. We've only been able to recruit youngsters that no other guild wanted because they were so... <br><br>... <br><br>No, of course I don't mean you. <br><br>Now stop interrupting. <br><br>I have a job for you. You know, don't you, that Al'Kabor has once again been clomping about using his powerful magics without much regard for consequences, don't you? <br><br>... <br><br>/em sighs. <br><br>Ok, your FIRST task is to read up on current events! () <br><br>Your second task is to find out if the rumors about his recent experiments are true. They say (and "they" are pretty reliable) that things such as noble-looking Kerrans calling themselves the Vah Shir, strange beasts of burden and new spells and songs have started showing up on Antonica. They also say that this is all due to the experiments of that Erudite Wizard Al'Kabor. You are to head out to one of the great wizard spires and investigate. If you can, interview one of these cat people and bring us back one of these horses they talk about... <br><br>... <br><br>Maybe you should talk to my assistant about things like directions out of the city and where you can find some shoes more appropriate for travel." <br><br>All this you overhear as you wait outside for your turn to talk to the loremasters of the League of Antonican Bards. <br><br>The door opens and you see a dejected and confused looking young bard step out. Following him out the door you hear a bellow, <br><br>"I also expect you to let everyone know that we are NO LONGER trying to establish mail routes to Grobb! Trolls can't read very well anyway." <br><br>Shadows of Luclin opens up new adventures and new challenges, as well as new rewards for those with a spirit of adventure. <br><br>Are you up to the challenge? <br><br><b>*** Notes for Shadows of Luclin customers *** </b><br><br>IMPORTANT: do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs. Because of the immense amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not be able to just copy the executable file into a new directory and download the rest of the expansion. We have placed restrictions on the amount of data that customers can download from our patcher so that massive patching as a replacement for reinstalling from the disk will not impact our other customers. So if you have a hard drive problem or you wish to install EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have your CD to do so. <br><br>TECH SUPPORT: Please visit our Tech Support Center at if you have any problems with your Luclin installation. <br><br>/facepick - this new command will allow those of you with Shadows of Luclin to change your characters face. It will only work for characters using the new models. If you've turned off Gnomes and your character is a Gnome, you will not be able to use this command on that character. And it will, obviously, only work for those with Shadows of Luclin installed. <br><br>/dismount - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so using the bridle. There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a horse. <br><br><b>*** Other Changes with this Patch *** </b><br><br>Along with our preparations for the introduction of Shadows of Luclin, we have made a few other changes with this patch: <br><br><b>** Gameplay Changes ** </b><br><br>- Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom scores, as well as that granted by items and spells. <br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing rogues to critical with every use of a thrown weapon. <br><br>- Fixed a bug that caused the experience bar to displaying incorrectly after leveling. This also seemed to cause a crash in certain cases when in F10 view. <br><br><b>** PvP Changes ** </b><br><br>- PVP looting will now display to the group. <br><br>- Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy player, they will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses. <br><br>- Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest faction). But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a fight. They will only come to the aid of people that they like. Otherwise they will not get involved in PvP combat. <br><br><b.** Item Changes ** </b><br><br>- Etched Peridot of Nature will be removed from all locations, including those held by players on their characters or in their banks. This item was not intended to be available until Shadows of Luclin went live, and then only in Luclin zones. <br><br><b>** Spell Changes ** </b><br><br>- Spells that heal less than 10 points of damage will not generate a message to the player. <br><br>- Velious portal teeth (Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) are no longer required to teleport to those locations. These items are also no longer soul bound. <br><br>- Fixed a bug with the Bard Song of Occlusion <br><br><b>** New Commands ** </b><br><br>- /stand now implemented. We've added this command because not everyone speaks programmer and would think that the logical reverse of /sit would be /sit off. :) <br><br>- /particledensity command - Switches particle density on the fly without having to click it in the menus and exit the game. <br><br><b>** Some new things you'll see ** </b><br><br>- We now have the ability to flag an NPC as non-targetable. This in effect renders the NPC non-attackable as well. Clicking on one of these NPCs will cause your current target selection to clear. This functionality is used primarily for the presentation of content. For instance, if we want an NPC to spawn and tell you a story, he can tell his story without being attacked mid-sentance by other players. It also opens up some pretty interesting content avenues. As an example, we can make NPCs unharmable until you do a quest "stripping them of their power". <br><br>- There are several new item classes (types) in the world. For example, there are weapons that do enhanced damage versus certain races (e.g. Perhaps you'll find a +2 vs froglok sword, or a +4 vs Bear club. In addition we can do the same type of thing with types of creatures (+3 vs humanoid, +1 vs Undaed). We've also added elemental modifiers (e.g. a +4 Fire sword). The bonus value is calculated as and increased DMG stat on the weapon, except that the elemental portion is run through the resistance system before calculating the strength of your hit. There are some items out there with bonuses to some more interesting stats, but we'll leave it to you to figure them out :) <br><br>- There's a lot more out there. Be prepared to reevaluate your assumptions and redefine the way you approach the world. Proposed solutions to situations and quests that you might have previously written off saying, "They can't do that in EverQuest", might be exactly the way you need to approach the problem at hand. As fellow gamers, we envy you as you approach Luclin and find everything fresh, new, and waiting to be solved. And to those of you who aren't first to solve the quests or adventure in the new areas, we urge you to do so with your friends, and leave the spoiler sites out of it. Good luck on your journies. <br><br><b>** Note on New Features ** </b><br><br>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin contains many new features which have yet to stand up to the scrutiny of 400,000 experienced players. Without doubt there will be some situations where we need to reevaluate the gameplay-impact of some of those features and adjust them accordingly to maintain game integrity. As an example, we think that they might accelerate and decelerate too quickly, but will have to wait until we see them used by a broad spectrum of players before we can make a final determination. We thank you for your patience in these matters. <br><br><b>** Note on Impending Features **</b><br><br>As we approached our launch date we found that several features which are planned are also not yet ready for prime-time. We're currently working on the following items, many of which will be implemented in the very near future: <br><br>- Extra flora in outdoor zones. Sprigs of grass, small bushes, flowers, etc. <br><br>- A robuste merchantile system in the bazaar that lets you flag yourself as a merchant, set prices, and conduct business without having to conduct business manually with each buyer and seller. <br><br>- We will be polishing up issues regarding tinted items in game. In other words, things that shouldn't tint with a tinted item (e.g. your skin) won't tint when the feature is complete. <br><br>- Light beards on high elves, dark elves, half elves, and dwarf females will be tintable along with the hair color. We are going to leave in the ability for you to change your appearance until after we've added more customization options. <br><br>We thank you for your patience and patronage as we implement these features. Good luck with your adventures on Luclin! <br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote>Any Thoughts? Click Below to Let us know!

Does your guild lack a place where you can communicate with each other off line and keep a long-term history? Or perhaps you've wished you could use the Stratics Forum software for your own guilds forums...<br><br>Well now you can!<br><br>EverQuest Stratics is proud to provide <b><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/forums/guilds.html">Guild Forums</a></b> to users in need!<br><br>These forums are provided so that your guild can have a set of their own forums for both public and private use!<br><br>Simply <b><a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/guilds/everquest/newuser.pl?Cat">register* your account</a></b> with our forums, and then post a request for your very own Guild Forums in the <b><a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/guilds/everquest/postlist.pl?">Guild Creation Request</a></b> forum (instructions and guidelines are listed there). *(Current EQSS forum users will need to register a new account as the user database is completely unique.)<br><br>You can have one public forum and one or two private forums (members and leadership) for your Guild's exclusive use. You tell us who should have access to your private boards and we'll take care of it. (Public forums can be read and written to by all.)<br><br>Now you can maintain a history, discuss recent events, or just chatter away in your own private guild forums right here on Stratics! And don't forget that your guild can also have its own <b><a href="chat.stratics.com">Stratics IRC</a></b> registered guild channel for real-time chat online when not in game! Great for coordinating tactics while camped out to preserve buffs!<br><br>Check it out!

To clear it up:<br><br>The GraphicsDLL setting in your EQClient.ini file should read "GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.dll" regardless of what server you are playing on or what version of DirectX you are running. If you are having problems getting in to EverQuest, specifically, problems crashing prior to reaching character select, please check and set this entry in your EQClient.ini as necessary.<br><br>Also, as a reminder, all EverQuest subscribers will need to have DirectX 8.1 or better installed on their system in order to play beginning Tuesday morning. The latest version of DirectX can be found at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</a>.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote>Understood!
