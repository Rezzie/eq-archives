                      thousands of years ago the world known as Norrath was &quot;noticed&quot; 
                      by Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon who rules the Plane 
                      of Sky. Pleased with the conditions on Norrath , Veeshan 
                      deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious. 
                      Then, with one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened 
                      several great wounds on the surface of Norrath, thus staking

                      and endless tunnels, Brell Serilis quietly created a magical

                      the Duke of Underfoot secretly seeded the underworld of

                      The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord were 
                      in attendance. Brell, carefully avoiding all queries as 
                      to the origins of his information, told of Veeshan's discovery 
                      of a new and potentially powerful world in which she had 
                      deposited her brood. Words befit of the King of Thieves 
                      poured forth from Brell's lips. He proposed and they accepted 
                      an alliance of sorts, ignorant of the fact that Brell too 
                      had already released some of his creations into the Underfoot 
                      of this new world. The planet that would come to be known 
                      as Norrath was divvied up between these beings of power 
                      for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in check. Each 
                      would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and 
                      keep a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell 
                      claimed the bowels of the planet and created the Dwarves, 
                      stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of Norrath. 
                      In the abysmal depths of Norrath's oceans Prexus left his 
                      children, the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental 
                      power. But is was on the surface of Norrath that Tunare's 
                      creation of the Elves, creatures whose limitless grace and 
                      beauty was only exceeded by their mastery of magic, drew 
                      the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a 
                      decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the 
                      Plane over which he rules, Innoruuk waited, stoking the 
                      fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed 
                      his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and 
                      vowed to make them regret this disrespect. From the halls 
                      of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, The Prince of Hate 
                      snatched away the Elven King and Queen. In his realm of 
                      pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and 
                      mentally, over the course of three thousand years. He then 
                      gathered the quivering pieces of these beings of light and 
                      rebuilt them in his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery 
                      of Tunare's noble children. In depositing The Teir'Dal, 
                      as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, 
                      back into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds for The Prince

                      three thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy. 
                      Mankind dwelled in the center of Antonica, spreading out 
                      slowly to inhabit the vast and fertile plains of Karana. 
                      Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching the size 
                      of towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos to the west, 
                      and Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain 
                      of the elder races who watched from afar, was strong -- 
                      it rapidly gained a solid foothold in the world of Norrath 
                      and was there to stay.</em></strong></font></font></p>

                      This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. 
                      Early on small groups formed, some linked by similar appearances, 
                      others by common goals. Competition was fierce, and when 
                      resources grew scarce for one reason or another many groups 
                      abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. 
                      A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the 
                      masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. They 
                      had broken away from the lands of Halas and their barbarian 
                      brothers in the name of peace, and these leaders insisted 
                      that humanity adhere once again to those principals to which 
                      all had agreed.</em></strong></font></p>

                      Their cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. 
                      Villages were encouraged to trade with one another and to 
                      respond to competition nonviolently. An economy based largely 
                      on agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns 
                      were surrounded by large farms. Most of humanity&#146;s 
                      leaders were pleased with this, wanting nothing more than 
                      peace and food on every man&#146;s table after a hard day 
                      of work. A few, however, wanted more. Even though their 
                      people had risen well beyond the standard of living endured 
                      by their barbarian brothers to the north, they were not 
                      content. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with 
                      tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as 
                      well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few 
                      even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the 
                      mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders 
                      heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.

                      this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly 
                      became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving 
                      a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud&#146;s 
                      followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet 
                      of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren 
                      coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited 
                      and quite appealing to the council and their people. They 
                      quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost 
                      every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost 
                      entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within 
                      it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High 
                      Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, 
                      and other artifacts brought to them by their spies. The 
                      first human mages were then born &#150; wizards, sorcerers, 
                      and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew

                      He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small 
                      but growing group of outcasts who often studied forbidden 
                      texts and other knowledge generally kept secret from the 
                      majority of students. The council was morally and ethically 
                      opposed to much of the information gathered afar by their 
                      spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied 
                      the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called 
                      Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant 
                      underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark 
                      elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing 
                      this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful 
                      magic, created for himself four identities, four separate 
                      countenances and names, and joined all four schools without 
                      the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that matter.</em></strong></font></p>

                      It came to pass some years later that the council, in its 
                      ever growing desire to know all there was to know, both 
                      in distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the 
                      group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great 
                      conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, 
                      the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely 
                      dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from 
                      back on the mainland. But there was one very significant 
                      difference &#150; they did not use swords and bows, but 
                      rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the 
                      hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, 
                      and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, 
                      to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus.</em></strong></font></p>

                      Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind 
                      to the implications when the conflict began. He left the 
                      heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth 
                      identify and siding apparently with the council. But this 
                      was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every 
                      artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left 
                      Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the 
                      city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only 
                      to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul 
                      grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed 
                      far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid 
                      the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself 
                      near the great lake called Winter&#146;s Deep and he hid 
                      there for some time.</em></strong></font></p>

                      While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He 
                      schemed and planned, and looked over every letter of every 
                      scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and 
                      his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied 
                      and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away 
                      at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel 
                      long distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. 
                      His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of 
                      Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false identity 
                      and countenance and traveled the lands of men. </em></strong></font></p>

                      Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, 
                      Miragul soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, 
                      and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people 
                      and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures 
                      grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision 
                      to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent 
                      life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range 
                      of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually 
                      came to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and was not 
                      until centuries later referred to as merely the Frigid Plain. 
                      This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul&#146;s 
                      heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge 
                      and the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. 
                      Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and 
                      slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as 
                      little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst 
                      them when absolutely necessary. </em></strong></font></p>

                      Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created 
                      a large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and 
                      study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep 
                      magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, 
                      passage after passage, he did create to house his store 
                      of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out 
                      in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, 
                      returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling 
                      with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories 
                      he had created. </em></strong></font></p>

                      Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even 
                      though he did his best to extend his life using magical 
                      means. There was a limit to his enlightenment when it came 
                      to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he 
                      would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being 
                      no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. 
                      As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#146;s 
                      time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more 
                      studying the existential. He soon discovered the various 
                      hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of 
                      Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could 
                      traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. 
                      But his strength was leaving him, and his journeys into 
                      these realities were short and often unprofitable. More 
                      and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, 
                      and the specter of death haunted him daily.</em></strong></font></p>

                      a foundation he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries 
                      before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became 
                      Miragul&#146;s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means 
                      by which to create portals within his own plane and made 
                      them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled 
                      back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the 
                      other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed

                      The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built 
                      a city into a great hole that led to unknown depths beneath 
                      the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that 
                      huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. 
                      The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed 
                      Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant&#146;s 
                      trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a 
                      select few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge 
                      for knowledge, power for power. They revealed to him the 
                      true power of necromancy, the ability to raise the dead, 
                      creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their 
                      master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with 
                      vast armies of undead, to wreak revenge upon the council 
                      that had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past.

                      One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, 
                      the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared 
                      endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover 
                      a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic&#146;s 
                      goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping them raise 
                      their undead army. All the while, however, he was experimenting 
                      himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he 
                      was given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that 
                      which he had sought, a way to transform a living being, 
                      as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, 
                      time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, 
                      his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost 
                      ready to make war once again. </em></strong></font></p>

                      Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his 
                      dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache 
                      hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew 
                      silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his 
                      final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless exploration 
                      and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. 
                      The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, 
                      and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the 
                      phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other 
                      necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then 
                      dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, 
                      an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called 
                      a lich.</em></strong></font></p>

                      formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#146;s soul, 
                      now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, 
                      retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge and 
                      power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human
