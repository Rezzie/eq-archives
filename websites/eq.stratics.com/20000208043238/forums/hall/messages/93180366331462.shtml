First of all, don't do it again.<p>But I have 2 accounts and 2 pc's at my house (My brother and my dad both play and it's the only way we can all live together peacefully)  But sharing 2 accounts among 3 of us and switching back and forth between the comps, what you described there has happened to me 3 times.<p>And I thought about it...  What happens when you are disconnected and then log back on before you character is logged out by the server.  As far as the server is concerned, you are doing the same thing.  Now I know it detects when you are linkdead (or tries to), but that is not perfect.  So, I would guess it sends out that message every time that you connect and you character is still logged in.  If you have been disconnected, then no one gets the message.  If you are trying to share an account with a friend and were the victim of bad timing, it scares you (and it did - so it works)<p>Why did you appear right where you brother was?  Well when you are disconnected from your ISP and your character remains logged in, if you reconnect quickly it will dump you straight into that characters current location as soon as you make a server selection (bypassing the character choice screen as you described) because it still detects that character logged into the server.<p>If they were really detecting the cheating.  They would most likely display on both ends.  The way they have it set up now, it's just a scare tactic for people doing what you are doing :)<p>The morale of the story is, they don't want people doing what you did.  Be careful, but don't worry too much.  I've had the message 3 times, so I'll get in trouble first ;)<p>NOTE: After the first character gets the message, they remain in but are not saved any more.  I suspect they are pulled from ther server at that point and are operating and moving around on the client side only.  Not wishing to cause any trouble, I haven't checked this.
