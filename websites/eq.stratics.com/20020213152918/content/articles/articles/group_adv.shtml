                  <div> Well, it seems that many people have read <a href="../unknown/group_com.shtml">Intermediate 
                    Group Combat</a>. If you haven't, you need to, as it the only 
                    'prerequisite' for this document. In that document PPI covered 
                    the absolute basics of group combat, including analyzing the 
                    function of each class in a party and basic skills for each 
                    class to pay attention to. 
                    <p> In this document, we're going to extend and move into 
                      more advanced territory, primarily to do with complex interactions 
                      between parties and enemy monsters. 
                    <p> Some examples of things that can go seriously wrong while 
                      in a party: 
                    <ol>
                      <li> The party has two people scouting for enemies and suddenly, 
                        they _both_ yell "Incoming!!" and charge back with big 
                        yellow monsters on their tail. 
                      <li> As a caster, you are meditating, and suddenly you see 
                        your parties health bars dropping... ALL of them. 
                      <li> The party sees a group of monsters, and someone mentions 
                        an attack... and immediately, half of the party runs directly 
                        into the midst of the enemies and begins slashing indiscriminately. 
                      <li> You are in charge bringing a monster back to an ambush, 
                        when... low and behold... the entire party has decided 
                        to head back to town for supplies, leaving you with a 
                        new friend and no party favors. 
                      <li> You come back with the next kill hot on your tail only 
                        to find the rest of your group has engaged some wandering 
                        creature nearby without telling you, leaving you to hope 
                        they finish the other in time to save you from whatever 
                        you brought back. 
                    </ol>
                    These are all serious group no-no's (just a few of many). 
                    Most often they occur because there is a lack of a basic party 
                    of any good group. Communication. Without good communication 
                    skills, your party is effectively acting as a bunch of solo 
                    characters who just happen to be fighting the same enemy (and 
                    that's if you're lucky). 
                    <p> Most good groups have a designated leader, who acts as 
                      a ringleader in a circus, directing the actions of those 
                      around him, while avoiding the lions and elephants and gnolls... 
                      Gnolls!? 
                    <p> However, sometimes groups will function perfectly well 
                      without a leader. This usually occurs when a group is comfortable 
                      with each other and knows their roles and what needs to 
                      be done. These groups will not usually have a leader per 
                      se but instead someone (usually a support character) who 
                      watches the battle from the outside and keeps everyone informed 
                      of what's going on. It is then this person's duties to back 
                      the group off so that they do not attract the attentions 
                      of wandering creatures that would endanger the group if 
                      they attacked. If you are in one of these groups, you're 
                      probably very familiar with a good majority of the rest 
                      of this document, but keep going, you just might learn something. 
                    <p> We're going to cover basic communication skills, leader 
                      responsibilities, and then a related bonus section on multiple 
                      enemy combat that uses most of these ideas.

              <tr> 
                <td><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2> 
                  <P><B><font color=050056>Communication</font></B> 
                  <div> Without communication, the party is doomed. Those things 
                    mentioned in the Introduction _will_ happen, and they will 
                    not be fun. Even in parties with good communications, sometimes 
                    bad things happen. Mostly because someone either wasn't paying 
                    attention, or because someone forgot to mention some action 
                    they were taking that could affect the other members of the 
                    party. For example, they were going out 'fetching', luring 
                    a monster back to the group for an ambush. Groups without 
                    a leader can be much less fun to play in because without someone 
                    to give direction you are more often than not left standing 
                    around waiting for someone to figure out what should be done 
                    next. (Note: this is different from 'natural' groups who don't 
                    require a designated leader) 
                    <p> While most online games have a barrier to communication, 
                      the keyboard, there are ways to work around this. Firstly, 
                      if you're working with a group of friends or some people 
                      you often group with, develop a shorthand that is easy to 
                      keep up with. Most of my groups have about five messages 
                      that are vitally important and also quick and easily abbreviated: 
                    <p> "OOM" (Out of Mana): For a caster, this is a _huge_ important 
                      message. Always give warning for both low mana (LOM) and 
                      for complete empty tank. If the party doesn't know their 
                      healer has no more heals, or that their wizard has no more 
                      mana for root or burn... well... someone is going to die. 
                      Good healers and burn support characters will be able to 
                      read their mana bar and call exactly how many shots they 
                      have left. It is more important for the healers. For the 
                      burn support characters LOM should suffice. 
                    <p> "INC" (Incoming): If a group is using the tentacle camping 
                      method (sitting in one place and reaching out and bringing 
                      monsters in), this is a key message, as it means that the 
                      designated fetch has found something and is coming in with 
                      it. A huge warning to prepare for combat (ie: stand up and 
                      stop meditating or healing). 
                    <p> "[Name] Back out": Get out of melee with the mob. There 
                      are others that can take the damage. Sometimes people just 
                      don't realize they've just been mangled (lag or just plain 
                      blindness, I never miss 'YOU have been mangled for 50!' 
                      messages but that's just me). If the leader keeps an eye 
                      on health and directs combat movement, it greatly simplifies 
                      the jobs of other party members (though it adds to the leader's 
                      responsibilities). 
                    <p> This command is the most often ignored. Many times it 
                      is because the person loses the message in the scrolling 
                      text and other times they just wand to get a couple more 
                      hits in. It is the party's job to be watching for the leader's 
                      commands and a lso the calls from other party members. Make 
                      sure you pay attention. If you think that you should get 
                      just one or two more hits in before stepping out DON'T. 
                      Your leader (if competent) has good reason to call you out. 
                      Step back immediately. If it is because you were getting 
                      low on health step back and sit down for 3 combat rounds 
                      at least. This gives the party's healers ample time to attend 
                      to you, and also makes the monster less likely to attack 
                      you when you rejoin combat. 
                    <p> "MR?" (Mana Report): Just something that all casters should 
                      get in the habit of announcing. It allows the leader to 
                      effectively judge the relative 'power' the party has left, 
                      both in terms of healing and in terms of direct burn. A 
                      good leader always knows what the mana levels of party members 
                      is, and if he/she doesn't, ASK. 
                    <p> "Rest": Pretty straightforward. The party is mangled and 
                      needs to camp out. Should only be mentioned when the party 
                      is not in any direct danger nor is sitting on somewhere 
                      that could become dangerous (ie: spawn point). Again, it 
                      is the leader's responsibility to find a safe place to call 
                      this.

                  Leader</font></B> 
                  <div> Well... either you are one, you've been one, or you will 
                    be one. Regardless of how good or bad you are at playing EQ, 
                    it is likely that you will eventually be called upon to lead 
                    a party. If you are decent at it, you'll garner some respect 
                    and likely get to be leader more often. If you get the group 
                    smoked... well, let's just say that finding a group might 
                    be more of a problem than leading one. 
                    <p> Experience makes a leader. The leader would have never 
                      gotten to that point if he had not made a few mistakes and 
                      learned from them along the way, though. Make sure if you 
                      do make a mistake to admit that you were wrong and try to 
                      make up for anything that may have happened as a result. 
                    <p> The leader has many responsibilities, and actually doesn't 
                      have to be a front line combat type. I (Drew) play a Magician 
                      most often and have been designated leader quite often. 
                      I usually am no where near melee range (though I do mix 
                      it up as needed to save people who are hosed), and that 
                      helps me keep my mind clear while directing things. Just 
                      a personal preference, other leaders may have different 
                      experiences. 
                    <p> The following items should be considered the leaders responsibilities: 
                    <p> Finding the Enemies: 
                    <p> Whether the party is a roving band, or is doing the tentacular 
                      thing, finding the enemies is the leaders prime responsibility. 
                      For roving bands, it's amazing how often the leader turns 
                      out to be the tallest member. Merely because it's easier 
                      to follow a tall leader who doesn't disappear into the weeds 
                      (*snicker* halflings *snicker*). 
                    <p> Planning and Organization: 
                    <p> One of the leader's jobs is to keep everyone organized 
                      and aware of the situation and their role in it. This is 
                      important both in and out of combat. Keep the party together 
                      and make sure everyone knows the score. 
                    <p> A strong leader should be aware of your party member's 
                      abilities and limits. This includes a strong working knowledge 
                      of all of the spells and abilities of those members of your 
                      party. A good leader will direct the Bard to play the correct 
                      song for the situation, and have the Shaman cast specific 
                      spells to turn the odds, etc. If you are not very familiar 
                      with all of your member's skills, ask them and begin learning 
                      a little about classes aside from your own. 
                    <p> The leader should be adept at directing actual attacks 
                      during combat, as well as indicating the order of combat 
                      for multiple enemies (see Multiple Enemy Engagement section 
                      below for ideas). This is especially important when dealing 
                      with dangerous monsters with special attacks, or those that 
                      have friends nearby. It also is important in planning escape 
                      routes should your party end up with more on their plate 
                      than they can handle. 
                    <p> Loot order: 
                    <p> Though this may seem trivial, it is vital that the leader 
                      keep a close eye on loot distribution. If a member is getting 
                      shorted, it's likely that he/she will depart for other places 
                      soon. Never good to lose a party member to those sorts of 
                      things. Autosplit (when working) takes the edge off of this 
                      problem but players still enjoy that birthday surprise type 
                      feeling of looting a mob. Even if you are not following 
                      an order just make sure everyone loots on now and then. 
                    <p> A good leader will also keep their group hunting monsters 
                      that are both interesting and profitable. If you lead your 
                      group around killing things that you could have taken alone, 
                      people will bore quickly and leave the group to go fight 
                      by themselves. Group fighting is _the_ most efficient way 
                      to improve your character as well as being the most fun. 
                      A good leader will make sure this is extremely apparent. 
                      A bad leader can sour players' perception of grouping. 
                    <p> Combat Coordination: 
                    <p> This is where a good leader can make the difference between 
                      killing the enemies and getting the entire party killed. 
                      This is more of an art than a science and incorporates many 
                      skills. The main skill a good leader has is the ability 
                      to multi-task. This is because he/she must engage an enemy, 
                      while constantly surveying the situation for changes, and 
                      while directing other members of the party in actions. Often 
                      when I am leading a party I end up breaking my own rules 
                      of breaking off combat at 2 bubbles of health because my 
                      attention is rarely on my own hit points. Leading is very 
                      rewarding but also can be very risky. Your first priority 
                      is to keep you group together and alive and your second 
                      is to your own health. This does not mean you should be 
                      reckless, but good leaders will always take calculated risks 
                      for the party. 
                    <p> A very important skill for any leader is to know when 
                      to fight and when to flee. As the leader in combat this 
                      is your most important duty. If you are with a good party 
                      they will not run until the leader calls for the run. This 
                      means they are placing their lives on your assessment of 
                      the situation. Do not expect to achieve this until you have 
                      proven yourself a strong leader. When the situation is getting 
                      ugly you are better to call the run earlier than later. 
                      Waiting can be fatal, and if you are going to escape a bad 
                      situation, you should attempt to reduce the 'downtime' the 
                      party will have recovering. Heck, if you called it too early, 
                      you can always make another attempt. 
                    <p> While in larger combat, it is often good for a party leader 
                      to be familiar with and use the many 3rd person views to 
                      scan the area around the combat for possible dangers and 
                      to get a more 'removed', strategic view of combat. Some 
                      people prefer the overhead view, but I'm very much for the 
                      long distance shots of the combat, as they give ample viewing 
                      of the area around combat while still allowing a good view 
                      of combat. 
                    <p> Respect: 
                    <p> As a leader you must earn your group's respect. This is 
                      done by showing that you know what is going on are able 
                      to command the group to peak its efficiency. Respect will 
                      be gained in time through successful weathering of bad situations. 
                      It is in these situations that the leader is really put 
                      through their paces and when the group will become forever 
                      loyal or mistrusting and being ignoring commands. Don't 
                      ask people to do things that you would not do yourself. 
                      The battle described later in this document gained the leader 
                      some respect but if it had gone the other way he could have 
                      easily lost some of the loyalty of his group.

                  <div> Unless you are the leader of the party, it is your job 
                    to follow orders to the best of your abilities. Though that 
                    may sound like no fun, it truly can be cathartic to be 'The 
                    Tank' and know that you can and should throw yourself at the 
                    enemy. Or 'The Healer', who just watches health and makes 
                    sure no one goes negative. When a party member, your life 
                    is simplified greatly because you really have one or maybe 
                    two tasks to concentrate on. As long as everyone plays their 
                    part, the party will do very well. It is amazingly fun to 
                    be part of something larger; especially is that something 
                    larger is ripping through the beasts of the area like a scythe 
                    through wheat. 
                    <p> Following a part: 
                    <p> As long as your leader is competent, just relax and play 
                      the role you've been designated. Try not to do anything 
                      that would directly endanger the party, and use your skills 
                      to the best of your abilities. See the Grouping 101 guide 
                      for ideas and suggestions for each class. 
                    <p> As a member, it is your duty to provide information to 
                      your party leader regarding your status. Casters, periodically 
                      report mana; warriors, mention that you are out of food 
                      and water, or that you need to rest. These things make the 
                      leaders job a little easier and are appreciated. 
                    <p> Also, do not hesitate to inform the group about changing 
                      situations, including additional monsters, changes in health, 
                      or mana. It's never good to have additional monsters enter 
                      a fight, but it's worse if no one realizes they are there.

                  <div> Story time: Ok... your fetch has just announce that he/she 
                    has not one, not two, not three, but FOUR big yellow aggressive 
                    things (for example, Minotaurs). This is a bad situation, 
                    as your group has only taken one and occasionally two of the 
                    beasts. You can either panic and bug out, or you can try and 
                    fight the horrible odds. Let's follow an example party and 
                    see how they do against the monsters. This is told from Vogyd's 
                    perspective. 
                    <p> Leader: 
                    <blockquote> Teffo, L11 Halfling Cleric (Jim) </blockquote>
                    Party members: 
                    <blockquote> Zanith, L10 Human Paladin King, L10 Half Elf 
                      Bard Vogyd, L12 High Elf Magician (Drew) Adaemus, L11 Dwarf 
                      Warrior </blockquote>
                    We had all rested up after a combat with 2 of the beasts, 
                    when we hear, "Oh... that's bad." from Zanith, our fetch. 
                    He had been scouting looking for a minotaur or two in the 
                    middle of the area where they spawn... when all of them spawned. 
                    He high-tailed it out of there with four minotaurs on him, 
                    and informed us as to our fate. "4 incoming." We briefly discussed 
                    our options, and then decided to try to smoke them. 
                    <p> The Bard switched to a combat anthem, and we waited for 
                      the enemy to arrive. As soon as Zanith arrived, I dropped 
                      a Fire Shield on both him and Adaemus. With four enemies, 
                      that mana cost would easily be made up for in damage done 
                      to our tanks. Teffo began to heal Zanith, and then we began 
                      to melee the beasts. 
                    <p> After a few seconds, we realized this was going to be 
                      close fight as both of our tanks were below 50% health, 
                      and I began searching for a monster with lowest hps. This 
                      would be the monster that was being attacked by our warriors. 
                      Most of the monsters were slightly damaged (from the Fire 
                      Shields) and eventually I found one at half life. I then 
                      burned it down the rest of the way. Teffo began to heal 
                      Zanith and Adaemus while fighting one of the monsters he 
                      had engaged long enough to draw its attack onto himself 
                      and away from the damaged warriors. King had also drawn 
                      one onto himself and resumed his attack on the next one 
                      targeted by the party. 
                    <p> Quickly, the odds shift into our favor, as we have now 
                      a 5 vs. 3 advantage. Again, the warriors concentrate on 
                      one enemy, and I begin to fry the monster as it attempts 
                      to flee having dropped to about 20% of it's health total. 
                      While I am burning, the tanks are very low on hps, so Teffo 
                      backed out of melee to heal while the tanks switch to yet 
                      another enemy. After dispatching my runner, I step into 
                      combat to make sure that others have cover, as Zanith was 
                      near 20% (he backs out), and I take some hits from one of 
                      the mostly undamaged minotaurs (which quickly reduces my 
                      hps to half). Zanith is mostly restored by Teffo's spells 
                      and returns to combat. I back out, and dispatch another 
                      minotaur who had decided to try and leave the area (low 
                      on health) with a few spells. 
                    <p> I am now extremely low on mana, so I save the rest in 
                      case of an emergency and step into melee range of the remaining 
                      beast. Adaemus and Zanith quickly maim the enemy and we 
                      cut it down from behind as it attempts to flee. 
                    <p> Analysis: 
                    <p> This little story demonstrates many key events in good 
                      party dynamics. Primarily, it shows that with good teamwork, 
                      a party can take out groups of dangerous (yellow!) monsters 
                      very effectively as long as certain rules are followed. 
                    <ol>
                      <li> Concentrating attacks on one enemy removes it from 
                        combat, lessening the damage done to the party as a whole. 
                      <li> When engaging multiple enemies, make sure that they 
                        all are concentrated on players who can take the damage. 
                        Tanks. If a spellcaster becomes a target, the party is 
                        in big trouble as without the fire support bad things 
                        happen. Thus, in large combats, the spellcasters should 
                        stay out of combat as much as possible until things are 
                        less chaotic (ie: fewer enemies) and should NOT burn randomly. 
                        That is the surest way to draw an undamaged beast onto 
                        you. Bad mage. 
                      <li> Spellcasters should endeavor to finish weaker monsters 
                        off quickly. This allows the warriors to get on to more 
                        important business. Also is much safer for the spellcaster 
                        (as mentioned in #2), as the monster is already really 
                        angry at the tanks who did most of the damage. 
                      <li> Good communication. Zanith told the party what was 
                        going on well before bringing the enemies into range, 
                        allowing the party to have a good look at the situation 
                        before committing. Everyone responded to 'Back off' commands, 
                        and they also concentrated their attacks well on successive 
                        monsters. They all knew that I was finishing off the 'runners' 
                        so they could concentrate on the monsters in their face 
                        and not on the ones that would be coming back with friends 
                        after healing a bit. 
                    </ol>
                    Overall, this fight was one of the best I have been in ever. 
                    Everyone did their part and there was very little confusion. 
                    Everyone knew what was happening and trusted the other members 
                    to do their part. I hope everyone gets a chance to experience 
                    this sort of coordinated action at some point in their EQ 
                    career. It's nearly indescribably cool.

                  Planning</font></B> 
                  <div> Any time the group is considering attacking a group of 
                    monsters, or is being attacked by a group, it is imperative 
                    that the group concentrate their attacks (as we saw above 
                    in the story). When the aggressor in a combat, the party has 
                    the advantage of pre-planning which of the monsters is the 
                    'primary' target. There are a few logical ways to analyze 
                    the targeting order in a combat. 
                    <p> 1) Enemy spellcasters. These HAVE to die, or the party 
                      is hosed. Primarily, this is offensive casting enemies like 
                      wizards and necromancers. These are a parties worst nightmare 
                      in groups because sometimes you can't get to them and prevent 
                      them from casting spells. This also applies to those monsters 
                      with special attacks (stuns or drains and the like). They 
                      are also mush easier to take out because of their low hit 
                      points (hopefully!). 
                    <p> Tactics: Have _your_ offensive caster take them out preemptively. 
                      Usually, starting a fight by having your caster burn on 
                      the enemy caster is effective because then the enemy caster 
                      is occupied. The only problem is that all of the enemy casters 
                      friends are on their way to kill your caster too. That's 
                      where the tanks step in front and occupy them. It's not 
                      too difficult to distract a mob if you hit it in the head 
                      with a sword. Thus, the fight is now divided, casters on 
                      casters, and tanks on tanks. 
                    <p> Hopefully your tanks are taking out the enemies by concentrating 
                      their attacks. It is important at this stage to get a tank 
                      on the enemy spellcaster. Vital. Even having a tank with 
                      another enemy on his back while he attacks the caster is 
                      worth it. This is for one reason. Interruptions. If your 
                      tank can induce interrupts, and your caster is unaffected, 
                      the fight is over. The other caster is going to be eating 
                      sword and spells; that's never a good combination. An excellent 
                      tank for enemy spellcasters is a Monk. Lots of attacks means 
                      a higher chance of interruption. Also works with any higher 
                      level warriors types with dual wield or double attack (or 
                      both!). 
                    <p> 2) Weaklings. There are always a few lower level monsters 
                      in a group of enemies (at least you hope there are). These 
                      should be prime targets. Why? Because they have less health, 
                      and can be taken out quickly. Never underestimate the power 
                      of 2-3 green monsters will have on a fight with a blue one. 
                      The sheer quantity of hits can be deadly as well as the 
                      power of those attacks. 
                    <p> Tactics: Either target them first, or have your spellcaster 
                      pick them off with concentrated fire. 
                    <p> 3) Damaged mobs. As mentioned previously and similarly 
                      to the Weaklings... the sooner they're dead, the less damage 
                      they'll do. 
                    <p> 4) Runners. This is the most dangerous type of enemy for 
                      a party in a dungeon. If one mob slips away after being 
                      damaged in combat the leader might as well call for a mass 
                      retreat while everyone can still make it out. In a dungeon,a 
                      damaged creature fleeing from combat will run deeper into 
                      the dungeon calling every monster it finds to attack the 
                      party that nearly killed it. If it does not call red creatures 
                      that would kill your party outright, it will call enough 
                      weaker creatures to overrun your party in a brutal fashion. 
                      This is called a train. You don't want it. 
                    <p> Tactics: These creatures should be dealt with by the mages 
                      or one of the warriors if your party is lacking anyone who 
                      can cast burn. _Never_ let them go unless you want to see 
                      how ugly a dungeon can really get. 
                    <p> 5) Faction. Attacking some creatures will lower your standing 
                      with other races and mobs. As Drew or the dwarven guards 
                      of Kaladim might tell you, killing Crag Aviaks will lower 
                      your faction standing with many groups. In general, if you 
                      con the creature (hit 'C' while it is targeted) and it says 
                      that it 'looks at you indifferently' you are best to leave 
                      it alone or you are going to get in trouble with some faction.

                  <div> Leaders can be the savior or damnation of a group. Keep 
                    that in mind and pick your group leader wisely. Oh, and note, 
                    the person who forms the group doesn't have to be the leader, 
                    but it helps, because then they can control the group composition. 
                    If someone is being dumb, they should get punted, and having 
                    control over group composition can be just the sort of 'enforcement' 
                    needed.
