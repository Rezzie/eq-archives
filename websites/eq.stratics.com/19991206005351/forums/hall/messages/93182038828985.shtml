Did you perchance think to take a screenshot of Tork's rudeness?  At least this way perhaps you could have sent it to Verant and a corrective action taken.  Then at the VERY least you would have something to substantiate your claim that he was as rude as you say he was.  I suspect, and this is probably going to piss you off, but I don't care, that you were already aggravated that you had died and lost your stuff, and anyone would have seemed rude to you at that point.  I have dealt with several GM's and Guides and not ONCE have any of them been anywhere NEAR rude to me.  So I think that you are either exaggerating or you said something to piss HIM off...<br>And Bylops is correct-  when travelling into unknown territory, PUT YOUR STUFF IN THE BANK.  This is a given!  If you crash frequently on the boat, but your valuables in the bank before you cross.  If you know you may be travelling through a zone where you are KoS by guards, <br>( Nektulos, for example ) put your stuff in the bank!  Barbarians are not so barbaric that they KoS just anybody-  the worst they should have /conned to you was dubious.  I've seen Gnome Necros, who are decidedly evil, walk into Halas unmolested.  I hardly think a Bard of any race would have a problem.  This sounds really rude, but the more I listen to you, the less I feel sorry for you.  I had a level 20 friend lose all his stuff by foolishly /consenting a dishonest player.  We all ( we all being his friends ) worked together to replicate his inventory, and with the exception of a few items, had EVERYTHING replaced within ONE NIGHT.  equipping to level 5 would be CAKE.  So if you have a screenshot of Tork being rude, I would love to see it, and if you produce, I will take back everything I have said.  Until that time, though, I have to agree with Bylops.  <p>Gaelrond begins to cast a spell<br>Gaelrond feels protected from fire<p>Flame away!
