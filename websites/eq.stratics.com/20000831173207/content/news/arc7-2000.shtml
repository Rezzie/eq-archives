One of the most common suggestions is that we work actively to promote more rewards for playing the game in the preferred manner, and leave rewards as they currently exist for camping. <br><br>Unfortunately, doing that would require making playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable, which would in our opinion decrease the fun to be had from it.

Of course, many made it clear in the threads they they prefer camping over doing anything else in the game.

We'll of course have individual exceptions to the philosophy in both directions, but on an as-needed basis.

Should we reschedule this process in the future, we will again give fair warning prior to implementing the purge.<br><br>*Today's Changes*<br><br>Today's patch consists mostly of content changes within EverQuest, such as new quests, corrections to existing NPC texts, and adjustments to spawn times associated with quest NPCs and other NPCs in general.  <br><br>- /help will now display emotes, guild commands, and normal commands separately.<br>- /sit will cause your character to sit.  "/sit off" will cause your character to stand.<br>- "/cast #" (where # is 1 to 8) will cast the spell memorized in the corresponding slot.<br>- "/book #" (where # is the even displayed page number divided by 2) will take you to the corresponding page of your spell book. For instance, to flip to page 27/28, type "/book 14".<br>- "/doability #" (where # is 1 to 10) will fire the specified ability.  Abilities 1-6 are those that are set on the "Abilities" page; Numbers 7-10 represent those that are set on the "Combat Skills" page.<br>- /whotarget can be typed to do a /who on the targeted PC.<br>- "/language #" (where # is a number corresponding to the desired language) selects the chat language to use in general communication.<br>- "/language help" displays a list of available languages and their corresponding number.  "/language" alone displays the current language.<br>- /meditate causes you to sit down, open your spellbook, and begin meditation.<br>- In "HUD" mode, the Chat Box will now take advantage of higher resolutions to display more text before wrapping down to the next line.<br>- Fixed a bug that allowed users to /quit out of the game immediately without penalty.  Normal operation is supposed to cause /quit to leave the character in-game and linkdead for a period of time to discourage this action.<br>- Again changed the functionality of the "U" ("use") key.  It will no longer inspect players or loot corpses.  All other changes implemented in the last patch stand.<br>- Added new customizable color options to the EQCLIENT.INI.  The working documentation for this is below.<br>- Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges to "disappear" when the last charge was used.  The item never really disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging.  It no longer appears to disappear.<br><br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br><br> 1 - Say<br> 2 - Tell<br> 3 - Group<br> 4 - Guild<br> 5 - OOC<br> 6 - Auction<br> 7 - Shout<br> 8 - Emote<br> 9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - yell for help<br>28 - Hit for non-melee<br>29 - Spell worn off<br>30 - Money splits<br>31 - Loot message<br>32 - Dice Roll (/random)<br>33 - Others spells<br>34 - Spell Failures (resists, fizzles, missing component, bad target, etc.)<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings:<br><br>RunMode    - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>ScreenMode - NORMAL for the dafault window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br>Log        - TRUE for logging on, FALSE for logging off<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote><br>Discussion on todays patch can be found <a href=http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=373745&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5 target="_blank">here!</a> </font>

Why not make all pets be named after the character? NPCs have pets named after the owner. So, if your character name was Merlin and you summoned a pet, the pet would be called Merlin's Pet. It would be MUCH easier to buff player's pets if you knew which pet in the group was theirs.<br><br><font color="#a00000">There's a little more flavor in this implementation, not to mention, the conversation between people to determine who's pet belongs to whom isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Not to mention, it's been this way since release and has worked well. I doubt that we'll change this.<br><br><font color="#050056">2. Why do pets owned by PCs (not charmed but summoned) show up on tracking?  There is no usefulness to this and they should be filtered out. I know they are treated as NPCs, but that still does not answer my question. Even when you filter out players with "/trackerplayers off" they still show up. I would rather track players than player's pets. PLEASE remove them from tracking and make rangers, bards and druids happy!<br><br><font color="#a00000">They show up because they are NPCs. Regarding your suggestion of a filter, it's possible that we may implement something like that in the future.<br><br><font color="050056">3. The solution to making the tracking window more efficient is to simply add a scroll bar. A lot of people have said this for quite some time. Filters are not necessary.. just add a scroll bar that will show everything that is in the tracking range of the player.<br><br><font color="#a00000">We have some things in mind already for tracking, but thanks for the suggestion.<br><br><font color="#050056">4. When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we've had some other things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding chains, it's working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is that it doesn't work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn't necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we've determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<br><br><font color="#050056">5. Why are players allowed to remove coins from the trade window?<br><br><font color="#a00000">This is on the list. It amazes me the lengths that people will go through to scam each other. The sheer number of the reports of scams of this nature is astounding. GMs litterally spend 3/4ths of their day dealing with scams.<br><br><font color="#050056">7. The Play Nice Policies state that killing green mobs is "Not Playing Nice."<br><br><font color="#a00000">No they don't. Check the copy attached to the rules of conduct.<br><br><font color="#050056">8. While I do not play very often on a PVP server, I have been really wanting to lately. Perhaps its the fact that the BLUE servers are so crowded and more people are being less friendly. In any case, the one thing that keeps me from playing PVP now is the same thing that always has. There is no penalty for killing another player. There is a penalty for dying though. <br><br><font color="#a00000">Play on Teams server (VZ or TZ). Both servers sport faction penalties for killing other players. They are pretty severe. Usually within 4 or 5 kills you'll be KOS to the hometown of the target.<br><br><font color="#050056">My suggestion is to allow players to turn DROPPABLE items into NO DROP items through an NPC and make them unsellable<br><br><font color="#a00000">The way items work in EQ would not support this. The items are not objects in and of themselves, but rather a reference (by number) to a central database. That means that we can't set attributes such as nodrop on a per-item basis.<br><br>-Gordon</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=373704&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

Now that we can actually train in the skill, and the entire skill has been reworked, and the herb prices have been halved, there is some utility in the skill. I know a number of shamans as they approach level 32 start working on SoW potions. (Due to the severe alchemy skill/level cap, SoW [trivial:37] cannot be made trivially until level 32.) However, the alchemy population beyond that point is very, very small, even considering the class/level requirements. <br><font color="#a00000"><br>Wow, good thread. I'm glad that I finally happened across it. I'll forward the bugs that were mentioned to the testing team, and the ideas over to the guy who's handling the revamping of all of the trade skills. <br><br>To be honest, since Alchemy was one of the most recent ones to get a revamp, first for items and availability, and later for cost of produciton, it's probably not going to be at the top of the list for enhancements going forward. However we can probably make some headway pretty soon here on the bugs.<br><br>I guess we should also pop up the price of fish gill extract as well :)<br><br>-Gordon<br></font></blockquote><br> </font>

You will be able to use / commands and also navigate through the options menus to change the colors. I believe this has been stated at least twice before by me here on the boards. So the ini file is merely a configuration file for what you will be able to change in game. I could have easily chosen to make it a binary file in a proprietary format, but I chose the ini format because it was simpler to implement (good old Win32 API), and I knew that it could be edited easily (even if the keywords I chose were cryptic). <br><br>So I made the choice to implement the bare minimum in the ini file itself. If I had intended for the ini file to be the only way to change it I would have made it much more user friendly. <br><br>I've already explained why there had to be color changes in the process of implementing the custom color feature. To recap, if I was to leave all the text messages there original color but be editable, I would have to have hundreds of user colors to cover every message and it would be pretty unwieldy. I chose to group similar types of text together into classes. My original implementation didn't have enough text classes, so I have added several more. I apologize that I didn't have more in the beginning, but hopefully after this week we can all put this behind us. <br><br>The 2 new classes I added for spells (others messages, and failure messages) are user 33 and 34, and since you current ini files don't have them you will use the defaults (failures in red, and others in a darker blue then your own spells). Any new classes I add will be above 34 so you will get defaults instead of what was already in your ini file (like what happened for 26 to 32). <br><br>I also plan to get the "old default" colors and code them in as defaults so that you can delete your ini file and when it creates the new one it will be back to almost what it was before I did any changes. <br><br>- Rowyl</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=373073&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

This time it was decided that we would attempt to go into the deepest regions of Infected Paw, a place not many people hunt in, and one where most people never see what takes place behind the double doors. Slated to start at 7pm CST we had to delay it a bit in order for all interested parties to arrive. <br><br>Things started well and the groups were formed. We even managed to acquire 3 Enchanters to help us out. Once everyone was ready we readeied ourselves just behind the double doors and our puller cleared the way across the bridge. From there though, things got bad as a runner managed to get away and pulled the entire first half of the dungeon upon us. We fought valiently and two members of the raid were slain but in the end all the gnolls perished and their broken bodies littered the bridge. <br><br>Out of mana and low on health we were not prepared for what happened next. A local gnoll spawned on us and fell down into the area below the bridge. he ran all the way to where help could be found and pulled a good portion of the second half of the dungeon on to us. Beaten down from the previous fight we ran to the zone, taking casualties along the way. <br><br>As we prepared to go back in, I experienced sever connection problems and went Link Dead. No matter how hard I tried I could not get this problem to go away and when I finally was able to log back in I was forced to forgo my postion as leader of the raid. No one else wanted to take it over, so with an apology to everyone who attended, we disbanded the groups and went our seperate ways.<br> <br>I would like to list and thank everyone who participated in this excellent (albeit short) raid into Infected Paw. This being the first multi-group raid for many, very little mistakes were made and even at first when things went bad, we only had two casualties out of 16 people. Thank you all.<br> <br>People who participated:<br>Heroes of Valor: Ignitz (Guildleader), Fattening, Overlore, Bamelin, Limlit, Braxus, Conjem, Gwinie, Facemaker.<br>Nine Toes: Smolik (Guildleader), Dettmer, Gammak, Slawen.<br>Others: Meniyana, Galendril, Ruddipoo<br><br>Look for a rescheduled raid to take place next month ;)<br> <br>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>Guildmaster, Heroes of Valor<br>Tribunal Server</font></blockquote> </font>

We're developers, we can do anything given enough manpower. Whether "anything" is something that is needed for the continued prosperity of the game and in line with our designs for it is another matter. We will not change experience curves because frankly, it's been this way for nearly a year and a half, and people are advancing in spite of it. It *works* as it is.<br>-Gordon<br></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT><br>Later On EXP loss and hybrids:<br><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color="#050056" face="Verdana" size=2><br>A) recalculating the formula eliminating the exp penalty would suddenly promote all hybrids up many levels.<br><br><br>B) upgrading the formula so everyone has the same exp penalty would suddenly demote all non-hybrids down many levels.<br></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><br><P><br><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color="#A00000" face="Verdana" size=2><br>You are correct in both cases, but as it's been mentioned before, there arevarious ways around both of these problems with a sufficient investment of manpower.

Certainly in Kunark, we've been trying contextual randomness (randomness that makes sense in the environment) on good loot, while leaving the best loot on standard "boss" NPCs. We've been fairly happy with the results, as it allows the casual player a good chance to pick up loot that will work for their class without "requiring" them to camp.<br><br>Still, many continue to suggest that we further randomize loot. I'd like to map out an example that shows why this isn't always the best answer. I think that the biggest misconception that I see here in regards to random loot is that the items will be more available. This isn't the case, as we still need to control the rate at which items enter the world. Randomizing loot isn't going to cause this rate to increase. <br><br>Let's say that CoolItem has a 20% chance to drop off of BossFrog in Lower Guk, who spawns 100% of the time on a 20 minute timer. This means that in two hours (six spawns, assuming he were killed instantly after spawning, which is close enough to the case), the frog would have just under a 74% chance of dropping CoolItem at least once. A group choosing to camp BossFrog would have a pretty good chance of getting 1 item in two hours.<br><br>Now, lets say that it was random. We can't increase the overall rate that CoolItem enters the world. So lets say that we give 20 frogs (still on a 20 minute timer) a 1% chance of dropping the item. Anyone care to guess how many of *these* frogs you have to kill to have the same 74% chance of getting the item? 135. Assuming the dungeon was completely camped, and that you could only kill one frog every 20 minutes, it would take 45 hours to have a 74% chance of getting the item. Suppose the dungeon isn't that crowded and you can take a whole room with 4 frogs in it every 20 minutes, it would still take 135 frogs to get that 74% chance, taking over 11 hours. The single-spawn 20% drop frog would have a 67% chance of dropping at least 6 during that time.<br><br>This same logic follows for suggestions that have the creature spawn in any number of random locations. If we have 20 places that BossFrog spawns, on a 1% spawn, and give him a 100% chance of dropping the item, we're still at 135 Frogs to get that 74% chance of him spawning. <br><br>As you can see, the level of randomness that some people are suggesting would create more frustration than people currently cite. <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>He then followed up later with:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#05006">Then increase the Chance to drop. <br><br><font color="#a00000">But that's not an option. The number that can come into the world needs to remain constant. Whether it's one frog with a 20% drop spawning 100% of the time, or 20 frogs with a 1% drop spawning 100% of the time, or 1 frog spawning in 20 locations 1% of the time with 100% chance to drop, or 1 frog spawning in 5 locations with a 20% chance to spawn and a 20% chance to drop, the rate of item creation is the same. The only thing that changes is the amount of time you spend completing the action required to get the item.<br><br><font color="#050056">But abashi, go check out Najena_alt on a server. What you state as increasing frustration actually seems to make people have more fun. A caster and I were there in a room killing and we killed green crud all night long for a chance at rubicite, it was a SUPER RARE DROP off mobs that could have it. After killing all night we both left with one rubicite bracer each. Other people got luckier.<br>The thing is it was fun, since you were excited about any possibility of getting a fun thing<br><br><font color="#a00000">Yet here were a bunch of people who were out-classing the dungeon determined to get an item. Some would say (I would be one of them) that encouraging bottom-feeding is just as bad in this sense as camping.<br><br>-Gordon</font></font></font></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=371510&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I found this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005765.html"target="_blank">here</a> on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true"target="_blank">Offical Everquest Forums</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a000000">I had a thought earlier and figured we could have a bit of a discussion about camping.  Now before everyone jumps in and says, "because the game forces you to", let's agree that for whatever reason, people decide to camp. Perhaps so many people are camping that newcomers feel that they have to camp, but you still have to make that choice: Am I going to camp or am I going to adventure? Perhaps the game encourages it by rewarding camping. If that is the case, wouldnt the logical solution be to remove those rewards? More on this later<br><br>So here's some questions:<br><br>1. Why camp?<br><br>Is it because you feel it is more profitable? Is it more profitable to sit in an overcrowded dungeon fighting over spawns and being on loot lists than moving out into the lesser-used areas of the world? I'm reminded of a recent Kunark review where the reviewer, an avid EverQuest player, indicated that there's more than enough room in Kunark to go off someplace with a group, but he couldn't get his group to do anything but sit in one area and camp a spawn.<br><br>2. Why not spread out to some of the lesser-used areas?<br><br>This question will inevitably bring about discussions of bindpoints, risk, reward, etc, or talk about how loot "sucks" in other areas. However, at the same time it begs the question, why do people choose to do something that they find boring and without challenge. Again I ask, is loot in any unused area really worse than what you'll get by camping a crowded dungeon, fighting over spawns, and being on a list? Certainly risk is less, but risk is essentially a small amount of experience in a well-balanced group. Do you feel that there is more net gain in the crowded dungeons? Can two groups taking turns killing 3 critters that spawn every 20 minutes in a room really be more profitable than going off someplace on your own, even given increased risk?<br><br>3. Do you actually enjoy camping? <br><br>There are people who do, and I'd like to get an impression of how many people honestly prefer camping. We've made several changes in the past few months to make camping less profitable, leading to a slew of complaints from this group, so I know that they are out there.<br><br>4. What do you propose should be done?<br><br>Some say that random loot tables are the only way to stop camping, but people don't just camp loot, they camp experience as well. We've all seen people move through the game staking out solitary 6 minute spawns for the purpose of camping experience. <br><br>Keep in mind that anything you suggest has to scale to 2K people online per server, all trying to do the same quest.<br><br>---opinion---<br>My feeling is that people camp because they feel it is more profitable, whatever "profitable" means to them. I personally consider "having fun" to be "profitable", to an extent greater than getting experience or loot. I won't go in certain dungeons because they are camped. I enjoy places where you zone in and you might be the only group there. Other people however often value loot and experience over fun, or believe that they can only have fun by acquiring loot or experience. Some people feel that they can only go have fun once they've acquired all of the loot and experience that they'll ever need. <br><br>I really don't think that random loot is an option for loot-camping, as people will still pick a spawn to camp and kill there until they get the item. Certainly, it won't lead to everyone camping the same NPC, but will still result in all of the NPCs being camped. I feel that as long as there exists the relative assurance that "If I spend enough time in this one area, I will sooner or later get the item". <br><br>As far as experience camping goes, I feel we can only get rid of it if we make it less profitable than other things people could do. Perhaps if we could programmatically detect XP camping, we could put something in to counter it. We've been adjusting spawn times that were set incorrectly on some NPCs in the world, causing them to spawn too rapidly, leading to it being a profitable camp, but what else do you think that we should do?<br>---opinion---<br><br>My last question is:<br><br>5. If we do whatever is necessary to get rid of camping, by making it less profitable, how many people will that *really* upset?<br><br>People camp because it's easier, faster, safer, and more profitable to do so than to move through areas and do something more exciting. People dislike camping because it's boring (without challenge), yet this situation is created by it being easier, faster, safer, and more profitable. Completely randomizing loot will only make more NPCs worthy of camping, not reduce the amount of camping going on. <br><br>Logic suggests that if people camp because its easier, faster, safer, and more profitable, the way to stop camping would be to make it harder, slower, more risky, and less profitable. Yet, any time we've done that with an aspect of the game, it creates a *large* number of upset people here on the boards. If we make something harder, we're trying to eliminate soloing. If we make it slower, we're trying to hurt the casual gamer.  If we make it more risky, we're trying to make you die more, which is supposed to make you play longer and pay us more. If we make it less profitable, we're trying to force everyone to join uberguilds. <br><br>In all honesty, any time weve made something harder, slower, more risky, and less profitable, weve been trying to motivate people to play the game in a manner that we would consider more fun. Should we stop trying to do that? If yes, should we stop trying to address camping? <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=371490&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

Moreover, the players can then rate each post for its quality and usefulness, letting you filter your messages to get only the quality of posts you want to see. <br><br> In addition, frequent posters will be assigned a karma rating based upon the average rating of their posts, with their future posts automatically getting rated at their karma rating. Plus, those with a high karma will have their posts highlighted, so you can pick out the posters whose strategies are most worth reading.<br><br>Just opened today, the database already has over a hundred separate strategies posted covering almost every category, and it is growing quickly.  Moreover, the large number of comments already existing in the quest database and in Illia's Bestiary have also been converted to the new system.  <br><br>This makes finding the quality information on monsters and quests all the easier.

This patch message is a replacement for the one posted earlier:<br><br>*Miscellaneous Changes*<br><br>- /trackplayers now supports a "GROUP" option, allowing trackers to exclude all player characters, except ones in their current group.<br>- The EQCLIENT.INI has some new features, including one allowing logging (/log) to be on by default.  Updated documentation for the EQCLIENT.INI file is at the end of this patch message.<br>- Activatable items, such as Journeyman's Boots, can now be activated by the corresponding number-key if placed in a hotbox.<br>- Items that are "out of charges" now display "Charges: None" when inspecting the item.<br>- Attack-speed buffs and debuffs will now stack correctly.  In other words, lower level spells will no longer overwrite higher level spells of the same type.<br>- The "U" key (short for "use") has had its functionality enhanced.  It now does the equivalent of a single left-click and single right-click at the center of the screen.  In addition to opening doors, it will now consider and inspect PCs, consider NPCs, and use bankers, merchants, and guildmasters.<br>- Fixed the way that spell-effect icons are displayed on the UI.  Previously, after adding several "buffs" to a character, one of the icons would be placed down in the chat window.  <br><br>*Chat/Login Server*<br><br>This patch contains eqmain.dll, which is used by the EverQuest login/chat frontend.  The following changes have been implemented:<br><br>- #help now accepts arguments.  #help #command will return help for the requested command.<br>- Errors issued within the chat/login server frontend now display an "Error Number".  Please have this error number ready when requesting technical assistance.<br><br>*Looking for Group Flag*<br><br>Players can now indicate that they are "looking for a group" by typing /LFG.  This command will flag your character in both zone-specific /who lists, and the server-wide "/who all" list with "LFG".  The LFG flag will remain active until you either enter a group or log out.  Players can search for other players who are LFG by using filters in the /who command.  For instance, to find rangers between level 40 and 50 who are looking for a group across the server, type "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg".  <br><br>It is our hope that this flag will make it easier for players to seek out group members, allowing for more adventuring with less preparation time.<br><br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br><br> 1 - Say<br> 2 - Tell<br> 3 - Group<br> 4 - Guild<br> 5 - OOC<br> 6 - Auction<br> 7 - Shout<br> 8 - Emote<br> 9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - yell for help<br>28 - Hit for non-melee<br>29 - Spell worn off<br>30 - Money splits<br>31 - Loot message<br>32 - Unused at this time<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client.

My main focus for now is the client program including the User Interface. <br><br>Some of the first things I've done are now live and I've seen the many reactions to them. I've been reading the boards and even implemented some of the suggestions already (they will go onto test tonight or tomorrow). <br><br>Be aware that while I am reading the boards, I can not respond to everything. I will read what I can, and respond when I can. If I were to spend the time needed to reply to everything, then I would not have any time to code the changes and fixes needed. My boss would not be too happy with me, if that were the case... <br><br>Hopefully, we can work together to make the UI as good as it can be.<br><br><font color="#050056">Spells being hot keyed. I'm wondering if that might be possible.  For example, a shaman might right click some of his/her buffs into his/her hotkey lower left 6 pad. That way he/she can cast these from the book, essentially, expanding the real estate of those ever-important 8 spell slots. Casting from the spell book, even at 3x the casting time, has been dismissed as impossible to implement, though perhaps I wondered if a workaround might be to hotkey the icon into the presets so that excessive spell-swapping is reduced. Some classes are more effected by the 8 spell limitation than others, and as the spells accumulate toward level 60, this just worsens. <br><br><font color="a00000">Having more then 8 spells from your spell book available to cast at any one time is not part of EQ and unlikely to change.<br><br><font color="#050056">I'd just like to suggest that, along with some of the other default options that are being tested out right now, that you also insert the option to turn /log on or off by default. <br><br><font color="#a00000">Log control has been added to the eqclient.ini file already, should be on test soon.<br><br>Just as a reminder, I am primarily working on the UI, I won't be addressing issues such as class balance and problems with quests or items  Here's an update though:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a00000">Using activatable items from the hot button panel is in and should be on test. I'm looking into why the hotkeys don't operate from a key press while in the spell book. <br><br>Looking into the Ctrl-1 thru Ctrl-8 for memmed spells. <br><br>The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no promises. <br><br>Looking into the shift click while buying to buy stacks of 20. One thing to keep in mind, if you don't have enough money for all 20 it will just cancel the sale. This will only work on stackable items.</blockquote> <br><br><font color="#050056">When emoting, the text of the emote YOU typed used to be blue.  But when others saw it, it was white. Similarly, when you saw other's emotes, they were white. Now all emotes are the same color.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I had to make "classes" of text, and in order to keep it from being a separate color control entry in the ini file for every text message printed (meaning hundreds of entries) I had to group stuff together. I thought it made sense to put all emotes into a class together. This reason applies to a lot of the messages.<br><br><font color="#050056">With my color User_11 RGB as specified in Gordon's file, full red only, the text is still WHITE on messages where others are hitting me. This is probably just a bug.  Wasn't the duel color (User_14) yellow? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Some of the messages are sent from the server with a color tag, I have already fixed most of these and it should be on test.<br><br><font color="#050056">Was all spell activity really dark blue? I must be losing my marbles, that seems wrong. <br><br><font color="#a00000">See my response above.<br><br><font color="050056">When you do a /who friend all, your friends list comes back white, rather than the color of all other friends queries (again, likely just a bug)<br><br><font color="#a00000">The "local" /who command is handled by the client, the "/who all" commands are all handled by the world server.  Those will be colored properly soon. <br><br><font color="#050056">How about letting us right-clink on potions and items with effects that are in an open backpack (you can only use a charged item that is in a general invent slot)?  Or letting us hotkey slots that are in backpacks<br><br>Either of these would help a ton, if you have 8 bags/large items in your general slots it becomes very annoying to swap around your Jboots for a quick recharge.<br><br><font color="#a00000">Just a note, hotkeying a backback slot is just not possible.<br><br>Couple things I wanted to address: <br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="a00000">Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game. If you click the wrong spell you have to wait... <br><br>I doubt I will be able to increase the number of hot-buttons per page above 6 pages of 6 buttons. It would change the player data format stored on the server, and that could cause serious problems with character data. I might be able to make it 4 pages of 9 (still having a total of 36 buttons, just more available at a time). I am still investigating this one.. I'll let you know what comes up. </blockquote><br><br>Several of the other things asked for here are either in or going in this week. Like: <br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="a00000">/cast 1-8 for casting memmed spells <br>/book # to open your book on page # <br>/sit <br>/doability # (so if you have tracking set on ability button 1, then /doability 1 would invoke tracking) <br>More control of certain text message colors, the spell and target being mentioned in the "casting" message                              Custom emotes that include the target name (/em gives @ the look of death and @ is frozen in his tracks would replace the '@' with the current target) <br><br>and more... some of these are on test already, and some will be there later this week.</blockquote><br><br><font color="#050056">What kind of answer is "Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game."  I have seen many things that were "part of the game" that were altered to suit to the players needs and requests. To me that like telling a warrior once you start attacking a mob you can't stop until X amount of time has gone by before you can take another action. <br><br>It more than an inconvenience, you cannot pick another target, you cannot switch thru your hotkeys, you have to run around sometimes to keep the spell from going of and sometimes it will still go off. I have never known an RPG that did not allow for you cancelling or stopping a spell or ability that is not an instantaneous affect. <br><br>Then you turn around and say you are making these other changes for casting spells and hotkeys, makes it sound like a double standard to me.<br><br><font color="#a00000">Just to reply to the people that didn't like my reply about stopping spells.<br><br>It's part of the game. If you click the wrong spell, it's a penalty that you have to wait thru. I'm sorry that it's not the way you would like it, but there have to be drawbacks to making mistakes. And I realize that sometimes it's not a mistake so much as the situation changing after you cast. <br><br>I play a caster, and I would like to make this change, also, but it's just something I have control over. The designers of the game want it this way. <br><br><font color="#050056">I know you stated:  "The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no promises." <br><br>Abashi has stated this as well, but many know this to simply not be true. I have seen Show in action (don't use it myself because in my opinion takes half the fun out of the game), and this does track a pet to it's owner. Since the program just sniffs packets it can't do any of this on it's own. Meaning that pets are indeed tracked with their owners. If anyone tells you otherwise, check it out for yourself.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I am familiar with ShowEQ, and how it does it's pet stuff. The pet does have the ID of it's owner in it's packet, but player packets don't have the ID of their pet. What needs to be done is that the client needs to search the current mob database for any pets that belong to people in the current party. For your own pet it does this when you create it. The client also needs to keep updating this info as your party changes and as your party members create and destroy pets (either via pet spells or charm).<br><br>Again, ShowEQ is just going thru it's entire database and when if find s a pet it sticks it under the pets owner, but as I've explained above it's not the same as tracking the pets for the functionality asked for in this thread. That said, I still plan to look into this feature because I think it would be useful. <br><br><font color="#050056">In the higher resolution modes 1024x768 for example when I'm in full screen with the display in transparent overlays, there's a huge amount of wasted space in the text box.  Is it possible to either allow the characters to go the full width of the box and add extra lines of text display?  Or at least shrink the box and remove the extra spaces between the lines to remove the amount of the screen it blocks out? <br><br><font color="#a00000">Regarding the text box in higher resolutions.<br><br>One of the other programmers here is working on that right now. It's not as simple as one might think at first glance because users can and do switch modes back and forth (sometimes they are forced to by the game itself like for inventory mode), and thus the text needs to be "re-wrapped" for the narrower box when in that mode, and then expanded back out when you return to the higher res fullview. It's almost working though and should be on test later this week. <br><br><font color="#050056">Three suggestions that have been drifting around a bit for the spell books: <br><br>A first and last page button would be great! <br>User customizable tabs/bookmarks would be an awesome improvement <br>Being able to duplicate spell icons (related to above suggestion) would be amazing: Why? So we can plan out different 'load outs' or whatever for our spells for different situations (i.e.: group section, ungrouped section, travelling section...)  Certain spells will invariably be in all 'configurations' (not sure if I'm being clear here...) <br><br>Tanks for the colour customization! That was great....except I managed to make mine worse hee hee...but eventually I'll have my own perfect scheme.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I am working on a /book command that will bring up your book, I plan to allow you to specify a page number with that and have it pop open on that page. So /book 5 would open the book with page 5 visible. This should allow you to get to any page in your book easily. <br><br>Duplicate spells icons in the book is not an easy thing, I'll peek at it, but doubt it will get done.<br><br><font color="#050056">Would it be possible for you to make it so we can have the GUI overlays in 800x600 and 1024x768 Full screen? Maybe through an optional download? I imagine these files are BMP files and the size of a 1024x768 BMP would be pretty large, but it would help a lot..  Some people like to play with the GUI on and in high resolutions.<br><br><font color="#a00000">Part of the GUI overhaul for Velious will likely involve something along these lines, but because of the new art and data changes for that it won't be until Velious. <br><br><font color="#050056">It would be cool if guild masters and maybe officers could set a text message that is stored server side and played back to guild members whenever they log on to EQ. Here's an example:- <br><br>Welcome to EverQuest!<br>Message of the Day: [The usual EverQuest message of the day in yellow text]<br>Guild Message of the Day: [Tindi'Losi] Reminder - Fear raid on Monday, insertion starting 0900 EST at Feerrott portal! Also, everyone please welcome your new guildmate Xyzzy, a level 34 druid who joined us yesterday. <br><br>This would be a very effective way for guilds to communicate, post reminders, make important announcements etc. Right now, whenever there's an important announcement people struggle with /guildsay and web boards, and 48 hours later half the guild still hasn't heard it. <br><br>It would also be cool to have a /guildmotd command that would play back the message on request at any time. <br><br><font color="#a00000">A guild "message of the day" would be a great addition to the guild functionality of EverQuest I am going to look into this one, I think it's a great idea. I will say this though, it seems like it might be easy at first glance, but it's not a trivial thing to add new data to be stored on the server and delivered to select users. Anyway, I'll see what I can do. <br><br><font color="#050056">A little thing that would make things a lot smoother for me anyway, are more keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys for those of us who use the keyboard and the mouse. <br><br>For instance, in inventory when I open up a backpack, and am done with it or realize it's not the right one and want to close it, it'd be nice to just press and have it close rather than have to click it. Same thing for trades and such. Using to confirm the trade and to cancel would be nice. <br><br>Also, more pages for hotkeys would be nice... Maybe 10 (0-9) pages instead of just 6 (1-6). <br><br>Lastly, and this may go into gameplay a bit, but a second rack for memorized spells would be nice. After a few levels, there are often MANY different spells at your disposal and only 8 slots to memorize them to. The number of spells is a selling point for the game, so why not make it to where you can use more of them.  Maybe make it so that you get more mem slots every few levels...<br><br>Make them work kind of like the aforementioned pages of hotkeys... Maybe + 0 can toggle between the spell lists, or if it's not used for anything. *SHRUG* Besides, it will still take a good while to mem all those spells initially, so it shouldn't be too unbalancing.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I like the idea of using and for more things, but it can also cause problems. For example, since you can chat while trading I can't make confirm the trade since you might just be hitting to end your line of chat. Same for you might just be cancelling a chat line. However, I plan to try and add more keyboard shortcuts for thing where I can. <br><br>I am already looking into the "more hot button pages" idea. <br><br>Having only 8 memmed spells is part of EQ and changing that is highly unlikely to happen. I won't say never, because one should never say never, but think of it like that.<br><br><font color="#050056">'You must be standing in order to cast a spell'. Why don't we automatically stand up whenever we hit a spell icon? It doesn't seem to make any sense that we have to manually stand and then cast a spell. If I click on a spell button, then I wanted to cast a spell so standing should happen automatically. <br><br>From a precedent setting perspective, if we are attacked by a mob while sitting we automatically stand.<br><br><font color="#a00000">I'll ask about this at the next tuning meeting. While I don't see a problem with it, there may be reasons I am not aware of that would stop us from doing this. <br><br>- Rowyl</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font> </font>

Rules for this event are simple, with no artifacts, no buffs, and no right clicking on any item (but wearing activatable items is acceptable, just not the use of those items). <br><br>These events will not have any entry fee, but players must be of 55th level or greater to enter. The winner of the event will be given a title of &#8220;The Champion&#8221; which is the 51st level title of the class. All of &#8220;The Champions&#8221; will be copied to Test Server, so that on Sunday at Noon (PST) all of the champions will face each other. Those that place (4th, 3rd, and 2nd places) will receive their 59th level title, and the winner of the &#8220;Main Event&#8221; will be dubbed the 60th level title (the Warlord).<br><br>Security for these events will be absolute, with Lake Rathetear shut down on Test Server for the duration of the event. The only characters that will be allowed in the Arena on Test Server will be the Events Staff, the Champions of each server, and possibly some members of the press who are covering the events. All others who come into the arena via gating in or having logged out there will be summoned out of the arena and binded in a far away land by a member of the event staff as soon as the player is discovered. There will be no exceptions to this.<br><br>After the event, all characters copied to test will be deleted, and titles will be given to the characters on their respective &#8220;live&#8221; server&#8217;s characters. This is to insure that the Test Server does not receive added players or items. Security measures will be in place to make sure that no items from the &#8220;live&#8221; servers end up in the hands of the Test Server. I know that there were concerns with this with the original announcement of bringing the champions to the Test Server, but rest assured that actions will be taken against those responsible IF something happens, not the server itself.<br><br><a href="http://www.everquest.com"target="_blank">www.everquest.com</a> will also carry all information and standings of the events for this<br>great event.<br><br>At the conclusion of the warrior&#8217;s competition, a random roll will determine the next class that will have the excitement of this style event. The titles awarded again will be 51st level title for the winners of the server competition, the 59th level title for the runners up, and the 60th level title for the grand champion of that specific class Norrath-wide.<br><br>There will be a week of normal events that all levels and classes can enjoy, then the week of the new classes competitions start. This is so that all levels, races, and classes get to have fun with the events. When it comes to the game-wide championships, those will be dedicated only to the 55th level or higher players. One week dedicated to all levels, then a week dedicated to the class specific events that will determine the best of each class in the game.<br><br>More information should be released early next week, including official rules and regulations of the Warriors Event. The Events Staff and myself look forward to bringing you these new events.<br><br>Lady Daegarmo &#8220;The Faithful&#8221;<br>Online Events Coordinator <br>Verant Interactive</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this upcoming event <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=370339&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

You had posted something a while back on what our thoughts were and you never responded. Even if you will never do anything just let us know. At least then we could all stop posting on the subject.<br><br>Just a few questions we would like you to take a look at: <br><br>1. Is there any plans on changing the looting system? <br><br><font color="#a00000">No.<br><br><font color="050056">2. Will there ever be a chance to move to another server?<br><br><font color="#a00000">Maybe. We're still considering the issue. Nothing is likely to be decided within the next month. I'd really like to see a server-specific polling mechanism put in, but it will be at least two weeks before we can do work on that. It would be at least a week after that before something could go live, and a few more to set up and implement any kind of meaningful poll. That's basically the plan at the moment. Of course it's all subject to change. <br><br><font color="#050056">3. Do you have any other options you are working with other then the two mentioned above? <br><br><font color="a00000">Not really. I think that the thoughts posted here have determined without a doubt that there are many different opinions on how PvP should be handled. I don't think that there is a solution that will please everyone, or even most everyone. We're a bit nervous about making any more major changes to the environment going forward. <br><br><font color="#050056">My question is Why have two identical PvP servers?  <br><br><font color="a00000">Because there are enough people to support it. More people enjoy playing Teams than they do on an open PvP server like Rallos. Items being allowed, it still makes more sense for it to be allowed on Rallons than on the Teams servers due to the level range.<br><br><font color"050056">By the way, any word on returning pumice stones to merchants as self-only?<br><br><font color="a00000">Yes, we've ruled it out as an option, and decided that the current stone is appropriate. <br><br>-Gordon</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=8&Board=eqsrvrallos&Number=370139&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

The addition of PvP to the game should not change the basic fundemental mechanics of EverQuest. PvP in EverQuest has to result in "EverQuest with PvP" rather than "PvP EverQuest", if you get my point. <br><br>One of the largest issues on the PvP Teams servers is the subject of cross-teaming.  Players of different teams get together for battles. Due to the PvE focus of the game,  this has to be allowed for sake of game balance. Though some have suggested that cross-teaming, either in groups or guilds, not be allowed, it's something that will need to remain for the PvE game.<br><br>The problem comes in when cross-teaming is applied to PvP.  Cross-teaming creates a situation that is often referred to as the "invulnarable healer" scenario. Basically, one group of PCs (Team A) attack a group of people on Team B, while supported by a healer from Team B. In this fashion, you have a situation where a member of one team is taking an active role in the deaths of members of their own team.<br><br>There is another "invulnarable healer" scenario that is more common and often just as bad as the cross-teaming scenario. This one revolves around a group of players from Team A attacking a group from Team B, while supported by a healer/buffer who is far superior in level to anyone from Team A or Team B. For example, a group of level ~20 trolls go on a killing spree in Greater Faydark, while supported by a level 50 healer/buffer.  The problem in this case is that someone out-of-range is directly contributing to the deaths of players below their range.<br><br>On Friday, I spoke with one of the programmers about possible solutions for the PvP Teams servers, assuming that people in general believe these issues to be a problem.  Suffice it to say that there is no easy solution. Each one has its disadvantages and "loopholes". For an example of some of the solutions:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a00000">1. Disallow cross-team buffing/healing<br>2. Disallow out-of-level (+/- 8) buffing/healing<br>3. Combination of 1 & 2.<br>4. Redefine "Teams" servers to GvE (good versus evil) servers and implement idea #1 on that basis, rather than on cross-teaming.</blockquote><br>The problem with all of these solutions is that they have an undeniable impact upon the PvE aspect of the game. <br><br>The final and best idea that we were able to come up with allows things to continue as they are now in regards to PvE, and only places restrictions on the basis of PvP. In this idea, any player who has taken damage from another player would not be able to be healed/buffed/receive any beneficial spells from anyone who wasn't on their own team or in the +/- 8 level range for a given amount of time (a few minutes), or until they zoned. <br><br>In the cross-teaming "invulnarable healer" scenario, the person from Team B would be able to support people from Team A for PvE engagements, however once a member of Team A took damage from another team, they would not be able to receive support from anyone on Team B for a few minutes. In a real game scenario, the maurading band of trolls in Greater Faydark couldn't be healed/buffed by a high-elf assuming that they were taking damage in their attacks. <br><br>In the out-of-level scenario, that same band of level ~20 trolls wouldn't be able to receive support from a 50th level cleric. <br><br>There are some disadvantages to this, such as in the following:<br><br>4 Trolls are grouped with a high-elf fighting PvE encoutners in a dungeon. Humans come in and "slap" the trolls every so often thus keeping the high-elf from assisting them. Perhaps this should just be a disadvantage for cross-teaming in general. Perhaps this is just a risk that people take from grouping with the enemy.<br><br>What are your thoughts on these ideas? What other issues do you see causing problems in regard to this idea? Do the benefits (e.g. reaffirming the servers as PvP Teams)outweigh the potential disadvantages? <br><br>-Gordon</font></font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this story <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=368903&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a><br><br>Talk about other Everquest Issues in the <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/forums/westwood.html"target="_blank">Westwood Tavern</a> </font>

With a Hero at the West and South gates in Freeport and two in Butcherblock Mtns, each team came up with a list of items for the intrepid adventurers to get, and in some cases, even gave them money to get a backpack in which to place the items. In the end, each winner received 10pp and was allowed to keep the backpack, and for the participants of the West Freeport Gate, the first three people to complete the hunt received additional items that could be sold for even more cash.<br><br>The people that participated were: Jeramiahh, Michalla, Kexin, Zellos, Privateer, Wraithgar, Aladran, Reorxx, Belavius, and Renmedee.

The tests that I did were only to confirm that that wasn't true. Yes, I conceed that monks cannot takes hits as well as warriors, but that's never been where the disagreement has been. When people said, "Monks no longer outdamage warriors", I had to disagree, which is why I ended up testing it out. However, when people now say, "We can't take hits like a warrior", I agree with that.<br><br>Dealing out more damage than the warrior doesn't mean that you'll beat the warrior in a duel, nor that the ratio of damage dealing to damage taking capability is constant. The benefit of extra damage has more weight than the disadvantage of being defensively inferior. <br><br>I'm sure that some would say, "If a warrior can solo creature X in two minutes and be almost dead at the end, then a monk should be able to do the same in a minute and end up almost dead". This would be an example of constant ratio between offense and defense and the two classes. This however isn't the case. If the ratio were constant as suggested, there would, again, be no reason to have the warrior, because the monk's other skills would make them preferable in all cases. Not to mention, there's an added benefit any time a creature is killed faster than normal, a benefit that can't be measured directly against the power of the class, but more against its usefulness to the group.<br><br>Would a group, for instance, like to kill things in 2 minutes and end up OOM and near death at the end? Or would the rather do it in 1 minute and end up the same way? They'd want it done faster in all cases. That's what monks and rogues add as melee classes.<br><br>Concerning everyone saying that the test wasn't "valid", I fully agree with that from a scientific standpoint. Many more combats would have to be carried out than the ones I could do over a couple of hours yesterday. To be honest, its not really my job to test things of this nature, I just do it as needed so I can speak with first-hand experience.<br><br>Though the specific percentage point differences can't really be considered averages, I do think that the test fairly well answered the question: Do monks outdamage warriors?<br><br>There was one interesting thing in the test that I didn't mention in the post yesterday, concerning the one time that the warrior outdamaged the monk. The warrior was using his best combo out of the 5 weapon combos I tried, the monk his worst (bare knuck).  <br><br>The damage ratios were determined by seeing how long it took for the character to kill the NPC in question. The monk completed the task in under two minutes in every case but one, where it took 2:03. The warrior was over two minutes in every case, with its fastest time at 2:01. The monk's best time, by the way, was 1:30.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Add your thoughts/comments <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=9&Board=eqwarriors&Number=368298&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>For other Class Specific News visit our <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/content/forums/classes.html"target="_blank">Everquest Class Forums</a> </font>

The interface is more similar to privateer in that the player pilots his own ship around space, doing as he pleases, but the similarities with typical space games end right there, and the player is treated to a very unique blend of all of the best space-game gameplay elements in pc-gaming history.</blockquote><br><P>You can connect to Stratics IRC on port 6667 at any of the following servers:</p><br><blockquote>irc.stratics.com<br>compu.stratics.com<br>dhp.stratics.com<br>intworks.stratics.com<br>frws.stratics.com</blockquote><P>If you'd like to join using our Java Client, head <A HREF="http://jg.stratics.com/sections/jghoc/jghoc.shtml">here</a>.

Last week it was suggested here on the boards that we implement a "Looking for Group" flag that players can set and view in order to help people get together quickly, allowing more time for adventuring. We've decided to try it out and it's on Test now.<br><br>The /lfg [on|off] command will set or unset your "LFG" flag. Players can then use all of the "/who" and "/who all" filters to find each others. For instance, "/who all rogue 45 50 lfg" will return all rogues between 45 and 50 who are looking for a group. "/who lfg" will return all players in the current zone who are looking for a group. <br><br>Your LFG flag will automatically unset when you enter a group. One final note, though anonymous and roleplaying characters can set their LFG flag, they will not show up in filtered /who lists. In other words, the first example above wouldn't return any anonymous rogues, however "/who all lfg" would return everyone in the game who is LFG (subject to the 20 person limit).<br><br>Assuming all goes well in testing, this change will most likely be in the next patch.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about these upcoming changes <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=367379&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5"target="_blank">here</a> </font>

We want that change to be permanent, as we don't want to see a situation where people switch deities based upon what is convenient at the time. For instance, if a really cool deity-specific quest or item comes in game, we don't want to see people flocking to a new religion.<br><br>As it was established that a change in religion would not be allowed, the game architecture was built in a way that now makes such a change impossible.

On August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of level 1 characters.  All level 1 characters that have not been played within 30 days from the date of the purge will be deleted.  As GMs will not be able to restore any characters that are deleted, please be certain to log in any level 1 characters that you wish to keep prior to the purge.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br><br>August 9th, 7:00am<br>------------------<br><br>*Guide Application*<br><br>The Guide Application is now back up at <a href="http://guideapp.everquest.com.">http://guideapp.everquest.com.</a>  If you are over 18 years of age, have a good customer-oriented attitude, enjoy helping your fellow player, and are interested in joining the Guide Program, we will be pleased to review your application.<br> <br>*Kunark Users*<br><br>A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of todays patch.  This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald Jungle.  Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering EverQuest.<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes. <br><br>*General Enhancements*<br><br>- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br>- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels transposed accidentally.  Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook.  Feel free to move one to the back.  Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate.<br>- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.<br>- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.<br>- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure caster with the same stats.  This will give those hybrids a good deal more mana, regardless of their stats.<br>- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a "NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.<br>- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.<br><br>*Changes/Fixes*<br><br>- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works<br>- Scaler recipe now works<br>- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch<br>- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.<br>- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work<br>- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.<br>- Elven Wine can now be brewed<br>- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather than pelts of quality.  This has been repaired.<br>- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.<br>- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.<br>- Many pathing errors have been repaired.<br>- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or feared.<br>- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.<br><br>*Dragons?*<br><br>Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much further away than is intended.  Rather than hold off implementing these dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix the problem in the next patch.  Enjoy :)<br><br><br>*New Command For Tracking*<br><br>New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will work for all players with the tracking skill.  The command has two settings:<br><br>- ON: Default setting, same as it is now.  Players will show up in the tracking window.<br>- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.<br><br>*Client Customizations*<br><br>Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in your EverQuest directory.  This file contains customizable settings for:<br><br>- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window<br>- Default screen viewing mode<br>- Default travel speed (run or walk)<br><br>The documentation will be included in the online manual in your EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several weeks, but the working document is posted below.  We felt that people would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're in the process of building them.  <br><br>Modifying this file is optional.<br><br>*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file: <br><br>1 - Say<br>2 - Tell<br>3 - Group<br>4 - Guild<br>5 - OOC<br>6 - Auction<br>7 - Shout<br>8 - Emote<br>9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client.

I thought I'd come give everyone a sneak peak at what we are working on:<br><br>- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.<br><br>- /trackplayers [ON|OFF] command. This will allow rangers (and only rangers) to remove or include other players on their tracking display. <br><br>- New file, EQCLIENT.INI in your EQ directory will allow you to set some interesting options: <br><br>1) Color of all text messages (by setting RGB values for each defined text type: text types listed below)<br><br>2) Default "RUN" <br><br>3) Default "Overlay" view mode<br><br>The EQCLIENT.INI setup info follows:<br><br><b>EQCLIENT.INI documentation</b><br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values.

The mana pool for a hybrid will be the same as the pool for the parent caster, assuming the same amount of int/wis. This is balanced by the fact that there are not nearly as many +int/wis items available for hybrids as pure casters, and that they'd have trouble equallying out in that department.

You can visit it <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/velious/index.html"target="_blank">here</a>!<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a00000">Before Recorded Time, Veeshan the great Crystalline Dragon marked Norrath by striking the continent of Velious with her foreclaw, and deposited her brood there to dwell. The legends of that time also tell that Veeshan blasted Velious with her breath, encasing it in eternal ice and creating a barrier of deadly ice flows and stormy weather. This marked the beginning of the Age of Scale. <br><br>The Age of Scale lasted untold millennia. From the tidbits of information passed down, it is known that a group of dragons mastered magic and spellcasting during this era.<br><br>Additionally, dragons of power and influence among their kind gathered together and formed a hereditary ruling council known as the Claws of Veeshan, who rule the dragons of Velious to this day. Few of Norrath&#8217;s inhabitants know more of this Age, and none that do would dare to speak.<br><br>The end of the Age of Scale was marked by the Gods creation of the other races of Norrath. Many of Veeshan&#8217;s vainglorious brood perceived that they might rule over these lesser beings and left Velious. This splinter group became known as the Ring of Scale. Those dragons that remained upon Velious had little interest in temporal power, and were content to pass the millennia in homage to their goddess, and in quiet contemplation and the study of magics.<br><br>In the Elder Age, the Ogres, Giants and Goblins conquered much of Norrath and began an assault on the Plane of Earth, precipitating retribution from The Rathe in the form of a great curse against all of Rallos Zek&#8217;s creations. The fertile homelands of the Giants (now known as Everfrost) were frozen, and those giants caught in the epicenter of the curse were transformed wholly into immortal creatures of living ice. <br><br>Those nearby were struck to the core of their beings, becoming lesser creatures in mind and body than they had been. Those few who escaped the effects fled Tunaria for other lands, coming to the attention of Prexus the Oceanlord, who sent a great storm to destroy them. The storm drove many ships back to Tunaria and to Kunark, where the curse of The Rathe took hold to a lesser degree than in Everfrost. Many of the most powerful giants managed to escape the storm thanks to their great powers, and passed through the Frigid Barrier to land upon the Icy Fingers in Velious. <br><br>The Kromrif established themselves in the Eastern Wastes and lived as nomads, eventually coming into conflict with the Coldain. The Kromzek were the most powerful of all Rallos Zek&#8217;s creations. Not content with a nomadic lifestyle, they established a mighty fortress city named Kael Drakkal in the Great Scar of Veeshan. The Claws of Veeshan took exception to the intrusion of the Kromzek upon their sacred lands, and thus began the long conflict between the two mightiest races on Norrath, in this most inhospitable of all places. <br><br>Ages passed, leaving the eastern regions of Velious largely in the control of the Giants. It was during this time that the ships of the Coldain, or Ice Dwarves, were wrecked upon the ice of the Frigid Barrier. Those few who survived to reach the shore escaped the notice of the Claws of Veeshan, but were devastated in a conflict with the fearsome Kromrif. <br><br>Fleeing the giants, the Coldain established Thurgadin, a hidden underground fortress in the mountains. Since these times, none of the other races of Norrath have dared to approach the Frigid Barrier, and thus Velious remained undiscovered.<br><br>In the present day, the Gnomes of Ak&#8217;anon have revealed an ocean vessel with the capability of navigating the roughest seas and breaking through ice flows. Upon it&#8217;s maiden voyage, the Gnomish Icebreaker successfully penetrated the Frigid Barrier and discovered the islands known as the Icy Fingers. Upon the largest of the islands, the crew discovered an ancient and massive bridge, which arced away into the mists and revealed the tip of a massive glacial continent &#8211; Velious! <br><br>For a price, these Gnomes and their allies will offer the brave adventurers of Norrath passage to these frozen, uncharted lands.<br><br>You may be one of the first to explore this deadly and forbidding icy land. You feet may be the first tread its deadly caverns and ancient shrines. If you are among the stout of heart, you may dare to enter The Scars of Velious. You are in our world now!</font></blockquote><br><br>Visit our Scars of Velious Forum <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/postlist.pl?Cat=7&Board=eqscarsofvelious"target=_blank">here</a> </font>

Cindy is a former Guide, and was also the coordinator for the St. Louis and Las Vegas EQ Gatherings. <br><br>Cindy will be coordinating future gatherings for EQ and other Verant products, and will also be here on the boards, helping to moderate the forums and answer questions from time to time.

The fact that we did publicize those additional numbers doesn't necessarily mean that we should publicize the next thing that seems "logical" given that argument. At some point we either have to stop releasing more numbers, or just release them all. Though there are certainly people who would like to see numbers on everything, we're of the mind that the game shouldn't be reduced to pure mathematics in the eyes of the players.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>On an idea to make hybrids more desirable Abashi commented in this <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000385.html targe="_blank">thread</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" color="050056" size=2>Hybrids are supposed to be warriors and casters right?

Of course that's an RP reason. From a game design perspective, nothing hits while in a casting delay, not even NPCs. Though I like the idea, this is a core mechanic of EverQuest, and isn't really likely to change.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>Abashi also added a comment on the Wake of Tranquility spell and when they new expansion spells are obtained by the various classes in this <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000392.html target="_blank">thread.</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" color="050056" size=2>Wake of tranquility seems to have an inappropriate level assigned to it for clerics. Enchanters currently get it at 51 and clerics at 55. Below is a list of when clerics and enchanters get the different spells in the lull series (this is the last upgrade to that series, and both classes share it).</font><br><br><font face="Veranda" color="a00000" size=2>When GZ was designing the spell layouts, he made a list of all of the spells that he wanted to implement, and then set it up so that a certain number of spells were implemented in a given level. Though it may appear to make sense for a particular spell to be given a few levels earlier or later, it would upset the way that the spells are allocated.<br><br>We actually made a mistake at one point, giving group resolution after group heroism. I'm not sure how that happened, but rather than shift the spells back to where they should be, we're actually going to replace one of the spells. I'm mentioning this to illustrate how important it is that we provide spells at the level which they are provided.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>Abashi had the following to say on bugs and the proof required for Guide or GM assistance in this <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000624.html target="_blank">thread.</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" color="a00000" size=2>Most bugs that would result in a resurrection leave some sort of signature that would allow the GM or Guide to verify the incident and make the correct decision. For instance, falling for 10K damage leaves a line of text that can be /reported in order to provide "proof".<br><br>The particular incident that you are mentioning however is not a bug. Centaurs by their nature are ornery critters, and have a very small percent chance of just going wild on someone. Of course this can be very inconvenient when there are other centaurs around, as their anger is contagious. <br><br>I think that one of the reasons people think that this is a bug is that this NPC personality trait isn't widely used in game. <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote>Although Abashi liked the posters idea for Iksar Necromancers he didn't think his suggestion could be implemented. Here is the original <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000372.html targe="_blank">thread.</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" color="050056" size=2>Say this is just somthing I was pondering on. Wouldn't it be awesome if Iksar Necromancer's pets were actually Iksar Skeletons? That would definitely add some awesome diversified life to the game. It would definitely be different. Just a suggestion.</font><br><br><font face="Veranda" color="a00000" size=2>That would make sense I imagine :) Unfortunately, the iksar skeleton model isn't in the global file, which is required for things such as pets, enchanter illusions, etc. <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br>Whew, that's a lot of posts! </font>

In the particular case you quote, I was looking for a way to indicate that there will be no change, not "no change" in the "lets discuss it for a long time and we might change it" sense, but in the "this will never ever change" sense.

The arguments are:<br><br>- ON: Same as option "Fast Drop" on the General Tab.<br>- OFF: Same as option "Confirm" on the General Tab.<br>- NEVER: Same as above.<br><br>Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation. Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground.

In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that apply to the EverQuest Forums.<br><br>In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting. This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum.<br><br>You may not, however, post any material that:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a00000">· Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate the idea, but do not turn your disagreement into an attack upon the poster.<br><br>· Engages in name-calling, harassment, or threats. See above.<br><br>· Contains obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity. Though we do have a filter in place to catch the  unintentional obscenity from time to time, this is not a license to abuse it.<br><br>· Disparages any religion, race, nation, gender, or sexual orientation. <br><br>· Is considered inappropriate for children 13 or over as governed by general standards of decency in the United States.<br><br>· Infringes on anyone's privacy rights.</font></blockquote><br><br>Furthermore, you may not:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a00000">· Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting attention paid to your issue.<br><br>· Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to another thread on a different subject.<br><br>· Monopolize the front page of any forum by "bumping" threads of the same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs.<br><br>· Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest within the game (e.g. Sit-ins).<br><br>· Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of EverQuest characters or items in exchange for real-world money.<br><br>· Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, the EverQuest EULA, or the Station Terms of Service.<br><br>· Advertise products or websites that are not related to EverQuest or other Verant/Sony Online Entertainment products.</font></blockquote><br><br><b>Actions Taken For Violation</b><br><br>Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on the Official EverQuest Forums will vary depending upon the transgression. It could include any number of the following:<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a00000">· Editing of the post.<br>· Deletion of the post/thread.<br><br>· Closing of the thread.<br><br>· Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest for the duration of the suspension).<br><br>· Banishment (results in the user's station account being canceled. User will no longer be able to access EverQuest, or any Official EverQuest Forum).<br><br>· Legal Action (i.e. Contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a threat.)</font></blockquote><br><br>People who violate the rules of the boards may or may not receive any warning before any action is taken. In the event that a warning is given, the warning will be recorded upon the game account and may result in further action should the player show a pattern of engaging<br>in prohibited conduct. Philosophically and administratively, there is no difference between conduct in game, and conduct in the Official EverQuest Forums.<br>---snip---<br><br>As a note, we will begin strictly enforcing these rules as soon as the changes are made.
