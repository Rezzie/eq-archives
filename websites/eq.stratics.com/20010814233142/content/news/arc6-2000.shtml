The event will begin at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and will run as long as there are people in attendance. Featured services will include a variety of tradespeople practicing fletching, blacksmithing, tailoring, and other skills as well as free starter weapons and provisions for newbies. Our casters will offer buffs to all, and there will even be music and fortune-telling. Some services may require a basic materials cost, but many will be free (donations will be cheerfully accepted in any case).<br><br>We are a roleplaying guild, and will be in character during the festival. Attendees are invited and strongly encouraged -- but not required -- to roleplay. We will provide safe escort from the Blackburrow entrance in Qeynos Hills and from the city gate in North Qeynos for those who require it. If you play (or are about to start playing) a new character, this event is an excellent place to get some help for little or no money. If you aren't a newbie, there will still be much of interest, and we hope M-T players young and old will come and roleplay with us.<br><br>Questions? E-mail <a href="mailto:scholargipsy@hotmail.com">Halwyn</a> or check out the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/loklorn" target="_blank" >Elves' Website</a> to learn more about our guild.</FONT></blockquote><br>Thanks for the announcement, Halwyn!

Are you simply told what to make and you create it         (with the help of design sketches, etc.), or do you have room for your own creativity? I am an aspiring 3D artist, and was                 wondering what it is like in the workplace...

They are not the fastest forums in the world, but they are certainly efficient enough to make your use of them far more enjoyable. We will still continue to pursue even better features and performance in the future as well. We are by no means settling for this one fix. There are plans to one day to expanded the features within our forums and also improve upon their performance.<br><br>I want to thank everyone who has shown tremendous patience with us during this frustrating period. I cannot even begin to express how thankful we have been for the support and understanding most of you have shown. Please spread the word and let folks know, our forum lags are behind us.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Stratics Community Development</FONT></blockquote><br><br>I just want to say thanks to everyone who's been so patient as well.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><br><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#050056">Greetings fellow Norrathians of the Tribunal Server. My name is Ignitz Gemcaller, and I am the guildmaster of the Heroes of Valor. It is my distinct pleasure to announce to you today the start of a month long events sweep. <br><br>That's right, once a week for the entire month of August the HoV will be holding an event, and there promises to be something for all walks of the Norrathian Life to enjoy.<br><br>The first event, I am proud to say, is the first of it's kind (as far as I know). Once I read of an event where a guild held a gnome race across the world. Well, today I announce a dwarf race of the same nature, except that it is across all the known zones of Faydwer with the notable exception of Kedge Keep. That's right, all participants will create newbie dwarves and traverse Faydwer, to include Unrest, Butcherblock, and Mistmoore Castle. <br><br>As well, we are raffling off a full set of Crafted Armor for some lucky adventurer to win. This is just the beginning, and it promises to be a fun filled month. So without further ado, I will proceed to lay out the details of our first event.<br> <br>What:  Crafted Raffle<br>Where: Greater Faydark at the Wizard Spires<br>When:  After the Naked Newbie Dwarf Race (see below)<br>Rules: As of now you may log on to the Tribunal Server and begin purchasing raffle tickets for a full set of Crafted Armor for warriors. <br><br>The price is 5pp a ticket and you may purchase as many as you want. Any HoV member will take your order so long as you go to them and pay for the tickets. They will take your name down and list how many tickets you bought, then relay that information back to me. The next day you may ask me (Ignitz) what numbers you have if you wish to know. The winner will be chosen at random using the ingame random number generator. <br><br>In the event that the winner is not present to receive his/her prize then the set will be held until the winner can come collect. Proceeds from the raffle will go to support more raffles like this.  Good luck to all who wish to participate.<br><br>What:  Naked Newbie Dwarf Race across Faydwer<br>Where: Kaladim near the Paladin's guild<br>When:  Friday, August 4th at 7pm CST sharp!<br>Rules: Registration will begin at 5pm CST near the entrace to Butcherblock Mtns in Kaladim. All participants must register as the character they wish to receive the prizes should they win. When creating the newbie dwarf you must use Hov as the first three letters and the name of the character who registered as the rest. (IE. Ignitz = Hovignitz).<br><br> To make things more interesting and to add an element of strategy to he race the following rules are made:<br><br>1. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins will start at 7pm on the dot with no penalty to their start time.<br><br>2. Clerics will start at 7:01. This is to illustrate that they have a little bit better chance of surviving the race without much difficulty due to the spells that they start with.<br><br>3. Clerics may choose to accept the spell Divine Aura in order to give them an even better chance of survival, but doing so will cause you to start at 7:02.<br><br>4. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race with the spell Skin Like Diamond cast upon them. Doing so however means they will begin the race at 7:04.<br><br>5. Clerics may also begin with Skin Like Diamond with a start time of 7:05.<br><br>6. Warriors, Rogues, and Paladins may choose to begin the race with Spirit of Wolf cast upon them with a start time of 7:09.<br><br>7. Clerics can start with Spirit of Wolf at a start time of 7:10.<br> <br>The race course is laid out as follow:<br>1. Kaladim near the Paladin's Guild to Butcherblock Mtns.<br>2. BB Mtns to Dagnor's Cauldren.<br>3. Dagnor's Cauldren to Unrest.<br>4. Once in Unrest you must make your way to the back of the zone, near the backdoor of the mansion, and /poke the HoV member that will be stationed there. Once that is done you may make your way back out.<br>5. Unrest to Greater Faydark.<br>6. Greater Faydark to Crushbone.<br>7. Once in Crushbone you must make your way to the area behind the castle and find the HoV member that is there and /poke them. You may then make your way back out.<br>8. Crushbone to Felwithe.<br>9. Once in Felwithe, you must find the HoV member hidden within the city. Once you have found them, /poke them then you may make your way back out.<br>10. Felwithe to Lesser Faydark.<br>11. Lesser Faydark to Mistmoore Castle.<br>12. Once you are in Mistmoore, make your way to the other side of the lake at the bottom of the entrance ramp and /poke the HoV members that will be waiting there. You know the drill<br>13. Mistmoore Castle to Steamfont Mtns.<br>14. Steamfont Mtns to Ak'Anon.<br>15. Once in Ak'Anon you must find me (Ignitz). The first four people to /poke me are the winners of the race.<br><br>There will be HoV members in all the zones mentioned and upon entering each zone for the first time you must /shout "Naked Newbie Dwarf Race!". This is to prevent people from shortcutting. The winners will be not only the first four people to /poke me but will also be the first four people to have /shout'ed in all the zones and /poke me. If you forget to /shout the phrase but manage to be one of first four participants to /poke me, I am afraid that I will not be able to reward you on the grounds of not knowing if you actually went through all the zones (non-negotionable).<br><br>Prizes:<br>1st place: 500pp and 10 tickets to the Crafted Raffle<br>2nd place: 250pp and 5 tickets <br>3rd place: 150pp and 3 tickets<br>4th place: 100pp and 1 ticket<br><br>The prizes will be given to the character who registered the winning dwarf at the Wizard Spires in Greater Faydark, where we will also be holding the Crafted Raffle to take place immediately after the last participant finishes the race.<br><br>Good luck to all participants in both events. Questions, Comments, and <br>Concerns can be addresses by emailing me at <a href="mailto:moontayle@hotmail.com">moontayle@hotmail.com</a><br>'May Valor be your Virtue'</font></blockquote><br><br>Talk about this event with your fellow Tribunal players <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showflat.pl?Cat=8&Board=eqsrvtribunal&Number=358617&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5" target="_blank">here</a>!

There are plans to one day to expanded the features within our forums and also improve upon their performance.<br><br>I want to thank everyone who has shown tremendous patience with us during this frustrating period. I cannot even begin to express how thankful we have been for the support and understanding most of you have shown. Please spread the word and let folks know, our forum lags are behind us.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Stratics Community Development</FONT></blockquote><br><br>I just want to say thanks to everyone who's been so patient as well.

For those that aren't, here's a quick recap:<br><br>Our intention is to handle all claims in a timely manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation. Our customers diserve courteous and prompt service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.<br><br>One thing that we should have made clear in the announcement is that unfortunately, this policy is not retroactive, meaning that those who experienced loss prior to the time that the policy was announced (7/18/2000) would not be covered by the new policy. <br><br>As mentioned above, we do need to perform due diligence when investigating the claims, and though we will make reimbursements any time that we lack proof of any misconduct, we still need to have that information (backups, logs, etc.) present to perform the search. <br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>Thoughts on this new policy?

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I found this <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/064830.html" target="_blank">here</a> on the <a href="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true" target="_blank">Official Everquest Forums</a>.<br><br><blockquote><font face="Veranda" size=2 color="#a000000">Before I get into the subject of this post, let me define the rulesets in play on each of the PvP servers:<br><br>Rallos: Complete PvP. Players can attack any other player within a 4 level limit. Looting is coin plus one item, providing that the item isn't bagged, NODROP, or carried in a melee slot.<br><br>There are no faction penalties for engaging in PvP combat.<br><br>Tallon/Vallon: PvP Teams. Players can attack any other player within an 8 level limit, assuming that the target is on one of the 3 opposing teams. Looting is coin-only. There *are* faction penalties for engaging in PvP combat.<br><br>As many here have noticed, there have been drives for each of the PvP servers, most recently Rallos, to get the server switched to coin-only loot. However, though the same drive once existed for Vallon, after the change was made, there was likewise a drive to switch it back to item-loot. This suggests that while there are people who enjoy coin-only loot, there are also people who enjoy item-loot.<br><br>The difficulty that we are faced with is trying to make everyone happy. Simply implementing majority will on each server doesn't accomplish that objective, as it addresses the needs of the pro-coin crowd without taking care of the pro-loot crowd. As much as both groups come here insisting that "everyone" wants what they want, I don't think that anyone can truly deny that both groups exist.<br><br>Right now, we have two servers where coin-loot is in operation, and one where item-loot is the rule. That layout is roughly equivalent to the percentages that enjoy coin-loot versus item loot. The third who enjoy item loot, though technically the minority, are still a significant portion of the gaming populace, and as such should have their concerns addressed as well. <br><br>Rather than just changing Rallos to coin-loot, it's been suggested that we allow people a one-time chance to move between the PvP servers. Though we are not yet prepared to commit to a plan of that nature, I do want to get everyone's opinion as to whether or not they would find such a plan acceptable. <br><br>If we were to allow moves, a two-step process would be used. First, Rallos people would be given the option to move to Vallon or Tallon (by choice), then Vallon and Tallon people would be given the opportunity to move to Rallos. If moved, players would suddenly find<br>themselves in a new ruleset, subject to every facet of that ruleset. <br><br>Former Rallos players would find themselves on teams, in an environment that discourages socialization outside of your team. They would suddenly be subject to attack in an 8 level limit, and would take race-based faction hits for any PvP kills made. Players with strange deity selections (e.g. Half elf worshipping Innoruuk) would suddenly find themselves homeless for all intents and purposes. <br><br>Former team-server players moving to Rallos would have their ability to engage in combat restricted to a 4 level limit, and be subject to attack and able to attack anyone in that range. Any race-based faction penalties assigned while on the Team servers would follow to Rallos, and would not be reset.<br><br>Players on all PvP servers would encounter an influx of characters of all levels, who wouldn't be completely familiar with any server-specific player-originated rules of etiquette that may be in place. It is possible that aspects once understood as a "given" within the server community might break down and be no more. <br><br>It may sound like I'm trying to discourage acquiescence to this change, however I just want to be sure that all aspects of the proposal are understood prior to anyone giving an opinion on the matter. If done, the change would likely be the biggest to be made to any server community in EverQuest, and we want to be sure that everyone is well-informed.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockquote><br><br>What are your thoughts?

What follows is a story that im sure many of you can relate to. <br><br>My guild had decided to do the Lucan raid in freeport for a guildmate of ours. Being a small guild we needed to call on other guilds to help out. Agter about an hour of gettin everybody together outside the gates we were finnaly ready. We all lined up against the wall to wait for the puller to bring lucan and all the rest of the guards out so we could get lucan alone. At the last minute before the pull a guy ran up to my group, being that we only had 5 in my group I put him into our group. <br><br>Lucan was pulled, seperated, and died in a huge barrage of sword and magic, we laid waste to him post haste. The guildmate who was to loot lucan had to zone on the initial pull, while we were waiting for him to reappear and loot the 6th man i had put into group decided that since he too was in need of a soulfire he should loot the no-drop item. We had been in the zone a good hour before the pull, everybody there knew why we were there and who was to loot. When i asked him why he looted he told me because he needed the piece as well. <br><br>This was not acceptable. We all petitioned and reported the ninja loot. After about an hour a guide showed up and talked to the ninja-looter and decided there was nothing he could do but leave a report for drembo, our server gm. About this time my frekkin power goes out. I finally get power back to my house several hours later to find out good has prevailed. Drembo showed up took the item away and gave it to our guildmate. For all those of you have complaints about your gm i say, come to tarew marr where drembo rules fairly and just.</FONT></blockquote><br><FONT color="#050056" face="Veranda" size=2>Editors Note:  I'm encouraged to see that more is being done to deal with those who ninja loot out of turn.

The thread is locked now, but if you would like to engage in reading a long but well done thread here's the link:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html<br>" target="_blank" >http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/056546.html<br></a> <br><br>Abashi was kind enough to respond to the thread and shot the idea down, but what he responded to was not what we were asking for so that generated another thread where we posted exactly what we wanted.  Our thoughts are to only ask for a server designated as being role-playing (much the same way as they have done for the PvP servers except they would be no code additions or deletions).  The players would do the rest.  We really don't think this is a lot to ask for and we feel it can only have a positive affect of EQ.  I won't go into the entire thread here, but if you wish to read the thread and show your support then take the link below:<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html" target="_blank" >http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410.html<br></a> <br><br>We're not asking for more skills, items, spells, or anything else that would affect the game balance. Time and time again we've jumped from server to server claiming it for role-playing but we've become to spread out and more of the minority on all the servers then we ever were before.  All we want is a clear cut home for role-players.  We really don't think that's a lot to ask.<br><br>An in game poll is a suggestion we have also that would let Verant get an idea of how many players would be interested.<br><br>Thanks again for your time and safe travels my friends.<br><br>Morgian Cessair</FONT></blockquote> <br><br>You can talk about this story <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showthreaded.pl?Cat=7&Board=eqwestwood&Number=357402&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&part=&vc=1" target="_blank">here.</a>

As you know, we previously ruled out such an option for various reasons, not the least of which were technical limitations.<br><br>After considering issue for some time, and taking into account the customer-service issues created by those who loot corpses and steal items under the guise of /consent, we've decided that a change to its operation is warranted. In the next patch, /consent will be changed to give permission to drag the corpse only, not to loot it. Other people<br>will not be able to loot your corpse. <br><br>Though we realize that some will miss the ability to /consent in the previous fashion, the proliferation of NODROP items in game has made asking someone else to loot your corpse a very infrequent event. Given the ability to do one or the other, consent for loot, or consent for drag, we believe that most people would prefer the option to /consent for drag.<br><br>We hope that this change will address everyone's concerns by eliminating the amount of antisocial conduct that surrounds corpse looting.<br><br>-Gordon</font></blockqoute><br><br>Talk about it on the <A HREF="http://boards.stratics.com/cgi-bin/boards/eq/showthreaded.pl?Cat=7,8,9,10,11&Board=eqwestwood&Number=354951&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5" target="_blank">here</a> Stratics forums!<br>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><font color=#a000000 face="Veranda" size=2>July 19th, 7:00am<br>-----------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*<br><br>- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to someplace "safer".<br>- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.  <br>- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity filter.<br>- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked doors.<br>- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against non-moving, non-rooted targets.  These restrictions allowed us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".<br>- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history.  The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that the old one was.<br>- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.  <br>- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons.  Take care to take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br><br>*Poison*<br><br>- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.<br>- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".<br>- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br><br>*General Crafts*<br><br>- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be crafted.<br>- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item".  <br><br>*Items*<br><br>- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br>- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around in the world.  Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".<br>- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a bit more useful.<br>- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time.  The function of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br><br><br>*/consent*<br><br>Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds.  Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report.  Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can undo it.<br><br>*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*<br><br>There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule.  Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you alone.  The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their faction.<br><br>*Regen Effects*<br><br>This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while under the affect of regen.<br><br>*Keyed Dungeons*<br><br>The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago.  Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point.  We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br><br>*Barbed Scale Whip*<br><br>In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already in-game.  It has been changed back to its original stats.<br><br>*Hiding Corpses*<br><br>A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client.  This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen.  This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay.  It will be particularly useful in the planes.  The command supports the following arguments:<br><br>- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your group.<br>- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br><br>For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone.  You can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it. <br><br>*Resurrection*<br><br>The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting.  Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES.  Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote><br>

From this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to players that have lost them due to bugs. We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost. Please be aware, if we catch people lying to us (i.e. a person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded it to someone) we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. We think it's important that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they aren't telling the truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a lot of people trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it.<br><br>2) We're in the process of adding a lot more GM's. In addition, we're<br>adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better accommodate our<br>International users. We're also adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off hours.<br><br>3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was split between this facility and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff to better accommodate players.<br><br>4) We've modified our Internal procedures with regards to how our GM's<br>treat players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important to us that our Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, so we've been working with our GM's to try and make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive ones. In addition, we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you, please email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at <a href=mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com>gscotto@station.sony.com</a><br><br>5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future.<br><br>6) We've put a new email system in place that should help ensure quick<br>response.<br><br>7) A different version of the Online Store will be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able to order Kunark from it once it's up.<br><br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</font></blockquote><br><br>Wow sounds great.

He or she are at home in a group at all levels or soloing up into the higher levels. The class, however, really shines for soloing in the mid levels from eight to the high twenties. The class can be successfully soloed beyond the twenties, but the game is designed to move you into dungeons once you get into the thirties. Dungeons, by their nature, are best approached in groups to reduce the risk to the player. So up through the twenties         you can still find great hunting grounds outside where the magician&#8217;s solo skills are some of the best in the game.<br>      </blockquote><br>      </font><br><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes/magician/classes_mag_comprehensive_pt1.shtml"> Here </a> is the complete article.

I am &#8216;Ester the Tester&#8217; (yes it rhymes) and I have asked Abashi to post a letter from the testing department to all of our players. I attended the EQGathering this weekend and spent quite a bit of time listening to players concerns. I felt that having Abashi put up a post detailing what the testing department is and is not may help the communication process between us and you the players.<br><br>What we do:<br>1. We read each and every email sent to eqtesting@verant.com<br>2. We read the bug reports as often as we can<br>3. We attempt to the best of our abilities to reproduce the bugs the players send us<br>4. We assign bugs to the Development Team.<br><br>What we do not do:<br>1. We do not have creative control over anything in game<br>2. We do not continue reading emails if they are abusive or flames<br>3. We do not do reimbursals<br>4. We do not respond to any emails, if we did this nothing else would get done<br><br>I would like to list a few things that if included in the emails and bug reports that would make it much easier for us to reproduce the situations.<br>1. Zone name<br>2. Location -- /loc <br>3. Full names of NPC&#8217;s<br>4. Full names of items &#8211; not abbreviations, I don&#8217;t know all of them!!<br>5. Location<br>6. Any mitigating circumstances even if they seem trivial (you&#8217;d be surprised)<br>7. Location<br>8. Server &#8211; even on bug reports, some times they get shuffled<br>9. Location<br>10. Did I mention Location???<br>11. Server name<br>12. Location<br><br>If you are reporting a broken quest PLEASE include the starting NPC&#8217;s full name, the zone it is in, the NPC&#8217;s loc, and the phrase used to trigger the quest. This will save us SO much time when reproducing these bugs.<br><br>Something else that is useful is the threads that talk about broken quests, or bugs in the game. It is a little difficult to sort out the wish lists, flames, complaints, but we have pulled bugs out of those threads and some of them are already fixed.<br><br>I am a firm believer in communication. I as also a firm believer in EverQuest, and the team of testers I work with. There are some things we just don&#8217;t catch. We haven&#8217;t played every class race combination to 60, so we desperately need your input. Please remember that the testing department can not change anything fundamental in the game, so the rants and flames are a waste of your and my time. To be honest, when I get an email that is offensive I stop reading right there. It is the same with posts. I do lurk on these boards, and I communicate frequently with Abashi. Sometimes he will ask for more information and clarification. This is usually me asking him to find me some more information so we can reproduce whatever bug you are talking about. <br><br>Thank you for playing EverQuest and caring so much about this game. I do promise to lurk and read. I&#8217;ll never post, but if Abashi says Ester the Tester said&#8230; well that was me.<br><br>Ester the Tester<br>Quality Assurance<br>Verant Interactive, Inc. <br>

Almost every other Ranger I know and have heard agrees that for this spell to be useful it needs to have about a 1.5 casting time and be unresistable or close to it.

Yet the same or BETTER weapons are available to warriors (test it out for yourself &#8211; level 55+ warrior duel wielding lamentations or jade maces will out damage a monk) which offer stat (str, stamina hp, resists etc) ADVANTAGES and no drawbacks to them. In addition to this, warrior Kicks are now more useful and in some situations far superior to the monk kick. These warrior weapons when combined with warrior equipment make them superior tanks and equal damage dealers with monks, with proc&#8217;s like snare and stun making them an even more USEFULL melee classes. Monks are being marginalized and forced to accept punitive penalties (in weight) in order to wield similar weapons or even less effective weapons. I think the situation should be looked into, perhaps some low delay low weight monk quest or dropped items can be introduced, or the weight on some of the existing items (stave of shielding, jade mace) can be reduced. <br><br><font color="#a00000"><br>Actually, the only time that I believe I made any statement in the form of a percentage was when we put in the innate haste for monk hand speeds. As I recall, the statement was something along the lines of 'High level monks should now do roughly 15% more damage'. I don't believe I ever made a statement comparing them to a similarly equipped warrior, other than to state that they should generally do more damage. Correct me if I'm wrong.<br><br>That said, monks are still the best toe-to-toe melee damage dealer, which is right where they are supposed to be.

It's not even coming close to the effectiveness of clerics (as I've been told by them using divine light instead). But it would permit the occasional group to exist without a cleric.

Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost.<br>- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive. <br>- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you have been selected until after the move is actually completed.<br>- Karana and Terris-Thule will be down for several additional hours on Tuesday, the day of the next patch.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <blockquote><font color=050056 face="Veranda" size=2>Raid On Freeport happened July 9th on the Innoruuk Server <br><br>Over a month ago, I(Grimthorn, leader of Kult of Death) began to spread <br>word to those of evil guilds and those of evil race that a Raid on <br>Freeport is planned. We were to march through West Freeport and then <br>move north into the courtyard of Temple of Marr. Alliances and Treaties <br>had been formed, to achieve this single goal. Death to many Paladins. <br><br>Here is an account of that day: <br><br>Grimthorn, the leader of the Kult of Death rose proudly. <br><br>The final day had come. Hordes of Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls gathered <br>in Eastern Commons near the Nekulos forest. The ranks of <br>the evil forces swelled and continued to grow over every passing moment. <br>Constant messages were being sent to Grimthorn of yet more to arrive. <br>Many were eager to claim the death of a Paladin. <br><br>Roughly around one hundred joined together in this mass legion of <br>darkness. Assigning duties to a few honorable members in the <br>ranks, I attempted to reign in the mass confusion such great numbers <br>produce. <br><br>In Freeport, the guards that held their post could hear feint shouts and <br>cheers far off in the distance. A messenger was despatched to their <br>general. <br><br>Finally, time was close at hand, the army had built itself into a <br>surmountable frenzy of the killing yet to come. The main army had <br>advance to into place while I frantically ran back to grab the last few <br>groups. <br><br>The army moved within view of the city gates, as humans behind the wall <br>quickly moved about as if this was part of a natural routine. <br>The hate built within many Dark Elves. Ogres muscles tensed up straining <br>not to be unleashed on a friend, and the Trolls drooled with <br>thrist for blood. <br><br>Once I had turned around to head back to the glories army that was to <br>destory the hated human city, I had heard the war cry sound across the <br>valley in a roaring thunder of blood driven rage. The army had charged <br>the West Gate! <br><br>"NOOOOO!!!", I screamed. Immediately I knew all the month long planning <br>was becoming unraveled. The powerful front gate guards I knew were not <br>going to be pulled properly so the forces can pass through with minimal <br>risk. I rushed back to the front line as fast as I could go. <br><br>The humans had set their city defenses in preparation for the attack. <br>Somehow they found out more then should have been allowed. <br>Determined to hold the West Gate the HumanÕs clashed swords with the <br>mighty horde. Under estimating the skill of the knights, the <br>army began to crumble beneath their flashing quick blades. <br><br>As I ran back, I passed small groups of the army fleeing back to caves, <br>forest and swamps for security. A large portion of the army lay <br>slain on the dry sandy ground of West Freeport. Yet I saw others still <br>fighting and holding ground within the City. <br><br>The humans had been prepared. Grimthorn knew he had to reorganize and <br>attack the city from a new direction. <br><br>Contacting leaders within the army and hidden scouts, I found that <br>everyone was completely scattered. Some had followed the intended <br>route and were holding there own in West Freeport, some had divided off <br>into the tunnels and hid in its secured darkness, a small force <br>had actually went invisible and waited for the rest of the forces in the <br>courtyard of the Temple of Marr, and a few unlucky others had <br>wondered deeper into the city only to be taken down quickly. Chaos had a <br>firm grip at that moment. <br><br>The humans began to methodically search the city for lost members of the <br>horde and cut them down. They felt victory was near. <br><br>Leaders and myself began to ralley the forces once more, directing <br>everyone into the tunnels. I noticed we had lost over a signifacant <br>amount of the intial army, yet those that remained still hungered for <br>vengence. <br><br>Fortunately the humans became too confident in their victory. <br><br>Regrouped we charged out of the tunnels and stood at the back side of <br>the Temple of Marr. There is where we stood. Guards and <br>Paladins where lured into an army crazed for blood. We easily held the <br>ground and many of the humans died. <br><br>Overlord of Death, <br>Grimthorn <br><br>The army never reached the courtyard of Temple of Marr as intended, but <br>we had maintained control of the North Section of Freeport <br>unquestionalibly. The confusion in the beganning was due to the <br>overwhelming amount of peopled that showed up and in upcoming <br>events this will not happen again since I know now how handle it. <br><br>Kult of Death would like to thank all the guilds that participated, <br><br>Grobb Skwad <br>Daughters of Innoruuk <br>Carpe Noctem <br>Scorched Heart <br>Pirates of Dark Tide <br>Olath VelgÕ Larrn <br>also the many other guilds and individuals that participated <br><br>A specail thanks to Zolgar and Steelheart who helped in organizing the <br>army <br></blockquote></font><br>

The sheer volume of usage we receive on a daily basis, particularly during the afternoon hours, has actually bogged down our boards server to the point where it is barely functional during peak usage.<br><br>The software we have uses a MySQL backend that is normally faster than the standard ASCII file formats used by most major forum products. But what we&#8217;ve found out the hard way is, you cannot run the forum software (with the large volume of visitors we have) and also run the MySQL server on the same machine. So we have a new server on the way, which will be used to run the MySQL server exclusively, thus freeing up the forum software on it&#8217;s own box. Basically speaking, we&#8217;re going to split the two separate applications in two with each having it&#8217;s own server to run on (freeing up each to use it&#8217;s own CPU). You should see a major improvement once this has been done.<br><br>The new server is expected to go online some time next week. So please bear with us folks, we&#8217;re very well aware of the problem. We too are frustrated beyond belief and we will do whatever it takes to get the speed and performance of our forums back to where they belong. Once everything is running smoothly again, the forums will be flying once again. Load times will be reduced to mere seconds and you&#8217;ll have a much more enjoyable time using our forums.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Jhariden<br>Stratics Community Development</blockquote></font>

This week Milo dishes out his colorful responses with a sugar coated tongue. (Heh, yeah right).

Great read as always, here's a snip.<br><br>    <Blockquote><br>    Question: Why do the loved-by-all Guides have the coolest graphics like the electric sword and hot looking green plate armor         while the people who are paying for the game get nothing but totems that look like a little dolly no matter how bad-ass it should     look. My point is that there are allot of graphics in the game that could be improved to make the customers happy. Instead it         looks like Verant is more concerned with making those that don't pay for the game happy, I.e guides.<br>    </blockquote><br> <br>Catalyst<br>Everlore -- All things EverQuest<br><a href="http://www.everlore.com">http://www.everlore.com</a>

The event went *very* well and I'd like to extend thanks to all of those who attended. I imagine that those who didn't go will be able to view reports being given by various web sites, many of whom were in attendance. <br><br>Several events took place at the gathering, including a Trivia Contest and the "RealLife Quest", an EQ oriented scavenger hunt. Kudo's goes to one of the groups of Rangers for winning the Trivia Contest, and to a team from Povar who took the "RealLife Quest" by gathering nearly 80 items found regularly within the game. One of the more creative items<br>turned in was a real human tooth submitted to represent the "Giant Elephant Tusk" in the scavenger hunt. <br><br>Overall, the Team here at Verant enjoyed the chance to meet the players and discuss the issues at hand. I personally had the chance to speak with several hundred people, quite a few here from the boards, and found the whole experience very positive and refreshing. We definitely look forward to going to the next one.<br><br>Thank you all,<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Internet Relations Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</font></blockquote>

I waited and Auriella never showed. She was having heart problems. This morning at 3:15 eastern time the young woman behind Auriella, Elisa...died peacefully of heart failure. What started as just words and text on a screen between her and I developed into something more serious and heartfelt as time passed by. I loved her with all my heart. I cannot begin to explain the tornado thats ripping apart my heart as I write this. Not knowing what to say...not knowing what to think...not knowing how to act. Elisa loved this game we all played. When I started playing EQ, I never planned on something to happen like what happened between her and I. It all started as just two people playing a game somewhere. Just a game. Thats all this was supposed to be...a game. Nothing more...nothing less. Auriella/Elisa always treated people kindly, with love, and respect. She taught me alot about myself and helped me be a better man. <br><br>They say Solusek Ro is the worst server. People KS, people hog camps, people do bad things to each other...there is a NAG board which sits as an open doorway for people to rip each other apart. Behind every character is someone sitting somewhere, typing at a keyboard. Full of emotion and heart. For anyone that ever treated Elisa wrong in game as her character Elizza or Auriella, no one will ever be able to say "I am sorry" to her.<br><br>Elisa always wanted the good things EQ was supposed to be. She wanted to just have fun, she didn't care about items. She wanted to see people be treated decently and RP and just have fun. To just play the game and treat everyone she ran into with love and respect. Is it that hard to do? Is it so hard to love and respect someone else? How hard is it to show compassion to a stranger?<br><br>I don't know if any of this makes much sense right now. Elisa was a bright soul on this earth of gods. I thought in all my years online I would never have to write something like all this, especially about someone I loved. She made a good example. The next time you see someone in game...please think about this. Think about all this. When you get mad...think about the alternatives. Think about the person on the other side...there is someone there that has a heart...someone that has feelings and emotions, even past text on a screen, past items, and past leveling...theres a human being there.<br><br>"You'll be Loved Always"<br><br>Where have all the flowers gone,<br>*this one last rose I lay for you.<br>Into sunset fields will lay eternity,<br>*yonder cascadance upon the horizon.<br>To dream the dream of dreams,<br>*with but one final passionate whisp.<br>Yet to stand alone in a moment as forever,<br>*is but torment on these lips.<br>Your heart shines in that night,<br>*as a falling star.<br>Then the world does fade from view,<br>*hearts forever wear a scar.<br>To know the grace of heaven,<br>*as all the love to set on by.<br>They say life is but a stage,<br>*yet within this final act.<br>Hearts a sorrow without any mercy,<br>*when the curtain draws to shear.<br>Yet when that star comes down from heaven,<br>*I know never to fear.<br>For you'll be loved always,<br>*in every falling tear.<br><br><br>In loving memory of Elisa McKnyght<br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br></font> </BLOCKQUOTE>

I have recently have reached enough level to start adventuring in planes and also do fire giants and also the dragons but only to find to my great disappointment that I cannot enjoy these raid due to the fact that all the raid are placned to be held at very early morning hours most of them being held at 3 am - 9 am which is impossible for me and a majority of other players to attend such raids except where they are held during the weekend which is still not a good time to play.<br><br>Well I am bringing this to the attention to all European players to step ahead and get to gather and organize a few raids for us to attend at a decent time for us. I have seen many posts regarding this situation and it is time for us European players to have some fun as well. So what am I asking? Well I advice all European players to please email me and post on the forum there name and level and class and time they are on so we get organize a raid where we are awake and having a good time and not fighting to remain awake and working in 4 hours or so. We can raid almost anything we like at the early evenings as the servers are not busy and low populated and Fire Giant raids are easily made as well as any other planes.<br><br>I am also leader of Knights Crusade and invite any people who are not in a guild to join us to make grouping much easier and everquest much more enjoyable.<br><br>My email address is <a href=mailto:omargalea@vol.net.mt>omargalea@vol.net.mt</a> And Knights<br>Crusade web pages is at <a href=http://www.geocities.com/knightscrusade target="_blank">www.geocities.com/knightscrusade</a>.<br><br>It is all to your interest and enjoyment I am doing in this and it is all possible with all your help.

This story has been heard by many among the outpost, but to this day no parties have been dispatched in search of the truth, until now.<br> <br>This Saturday, July 8th, at 3 PM EST, Eldrad the General will be leading an expedition to these caverns. This raid is for anyone levels 10 - 25 who would like the chance to check out Kurn's Tower and see what it has to offer. It's a nice dungeon for the younger levels, with somce decent loot for the levels required, and in addition for the raid many monsters will be given new and better high level items to fight with (which will come out as loot when they die). Kurn's Tower is located in the Field of Bone. It's a far hike for the Firiona Vie outpost, so if you can't bind yourself it could be a problem, unless you're welcome enough in Cabilis to bind there (killing a lot of sarnaks and kunark goblins will help factions with most of the guards)<br> <br>If you'd like to come, or donate items for quest rewards/monster loot, send email to <a href=mailto:eldrad@tarewmarr.net>eldrad@tarewmarr.net</a> and/or check out the Tarew Marr Community Center at <a href=http://www.tarewmarr.net target="_blank">http://www.tarewmarr.net</a><br> <br>Once again the time is 3 PM EST this saturday. The raid will begin at that time with or without you. If you need time to travel there, I'd suggest doing it the night before and camping there, or leaving extra early. The raid forces will be gathering at the bottom of the ramp the leads up, around and into the castle, around 2 PM and going in at 3 PM. Also there should be a few high level players in the zone hosting the event, to help keep some of the "kids" alive, and to hopefully provide revives or resurections to those who die but are bound far away and can't get back themselves.<br> <br>Hope to see ya there :)<br> <br>--Eldrad the General<br>  Tarew Marr</font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <FONT color=#050056 face="Veranda" size=2><blockquote>Yesterday two changes occurred at EQSS which will improve the overall performance of this site.<br><br>1)  The EQSS WebServer (<a href="http://eq.stratics.com">http://eq.stratics.com</a>) has moved to a new physical machine.  This may <b>temporarily</b> result in connection problems for a small number of visitors as the DNS changes proliferate throughout the Internet.  Unfortunately, those users affected by this issue will not actually see this news item until they get the new DNS address, so if you've had any problems accessing the site in the last few days since Thursday, July 6th, I apologize.  The new server is faster and has more capacity, so we're very happy with the move.<br><br>2)  We have installed a new caching module to the Forums server which, we hope, will greatly improve the performance of our forums during the day.  We are most painfully aware of just how horrendous the performance has been in the last few weeks, and we are sorry that we haven't been able to move faster in addressing the problem, but unfortunately, the delays we'd experienced were beyond our control.  We are very hopeful that this new module will greatly improve prime-time (just after lunch, EST till about 5pm PST) performance for not only the EQ forums, but all our gaming network forums.  If you've been avoiding the forums because of the speed, now is the time to try them out again - because the more people we have hitting it, the better we'll know how effective the solution has been.<br><br>Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.  If you continue to experience any difficulties with our site, please contact <a href="mailto:greebo@stratics.com">Greebo</a> (me) at your earliest convenience.<br><br>Best wishes and good hunting,<br><br>Greebo<br>EQSS Project Manager<br><a href="http://eq.stratics.com">Stratics EverQuest</a> </FONT></blockquote>

I think "bug" is probably not the correct term to describe why hell levels are there. "Unintended Mathematical Consequence" would probably be a better description. Trying to put it in easy terms:<br><br>Basically, everyone knows that the experience needed at every level is a curve. Well, it's not so much a curve, as it is a series of straight lines. As you level, the "curve" gets steeper. However, due to the formula used, in the first level after the curve gets steeper, you must "make up" all of the experience as if the curve had been that steep all along. As such, a "Hell Level" is the first level where a new experience curve took affect. Ideally, it would have been nice if the formula spread the additional experience required over all the levels of the next range, rather than requiring it all in one level, but the outcome is the same.<br><br>As for 50+, it's probably safe to say that experience required in those levels won't be on the same curve as 45-50, and as such, any time the curve steepens, the "Hell Level Phenomenon" will be present for the first level of the new curve.<br><br>Basically, this is just the way it is, and we won't be readjusting the experience curves. They haven't been changed since release, and no one ever said that progression would be linear.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>

This is how the gaming industry works. You grab their attention and keep it as long as you can.<br><br>I don't think that this qualifies as a "rake it in while we can" policy, at least not in a negative sense. We provide a service offering and people decide whether or not they want to be our subscribers. This service offering is flexible, but only to the point that it remains the same offering. Given infinite resources, sure, we have tons of things that we could do for EQ, but will only do those things that make the game "EQ". We won't risk completely changing gameplay to the point that we'd lose the magic that is responsible for EQ's success.<br><br>But as for us not having "competition", we currently enjoy about half of the marketshare among those playing the 3 MMORPGs out there. That's fairly indicative of some current competition. If you recall, EQ was supposed to "Kill" the top MMORPG of the time (UO), and was supposed to be "Killed" by the next (AC). Niether of those things happened, as we all continue to co-exist peacefully. We each provide a niche that a varying and increasing number of subscribers enjoy.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>

Players wishing to have their characters moved to the new split server will need to run the command "/movelog yes" after registration is opened. <br><br>Notes: <br><br>- /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count for all characters on that server on that account. <br><br>- Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down tomorrow morning (9am PDT). Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost. <br><br>- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive. <br><br>- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you have been selected until after the move is actually completed. <br><br>- Test Server Players with artificially buffed characters on their account *MUST* delete those characters prior to registering for move. Having artificially buffed characters moved to the live servers will result in action against the player's account. <br><br>Item Changes Pending in Next Patch <br><br>In the next patch, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Howling Stones will all be made NODROP if not currently set with that flag. This means that people holding more than one key will not be able to hand out their extras after the patch. <br><br>At the same time that this change is made, we are also implementing a new change that "binds" these items to your character. Should you die with one of these keys in your possession, it will not be left on your corpse, but will stay with you when you return to your bindpoint. <br><br>This change was made in light of the difficulty of the key-quests, in order to eliminate the need to do the quest multiple times prior to entering the dungeon. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br>
