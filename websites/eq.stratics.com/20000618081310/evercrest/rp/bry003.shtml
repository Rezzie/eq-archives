Knock! Knock!
The sound awoke Bryan as he wearily got up out of his bed.
Knock! Knock!
"Geez hold on! Im coming!"
Knock! Knock!
"Cant ye hold..."
<br><br>
His words stopped as the door opened and in came a raging Dark Elf
"Thee will pay for your horrible crimes!"
<br><br>
The dagger came swifting through the air and Bryan strafed to the left just
to miss it.
Stumbling back he fell onto his bed and reached for his bag hoping to get
his daggers.
<br><br>
Another strike came, Bryan started to bellow as deep as he could, when the
bellow was completed
the dark elf stumbled back in pain. Bryan ran for his bag and grabbed both
his daggers.
He started to bellow and slashed the Dark Elf. Bryan held back his dagger
and 3 more dark elfs
strolled into the room.
<br><br>
"I wouldn't do that if I were thee."
Bryan looked down to see the body squirming with fear on the ground. Murming
something he backed off
The dark elf walked up and pulled the dagger from his belt held it up.
"You have disgraced us!"
Than down came the dagger and landed on the dark elf in which he had
struggled with earlier. The dark
elf let out a gasp of air and closed his eyes.
The dark elf backed away from the corpse leaving the dagger in it.
<br><br>
Bryan stumbled back and wondered how the Dark Elfs got in.
The Dark Elf came closer. "You will show us all you know!"
Than the Dark Elf lifted his hand into the air and swung it down.
Blackness...
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
"Get up fool!"
<br><br>
Bryan blinked his eyes to the dark elf holding a dagger at his face.
<br><br>
"Dont you hear me? Get up!"
<br><br>
Bryan sat up and looked around. He was deep into a cave... not knowing what
had happened to anything.
He looked to the corner and saw his brown bag. He could see the top of his
lute hanging out.
<br><br>
Another Dark Elf walked in, "Has he awoken yet?"
<br><br>
"Just got up sir!" another Dark Elf replied.
<br><br>
"Good! Bring him to the cell immidietly!"
<br><br>
"Yes sir!"
<br><br>
"Come on music boy!"
<br><br>
The Dark Elf grabbed Bryan and pulled him over to the door. What happened
next surprised Bryan.
The Dark Elf slipped a dagger into Bryan's pocket as well as a note. Bryan
nodded to the Dark Elf and walked through
the door.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
"Ahhh.. Here you are!"
A much older dark elf said to Bryan. He looked like strong wizard of some
sort. Lookin to the table in the corner he saw a
book. He knew right than this guy was a spell caster. The heavy door closed
and the cave rumbled. The Dark Elf started
casting a spell, and chanted some words he had never heard before. Than
remembering the dagger jabbed it into the
Dark Elfs heart. The Dark Elf stumbled back getting released from the dagger
and reached back for his staff. Casting a
faster spell Bryan felt his skin smulder. Than two more times he jabbed the
dagger into the dark elf and let out two great
bellows. He soon fell back casting some spell and the magic came off his
fingers, Bryan fell to the floor in pain...
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
"Wake up good sir!"
<br><br>
He was outside the cave. This was happening to much now. Waking up once
more. He rubbed his head. This is beginning
to become to much. What did those dark elfs want?
<br><br>
"Sir? You alright?"
<br><br>
He looked up... The sun was gleaming in his eyes. He looked around and saw a
cave with a dead dark elf outside.
<br><br>
"Sir?"
<br><br>
He looked up...
It was a female wood elf.
<br><br>
"Ugh, Hail."
<br><br>
"Sir you look pretty wounded. Here this should help"
With a few words from her lips, what looked like water streamed from her
fingers... She continued to wave her hands
and Bryan's wounds slowly disappeared.
<br><br>
"Thank you m'lady. Where are we?"
<br><br>
"That is something I cannot tell thee. Cmon get up now."
<br><br>
Bryan got up and turned around. The wood elf swung at him and he dodged. She
continued to swing until she was
just to tired.
"What do you want from me?" He shouted.
<br><br>
"You must die!"
<br><br>
The beautiful wood elf he knew transformed into a Dark Elf.
<br><br>
Bryan than felt a surge of adrenaline flow through him and his eyes became
dark, He didn't know what was happening
Than all of a sudden his arms felt like they were about to explode. He swung
his fist right into the dark elfs face. And
continued to swing like a wild animal. Anger giving him the strength. The
dark elf than fell to the ground in pain.
While on the floor Bryan reached for the dagger from the Dark Elf and
stabbed him multiple times. Looking around
Bryan didn't see anything but a straight flat desert. He started to sing a
song with a little bit of a beat and started running.
<br><br>
Not knowing where he was going.
