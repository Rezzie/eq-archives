 Ah! I remember Sunday evening well! I had a truly successful outing in the Western Commonlands, before tiring very latein the evening. I camped at the entrance to the gorge leading to Kithicor Woods, planning to resume my hunt at noon the next day. Imagine my surprise when I awoke in Misty Thicket without a single piece of equipment. Had I been sleepwalking? Had some rougue drugged me, and deposited me here as a joke? Small difference, the thing to do was to return to my camp and collect my things. Alas, my arrival at my camp site found not even the ashes of my fire, much less my gear. I searched the entire Western Commonlands, but to no avail. Heart sinking, I quickly calculated my loss. Just over 118 p.p.! And me with only 4 platinum in the bank after buying that Chain Neckguard! I was doomed. A warrior without armour or weapons is no more than a tavern bully. Falling to my knees in despair, I petitioned the very Gods to help me, but there was no answer. Making my sorry way back home, to Rivervale, I withdrew one of my precious platinum pieces from the bank, and bought some food and water to sustain me. Knowing my career as a Warrior was over, I decided to return to the fish mongering days of my youth. I purchased bait and pole, and set about making my fortune catching and selling fish. For perhaps two ours I performed this drudgery, calling to mind why I had wanted to be a Warrior in the first place. As I sullenly mulled over starting anew, there came a sudden voice behind me, though I heard no footsteps approach. "Hello Tymbryn" said the voice, in an unmistakable Elven lilt. Well, only my mother calls me by my full name, and she's certainly no Elf. I spun around, fishing pole still in hand, only to be struck dumb. Not Elven, but Half, and a true beauty. Setting several large bundles on the groud before me, she said "Take these, they should help!". Numbly, I peeked inside the bundles, and realized what I should have known straight off. This Half-Elven beauty was an Avatar of the Gods! The bags and bundles were filled with a complete set of chainmail armour, and one shiny new Two Handed Sword (the absurdity of a Halfling wielding a two hander most likely never occurred to her, and I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth!). I quickly informed the Avatar that this was far more than I had lost, her only answer was a smile and a happy "Good, then they WILL help!". With that, the lovely vision began to fade away in swirls of bluish light, so I shouted "Thank You, My Lady!". Came her voice to me one last time, "Remember this Tymbryn. These things are a gift from the Gods to YOU, no other must ever touch them. Before that happens, you must destroy them. Good Luck!". She was gone, but I took her words to heart, and quickly broke the two hander asunder. No Halfling could use a sword so large to any effect, and I would have no other hands sully it. I went and used my last coin to purchase two Short Swords, and headed merrily back to the Western Commonlands. I had a hearty appetite for the hunt, and Tym the Warrior had both the gifts and the favour of the Gods!
