Yes, yes, yes, some say Warriors suck as of right now and that may also be true.  But let is look at what you are asking.  You want them to have faster healing rates.  Well that is great.  Instead of hearing "Warriors suck" we will not hear "Trolls suck" or "Bards suck, Warriors can heal just as fast."<p>I personally would rather have a Warrior in the group then a Monk or Rogue or Bard or what have you.  This would be for 2 or 3 man team.  In a larger group, Warriors would be welcome just as much as a Monk, Rogue or Bard.  Hell, I am a Cleric.  I like seeing the 2 bubbles of life shoot up to 3 when I heal a Warrior.  Rather then 2 bubbles shooting up to full health when healing a Mage.  It is quite humbling seeing how much HP per bubble a Warrior has over other classes (even my own).<p>I can understand why Taunting would not have helped in that situation.  When a MOB is on a character that has less then 2 bubbles (as you described) then they become frezied on them.  The see this person as someone who they can kill with a few more hits.  Look at us.  If you were attacking my friend in PvP and he had 2 bubbles of life left, would you turn to attack me if I said, "Stop attacking him and fight me you big horses ass!"  Well, this is essentially what Taunting is.  If you KNOW you can kill someone within a few more hits, why turn on someone else if they are calling you names or otherwise Taunting you?  Now if you were fighting 2 people at once and one was constantly taunting you, sure, share the damage with both of them.  This is how frenzied monsters act which is not that hard to understand because any good WARRIOR would act that way too.<p>No class is designed for soloing, least of which the Warrior.  This is a group game, meant for parties.  Each character class compliments another.  Warriors take the damage and deal it out for the Clerics.  The Clerics in turn heal and buff the Warriors.  Mages blast from behind while tanks melee and Taunt hoping the monster will not get past them onto the Mage.  Bards are a good compliment as they can do minor heals, buffs and damage for a party and Rogues can sneak in and backstab a victim.  Everyone should work together, not seperate.  If this is your thinking then maybe EQ isn't for you (sorry, no way around saying it).  Persoanlly I like both aspects.  I love to solo as much as group.  Depends what I am in the mood for, who is around, and what I will be fighting.<p>I would not bitch about the Warrior just yet.  The are doing some enhancements now on the Test server with more sure to follow.  This is as bad as the other post where someone was kinda bashing AC stating what it is missing when it is only in the 1st stages of beta.  You are bashing what is missing on the Warrior while they are in the midst of enhancing it.  Sure, maybe all they are doing is adding critical hits, maybe they won't matter in the long run, but isn't it a bit premature to bash something people have been bashing for weeks ESPECIALLY when they are fixing it up some on the Test server?<p>Good luck Warrior!
