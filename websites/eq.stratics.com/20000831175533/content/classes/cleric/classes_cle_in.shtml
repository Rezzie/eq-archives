                    <p><font size="2">To be honest, a Cleric is not as effective 
                      at solo play as the heavierhitting pure fighter classes. 
                      This is because round for round, a Clericis going to have 
                      a harder time dealing consistent damage to kill highlevel 
                      monsters, as well as having fewer hit points to survive 
                      thevicious counter-attacks. Clerics can dish out a beating 
                      with theirspells, but their most powerful damage spells 
                      take a while to cast -leaving them vulnerable to a well 
                      placed hit from their foe - and drainlarge amounts of mana. 
                      Take it from me, the one time you're guaranteedto need a 
                      quick heal is right after draining all of your mana to blastyour 
                      opponent down to an inch of his life! Additionally, while 
                      there areplenty of blunt weapons that do a fair amount of 
                      damage, only the mostpowerfully enchanted mace is going 
                      to keep up with a two-handed claymorein the hands of an 
                      experienced barbarian warrior. The one caveat to thisis 
                      the fact that Clerics are able to wear all kinds of armor, 
                      includingfull plate. Find yourself a powerful set of armor 
                      and wade into thefray, well protected from harm. This is 
                      an advantage none of the otherspellcasters can claim! </font> 
                    </p>
                    <p><font size="2">As with many other classes, Clerics come 
                      into their own in a group. Withjust one fighter to distract 
                      the monsters and keep your hands free forhealing and support, 
                      you'll find that your tank can live well 'nighforever battling 
                      against monsters far above your own levels. And youroffensive 
                      spells are potent enough to deal the decisive kill at the 
                      endof the battle.</font> </p>
                    <p><font size="2">One drawback to the Cleric is they have 
                      to deal with the worst of themoney situation of both fighters 
                      and spellcasters. On the one hand, youneed to save all the 
                      gold and platinum you can to afford the spells youwant in 
                      the next rank. On the other, if you don't get some protectioncovering 
                      those scrawny bones, your gonna be soup. So it's especiallyimportant 
                      to keep a tight fist on your money supply, and never waste 
                      asingle copper chip. Come level fourteen you're going to 
                      want to spend 50platinum to get all those great spells - 
                      and if you're not careful,you'll be broke as a milkmaid!</font>

                    and other unimpressive fare) and sellingwhatever loot you 
                    can. You will start out with Strike and Light Healingspells 
                    - scribe and memorize them immediately, and begin practicing 
                    yourmagical abilities. Use Strike to finish your opponents 
                    off, which willgive you the practice you need for timing your 
                    spells between youropponent's attacks. Cast light healing

                      boost yourAC and HP, and at low levels is a tremendous boon. 
                      Unless you absolutelyMUST have one of the other Rank 1 spells,

                      Thisis to balance the Clerics' ability to use blunt weapons 
                      and armor.Therefore levels one to four are more of the same 
                      stuff. For maximumexperience you'll want to stay away from 
                      parties until at least levelthree and depending on your 
                      personal inclination even until level five.At level five 
                      you'll want to purchase Light Healing, Holy Armor, Gate,and 
                      Ward Undead. Your prowess on the battlefield will have improvedquite 
                      a bit and these additional spells will help. But just because 
                      youhave Light Healing, don't put that Minor Healing away! 
                      Light Healingtakes significantly longer to cast as well 
                      as using up quite a bit moremana than Minor Healing, so

                    At this level you gain accessto your first real damage spell 
                    - Word of Pain. WoP deals damage to allthe monsters in a small 
                    circle around you, and can clear a battlefieldin a hurry. 
                    WoP will draw quite a bit of mana at level nine so becareful, 
                    but you'll find it just the thing you're looking for to dealdamage 
                    while still being the party healer. Some other important spellslevel 
                    nine brings are Center, a powerful buff spell, Root, which 
                    willstop an enemy dead in its tracks, and Soothe, an improved 
                    version ofLull. Root is handy to stop a fleeing foe from rounding 
                    up his friendswhile you attack his back, as well as keeping 
                    a mummy in place while youpound it from a safe distance with 
                    Ward Undead. Soothe works the same asLull, just better, and 
                    is well worth the upgrade. And Center is Couragepart II - 
                    a much-improved version that no fighter in your party shouldbe 
                    without.From nine to fourteen you'll be much more powerful, 
                    and well equipped toexplore more challenging (and rewarding!) 
                    places. You and your party cantry out Crushbone proper rather 
                    than skulking about the camps at theentrance, and Black Burrow 
                    trains won't mean an instant death anymore.Soon you'll be 
                    to level fourteen, which is the shining level for aCleric. 
                    You can now cast Healing and watch that HP bar climb climbclimb, 
                    while Smite is a sorely needed replacement for the now useless(except 
                    for luring!) Strike. You'll also have access to Expulse Undead 
                    -and if you thought Ward Undead was incredible, you haven't 
                    seen anythingyet! Paired up with Expulse is Invisibility to 
                    Undead - the perfectcomplement to an adventure in the undead 
                    dungeons. Enjoy your new powersand abilities - you are well 
                    on your way to becoming a master Cleric! </font>

                    classes to play in a group.When adventuring with your comrades, 
                    you are in charge of that mostprecious commodity - life. It 
                    is your sworn duty to keep yourcompatriots alive at any cost 
                    - lonely is the Cleric who can't masterthe ability of keeping 
                    a close eye on the health of his fellows whileclosely following 
                    the battle at hand. A well-played Cleric makes friendsanywhere 
                    she pleases, has no trouble finding a group, and is neverwithout 
                    a helping hand. The unsuccessful Cleric - well, he might as

                    <p><font size="2">One of the key skills you'll need to master 
                      as a Cleric is the best useof your abilities to help the 
                      group. For the Cleric there are three keyroles for you to 
                      play:</font> 
                    <blockquote><font size="2">Healing and Combat Support:<br>
                      This is what being a Cleric is all about, and is the reason 
                      many choosenot to follow the healer's path. If you don't 
                      see the excitement, value,and fun in being the person your 
                      comrades depend on to keep themfighting, a Cleric's life 
                      is not for you. In addition to the obvioushealing, Cleric's 
                      have several powerful "buff" spells that increase hitpoints 
                      and armor class, provide resistance to certain types of 
                      attacks,and can cure ailments such as disease and blindness. 
                      Combat support alsoincludes using spells such as Lull or 
                      Soothe to pinpoint the exact foesyou will fight (or allow 
                      safe passage through a treacherous zone!), Rootto stop a 
                      fleeing monster dead in its tracks, and Invigor to restorewaning 
                      stamina when the battle drags on a bit too long. It's also 
                      theact of keeping on eye on your surroundings and watching 
                      for potentialtrouble during battle. Your name will go down 
                      in your partners littleblack books if you are the one to 
                      spot the King of the Minotaurssneaking up on your fighters 
                      during battle! </font> 
                      <p><font size="2">Spell Damage:</font> <font size="2"> Sometimes 
                        the combat is going particularly well, or your fighters 
                        aredodging and ducking blows like ballet dancers (maybe 
                        because of allthose buff spells you've cast on them!). 
                        This is the time to survey thesituation and see what you 
                        can do to help cause some damage. If you'refighting multiple 
                        enemies, a well placed Word of Pain might be theticket 
                        to evening the odds, or perhaps you'd like to flex a littlemuscle 
                        and take down that Mummy in a minute with Ward Undead. 
                        Remember,though, it's always wise to practice restraint 
                        with combat spells, orall too soon you'll know what it 
                        feels like to have used all your manato crush your foe, 
                        only to have nothing left to heal your bruised andweakened 
                        fighters when a wandering monster attacks. </font> 
                      <p><font size="2">Melee Damage:</font> <font size="2"> At 
                        low levels, the damage you can inflict on monsters with 
                        regularhand-to-hand combat is on par with the other fighter 
                        levels, andtherefore will make a difference in the battle. 
                        As you progress up theexperience ladder and begin facing 
                        tougher and more advanced battles,this isn't the case, 
                        so only step into the fray when there's absolutelynothing 
                        better for you to do. There's nothing wrong with sitting 
                        downand meditating in the middle of battle - your friends 
                        will appreciateyour forethought in recovering a few bars 
                        rather than lightly tapping aCrusader with your mace when 
                        his friends show up and start swinging!</font>

                  <div><font size="2">Finally, here's a list of some helpful pointers, 
                    ideas, and conceptsthat will help you make your way in Norrath, 
                    and become a Cleric thatBards will sing tales of long after 
                    your passing! </font> 
                    <p><font size="2">If you find yourself alone in Norrath, the 
                      best things to fight areUndead. As a Cleric you have a natural 
                      ability to best these fiends fromthe netherworld, and there 
                      are several Cleric-only spells in yourarsenal such as Ward, 
                      Expulse, Spook, and Sense Undead, that you'll beable to 
                      use with great effect. Solo'ng undead is also a good way 
                      to earnmoney and XP - you'll be able to go face-to-face 
                      with undead at levels apure fighter type would shy away 
                      from.</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">Save your money! Your third rank spells 
                      will cost on average fiveplatinum each - a small fortune 
                      in Norrath's depressed economy. Untilyou get to around twentieth 
                      level, being able to afford both the spellsand the weapons 
                      and armor you want will be one of your greatestchallenges. 
                      After twenty, you can look forward to a little leeway, asyou'll 
                      be able to fight monsters that will give much more money 
                      andvaluable loot, while the price of your spells will not 
                      keep up inrelation to your money making ability.</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">As a Cleric you've got the easiest way to 
                      gain friends and allies inNorrath - use it! When you see 
                      a hapless soul stumbling away from amonster, help that person 
                      out! Heal him up and watch the tide of battleturn. Or offer 
                      your assistance to fellow travelers when the world isswarming 
                      with plague rats or other disease carrying vermin. When 
                      all issaid and done you'll have made a valuable friend and 
                      ally; in Norrath,you can never have too many friends.</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">In battle, your eyes should be checking 
                      your comrades HP more than yourown. If everything is going 
                      right, your fighters should be taking thedamage while you're 
                      on the sidelines playing support. In a long battle,remember 
                      to Meditate between casting heals - at Level 11 you'll recoverenough 
                      mana to cast a Light Heal every 2-3 rounds. And that makes 
                      a hugedifference.</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">Just like any other spellcaster, you'll 
                      have a hard time working yourcraft if an Orc is belting 
                      you. Also, some monsters take offense at yourhealing and 
                      turn quickly to attack you. Make sure your party membersrealize 
                      they need to keep you out of direct fire if they want to 
                      benefitfrom your healing - if they know it's a matter of 
                      their life and death,they'll be sure to Taunt more effectively!</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">In a party, keep your fighters in tip-top 
                      shape between battles as wellas during. When the fighting 
                      is over, make sure all your fighters are atfull or near 
                      full health before recovering your own mana. Also be readyto 
                      apply Center, Holy Armor, Courage, or whatever other buff 
                      spells youhave available as soon as your teammate signals 
                      readiness. It only takesone unexpected run in with a fierce 
                      monster to learn this lesson ofreadiness well.</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">Lull (or Soothe) and Strike is your friend! 
                      At a monster camp, controlthe pace and frenzy of the battle 
                      by selectively Soothing or Lullingcertain linked monsters, 
                      then Striking from a distance the remainingmonster(s) you 
                      want to tackle. Repeat as necessary until the camp isempty. 
                      This evens the odds and allows even a party of just two 
                      (you andyour fighter!) to handle dangerous areas.Divine 
                      Aura grants you 30 seconds of invulnerability when cast. 
                      You canmove while invulnerable, but you cannot cast spells 
                      or attack. 30seconds is a LONG time when you're being chased 
                      down by a ravaging hordeof ghouls or when you're providing 
                      a getaway for your compatriots. Learnit and use it!</font> 
                    <p><font size="2">Practice all of your spells you will be 
                      using in combat, and have a goodunderstanding of their casting

                      practice both one-handed and two-handed blunt skillsregularly 
                      as you progress through the levels. Because you must hitcreatures 
                      that give you experience to raise a melee skill, it gets 
                      verydifficult to raise skills once you've neglected them 
                      for a few levels(try hitting that Level 20 Gnoll with a 
                      two-handed blunt skill of 3!).When you do find that Magical 
                      Dwarven two-handed Warhammer, you'll wantto be able to use
