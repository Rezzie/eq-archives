                  </p>
                  <p>Many people considering becoming a druid never even think 
                    about the Half-elf. In many ways, Half-elves have lived with 
                    the stigma of being neither Human, nor Wood-elf. Most druids 
                    look down on the Half-elf druids as well, but for different 
                    reasons. However, the Half-elf druid can be just as powerful 
                    as any other druid, but in diverse areas. </p>
                  <p>Druids are masters of nature and the enemies of all summoned 
                    creatures. With this, most animals will perceive the druid 
                    to be their ally, and kindly allow them in their territory. 
                    However, summoned creatures and some extremely territorial, 
                    aggressive animals will attack druids without provocation. 
                    In order to combat this, druids can charm many types of animals 
                    and deal substantial amounts of damage to summoned creatures, 
                    even higher than most wizards! The Half-elf druid is best 
                    suited for charming animals to fight for him, instead of against 
                    him. </p>
                  <p>Druids have many limitations for armor, weaponry, and melee 
                    skill. Druids are only able to use natural weapons, made of 
                    wood or other materials. The exception is the scimitar, whose 
                    speed and precision can be the best tool a druid has in his 
                    fighting arsenal. Druids can also only wear natural or magically 
                    enhanced armors. This includes the lower protection armors; 
                    Cloth, leather, mesh, reinforced, and raw-hide. The druid 
                    has a few choices for specialized armors once he has gained 
                    many seasons and has become a master druid: Vermiculated, 
                    Elder Spirits, and Withered. These give many different kinds 
                    of enhancements, such as spell casting without using the druids 
                    natural energy - mana, statistic increases - such as stamina, 
                    strength, and wisdom, and higher protection in melee battle. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The other side of a druid is his spells. A druid has many 
                    types of spells and is considered a 'priest'. A druid can 
                    attack with the various forces of nature, mainly fire but 
                    also lighting, rain, hail, wind, and earth. Druids can summon 
                    other forces from nature to assist in combat, like roots or 
                    vines to slow or even stop the movement of an opponent. They 
                    can help themselves and their allies by increasing their strength, 
                    offense/defense, movement rate, or ability to withstand magical 
                    attacks. In addition, the druid can heal and cure many infirmities. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In essence, a druid can do a little of everything, but is 
                    a master of his environment. Many young druids, with awe of 
                    the magical powers available to them, focus on this ability 
                    alone. A Half-elf druid has no chance to have the ability 
                    to cast the larger amounts of spells the Halflings and Wood-elves 
                    can without resting, but he has his own advantages. </p>
                  <p>Exiled by the Humans and Wood-elves, Half-elf druids reside 
                    in Surefall Glade, outside the Human city of Qeynos, in the 
                    hills. Here, druids train along side of rangers, their nature-loving 
                    cousins. There are caves and a waterfall in the glade, near 
                    the hollowed-out tree of the druid guild. The Qeynos hills, 
                    Blackburrow and West Karana areas allow for exploration of 
                    what your druid can and cannot do, as well as learning many 
                    tactics that apply to large groups, small groups, and solo 
                    hunting. </p>
                  <div align=right> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img height=5

      width=5>&nbsp;<a 
      href="#top">top</a></font> </div>
                  <p><b><font color="#050056">Beginning Statistics </font></b></p>
                  <p>Half-elf druids have some of the lowest starting characteristics 
                    of the druids. Charisma and Intelligence a tied with all but 
                    the Halfling druids, wisdom is the lowest, strength, stamina, 
                    agility and dexterity are all tied for second highest. These 
                    stats allow the Half-elf druid to be the most versatile type 
                    of druid in the game, as they all relate to melee offense 
                    and defense. </p>
                  <p>At creation, most younger inexperienced druids try to increase 
                    their wisdom, as it relates directly to the amount of mana 
                    they have and the likelihood that a spell, once begun, will 
                    result in the desired effect. This urge comes from a certain 
                    attitude and inferiority complex. Many measure the worth of 
                    a 'priest' by the size of his mana pool. This can be confusing 
                    and frustrating. </p>
                  <p>Half-elf druids will never be the best druid caster in the 
                    game, and thus should look for alternatives to assist them 
                    in their travels. A druid cannot inflict the massively damaging 
                    blows of a warrior, or attack from a distance with thrown 
                    or launched weapons like arrows or throwing daggers. With 
                    the right balance of dexterity, strength, and agility however, 
                    a druid can become a decent assistant tank with the quick 
                    scimitar in hand and a shield to soak some damage. Half-elves 
                    are best suited for this, as they have more strength, agility 
                    and dexterity collectively than any other race of druid. The 
                    dexterity increases the chances to hit, the strength increases 
                    the likelihood of hitting for the maximum damage, and the 
                    agility decreases the amount of damage and how often the druid 
                    gets hit. </p>
                  <p>Strength also allows the Half-elf druid to carry more items. 
                    The Half-elf druid could be the pack-mule of the group, carrying 
                    the arrows and components for the other classes with increased 
                    strength. Conversely, the Half-elf druid could go into a dungeon 
                    empty of all but backpacks, bags and boxes and fill up to 
                    carry the loot out - leaving the tanks unencumbered. Druids 
                    gain a strength buff that magically increases the Half-elf 
                    druids strength, further enhancing this ability. </p>
                  <p>Agility greatly affects the ability of the Half-elf druid 
                    to dodge those damaging blows. This can become essential once 
                    a pack of angry monsters attacks you, seeing you hit 4 of 
                    them for large amounts of damage at once with the druid nature 
                    area-attack spells. It also decreases the slowing effect of 
                    being encumbered with too much weight. </p>
                  <p>Dexterity does two things in melee; it increases the chance 
                    you hit the monster, and it increases the chance a special 
                    spell effect on a magic weapon takes effect or processes. 
                    Druids at times have to play a solitary role, as another class 
                    may come along that can heal better, cast direct damage spells 
                    better (nuke), buff better, or melee better. A Half-elf druid 
                    has less mana than other druids, so one way to make up for 
                    this is to have a greater ability to give melee damage in 
                    a fight. One the mana runs out, you better be able to hit 
                    the monster or run. </p>
                  <p>Stamina is necessary for all druids. Half-elf druids need 
                    a little more. When you give or take damage, your stamina 
                    allows you to continue moving. Every time you swing a weapon, 
                    cast a spell, or get hit a little bit of stamina goes away. 
                    It will eventually regenerate once you rest. Stamina also 
                    gives you a few extra hit points for those really close fights. 
                    Long-distance running also takes stamina away. Half-elf druids 
                    need all of these, as they melee more, run more, and generally 
                    get hit more. Stamina also increases armor class, but not 
                    by much. </p>

                  <p>Many people see druids as one-dimensional, having only one 
                    way to play. Nothing could be further from the truth for the 
                    Half-elf. The Half-elf druid can be all of the following types 
                    of druids and can switch between them quickly when needed. 
                    There are also different types of armor and jewelry that assist 
                    the druid in his various roles. </p>
                  <p><b>Caster/Nuker Druids </b></p>
                  <p>Half-elf druids have the least amount of mana to begin with. 
                    The Caster/Nuker druid uses a wide range of techniques to 
                    achieve his goal: killing the monster he's attacking with 
                    spells without being hit. Half-elf druids normally can take 
                    on only lower-level monsters with this tactic as they run 
                    out of mana too quickly. However, this is still very possible 
                    when the Half-elf has lots of wisdom enhancing jewelry. </p>
                  <p><b>Healer Druids </b></p>
                  <p>Druids are the second best class when it comes to healing. 
                    Healing is not normally as mana-intensive as nuking, as it 
                    can be timed and allows for meditation between casting. Most 
                    Half-elf druids can tell better than any other druid how much 
                    mana they have left, and how much mana a healing spell will 
                    take out of them. Because of this, they can get their timing 
                    down better. As healing is more of a group tactic, the Half-elf 
                    druid Healer tends to seek out groups rather than go solo. 
                    Some kinder, gentler Healer druids may even heal people not 
                    in their group, as they run by. </p>
                  <p><b>Buffer Druids </b></p>
                  <p>Half-elf druids often enhance their melee abilities with 
                    things called buffs. A buff is anything that increases the 
                    base statistic through a magical spell. Half-elf druid normally 
                    use this ability so much, that they quickly reach the maximum 
                    skill allowed at each level. A druid can buff many of their 
                    own stats and can also provide special defenses like thorns 
                    that spring from their skin to harm any creature that attacks 
                    them. Some of these buffs can also be applied to others, specifically 
                    strength, thorns, speed, and hardening of the skin. </p>
                  <p><b>Tank Druids </b></p>
                  <p>Druids can take a lot of damage when they have items and 
                    spells that increase the amount of hit points they have. The 
                    spell line that hardens skin is most effective in helping 
                    here. As Half-elf druids have more agility and stamina, they 
                    can stand toe-to-toe longer than the other races of druid. 
                    Their higher strength and dexterity also allows them to give 
                    some of that damage back. At higher levels, however, the ability 
                    of the druid to be a tank decreases significantly as the monsters 
                    hit harder and faster. Still, there are the occasional monsters 
                    that Half-elf druids can tank in a group in the lack of a 
                    warrior/fighter class. However, it goes without saying that 
                    a warrior is the best choice for a tank. </p>
                  <p><b>Puller Druids </b></p>
                  <p>Druids can run faster and dodge better than many classes 
                    in the game. The animal-specific line of spells also lets 
                    the druid be picky as to what, how many, and how often a group 
                    of monsters attacks him. The picking of one or more monsters 
                    from a group and bringing back to the group to kill is called 
                    pulling, and is an essential skill to learn. A Half-elf druid 
                    can do this better than any other druid by using every statistic 
                    at once. Casting, meleeing, dodging, and running all help 
                    the Half-elf druid become an efficient puller. I've heard 
                    many people comment that druids make the best pullers in the 
                    game and I believe this is due to the Half-elf druids. </p>
                  <p><b>Travel Druids </b></p>
                  <p>At higher levels, druids increase their ability to travel 
                    and to bring others with them on their travels. If you have 
                    problems with abbreviations, get really familiar with this 
                    one: SOW (spirit of the wolf). Oh, and here's another: TP 
                    (teleport). One last abbreviation is EVAC (evacuation - also 
                    known as succor). Druids can run faster, longer and can magically 
                    transport themselves to stone rings that were set up by their 
                    ancestors. The more senior the druid becomes through his adventures, 
                    the more easily he can travel. Many friends and even strangers 
                    would like a druid to help them travel. Unfortunately, most 
                    brash adventurers EXPECT you to help them and can become quite 
                    rude. Try to be polite and understanding, as the better you 
                    relate to people, the more this ability can work positively 
                    for you. For example, a donation from an elder adventurer 
                    can be sizeable when you help them in their time of need. 
                    Conversely, you should try to help those less experienced 
                    than you when they cannot offer anything in return. Half-elf 
                    druids can travel just about equally to other druids, but 
                    their charisma, agility and stamina are all higher collectively 
                    that other races, and allow them to be more successful in 
                    getting to their destination unharmed. </p>
                  <p><b><font color="#050056">Special Abilities </font></b></p>
                  <p>Half-elf druids have only one more ability over humans, the 
                    least endowed with special ability druid. All druids get the 
                    ranger ability to forage up food and water without using mana, 
                    health or stamina. Half-elf druids also get infra-vision which 
                    increases their ability to see better at night. A fire-beetle 
                    eye in the main inventory slot or in the hand will enhance 
                    this at close distances. Wood-elf druids get hide, and Halfling 
                    druids get sneak and hide as well as a slight movement speed 
                    enhancement. In the special abilities department, there's 
                    not much special about Half-elves. </p>

                  <p>Half-elf druids can do a little of everything better than 
                    all other races of druid, but are not the best at anything. 
                    This can force the Half-elf druid to embrace this, but can 
                    also send the druid into denial. The more the Half-elf druid 
                    can adapt to his situation, the more appreciated that druid 
                    will be by others. In the end, if one is content with one's 
                    circumstances, those around them will accept and appreciate 
                    them. - Motto of the Half-elf druid. <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
