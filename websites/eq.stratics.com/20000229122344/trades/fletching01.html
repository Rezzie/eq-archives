I would             recommend between 4 and 8. I personally used 5 pts at level 5 as a             ranger to get going. The skill improves rather rapidly.<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Be warned             that fletching is NOT fun. It is very tedious. You have to put 1 of             each of the 4 arrow components in to the kit 1 at a time. If you put             in a stack you will get back 1 arrow if successful. So, before you             start get comfortable and be ready to excercize your wrist often.<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Begin             by buying up 20 of each component, and get started. Buy the cheapest             of each of the 4 components, so each attempt costs you 4 copper. You             will use these arrows to archer with as they are the basic arrow,             providing a range of 50 and damage of 1. You usually rise 2-4 pts             per grouping of 20 attempts. So depending how many training points             you invest, you will reach the cap of triviality on the basic Wood             Arrow in 3 or 4 batches of 20 arrows. Not too bad.<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The             next type of arrow is the Class 1 Wood Arrow. This requires the 3             cp notch, which brings your cost per attempt to 6 cp. You will fail             a lot at this point in making arrows. Failures can increase your skill,             however, and the rate of increase is comparable to the previous arrows.             I would use these arrows as well to archer with, as they provide a             range of 75 and damage of 1. The cap of triviality for these is a             rating of 36. Making a rough guess at this point you have probably             spent 1 to 1.3 platinum on increasing your skill to 35. You also have             a nice number of arrows in your inventory. I would now go and get             a bow....<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DO NOT             BUY A BOW! The best part of being a fletcher is that you get to make             bows. The store bought bows are very expensive and not good. With             a skill of 35 you can easily make a bow that is better than the store             bought ones. I would recommend buying the bowyering book, a Hickory             staff, and some Linen string. This is rather cheap, and your success             rate should be very high at 35 skill. This lets you make a Rough Hickory             Recurve Bow with stats of Damage: 9 Delay: 46 and Range:50.<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now             go out and increase your archery skill. The best way by far to do             this is beat on animals that tend to run from you. When they run do             not chase. Instead you pull out the bow and you get easy target practice.             All the players I've seen w/ high Archery skill do this. The second             way to get in free shots is to group w/ a warrior or other melee type             and fire at the monster's back while they are engaged.<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once             you cap out at a skill of 36 I'd make basic arrows to practice archery             with. Otherwise your expense may increase. At some point however you             wanna go above 36 to make better bows. Making Class 2 Wood Arrows             will do this. They are composed of the better notch, and the better             fletch. The cost per attempt is now 1 sp 1 cp. At this point things             move up much more slowly. I only went up 1-2 pts per batch of 20 attempted.             The skill cap for this type of arrow is a fletching skill of 46<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To go             beyond 46 I suggest moving to the basic Bone Arrow, which includes             a Bone Shaft and all the other basic 1 cp components. The cost per             attempt now is almost 2 sp. I haven't reached the skill cap for this             item yet. I sell back the made arrows, because in my opinion they             are way to expensive to use. I take a loss on the sale, but I think             it's the right move.<br>            <br>            </font>           <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this             point you can make an Elm Bow, which provides an important range bonus.             Using a linen string and elm staff you can make a Rough Elm Recurve             Bow, with stats of Damage: 12 Delay: 47 and Range: 75. Getting better.             I now use Class 1 arrows as my basic archery arrows as they both have             ranges of 75 and I can now hit for 13 pts per shot. The cost of the             components for this bow are around 2.5 Platinum.</font>         </ol>        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Submitted         by <a href="mailto:MRobaina@cgus.com">Charron</a> of Kanara</font></td>  </tr></table></center></body></html>
