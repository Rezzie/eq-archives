                      at the sight of a seedy-looking halfling standing on a bar 
                      stool drinking his ale. You hear a melody in the background 
                      which, in another world, would be recognized as a famous 
                      song created by the <i>The Stones That Roll</i>... 
                      <p> The halfling turns to you, raises his honey dew ale 
                        in salute, and says: 
                      <blockquote> <i>Please allow me to interduce meself,</i><i>

                      Hiller gives you a broad wink and finishes his ale in one 
                      gulp. "Set yer mind at ease, friend, fer in da world o'

                      heh." 
                      <p> He reaches up and claps you on the elbow. "So, rest 
                        easy, and have a seat. Yer givin' me a crick in me neck

                      <p> The halfling watches you with a twinkle in his eyes 
                        and chuckles. "So, tell me 'bout dis team yer formin'

                      Dain said is true: a rogue cannot steal from a -pvp character--no 
                      way, no how, not gonna happen. Doesn't matter if he is +pvp 
                      or -pvp. Can't steal from a -pvp character. Also, a -pvp 
                      rogue can't even steal from a +pvp character. The only way 
                      a rogue can steal from another player character is if they 
                      are both +pvp. Here's an exerpt from the Everquest FAQ: 
                      <blockquote><i> 11.4 Can I steal or pickpocket with a -pvp 
                        character? Wouldn't that make it impossible for people 
                        to retaliate? </i> 
                        <p><i> You may <u>not</u> </i>(underlining is mine)<i> 
                          steal from another character if you are -pvp. You can, 
                          however, steal from NPCs. If you are +pvp, you may steal 
                          from both +pvp players and NPCs.</i>

                      Fool's Gold Tavern, discussing plans for the upcoming quest. 
                      As the sun set behind the mountain, the bartender walked 
                      around lighting candles. 
                      <p> "Um, ya sed ye no kin steal frum me, right?" asked the

                        tried to focus on the troll. He shrugged his shoulders 
                        and said, "Some say that Bristlebane once tried to pick 
                        Erolissi Marr's pocket and Tarew Marr caught 'im at it. 
                        Tarew brought 'im before the council of gods ta answer 
                        fer his crime. As punishment, Bristlebane and all of his 
                        followers lost the ability to pick the pockets of anyone 
                        wi' a soul who chose not to do battle wi' others of their 
                        kind. But we can still pick the pockets o' those wi' no 
                        soul." 
                      <p> "Dose wid no soul?" the troll asked. 
                      <p> "Aye," the halfling replied. Like our friend the bartender." 
                        He waggled his thumb in the bartender's direction. 
                      <p> The troll eyed the bartender. "Sumpin wrong wid dat 
                        guy." 
                      <p> Hiller nodded. "Haven't ye got any like him in yer village?" 
                      <p> The troll furrowed his brow in concentration. "Um... 
                        yup." He suddenly grabbed his head with both hands. "Ow, 
                        dat hurt! 
                      <p> The halfling's eyes twinkled, but he managed to keep 
                        a straight face. "Anyway, I don't really know why we can 
                        only pick certain pockets. Heh, ye might as well ask me 
                        why we keep comin' back from da dead, or why the sun sets 
                        over that mountain and not the one over yonder. Mayhap 
                        a great mage could tell ye." The halfling rogue turned 
                        his gaze to the candle and stared into the flame...

                      <font color=#050056><i>Out of Character:</i> I've read a 
                      lot of discussion lately about how to justify some the aspects 
                      of online roleplaying games so that they fit in a "pure" 
                      roleplaying context, i.e., how do we justify resurrection? 
                      <p> Maybe it's time we broke the "pure" role playing mold, 
                        or at least re-shaped it a little. Instead of trying to 
                        justify our resurrection and other abilities we are given 
                        in an orpg, maybe we should tailor our roleplaying to 
                        fit the framework of the world as it is... 
                      <p> Remember what the gods of Norrath have told us: <i>"You're

                          the night. They left early this morning, heading north.

                      Hiller blew gently on the parchment, then rolled it up and 
                      slipped it in a tube and capped it. He rose and walked to 
                      the open window. He drew a small wooden cylinder from his 
                      pocket and brought it to his lips. A high, piercing whistle 
                      was heard. A moment later, a giant bat glided up and perched 
                      on the sill. The halfling tied the tube onto the bat's leg 
                      and sent it on its way. "Fly straight and true, leatherwings, 
                      and fly safe above all." Hiller closed his window, walked 
                      back to his bed, turned down the covers and snuffed out 
                      the candle.

                    <div> The halfling and the troll set out at sunrise the next 
                      morning, turning north and trekking toward the frigid plain. 
                      As they approached a high mountain pass, the troll stopped 
                      and turned completely around, sniffing the air. He began 
                      to rumble deep in his chest. 
                      <p> "Me smell elf," he said. 
                      <p> "All right, ," said the halfling rogue."Don't go berserker 
                        on me. If it's who I think it is, we're gonna need him." 
                      <p> "Me no like elf," said the troll. "Me HATE elf!" 
                      <p> Hiller climbed up on a boulder and stared Trukk in the 
                        eye. "Lissen. Just how bad da ye want dat Eye of Uggluk, 
                        anyway? All ye know is some legend about dis Erudite mage 
                        named Miragul who came and conned yer people out of some 
                        artifact...and maybe, maybe went into the northlands wid 
                        it. If ye want any chance at all of finding da eye, we 
                        are gonna need a ranger. And dis particular elf is one 
                        o' da best!" 
                      <p> Trukk's eyes blazed as he looked at Hiller. He sighed 
                        deeply, then shrugged his hairy shoulders. "Ya. Me need 
                        eye more den blood of elf. But if not da one we want, 
                        me squash like fire beetle." 
                      <p> Hiller looked Trukk in the eye once more, then said, 
                        "Stay here, I'll see who it is. I'll come back fer ye 
                        when I know fer sure. Erm, which way?" 
                      <p> The troll pointed off the trail into the pine forest. 
                      <p> "Remember what I said. We need him. I'll be back as 
                        soon as I know." Hiller jumped off the boulder and headed 
                        into the forest. As he hiked deeper into the forest, Hiller 
                        wondered how in the world he was going to keep these two 
                        from killing each other, half hoping that it wasn't his 
                        friend that the troll had smelled. He came upon a small 
                        glen and peered through the bushes. 
                      <p> He felt a feathery touch on his ear and spun around. 
                        There stood his friend Darter Elfgard, twirling an arrow 
                        in his hand and grinning impishly. 
                      <p> "Looking for someone?" Darter asked. 
                      <p> "Darter!" The halfling gave him a bear hug and clapped 
                        him on the back. "Good to see ya, old friend!" 
                      <p> "And you, Hilly! Hows the missus?" 
                      <p> "Fine, fine. Still makin' da best tarts in Rivervale." 
                        Hiller smiled, then grew somber. "I am glad ye got my 
                        post. I was hopin' ye wouldn't be too busy ta help." 
                      <p> "I could nae deny ye, my friend. After all, I owe ye 
                        my life. Have ye got any more clues on the whereabouts 
                        of the missing girl?" 
                      <p> "Only that da raiding party was spotted heading north. 
                        Erm, I joined up wid someone else who happens to be going 
                        that way..." Hiller puffed up his cheeks and shuffled 
                        his feet. 
                      <p> "Aye, and?" asked Darter. 
                      <p> Hiller eyed Darter carefully. "Aye, and...well, erm, 
                        he is really a great shaman and quite strong, and...where 
                        we're headed, we need that kind of back up..." 
                      <p> "Aye, so?" Darter shrugged his shoulders. "I have naught 
                        against barbarians." 
                      <p> Hiller blinked. "Well, that's just it...heh...he nae 
                        a barbarian. He, well, he is a tr.." 
                      <p> Darter exploded. "Troll! He is carrion!" Darter frenziedly 
                        started checking Hiller's trail. "Where is he? He dies 
                        now!" 
                      <p> The halfling tackled the elf and held him down. "No, 
                        Dart, no! I told ya, we need his skills to find da girl 
                        and get out safely!" 
                      <p> "We'll find some other way," Darter shouted. "We nae 
                        need any stinking troll wi' us!" 
                      <p> "Yes we do! We can't do this by ourselves! Remember, 
                        Dart, ya do owe me!" 
                      <p> Darter went still. "Aye, I owe ye. I'll do this. But 
                        then my debt is paid. And I'll nae be seein' ye again. 
                        Our friendship ends wi' the payment of the debt. Understood?" 
                      <p> "Aye, understood," Hiller sadly replied. 
                      <p> The wood elf pushed the halfling off of him and stalked 
                        down the backtrail. Hiller hurried after him. 
                      <p> 
                      <font color=#050056><i>Out of Character:</i> How do you 
                      justify seemingly incompatable races joining together? Obviously, 
                      you have to have very compelling reasons: 
                      <ol>
                        <li> They make a truce in order to accomplish a quest 
                        <li> They temporarily unite to fight a common enemy 
                        <li> They unite because they have no other choice 
                      </ol>
                      I wonder how the grouping of characters of different alignments 
                      will affect their alignments in Norrath. Would a troll become 
                      "more good" and lose the respect of his clan? Would an elf 
                      become "more evil" and find he is unwelcome in "good" society? 
                      Hmm...</font>

                    <div> Gulping for air, Hilly finally caught up with Darter 
                      on the way to the main trail. "Lissen, Dart, ye kin take 
                      point. Then ye nae be needin' ta rub elbows wi' da troll. 
                      And I promise, soon as da kidnappers' trail splits wi' da 
                      direction da troll is headin', we part company wi' him." 
                      <p> Darter stared at the mountains for awhile, then nodded 
                        his head in agreement. He stepped off the trail and disappeared 
                        into the woods. Hilly looked after his friend, sighed, 
                        and headed back to the troll. As Hilly came upon the main 
                        trail, he saw Trukk fashioning a club from an oak branch. 
                        "It was me friend, and he has joined up wi' us," Hilly 
                        said. 
                      <p> The troll glanced at the rogue and said, "I know dat." 
                        He pointed his club north. "Him dat way, not far." He 
                        finished his club and swung it a few times, testing its 
                        heft and balance. He went down on one knee and held the 
                        club out with both hands. "Tunare, bless me club, may 
                        it strength be great an it aim be true." He touched the 
                        ground with his club then brought it to his forehead. 
                        Then he rose and said, "We go." 
                      <p> As they made their way farther into the mountains, the 
                        trees began to thin out. Miniature waterfalls of frozen 
                        streams could be seen here and there, colored green and 
                        red and purple from the minerals in the water. Walking 
                        around a bend in the trail, they noticed a lone figure 
                        leaning on a sword. 
                      <p> The troll hefted his club and roared. "I be Trukk, shaman 
                        uv Grobb! Move or do battul!" The barbarian warrior threw 
                        back her head and laughed. "I am Huntra, warrior of Halas, 
                        and you're soiling my road with your presence!" 
                      <p> Hilly sidled to the left, trying to flank the warrior. 
                        "One more step and it may be your last, shorty," the barbarian 
                        grinned. The rogue froze. 
                      <p> Trukk roared again and stomped his foot, knocking the 
                        warrior on her rear. Hilly managed to keep his feet. 
                      <p> "Ah, so that is the way of it, then?" Huntra said as 
                        she stood back up. "Well, so be it. We fight!" 
                      <p> "Yup," said Trukk. "Ta deat' or ta yeilding?" 
                      <p> She looked at the two scruffy travelers. "You don't 
                        look much like you have anything worth dying for, so we 
                        fight to yielding or not at all, agreed?" 
                      <p> Trukk charged her and said, "Yup." He took a mighty 
                        swing at her head, and made contact with...nothing. The 
                        warrior had somersaulted forward as he ran past. 
                      <p> She slashed savagely behind her as she came up on one 
                        knee, gouging Trukk's thigh deeply. Trukk screamed and 
                        whirled around. He swung downward, trying to pound her 
                        into the ground with his club. 
                      <p> Huntra twisted to the right and held her sword point 
                        up, jabbing the troll in the wrist. Trukk moaned and gripped 
                        the club one handed. He feinted a jab to her belly and 
                        twirled the club up and over, smashing the warrior in 
                        the forehead. She instantly dropped her weapon, dazed, 
                        and fell to the ground. "I yield," she panted. " I cannot 
                        fight further. Take my sword, it's yours by right of victory." 
                      <p> Trukk cast heal on himself and the warrior as he loudly 
                        proclaimed his victory. "Yuh fight gud," he told the woman. 
                        "Yuh gib me honor in battul." He reached for her two-handed 
                        sword. 
                      <p> Just then another warrior stepped from behind a rock. 
                        "Not so fast, ye smelly pile of dragon dung! Now ye got 
                        to deal with me! I am Volgar, warrior of Halas, and clan-mate 
                        to Huntra! We fight!" He twirled his battle axe over his 
                        head. 
                      <p> "I think not," said Darter as he stood beside a lone 
                        pine, sighting along his arrow at Volgar's heart. Suddenly 
                        his eyes widened. 
                      <p> "Drop!" He yelled and loosed his arrow. 
                      <p> The warrior dropped as a spear just missed his head, 
                        slicing his ear. The air of Darter's passing arrow fanned 
                        his hair as it flew on and buried itself in the chest 
                        of the snow orc. 
                      <p> "To arms!" he cried. "Orcs all around! Trukk to the 
                        center to heal! Fight for yer lives!" Darter sprinted 
                        to the center of the trail, shouting and firing, while 
                        the others formed a circle around the troll. 
                      <p> Slashing and firing, the ring of fighters took on the 
                        oncoming snow orcs. Between healing casts Trukk managed 
                        to smash any heads that broke through the circle. As guickly 
                        as they had come, the orcs departed, leaving three dead 
                        behind them. 
                      <p> Hilly quickly searched the dead and distributed the 
                        spoils. "Dart, keep an eye out fer me while I disarm and 
                        pick the lock on this chest I found?" 
                      <p> "Aye," said Darter. 
                      <p> The rogue went off a ways and carefully examined the 
                        chest. He discovered a poison trap, which he deftly disarmed. 
                        He then took out his set of lockpicks and went to work. 
                        Presently a soft *click* was heard. Grinning broadly, 
                        Hilly opened the chest. 
                      <p> "Whoa! Lookit this!" he exclaimed. The others gathered 
                        around. Inside was a deep red ruby the size of Hiller's 
                        fist. "This what ye been lookin' fer, Trukk?" 
                      <p> The troll stared at the ruby and shook his head. "Nup, 
                        but it could be its liddle brudder." 
                      <p> Hilly's jaw fell. "Bigger then this, eh? Somethin' like 
                        that has got ta have some serious protection around it..." 
                      <p> The barbarian warriors glanced at each other, impressed. 
                        They nodded to each other and smiled grimly. Huntra spoke 
                        up. "Say, if you are out for more like this, you may need 
                        some fighters...mind if we tag along?" 
                      <p> The rogue looked questioningly from Trukk to Darter. 
                      <p> "Yuh fight gud. Ok wid me." 
                      <p> "Aye," said Darter. "Anything to dilute the smell of 
                        troll." He strode off toward the north. 
                      <p> The rogue stared after the elf's retreating back, then 
                        turned to the barbarians. "I am Hiller Dain, rogue of 
                        Rivervale, and that ill tempered drake whelp is Darter 
                        Elfgard, ranger of Kelethin. Erm, ye wouldn't be knowing 
                        anything of a so-called 'Eye of Uggluk', would ye? 'Tis 
                        a magickal artifact that was taken from Trukk's clan." 
                      <p> The barbarians looked at each other and shrugged their 
                        shoulders. Huntra said, "We haven't heard of it by name, 
                        but we have heard legends of a cache of magickal items 
                        that is supposed to be hidden somewhere in the frigid 
                        plain. Would that be what yer looking for?" "Mebbe," said 
                        the troll. "One way tuh find out. Lead da way." 
                      <p> The warriors turned and headed north, with the rogue 
                        and the troll bringing up the rear. 
                      <p> 
                      <font color=#050056><i>Out of Character:</i> What if we 
                      could challenge each other to a duel in EQ, -pvp and +pvp 
                      alike, without change of status? 
                      <ul>
                        <li>What if we could duel anywhere in Norrath? 
                        <li>What if we could choose to either "auto yield" after 
                          losing 2/3 of our health points or to fight to the death? 
                        <li>What if, when we choose "auto-yield", the fight would 
                          end as soon as one of the duelists lost 2/3 of their 
                          health points, and that was all the health they would 
                          lose? 
                        <li>What if the loser of an "auto-yield" duel would drop 
                          the most valuable item they have, and it could only 
                          be picked up by the winner as loot? 
                        <li>Finally, what if npcs carried booby-trapped and locked 
                          chests which only rogues could disarm any unlock? 
                      </ul>
                      Why, then: 
                      <ul>
                        <li>Paladins could duel with Necromancers. 
                        <li>Highwaymen could challenge travelers. 
                        <li>Anyone could battle anyone. 
                      </ul>
                      Without fear of dying and loss of all items. And, finally, 
                      rogues could be more valued members of EQ. Imagine the possibilities...</font>

                    <div> With Darter and the barbarians in the lead, the party 
                      trekked northward until early afternoon. They were deep 
                      in snow country now, and the air was still and cold. They 
                      deciced to stop early to hunt for food and to be fresh for 
                      the next day's journey. They found a suitable campsite and 
                      prepared to spend the night. Darter and Hilly went in search 
                      of firewood while the troll and the barbarbarians went hunting 
                      for game. 
                      <p> "So, Dart, what has yer tracking told ye so far?" asked 
                        Hiller. 
                      <p> "The party we seek continues to the north and the east. 
                        From what the barbarians say, that is the very direction 
                        of the legendary cache." Darter grimaced. "Seems we will 
                        be stuck with the troll for some time to come." 
                      <p> "Aye, seems that way." replied the rogue. "But ya gotta 
                        admit, ye'd be dead now if he hadn't healed ye once er 
                        twice during that orc attack." 
                      <p> "True, but he is still a troll." 
                      <p> Hilly shrugged his shoulders as they headed back with 
                        thier armloads of wood. 
                      <p> The hunting party returned as they were preparing the 
                        fire. Trukk had a mammoth calf draped over his shoulders. 
                        They quickly cleaned the beast and cut strips to smoke 
                        over the fire, and cooked the haunches for that evening's 
                        meal. 
                      <p> After the meal everyone settled around the fire, lost 
                        in their own thoughts. Darter unslung his lute from over 
                        his shoulder, tuned it, and began to play softly. In a 
                        tenor as clear and pure as a temple bell on a crisp autumn 
                        morning, he began to sing: 
                      <blockquote> 
                        <p>The lady with the beautiful eyes<br>

                      "Ah, Darter, me friend, ye gots da heart o' a bard." sighed 
                      Hilly. 
                      <p> The ranger nodded. "I have played in the bard guild's 
                        performance hall a time or two. 'Tis an enjoyable pastime. 
                        The bards are a lively bunch, and they love to sing a 
                        song and tell a story now and then. Why, I have seen many 
                        a rogue, cleric and warrior ask to be invited into the 
                        hall to listen in on the performances, and even join in 
                        on occasion." He slung his lute back over his shoulder 
                        and stared into the fire. 
                      <p> Hiller looked shrewdly at Darter. "She musta been some 
                        lady, ta inspire ye ta write such a song." 
                      <p> "She was, indeed." Darter looked sad, and somehow deeply 
                        pained. 
                      <p> The rogue decided to change the subject in an effort 
                        to divert his friend's thoughts. "Erm, Dart, I kin understand 
                        yer clan's dislike fer trolls, but Trukk here..." 
                      <p> Darter turned and looked at his friend with haunted 
                        eyes. "Ye wonder why I feel the way I do? Well, I suppose 
                        tis only right I tell ye... 
                      <p> 'Twas during the mere threshold of spring, that time 
                        of year when trees shed small branches and twigs like 
                        winter fur, and robins joust for territorial rights. The 
                        day dawned unusually warm and clear, showing the promise 
                        of summer to come. My beautiful Gethsemane and I decided 
                        to take our son Merlock on a picnic 'neath the sacred 
                        evergreen. My brother and his wife joined us. 
                      <p> Merlock was no more than a toddler, and Flitter and 
                        I were teaching him some basics of forest lore while my 
                        lady and Morgana were laying out the food. 
                      <p> Suddenly, Flitter started as though pricked by a thorn. 
                        He climbed up the great evergreen. Looking to the north, 
                        his visage paled and he scrambled back down to the ground. 
                      <p> "They come," he said. "Trolls on the rampage. Prepare 
                        for defense of our sacred tree." 
                      <p> Gethsemane grabbed up Merlock and hid him in a hole 
                        in the bole of the tree, then drew her sword and took 
                        a place beside me. 
                      <p> We had not long to wait. 
                      <p> They came upon us with the fury and force of a late 
                        winter storm, thundering into the clearing, their lightning 
                        fires burning the brush all around us. Gethsemane took 
                        a spear in the first wave. Later, Morgana fell under an 
                        axe meant for Flitter. We fought on for what seemed like 
                        hours. 
                      <p> Darter stopped his tale and stared into the glowing 
                        embers of the fire, swallowing hard. A solitary silent 
                        tear slid down the side of his cheek. "Sometimes I think 
                        that the only thing that kept us going was our rage and 
                        our burning desire to have vengeance on those who had 
                        murdered our loved ones... 
                      <p> And Flitter! Flitter was an inspiration to me. He was 
                        everywhere and nowhere at once. He fought like a firedrake! 
                        To this day his sword is known as Eyothewer, for it did 
                        carve an island in the sea of battle. 
                      <p> Finally, we began to weaken. I was down with a troll 
                        ready to deal me a death blow, and there was Flitter, 
                        slicing his head off with one swing of his singing sword, 
                        using his last ounce of strength. 
                      <p> There was but one troll left, and neither of us had 
                        the strength to raise hand 'gainst it. We looked each 
                        other in the eyes as the troll raised his club for a crushing 
                        blow. Suddenly, the troll blinked, shuddered, and fell 
                        dead. 
                      <p> Young Merlock, barely a toddler, had lept from his hiding 
                        place and pierced the troll's spinal cord with his whittling 
                        knife. 
                      <p> Darter let out a deep, shuddering sigh. "So. Now ye 
                        know." 
                      <p> "Two sides ta dat story. Me brudder..." the troll muttered. 
                      <p> The ranger glared at Trukk. "What ye say, troll?" 
                      <p> "Me can no talk like yuh can, elf, but me can show yuh..." 
                        The troll began a low rumbling chant, staring into the 
                        fire and slapping his palms on the ground in a steady, 
                        throbbing beat. "Tun Ah reh, Tun Ah re, Tun Ah reh," he 
                        chanted over and over. Slowly, gradually, the fire seemed 
                        to grow brighter and brighter, until it became their whole 
                        world. The flames seemed to take on shape and substance, 
                        until they became figures, and the figures clarified into 
                        the forms of trolls. Trolls marching, no...not quite a 
                        march...more like a procession. There was somehow an air 
                        of majesty and mystery about them as the shuffled on their 
                        path. They mumbled deep in their throats as they moved 
                        along. The mumbles grew louder and stronger, until they 
                        were clearly heard. "We come..ta honor..da dead." Over 
                        and over they chanted as they marched toward their holy 
                        ground. 
                      <p> The figures grew smaller as more of the landscape became 
                        visible, and was recognized as a swampland. But something 
                        was wrong with the swamp, it was not quite a swamp. It 
                        was dying, drying up. Many spots that once were pools 
                        of stagnant water were no more than dried up depressions 
                        in the ground, filled with dead fish and cracked plates 
                        of dusty dirt. 
                      <p> The procession moved on until it reached its destination. 
                        The trolls looked around in dismay. Their holy mud pits 
                        were gone, turned into sun baked bricks, deviod of water 
                        or life. 
                      <p> One of the trolls roared in rage and began to search 
                        the area. He followed the path of the dried up streambed 
                        and discovered a dam. A dam guarded by elves. He made 
                        his way back to his comrades. He yelled, "Da elves destroy 
                        our holy ground! We destroy dere holy tree!" Screaming 
                        in rage and hatred, they charged off . 
                      <p> The fire flared up, and the vision was no more. The 
                        flames died down and once again became glowing embers. 
                      <p> Darter blushed as he looked at the shaman. "We didn't 
                        know..." 
                      <p> Trukk nodded. "Yuh didn't know. Enemies neber talk. 
                        Only fight." 
                      <p> Volgar cleared his throat. "Say, Trukk, your clan honors 
                        the dead, but our dead come back. Don't your people?" 
                        The troll nodded. "Dey come back. One time. Two time. 
                        More dan two time. But sometime, dey don't come back" 
                        Trukk looked at Darter. "Me brudder die in dat battul.

                      <p> Darter frowned and shook his head no. 
                      <p> "So we honor dose dat don't come back. Now our holy 
                        pits gone. Do dey come back?" Trukk rose and strode away 
                        from the fire. The others moved off and prepared to bed 
                        down for the night. 
                      <p> <font color=#050056><i>Out of Character:</i> I will 
                        always be a bard at heart, and I know from experience 
                        that bards like to congregate and share their songs and 
                        stories, even if they are not "professional" bards, i.e. 
                        they may be a different class. The best example of this 
                        I have found had a place where bards could go in their 
                        guild hall and perform. Others classes could enter on 
                        an invitation only basis. They would ring a chime and 
                        shout a request to enter. Then any bard of a certain level 
                        (above level 5 ?) could go and escort them in. It was 
                        a fun experience, and gave me a haven from the constant 
                        battle for survival that is inherent in the leveling process. 
                        Something else on the role playing side: I like the idea 
                        of having role players as guest gms for role playing quests. 
                        From my understanding of pen and paper rpg's (never played 
                        one, by the way), this may be the closest an online rpg 
                        can come to that style of play. If these rpg guest gms 
                        control the direction and content of the questing party, 
                        they can filter out the "cool doodz" and allow those who 
                        truly try to role play to participate in role playing 
                        quests within the game. For instance, role playing quests 
                        are posted on special role playing bulletin boards throughout 
                        the cities of Norrath, with dates, times, party assembly 
                        points and rp gms' names. All interested participants 
                        be there. Maybe you could have people sign up up in advance 
                        so you could plan how many gm's you need in a certain 
                        area. Those details could be worked out. Guest gms have 
                        power to boot those who are detrimental to the rp spirit 
                        of the quest. Some guest gms would be party members (say, 
                        one per party), others could be adversaries. Guest gms 
                        would be given the powers they need to carry out their 
                        roles within the quest, and would revert to their regular 
                        character levels, plus whatever exp and loot they gained 
                        during the quest at its completion. Just a thought...

                      The party of adventurers rose early the next morning. The 
                      air grew colder and colder as they continued north and east. 
                      Darter began to slow down as the weather took its toll on 
                      his endurance. Noticing his plight, Trukk cast endure cold

                        Their journey was not easy, nor without mishap. They often 
                        slipped and fell on the icy terrain. They encountered 
                        giant white spiders, snow orcs, mammoths and even a polar 
                        bear. They defeated them all and shared the loot equally. 
                        Once they saw what they thought was a moving iceberg. 
                        It was a frost giant. They hid as it passed them by. Finally 
                        they came to a range of rocky outcrops. Among them they 
                        found a crevice. In the crevice they discovered an entrance.

                        Stamping their feet and rubbing their hands, they gathered 
                        around to discuss their options. Hilly asked Volgar if 
                        this resembled the secret cache of their legends. Volgar 
                        nodded. "Aye, as near as I can tell. Only one way to find

                        asked Hilly. </font>

                        Cautiously, they entered the cave. They worked their way 
                        deeper and deeper into the cave, with Darter in the lead, 
                        then Volgar, Trukk, Huntra and finally Hiller in the rear. 
                        Trukk cast night vision on Huntra and Volgar as he noticed 
                        them stumbling in the dark. Suddenly, Darter came to a 
                        halt. He signaled the others to gather round and pointed 
                        beyond. There stood an ice giant, five or six times as 
                        tall as the ranger. Darter signaled to the left, and the 
                        party snuck around the unsuspecting giant. </font>

                        Deeper and deeper they went, hiding from an occasional 
                        snow goblin, working their way down into the caves. Finally, 
                        they became aware of a low moaning, almost like wind in 
                        a small crack. As they traveled further, the moaning grew 
                        louder. Searching the area, they found a small opening 
                        almost completely covered by a fallen boulder. The moaning 
                        seemed to be coming from the opening. </font>
                      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Do 
                        we go on, or find the source of the sound?" asked Darter.

                      <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It 
                        could be someone in need of help," replied Hilly. He looked 
                        meaningfully at his friend. "I think we should find out." 
                        </font>

                        Trukk shrugged his shoulders and nodded. With a grunt 
                        he began to push at the boulder blocking the way. His 
                        muscles bulged until they looked like they would split 
                        his hide. The boulder finally gave way as he rolled it 
                        to one side. Darter got down on his stomach and tried 
                        to crawl in to the opening. Small as he was, he couldn't 
                        fit . "Let me try," whispered Hilly. It was a tight fit, 
                        but he managed to wriggle in. </font>

                        The further Hilly crawled in the tight passage, the louder 
                        the moaning got. The air became warmer and the passage 
                        grew lighter. He crawled around a bend and suddenly the 
                        passage opened up into a large chamber. Torches lit the 
                        chamber in a blood red glow. He wiggled out of the crevice 
                        and stood up. </font>
                      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                        The walls of the chamber were stacked with chest after 
                        chest, some of them opened and revealing more gems and 
                        coins than Hiller had ever seen. It would take an army 
                        of trolls a week to clear the chamber of all the riches 
                        he saw before him. His heart beat wildly as he looked 
                        around him. He giggled uncontrollably, grinning like an 
                        idiot. Once again he heard the moan. He turned in the 
                        direction of the sound and saw the halfling maiden tied 
                        spreadeagled to a blood stained altar. </font>

                        He hurried over to her. "Morningdew, its me, Hilly! Are

                        glared at her dubious savior. "Now would you be so kind 
                        as to untie me and get me out of this demon's abode?" 
                        Hilly blushed and cut her bonds with his dagger. </font>

                        the chests, and ran to what looked like a blank wall. 
                        She pushed an oddly shaped brick and the wall slid open 
                        to reveal a doorway. She yelped and jumped back on guard 
                        as Trukk and the others rushed into the chamber. </font>

                        from Trukk to Hiller and said. "Some companions! Is this 
                        the best you could do for the mayor's daughter?" </font>

                        Hiller blushed and nodded. He entertained thoughts of

                        Suddenly, Trukk gasped and rushed over to an open golden

                        them had ever seen. "Da eye uv Ugglukk! I have it back!" 
                        While he reached out for the stone, the others ran around 
                        grabbing as much loot as they could stuff in their packs

                        shrivel and burn in the lava pits!" The party members 
                        blanched and looked deeper into the chamber. The smell 
                        of brimstone filled their nostrils as a column of swirling

                        goblins took up the alarm and chased after them, with 
                        the lich also in hot pursuit. Trukk cast slow on the lead

                        roared and took a swing at her. She rolled to the right,

                        magicks he had never before seen. They flew onward as 
                        the clash of weapons and the screams of battle grew weaker 
                        and weaker. Finally, they could be heard no more. </font>
