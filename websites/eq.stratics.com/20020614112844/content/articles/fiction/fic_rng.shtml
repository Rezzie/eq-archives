                    <div> After a long journey from my homeland and the city of 
                      Felwithe, I finally find myself standing in the strange 
                      and uncomfortable town of Qeynos. Now, in order for you 
                      to really understand my discomfort, you must know that my 
                      homeland is one of a rural setting. I grew up living hand 
                      in hand with nature. Here in the city of Qeynos, I don't 
                      even see anything natural, besides the ocassional plant 
                      placed decorativley in the window. What trees I do see are 
                      simply dead husks--mere shadows of the majestic fauna from 
                      my homeland. So, one might ask, why did I come here? Well, 
                      my reasoning is simple, although the explanation is not. 
                      You see, I am what some rudely call a halfbreed. My mother 
                      was a human and my father an elf. An elf of some noble stature 
                      actually. While humans and elves get along just fine, I 
                      found that growing up as a half-elf was difficult at best. 
                      I was constantly teased and taunted. In addition, while 
                      I loved my homeland and the deep forests within, my father 
                      strongly dissaproved of my interest in the ways of the druids, 
                      and wanted me to become a cleric like himself and my mother. 
                      Now please understand that I have nothing against clerics. 
                      I simply decided that I prefered to live my life in harmony 
                      with nature. I wanted to be a druid. 
                      <p> Unfortunately for me it seems that my human half, though 
                        I love my mother dearly, has cursed me in a way. I am 
                        simply unable to gather and control the vast amounts of 
                        magical energy required to be a true druid. Refusing to 
                        be swayed however, I vowed to become a ranger. Rangers 
                        are respected by many a druid and non druid alike, and 
                        while they are not as mystically powerful as the druids, 
                        they do wield strong spells of thier own. I decided that, 
                        considering my choice of career, and my father's equal 
                        dislike for that choice, it would be best for me to leave 
                        home. I had heard of a great training camp for rangers 
                        somewhere near the city of Qeynos, and so I set out. Which 
                        brings us to the present: Qeynos. 
                      <p> This large city may very well be one of the shining 
                        symbols of peace and prosperity, but I find it to be loud, 
                        crowded, and a virtual maze of streets. After nearly an 
                        hour of running this way and that, I finally find a helpful 
                        woman who points me in the direction of a settlement camp 
                        called Surefall Glade. She indicates I can find the training 
                        I seek there. I thank the woman and set off on my way 
                        through the lands outside of Qeynos. On a side note, it 
                        seems to me that this city has a serious rodent control 
                        problem. Everywhere I look outside the city gates I see 
                        countless rats and snakes. Now while I may love nature 
                        in all of its forms, I have trouble with the thought of 
                        living amongst vermin such as this. Hopefully I can make 
                        my home in this Surefall Glade area. 
                      <p> Suprisingly, I find that the journey to my new home 
                        is rather short, but the change in scenery couldn't have 
                        been more profound. As much as I love my homeland, I must 
                        say that Surefall Glade is the most beutiful place I have 
                        ever seen. After wandering around a bit, I find two guards 
                        standing outside a tunnel cut into the side of the mountain. 
                        Upon inquiring I find that what I seek is through there. 
                        One of the guards, whose name I believe was Effin, offered 
                        to let me use a torch, but I assured him that I would 
                        not need it. My half-elven abilities allow me to see just 
                        fine in the dark. I'm quite relieved to find that humans 
                        in this area have nothing against people of my kind. I'm 
                        starting to feel better about this trip. I thank the guard 
                        and press on into the tunnel. It only takes me a few minutes, 
                        and I come out onto the other side of the mountain into 
                        the settlement I have been looking for. It is however, 
                        extremely late and I feel that I had best wait 'til morning 
                        to start my training. I stop by the local inn to find 
                        a place for the night. Unfortunately it seems I neglected 
                        to bring any money along with me. I explain my situation 
                        to the inkeep and she agrees to let me stay the night. 
                        It seems that the people around here are very kind. 
                      <p> When I awake I find a small parchment has been left 
                        for me. Upon reading it I find that it is a letter left 
                        by one of the Druids in the area. It seems he knew I would 
                        be coming and has arranged for my indoctrination and training 
                        into the local Ranger's Guild. I gather my things and 
                        thank the innkeep once again for the room. I quickly locate 
                        the guildmaster and begin my training. The next week was 
                        a long and hard one, but by the time I finished I was 
                        well on my way to life as a ranger. My guildmaster has 
                        taught me important skills such as tracking and sense 
                        direction and I am off to make my mark in the lands of 
                        Norrath!

                        Eastern fire beetle eyes. You would have to travel all 
                        the way to Freeport to get these, and even then you would 
                        pay at least a platinum for the lot here. I'm offering 
                        them to you for only 8 gold peices." 
                      <p> "8 gold is outrageous. I'll give you 3." 
                      <p> "My friend, once you buy these, you will be the only 
                        one in this whole area with a supply. You could sell them 
                        for whatever you wish. Surely 8 gold pieces is a pitance 
                        compared to what you could get for them here." 
                      <p> "I'll give you 5 gold for the lot of ten. No more." 
                      <p> "5 gold plus you through in a week's worth of food and 
                        water." 
                      <p> "Hmm. You drive a hard bargain Muerte, but its a deal." 
                      <p> I hand over the bag of ten fire beetle eyes to the shopkeep 
                        and take my gold and supplies in return. I thank the man 
                        and head out into the area of Erud that one might loosely 
                        call the town square. It is here that I am supposed to 
                        be meeting my old friend, Agathorn. Those of you who have 
                        done some traveling may know exactly where I am, but for 
                        the sake of the geographically stunted crowd I will try 
                        to explain where I am and how I happen to find myself 
                        here. 
                      <p> It all started one night back in my home of Surefall 
                        Glade. I was out on the archery range practicing when 
                        I man stumbled into town. Maybe stumbled is a bad choice 
                        of words, as the man more properly barely walked into 
                        town and fell unconscious near the archery range. I dropped 
                        my longbow and rushed to the man's side. Carefully picking 
                        him up I brought him into the inn and called for my instructor. 
                        When my instructor arrived he tended to the man's wounds, 
                        and believe me whan I say there were many, while I arranged 
                        for a room for the stranger. 
                      <p> The next morning we payed the man a visit and it seemed 
                        he would be alright. Physically at least. Shala, the innkeep, 
                        told us that emotionally the man was a wreck. It seemed 
                        he was the sole survivor of a Gnoll raid on his village. 
                        We talked with the man to get more details. As it turns 
                        out his village was raided by the Gnoll clan of Darkpaw 
                        with the aid of a Human necromancer. Everyone in his village 
                        was either killed or taken as slaves. He alone escaped 
                        because the raiding party took him for dead. This news 
                        was rather alarming in the fact that while Clan Darkpaw 
                        regularly wandered the area blaming Humans for thier problems 
                        and ocossionally attacking lone travelers, they had never 
                        banded together and made such a bold strike before. The 
                        addition of a necromancer, and a Human one at that, made 
                        things even more alarming. 
                      <p> And so began my quest. I vowed to the man that I would 
                        do all I could to free those of his village that were 
                        still alive. With a necromancer thrown into the equation, 
                        things became decidely more difficult and I knew I would 
                        require assistance. While my skills had progressed rapidly 
                        in the last year of training, I was still unable to wield 
                        the power of the arcane arts. I therefore sent word to 
                        an old friend, which is what brought me to the city of 
                        Erud; home of the High Men, the Erudites. The city of 
                        Erud lay across the sea from Qeynos, which is a major 
                        port city not far from my home in Surefall Glade. 
                      <p> Enough of the geography lesson though. It appears as 
                        though my friend Agathorn is approaching. I stand up from 
                        my seat and smother my boyhood friend in a great embrace. 
                      <p> "Agathorn my dear friend, it is good to see you again." 
                      <p> "And it is good to see you again as well, Muerte. I 
                        must say you have changed greatly from the boy I knew 
                        back in Felwithe. A change for the better no doubt." 
                      <p> "Yes, getting away from there was the best decision 
                        I've ever made. Growing up in my father's shadow would 
                        have done me no good. I see you too have left Felwithe 
                        to return to your homelands here in Erud." 
                      <p> "I'm afraid the High Elves have been getting a bit too 
                        superior in attitude for thier own good. It has gotten 
                        to the point that other races do not even travel to the 
                        fine city anymore. I was forced to leave by the council 
                        if you can believe it. Enough about me however, lets talk 
                        about your little adventure." 
                      <p> "Well you obviously got my message, so you know as much 
                        as I do at the moment. It will take some tracking to find 
                        the villagers, but I thought we might start in the caves 
                        near Qeynos. Those caves seem to be the home of Clan Darkpaw. 
                        I doubt we'll find what we seek there, but it should point 
                        us in the right direction." 
                      <p> "Sounds like as good a plan as any. Lead on my friend." 
                      <p> And lead on I did. We spent the journey back to Qeynos 
                        talking about how best to carry out our goal. I was astonished 
                        to find how far Agathorn had advanced in his chosen profession 
                        as an enchanter, and found that his skills would be extremely 
                        useful to us. By the time we reached Qeynos we had a solid 
                        plan of action in place. 
                      <p> Next Week the adventure continue as Muerte and Agathorn 
                        find the missing villagers, and uncover secrets that could 
                        spell certain doom for all of Norrath...

                    <div> What remains of the story has been pieced together by 
                      various individual accounts, and as always, people are prone 
                      to exaggeration from time to time. It is unfortunate that 
                      we could not get Muerte himself to finish the story for 
                      us, but the reason behind this will become painfully clear 
                      once you have read what follows. 
                      <p> We do know for certain that Muerte and Agathorn made 
                        an excursion into the caves near Qeynos that Clan Darkpaw 
                        claims as their own. Not much is known about what went 
                        on inside, but it is rumored that the party, despite Muertes 
                        amazing skill, found themselves lost within the mazes 
                        and were soon captured by the clan of gnolls. Through 
                        talks with the city guards, who keep regular record of 
                        who travels in and out of the city, it was discovered 
                        that Muerte and Agathorn were gone for nearly two weeks 
                        before they were seen again. When they finally reappeared 
                        they looked, as was so eloquently put by the guard on 
                        duty, "Like death warmed over." 
                      <p> The two were brought to Falor, Muertes Ranger instructor, 
                        in Surefall Glade. There they received the care they needed, 
                        and Muerte told his instructor what they had seen. 
                      <p> "It was awful, Falor. Absolutely awful. Ive seen death 
                        before but this was a hundred times worse. It was more 
                        than just bodies laying all over, although there were 
                        plenty of those. But rather just the overall sense of 
                        death  that atmosphere. You could just feel it. It was 
                        like Death himself was standing right behind you waiting 
                        for you to fall into his domain." 
                      <p> "It was more than that, Lord Falor." Agathorn explained, 
                        "I did not tell Muerte at the time, but even the Gnolls 
                        that wandered around were dead. Thanks to my training 
                        in the arcane, I could see the magical aura given off 
                        by their bodies. They were dead, and re-animated by a 
                        very powerful Necromancer. I would suspect that this individual 
                        is the same Necromancer that was seen during the village 
                        raid." 
                      <p> "Are you sure about this, Lord Agathorn?" Asked Falor. 
                      <p> "I am afraid so. Whomever it is we are dealing with, 
                        he is very powerful. In addition, it would appear that 
                        he has a much bigger plan in play." 
                      <p> "But I dont understand why a Necromancer would want 
                        to make everyone think that Clan Darkpaw was still alive 
                        and well." Muerte exclaimed. "Why go on with this deception? 
                        If he is raising an army of undead, which is obviously 
                        what he has done, then why not simply treat them as such?" 
                      <p> "Animosity." Replied Falor. 
                      <p> "What?" Asked Muerte. 
                      <p> "Animosity. Bad feelings, hatred. Now that I think about 
                        it, Clan Darkpaw only started harassing and attacking 
                        humans about a year ago. Up until that point, they lived 
                        in harmony with us. It seems logical that this Necromancer 
                        took control of them back then and has been using them 
                        to fuel hatred in the area. I would say it is designed 
                        as some sort of front for whatever he has planned." 
                      <p> "Yes, " Agathorn agreed, "that would make sense. The 
                        big question is, however, what exactly does he have planned?" 
                      <p> "Very good question." Replied Falor. "This large scale 
                        raid on the village of Aranok is the first one he has 
                        made. Its also the first time he has shown himself. Whatever 
                        he is planning, I would say it has only begun." 
                      <p> "Wait a moment." Said Agathorn. "Did you say the name 
                        of that village was Aranok?" 
                      <p> "Yes. Why?" 
                      <p> "Last I had heard, Aranok was where the powerful Druid 
                        TalLor was living." 
                      <p> "Yes, " replied Muerte, "Master Lor was living there. 
                        I had visited him a few times during the Solstices." 
                      <p> "Then that explains it." replied Agathorn, snapping 
                        his fingers. "This Necromancer is out to harness the power 
                        of the Five." 
                      <p> Seeing the confused look on the faces of his friends, 
                        Agathorn explained. 
                      <p> "Legend writes that one day, thousands of years ago, 
                        a powerful Necromancer succeeded in capturing five powerful 
                        spellcasters. One Druid, one Wizard, one Cleric, one Enchanter, 
                        and one Magician. Then, using the powers of the Dark under 
                        his control, he was able control and harness the power 
                        of these five casters. The Necromancer became incredibly 
                        powerful and managed to transport himself to the plain 
                        of the Gods, where he proceeded to do battle with them. 
                        The Gods, completely surprised by the attack, quickly 
                        fell to the evil Necromancer. Once the Gods fell, all 
                        of Norrath was blanketed in a perpetual darkness that 
                        none could lift. It was known as the Time of the Red Moon. 
                        During this period evil ran rampant and all of the lands 
                        were coated in the blood of innocents. It seemed as though 
                        all was lost." 
                      <p> "Hundreds of years passed in this way, and then the 
                        Necromancer made a mistake. Throughout these hundreds 
                        of years, the Gods had been cooperative. So much so that 
                        the Necromancer finally gotten careless, allowing one 
                        of the Gods, Rodcet Nife, to slip away from their plain 
                        and enter Norrath. Once on Norrath he mated with a Human 
                        female, and then returned to the plain of the Gods." 
                      <p> "Shortly after, this Human gave birth to a son. The 
                        child, named TrandDoshan, was immediately taken by the 
                        monks of a local monastery and raised to respect the virtues 
                        of good. Blessed by his fathers power, the child grew 
                        quicker than any human and soon became a formidable warrior. 
                        He then set out to learn the ways of the Clerics." 
                      <p> "In only a few years Doshan mastered the clerical ways. 
                        Once his training was complete, he was told of his destiny 
                        and Rodcet Nife opened a portal between Norrath and the 
                        plain of the Gods. It was there that the Necromancer and 
                        the mighty Cleric did battle. Legends reports that the 
                        battle went on for centuries, but in the end the Necromancer 
                        fell and order was restored." 
                      <p> "It is also written that TrandDoshan became the founder 
                        of a new Clerical order and it is because of him that 
                        Clerics are now such formidable warriors. Before his coming 
                        Clerics were recorded as simple spellcasters with no use 
                        for such armor and weapons as they now use." 
                      <p> The two men were fascinated with the story, as well 
                        as frightened, for they realized what it meant. 
                      <p> "So it seems as if this Human Necromancer we have been 
                        hearing about is trying to again harness these powers. 
                        We know that he has a Druidic master, but we have no way 
                        of knowing what others he has gained control of, and we 
                        still dont even know where to find him." 
                      <p> "Im afraid that things are even worse than we fear." 
                        Said Falor, putting his hand on Muertes shoulder. 
                      <p> "What do you mean, Master?" Asked Muerte, a sudden feeling 
                        of dread washing over him. 
                      <p> "While you were gone I received a letter from the High 
                        Lords of Felwithe. A band of Orcs allied with Clan Crushbone 
                        raided Felwithe and your father was taken prisoner. Im 
                        so sorry, and as unfeeling as it sounds, I must assume 
                        that the Necromancer now has control over your father, 
                        himself a mighty Cleric." 
                      <p> So goes the story of Meurte, the wandering Ranger, as 
                        recorded by the great scribe Agathorn (no relation to 
                        the enchanter).
