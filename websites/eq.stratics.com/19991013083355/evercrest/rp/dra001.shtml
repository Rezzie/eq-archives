<font face="Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica"><em>Fiction by <a href="mailto:WarDrake07@aol.com">Draciar</a></em></font><br>
</center><br>

<font face="Comic Sans MS" size=-1>
       Draciar, noble paladin of Tunare awoke. As he looked around, he was in 
unfamiliar territory. A branch cracked from above him and it fell into a 
muddy pool next to him. He had no clue how he got here, or where this was. As 
he became more awake he realized his armor, and face was encased in dirt.
<br><br>
       Draciar took a quick swim to clean the mud off his armor, and jumped 
back out. Somehow he remembered running... coming to save something. He 
couldn't remember what that something was. He shrugged and walked along a 
muddy path. He was very cautious, since he had no idea  what kind of monsters 
dwelled in these muddy crevices. Suddenly something jumped out of the water! 
Draciar's first instinct was to draw his sword. He looked at the creature and 
saw a frogman holding a spear. He slashed at it, and cut it in half neatly, 
killing it. "hmm.. easy." He remarked.
<br><br>
       He continued down the path, and stopped suddenly. Footsteps... and 
very deep, booming voices. Draciar slowly approched and saw a drow or inkie 
scum, as he liked to call it, struting away, laughing evily. He glared at the 
thing daring to kill it, but the inkie wasn't the real threat, he saw two 
trolls, tormenting an innocent female, that was trapped by a hand. Draciar 
remembered his dreams 3 or 4 days ago again. Tunare somehow spoke to him to 
come to a swamp... the Innothule Swamp. That explains where he was! He looked 
at the trolls and saw them doing...
<br><br>
      BAM! Draciar bashed one troll on the side of the head with his shield. 
The another troll swung carelessly in rage, but Draciar ducked, and the troll 
hit his companion troll standing next to him. "Ha, hey troll that just got 
hit by your "friend," it looks like he isn't really, your friend, he just 
wants to fight over the beautiful girl in the hand! I'd watch your back if I 
were you..." The first troll that Draciar bashed came from behind him and 
slamed him in the back, crushing him. Draciar tumbled but managed to stand 
upright.
<br><br>
      "Want to play that way, eh? You're no match for me!" Draciar delivered 
a blow to the trolls stomach with his steel sword, and followed up with a 
bash. The young troll was enraged and swung his club in an arch motion. 
Draciar sidestepped and slashed again, this time in the throat. Draciar 
laughed and said mockingly, "Didn't you learn at your guild that anger doesnt 
win battles, but skill and patience? Oh yeah, I forgot... the inkie was 
stupid and left 3 YOUNG trolls in charge." The troll charged after him, but 
Draciar rolled to the side, and the troll hit the other two, that were 
provoked into fighting each other.
<br><br>
      All three of them began to fight. Draciar looked to the woman in the 
hand, that was trying to wriggle free. "That was brave of you, but i fear you 
can't cant help me in this situation of freeing me, noble paladin" She said 
solemnly.
<br><br>
      Draciar replied, "At least i got the trolls off ye." He looked back to 
see one of them was bleeding signifigantly. 
<br><br>
      "Stop it, my young trolls! why are you fighting each other, but not the 
enemy? Help kill this pitiful High Elf!" Draciar spun around to see the drow. 
But the drow was too late in warningthe trolls... a troll was on the ground 
dying. The other two trolls looked at Draciar and began to advance... too 
many of them, i could take the drow one on one, and... the next thing he knew 
was pain, and then darkness...
