                  Proposed PK System For EverQuest</font></b> 
                  <div> I love the community-aspect of EverQuest. Grouping with 
                    other players, casting spells of healing and protection on 
                    random countryman as you pass by. Cooperation is encouraged 
                    and wonderfully woven into the game, and being able to learn 
                    and experience the world of Norrath without fear of getting 
                    whacked by another player on a random killing spree is a comforting 
                    luxury. But once you've had a chance to acclimate yourself 
                    to the game, EverQuest is missing something. It's missing 
                    the player vs. player environment, promised to those of us 
                    who enjoy hunting intelligent prey, and to those of us who 
                    simply enjoy the dangers of an unpredictable world. 
                    <p> Right now EverQuest employs a PK-switch method to support 
                      player vs. player. Upon entering the game, you are immune 
                      to the attacks of other players. By activating the PK mode 
                      (accomplished by completing a simple quest), you are permanently-and 
                      irrevocably-allowed to attack and be attacked by other players 
                      who have activated the option. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, 
                      it doesn't work. In three months as a phase 3 tester, I 
                      ran across exactly THREE people who had taken the time to 
                      visit their local Priest of Discord, permanently activating 
                      the PK-option. Clearly player vs. player was not a popular 
                      choice, and I soon learned why. 
                    <p> One day I was looking for a small adventuring party to 
                      hunt in the icy plains of Everfrost. An 8th-level shaman 
                      at the time, I was pleased when the "who" command turned 
                      up a 7th-level rangera perfect duo for battling mid-level 
                      monsters. I contacted the ranger via the "tell" command 
                      and invited him to join me. When he arrived, I was startled 
                      to see the name above his head burned in red, denoting that 
                      he had activated the PK-option. It was like a brand-I immediately 
                      reacted with trepidation, even though I knew he couldn't 
                      harm me. He couldn't attack me, but would he abandon me 
                      in the middle of a fight? The ranger assured me he wasn't 
                      evil, and I reluctantly grouped with him as we embarked 
                      to find prey. 
                    <p> We quickly located an orc-trooper, and I began to cast 
                      spells of protection and strength on my partner-only to 
                      discover that they were ineffectual. And for the first time, 
                      I was made aware of the full consequences of choosing the 
                      "dark" path of PK-mode. The ranger explained that my spells 
                      would have no effect on him. We still won the fight, but 
                      I was beginning to question the worth of continuing the 
                      hunt. I was much better as a healer than as a warrior, but 
                      with this tainted partner my defensive skills were of little 
                      use. Our partnership ended quickly when a pair of orc-shamans 
                      ambushed us, but it was for the better since we then went 
                      our separate ways. How could I effectively team with someone 
                      whom I could not help? And a selfish part of me also thought, 
                      "Like I really want to sit around and wait while this guy 
                      heals!" 
                    <p> At that point, I realized I would probably never group 
                      with a PK player again, and I would certainly never choose 
                      the option myself. It was just too limiting. All things 
                      being equal, I might have considered activating the PK- 
                      option once I felt I was experienced enough to be able to 
                      get away from would- be attackers. The sense of danger from 
                      intelligent threats would make the game more exciting, more 
                      unpredictable. But all things are not equal. The drawbacks 
                      of the PK-switch are simply too prohibitive 
                    <p> By activating the PK-option I would be forced to abandon 
                      some of my favorite aspects of the game. As a shaman I would 
                      be useless to most adventuring parties, and I would be left 
                      to grouping ONLY with players that had chosen the same path 
                      as I had-players who could attack me on a whim if they felt 
                      like it. Also, many players would never look at me the same. 
                      Good intentions or not, the red-colored name you get when 
                      you activate the PK-mode is like a scarlet letter, branding 
                      you from the majority of society. 
                    <p> There's a second problem I have, although this is more 
                      from a roleplaying standpoint. I'll never forget the first 
                      time I encountered a player of an enemy race. I was wandering 
                      my homeland of Everfrost, seeking the standard prey, when 
                      I saw an ogre march into view. My initial reaction was a 
                      mix of fear and anger, rage that this vile creature had 
                      tainted my home with his presence. Even after using the 
                      "consider" command to determine that he was far my superior, 
                      I wanted to take my aggression out on him anyway, if for 
                      no other reason than to act on my feelings. But instead 
                      I was forced to merely stand and watch as he lumbered right 
                      past me. I knew he couldn't harm me, and he knew the same, 
                      and that quickly took the passion out of the moment. 
                    <p> Some might argue that EverQuest isn't about killing other 
                      players, and I'd be hard-pressed to disagree. RedEye has 
                      made it clear that they want EverQuest to be a cooperative 
                      game first, and I applaud that. Not every online game has 
                      to be about "killing the other guy." However, they have 
                      also chosen to try and satisfy the audience that IS interested 
                      in PK'ing, and this decision isn't something that should 
                      be taken lightly. If you're going to market your product 
                      to a secondary market, you better make sure your product 
                      delivers to that market. Simply put: If you make PK'ing 
                      so restrictive that it's not worth it, you might as well 
                      not even bother. 
                    <p> Fortunately, this rant is leading to a point. I think 
                      existing EverQuest mechanics can set the foundation for 
                      a solid PK-system, but it needs to be more flexible. The 
                      other major consideration that needs to be taken into account 
                      is that EverQuest is a "roleplaying" game. As such, any 
                      acceptable PK system would have to somehow fit into that 
                      aspect of the game. Here is a possible solution: 
                    <p> 1. Two lifestyles, one community. There's nothing wrong 
                      with having a PK- switch option, but why can't a PK-player 
                      and a non-PK-player interact? This seems like the easiest 
                      way to make a positive change. Allow positive spells to 
                      be cast on ANY player, regardless of their PK-status. 2. 
                      Take it one step further. Eliminate the "red-flag" from 
                      the view of non- PK's. Someone who's activated PK mode still 
                      can't harm non-PK's, so why should he automatically be treated 
                      like an outcast? Instead, only players with the PK-option 
                      activated should be able to recognize other PK's. This way 
                      they can interact normally with the non-PK's while still 
                      being fully exposed to the dangers of playing PK. 
                    <p> 3. This part is more of a radical idea, but it's one that 
                      I think would benefit the roleplaying aspect of the game 
                      tremendously. Use the faction system to allow player-killing 
                      between enemy races. Why shouldn't a high-elf player be 
                      able to attack a dark-elf player on sight? This is one instance 
                      where the "red flag" would work perfectly. The red name 
                      has the effect of causing a negative first-impression-exactly 
                      what you want between the first meeting of two races that 
                      are taught to hate each other. However, that doesn't mean 
                      those two players couldn't work together. The dark-elf player 
                      might plead with the high-elf to not attack, explaining 
                      that he is not evil like his brethren. At this point, it's 
                      up to the high-elf to decide if she wants to take the risk 
                      of trusting someone who could turn on her at any second. 
                      Voila! Instant roleplaying. 
                    <p> Another plus is that the faction system already allows 
                      for improved standings. A dark-elf who works hard to improve 
                      his standing with the humans or elves may eventually become 
                      immune to attacks from players of his once-opposition race. 
                      By the same token, a human who spends enough time doing 
                      vile acts (such as killing human NPCs) could eventually 
                      attack human players. It would make it harder for players 
                      to play the evil races (dark-elves, ogres and trolls), but 
                      doesn't the character creation process already warn you 
                      that choosing an evil character has its drawbacks? 
                    <p> There are, of course, problems with this solution. What's 
                      to stop a 15th level dark-elf from journeying to Faydark 
                      and preying upon low-level characters that are just starting 
                      their adventuring careers in their home territory? It might 
                      take awhile, but eventually the game would degenerate into 
                      an Ultima Online- style bandit simulation. You could impose 
                      level-limits, saying that 15th-level character could only 
                      attack levels 12 or higher, but that causes other problems. 
                      Afterall, a third-level dark-elf who journeys as far as 
                      Everfrost is taking the same risk as if he had wandered 
                      into a bandit camp. Go where you're hated and hopelessly 
                      outmatched by enemies and you probably deserve to die, no 
                      matter what your level. It's hard to maintain both balance 
                      and realism. 
                    <p> So which one goes? Well "realism" can only take you so 
                      far. We're talking about a game where you instantly know 
                      the name of EVERY person you meet. A game where a computer-controlled 
                      character will have the exact same conversation with you 
                      every time you engage him. EverQuest simulates many real-word 
                      aspects, like night and day and the effects of hunger and 
                      thirst, but it is NOT a real-world simulation. 
                    <p> So the ultimate question is this: "What is the best, most 
                      balanced PK system that supports the play styles of both 
                      types of players?" The answer must be based on game mechanics, 
                      and not governed by an effort at realism. In that case a 
                      system based on faction standings and level-limitations 
                      is the best way to go. Clearly there is no balance in a 
                      system that allows a 10th-level character to attack a 2nd-level 
                      character, so such an option shouldn't even be considered. 
                      (Unless, of course, the 2nd-level character consents to 
                      the risk. For example, I once accepted a duel from a character 
                      13 levels my superior, and promptly ran to the guards. When 
                      he attacked me they chased him away. A dirty trick indeed, 
                      but HE was the one who initiated the challenge.) 
                    <p> What about the race restriction on PK'ing? I think it 
                      has several benefits. First, and foremost, it protects newbies. 
                      By the time a character reaches sufficient level to safely 
                      travel to an enemy land, he'll be long past the range of 
                      being able to attack low-level characters. Or, if he does 
                      manage to make the journey and is still low-enough level 
                      to attack, he'll likely get whacked by other, more experienced 
                      players in the area-players who will be all too eager to 
                      rid their home of a hated enemy. 
                    <p> Second, things will start to get dangerous when you venture 
                      into neutral areas, since you'll have to be wary of players 
                      from enemy races. No race has safe haven in the open plains 
                      of Southern Karana, so if an ogre bumps into a human-well, 
                      you better believe the lower-level character might want 
                      to turn tail and run. Or maybe the player will decide to 
                      take a chance and see if the ogre player is friendly. So 
                      much the better-as mentioned before, such interactions only 
                      work to support roleplaying. 
                    <p> One could raise the argument that this overall system 
                      would still present the problem of groups of PK's ganging 
                      up on players who aren't interested in PK'ing, but who can 
                      honestly claim that a band of trolls waiting to ambush a 
                      lone halfling ISN'T roleplaying? 
                    <p> The bottom line is this: I believe the producers of EverQuest 
                      have a golden opportunity to cash-in on a unique player 
                      vs. player environment without damaging the roleplaying 
                      aspect of the game. A player vs. player environment does 
                      not have to be littered with power-gamers and homicidal 
                      maniacs. In EverQuest the foundation is firmly set for an 
                      environment shaped by an excellent racial hatred system 
                      that is already a deeply rooted aspect of the game. Player-killing 
                      can work in a roleplaying game-especially in EverQuest. 
                      It just needs to be balanced and flexible, and given the 
                      effort, I believe both can be accomplished.
