Drysart was awoken from his rest by a fellow traveller.  "My lord, we are here," the stranger whispered as he woke the sleeping wizard.   The wizard had rested the night aboard Stormbreaker. While he slept, visions of his past drifted through his subconscious, frightening and angering him.  He had spent years seeking to understand what had happened that fateful night so many seasons ago, and just as he began to close on a vital clue, fate stole it from him.<br>
<br>
His bag, stolen by a tribe of aqua goblins, had what he was travelling to recover within it.  Everything else he had lost was worthless, and could easily be replaced, but this one item.... could not be replaced. There would never be another.  And the wizard would sooner see himself dead than to leave it with a ragtag group of goblins who probably didn't even know what it was they had.<br>
<br>
He stepped onto the docks of the Erollisi Sisterhood island and headed for a nearby rowboat. Quickly he pushed off shore and began rowing into the open ocean.  He had stumbled on the island accidentally before, but now knew exactly where he was going, and he could not get there soon enough.<br>
<br>
Hours later, he caught sight of the island in the distance.  As he drew closer, he spied no goblins. Perhaps they were on the other side of the island, he pondered. No matter. He also saw his tattered leather bag, lying amongst other various pieces of equipment the goblins had collected over who knows how long a time.  Searching again for goblins and seeing none, Drysart rowed his boat to the island shore and stepped onto the island.<br>
<br>
He remembered his last experience here. He remembered being beset upon by a horde of goblins, and he remembered swimming for his life to the nearby sister island, and he remembered the sirens.  But he tried not to think of the sirens. He was afraid they would lure him in as they did before.  Nevertheless, thoughts of their alluring aura filled his head as he scrambled up the rock cliff to where his bag had been placed.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
"Get the bag and get out," he told himself, "you don't need anymore trouble."<br>
<br>
He grabbed his bag and began rifling through it's contents. His notes and sketches were thrown aside as he desperately searched for the page he had come back for. More notes... tossed aside.  More sketches... thrown out.  He had searched and thrown away all but one page, which set folded at the bottom of his almost empty bag.<br>
<br>
"Finally..."<br>
<br>
He pulled the page from the bag, laughing... until he opened it up and found not what he was looking for, but instead found a sketched he had quickly penned of Lord Cernus and Lady Syndie during a lazy night in the tavern.<br>
<br>
"No!  It must be here!  It was in the bag!" he shouted as he again searched the pages he had tossed aside. He knew it was in the bag. The bag never left his side, no one else had been in the bag...<br>
<br>
Except....<br>
<br>
He remembered the last thing he saw before gating himself home from the islands on his last, ill-fated visit.  The goblins were going through the bag.... were they... looking for something?  No. Impossible. The goblins wouldn't have the mental capabilities to know one page from another....<br>
<br>
He stared out to the open ocean, disillusioned...<br>
<br>
"Archers ready?" the goblin lord whispered to his party who had witnessed Drysart's landing at the island. They had been watching from over a hilltop, and now they were about to make their move. He wouldn't get away this time.<br>
<br>
Drysart was staring at the ocean, crying, when he felt the sharp pains pierce his body....  then he was surrounded by black...<br>
