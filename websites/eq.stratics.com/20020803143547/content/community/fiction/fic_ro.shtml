                  <div> Something was wrong here, Simeron knew it. He could feel 
                    it in his bones and beard. The darkened street was totally 
                    empty of life. No beggars or urchins, no travellers, not even 
                    a rat was out...except him. He didn't like it at all but, 
                    he had a job to do and by Brell, he was going to get it done. 
                    So, with a heavy sigh, he hefted his hammer and shield then 
                    walked out of his small house, locking the door behind him. 
                    He wished to be with his fellows this night. Cragghorst and 
                    Mekkun were both off to the north hunting down a band of ogres 
                    lead by Filthy McNasty of the Skorchers. Both were skilled 
                    spellweavers, being a cleric and druid. and they complemented 
                    each other well. Together, they were nearly unstoppable but, 
                    they had to hunt Filthy down first and despite Mekkun's tracking 
                    skills, so far they had not caught up to him. They had found 
                    and killed several of his ogres and trolls along the way though, 
                    greatly reducing the number of their raids. Castro was off 
                    at a wizard's cauldron and Lodossx was busy helping to slay 
                    an invasion of undead. Suddenly, the glint of moonlight off 
                    an assassin's blade came streaking toward him. Just in time, 
                    he raised his shield and deflected the blow. The blade of 
                    the sword glanced off the shield with a loud clang and imbedded 
                    into the door with a thud. Quickly, Simeron swung his mighty 
                    warhammer, DwarGlum, at his assailant. The blow landed with 
                    a crunch of metal on bone and chips flew in all directions. 
                    He slammed his shield into the skeleton before him with all 
                    his strength further opening the wound. Undaunted, the skeleton 
                    tried to bash him down, to finish him. Simeron again parried 
                    with his shield and called upon Brell's power to drive this 
                    undead thing from the lands of Norrath. A blaze of blue-white 
                    light exploded from the skeleton's head and it fell in peices 
                    to the ground. Simeron scanned the area and saw a dark skinned 
                    female elf wearing Necromancer robes running off into the 
                    darkness. Sighing heavily, Simeron extracted the sword and 
                    gathered what few items of loot the skeleton had and proceeded 
                    to the clan hall for the weekly meeting of the Council. 
                    <p> Light from inside the hall shown into the street from 
                      the open door and he could hear the voices of his friends 
                      even now. Grimalkin was the loudest of course, with a chest 
                      like a barrel and the belly of a drum. Dergan could be heard 
                      calling for more dwarven ale to be brought and the meeting 
                      to be called to order. Each warband's leader, or Rik Drungi, 
                      was in attendence he knew well for Dergan's message had 
                      said there was to be important news to be discussed tonight. 
                      But, there were other voices too. Unfamiliar ones but, dwarven 
                      to be sure. So, with a grunt and a stomp he entered the 
                      hall. 
                    <p> "Hail and Well Met me kin! I be here fer our weekly meeting." 
                      he bellowed over the noise within the hall. 
                    <p> "Hail Simeron!" came the reply from his fellows. 
                    <p> Simeron looked about the hall and saw several new faces 
                      among his kin. Dergan, seeing his stare, introduced the 
                      newcomers. 
                    <p> "I want you to meet our two newest allies Simeron. This 
                      is Thorgrim, leader of the Grudge Bearers Clan and this 
                      is Grimm, commander of Grimm's Heavy Foot." 
                    <p> "A pleasure ta be sure M'Lords" Simeron said as he bowed 
                      to them. "What may we of Odin's Hammer Clan do for you?" 
                    <p> "You can vote to join the Mithril Alliance and help return 
                      the Mithril Age to the land and our peoples. Everyone else 
                      has already committed to this. You alone are the last to 
                      vote." replied Thorgrim. 
                    <p> Simeron looked on the two mighty dwarven warriors. Grimm 
                      or Thorgrim could easily be his equal in battle but, what 
                      was this 'Mithril Alliance' they spoke of? 
                    <p> "Well, truly I tell you, I know not of this alliance and 
                      until I do, I cannot vote one way or the other in good conscience. 
                      So, who would tell me about it?" 
                    <p> Dergan volunteered, with help from the others on different 
                      points, and soon Simeron agreed to the alliance idea. He 
                      also decided to jump into it in his normal fashion, both 
                      feet first and full speed ahead. He tossed the sword onto 
                      the council table and told of the continued assassination 
                      attempts against him. 
                    <p> "I say we go out and kill the whole lot of 'em. Damn Necromancers." 
                      Grimalkin said. "We're dwarves by the gods." 
                    <p> "Aye, that we should." echod Thorgrim raising his axe. 
                    <p> "I agree with you both but, WHERE do we find them? Personally, 
                      I'm more worried about me fellows than meself." Simeron 
                      answered. 
                    <p> "Well, now that we have formed the Mithril Alliance, maybe 
                      they will get the message that the dwarves have returned 
                      to Faydwer and are a force to be feared and respected!!!" 
                      Dergan said with more than a little pride. 
                    <p> "AYE!!!" erupted the unified shout of every dwarf in the 
                      hall. 
                    <p> "We have a saying that is most fitting Dergan. Barak Khazad!!! 
                      Khazad A-mienu!!! Axes of the Dwarves, the Dwarves are upon 
                      you." said Thorgrim. 
                    <p> "A good saying to be sure Thorgrim. We shall have to discuss 
                      adding that to our flag and banners so that all will know 
                      of our Mithril Alliance." Simeron replied to the nodding 
                      heads of his fellows. 
                    <p> "Aye, a good days work has been done here this night." 
                      Dergan said to the host of dwarves. "Let us drain the kegs 
                      of fine dwarven ale to the dregs in celebration of the Mithril 
                      Alliance!!!" 
                    <p> Outside a window, shrouded in darkness and invisibility, 
                      stood a lone figure. Her eyes were cold blue and her heart 
                      filled with evil. She had followed her target to the hall 
                      in hopes of getting a second chance to finish the job but, 
                      had instead watched and listened to the developments in 
                      the hall with great concern. A uniting of the dwarven clan 
                      would indeed be a terrible thing for her employers and all 
                      the dark minions of Norrath. She would need to tell BloodWyrm 
                      about this and hope that he would send word to the leaders 
                      of the other evil guilds to counter this threat. Moving 
                      away from the window and finding a dark alley, she cast 
                      Gate and returned to her safe spot. As she faded away, she 
                      muttered to herself, 
                    <p> "This Mithril Alliance will be countered and destroyed 
                      quickly. So have your celebration little ones while you 
                      can. Soon, the bodies of your dead will far outnumber those 
                      of the living. And that is the way is should be." 
                    <p> With a flash and a smile at her last thought, she was 
                      gone.

                  <div> Xiltara truly hated coming to Oggok, period. The ogres 
                    always looked like they were sizing her up for that night's 
                    side dish or worse, the next attempt at crossbreeding. But 
                    such was the problems of being a shapely dark elven female 
                    in a land where the combined intelligence of the entire city 
                    wasn't half of hers. It wouldn't be so bad but, on top of 
                    that was the awful smells of urine, blood, bile, excrement 
                    and who knows what else. Burning flesh mixed with it all as 
                    the ogres burned whatever they had caught for food. She had 
                    to say burned because ogres never really cooked anything. 
                    In fact, most of the time the victim was just eaten raw where 
                    found and killing the victim first was not a requirement for 
                    eating. But, even with all this unpleasantness, she had to 
                    make her report to Bloodwyrm, Warlord of the Skorchers. 
                    <p> How she had come into that ones employ was a bit comical. 
                      Ogres could be rather effective Shadow Knights, although 
                      no match for her own people's. And it was from one of these 
                      she learned that Bloodwyrm had gathered a group of ogres 
                      and trolls together for the expressed purpose of hunting 
                      in the commonlands for loot and food. Now, food was easy 
                      to find. If it wasn't an ogre, troll or able to kill you, 
                      it was food but, loot was a bit harder to come by. It seemed 
                      the humans in the commonlands would see the Skorchers coming 
                      and quickly take the majority of the women and children, 
                      the tenderest morsels, and the best loot they owned and 
                      send them packing all the way to Freeport if necessary to 
                      spoil the Skorchers fun. So, one day, they decided to explore 
                      a new pass they found that lead to her home. They attacked 
                      the lone guard at the pass, quickly overwhelming him. Then, 
                      they began to move into Neriak proper. Unfortunately for 
                      them, the first bridge had more then one guard. In fact, 
                      it had several highly trained guards and spellcasters at 
                      most times. She happened to be there when the Skorcher patrol 
                      showed up. Now, while ogres and trolls aren't known for 
                      their brains, they are not completely stupid. And the leader 
                      quickly determined that this fight was going to be more 
                      then they had bargained for so, he grabbed one of the shadow 
                      knights with him and sent her forward to speak with them. 
                      She knew exactly how she felt, for the same thing happened 
                      to her. In the ensuing conversation, not only did the Skorchers 
                      get to leave but, she became an "adviser" to the Warlord, 
                      Bloodwyrm. Her job had started out mainly as getting the 
                      people to flee toward the Skorcher patrols by attacking 
                      the opposite side of the town with undead and summons from 
                      the magic users of her race. Soon, she had grown enough 
                      in power to cloak herself in the darkness and thus, she 
                      began to scout the towns. Now, Bloodwyrm had heard from 
                      a dwarven traitor that several clans were joining together 
                      to return all of Norrath to their idea of perfection. 
                    <p> On a throne made from the bones of his enemies sat Bloodwyrm, 
                      Warlord of the Skorchers. Before him, a troll carver was 
                      preparing to carve up a frog-man for his dinner. How he 
                      wished it was a dwarf instead of that croaking thing. Dwarves 
                      were much more fun to prepare because they lived longer 
                      and therefore screamed more. He raised a small keg of beer 
                      to his mouth and drank deeply. He really hated dwarves. 
                      Always getting underfoot and trying to spoil his fun. Now, 
                      a dwarf had been brought before him saying he was an ally 
                      and had news to prove it. It seemed some of the dwarven 
                      clans had banded together and formed some sort of alliance. 
                      A Mithril Alliance he had said. Bloodwyrm was actually almost 
                      sorry he had decided he didn't want a dwarf for an ally 
                      but, that dwarf was fun to prepare. His attention was moved 
                      from the croaks of pain from his dinner to the shapely dark 
                      skinned female that entered his hall. Unlike most of the 
                      leers of his troops, Bloodwyrm's stare was not one of physical 
                      lust or hunger, but of a lust and hunger for the knowledge 
                      he knew she brought him. 
                    <p> "I take it you completed your mission Xiltara." he spoke 
                      clearly. 
                    <p> "For the most part Bloodwyrm." came the reply. 
                    <p> "For the most part. That means you DIDN'T complete it 
                      then. Just what am I bothering to pay you for if you can't 
                      get things done?" the ogre scowled. 
                    <p> "You pay me to stay alive long enough to bring you important 
                      news." Xiltara scowled back. 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm was actually impressed with her arrogance. He 
                      could respect it, but not tolerate it. 
                    <p> "If you wish to REMAIN alive necromancess you best learn 
                      you are no longer in your homeland but mine." 
                    <p> Xiltara understood the threat. She had indirectly challenged 
                      Bloodwyrm in his own hall. Not the smartest of things to 
                      do. But, the fact that she still breathed was proof enough 
                      that he was not overly angry...this time at least. 
                    <p> "My pardon Bloodwyrm. I did forget, you know how we females 
                      of Neriak are. I was not able to eliminate the problem you 
                      wanted. He was too quick and strong. But, I know he is not 
                      with his warband and I know why not." she said. 
                    <p> "So Simeron Steelhammer still lives. That is good I think. 
                      His death will be made sweeter when done by my own hand 
                      anyway. If he is in Kaladim, where is his warband and why 
                      is he not with them?" he replied. 
                    <p> "His warband was not in the city, not a single member. 
                      Where they are, I could not find out but, he was there because 
                      of his position as the leader of the Warhammers. There was 
                      a meeting of the leaders of the Odin's Hammer Clan's warbands 
                      and chieftain along with the leaders of the clans Grudge 
                      Bearers and Heavy Foot. They have formed an alliance to 
                      return all of Norrath to the "Mithril Age". I thought you 
                      would like to know this rather then having me kill Simeron 
                      and die for it." 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm did not like the sound of that. The Warhammers 
                      had been getting in the way recently of his troop's raids 
                      and now, he found the leader was not with them, but in Kaladim. 
                      Furthermore, it seemed his old enemies the Grudge Bearers 
                      and Heavy Foot had joined with this new threat, Odin's Hammer, 
                      to form one large dwarven problem named the Mithril Alliance. 
                      Blast that Thorgrim and Grimm. How good it will be to feast 
                      on those two dwarves. This was not good, not good at all. 
                      But, something would have to be done and he knew he better 
                      be the one to do it or the Skorcher might wind up wiped 
                      out as fodder for the dark elves. 
                    <p> "You were right this time to bring me the information. 
                      Tell your people this and that I wish to speak with them. 
                      I will send word to all the hordes of this danger. Soon, 
                      the Mithril Alliance will be no more then a bad dream. We 
                      will bind together against the common threat and crush them, 
                      with the Skorchers in the lead!!!" 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm waved Xiltara away and turned back to the near 
                      dead frog-man, still being slowly cut and torn to pieces. 
                      Its weak cries of pain and dispair made him hungry. And 
                      his thoughts of fresh dwarf being prepared for him soon 
                      forced even his grim face to hold a smile. Maybe this Mithril 
                      Alliance wasn't so bad after all.

                  III. A Rumbling of Thunder</font></b> 
                  <div> Simeron sat on the dock fishing and thinking of rejoining 
                    his warband somewhere in the heart of the west commonlands. 
                    Castro had joined him and was practicing some new spells he 
                    had learned while at the cauldron. The recent attack by a 
                    dark elf necromancer had worried him. Not that he was worried 
                    for himself but, she had struck at him in the heart of Kaladim, 
                    the dwarven nation's capital. That fact worried him because 
                    if an assassin's blade could find him there, how much easier 
                    for it to hunt his fellows in the commonlands? He remembered 
                    how his band had grown, only to be cut down once again in 
                    battle. Darlentan, Kringe and Galendor were all gone now. 
                    Killed in a pitched battle with a Skorcher patrol. He himself 
                    bore a still tender scar on his cheek from the sword of a 
                    troll shadowknight. But, he took solice that they had won 
                    the fight, killing all but one of the six ogres and trolls 
                    and losing only three of thier six. Still, half the group 
                    dead was not acceptable to him. As he pulled in another fish 
                    and rebaited his hook, he could see the sail of the boat that 
                    would take Castro and him to Freeport where his Lok Trommi 
                    Cragghorst waited. They would join the rest of the warband 
                    in the west commonlands and then proceed to finish off the 
                    remnants of Filthy's band. He pulled in a last fish and put 
                    away his pole, retrieving his warhammer and shield while Castro 
                    finished meditating. As they stepped onto the deck of the 
                    ship, Simeron could not but feel something strange and terrible 
                    was brewing. Deep inside, he heard Brell's call and warning 
                    to prepare for war. 
                    <p> Cragghorst made his way through the streets of Freeport 
                      toward the docks. Simeron and Castro were due to arrive 
                      soon and he was supposed to join them and lead them to the 
                      rest of the warband in the commonlands. Freeport was everything 
                      he had come to expect from a human town founded on greed 
                      and corruption. Smugglers, Paladins, Necromancers, Thieves, 
                      Rangers and just about every other class of person could 
                      be found here. In fact, about the only races not found were 
                      the ogres, trolls and dark elves. And with a little coin, 
                      even these could get some unsavory mage to cloak them from 
                      view so they could slip unobserved through the city and 
                      onto the boats. The city streets had the normal beggars 
                      and travellers about, a millita man was having a heated 
                      arguement with a knight over who was the rightful law in 
                      Freeport and the odd thief was about too he knew. He worked 
                      his way down to the dock in time to see the boat pulling 
                      up to the dock and his friends disembarking. 
                    <p> "Hola Sim." he said smiling. 
                    <p> "Hail and Well Met Cragg. I have much news for the warband. 
                      Castro has got some new tricks to help us too." Simeron 
                      said as he clasped Cragg's arm. 
                    <p> "News? Good news I hope. We've enough bad news to last 
                      a good while." 
                    <p> "Aye, that we have but the news is good. Odin's Hammer 
                      has joined with the Grudge Bearers and Heavy Foot to form 
                      the Mithril Alliance. We are all pure dwarven clans and 
                      are going to work together to return Norrath to the Mithril 
                      Age." 
                    <p> "That is no small undertaking." said Cragghorst looking 
                      about him. "Especially from what I see here..." he sighed. 
                    <p> "Ah well...that never stopped us before did it?" Simeron 
                      smiled. "Let's be off to the warband now and tell them." 
                    <p> The high elf and two dwarves headed through the city and 
                      out the west gate toward the commonlands. Unknown to them, 
                      a human Shadowknight had followed them from the port and 
                      out into the commonlands. When they came to the warband, 
                      he noted the location and immediately reported to Xiltara 
                      and the Skorcher patrol. Xiltara decided to launch an attack 
                      at night with undead pets first followed by the two orges 
                      and two trolls that the patrol contained. As night fell, 
                      the pets were summoned and the whole group got into position 
                      to attack. The dwarves and elf were still in the same area 
                      and had killed a couple of trolls and an orge. The last 
                      of Filthy's band save Filthy himself. The pets were sent 
                      into the fight first followed by the foot soldiers. Xiltara 
                      stayed back and struck from afar. 
                    <p> Simeron hear the bones clattering before he saw the skeletons 
                      attack as did the others. He summoned the power of Brell 
                      and hit the lead one with a ward and then closed on it. 
                      He saw several others wards hit two others and knew the 
                      others were joining the fight. As he got closer, he knew 
                      they were in trouble though and yelled to his warband that 
                      these were no skeletons, but pets of some necromancers and 
                      to be wary of ambush. Three pets clawed and bashed the troop 
                      while getting beat down to pieces themselves. Castro let 
                      loose a bolt of fire that dropped one of them on the spot 
                      and a few more wards left the other two piles of bone on 
                      the ground. It was then that the ogres and trolls charged 
                      into the them howling with rage. Xiltara and Castro began 
                      having a wizards duel, each firing off spells at the other. 
                      Simeron was hit with two harm hands and was saved from death 
                      only by his own healing touch and that of Sandman. Cragghorst 
                      and Lodossx were healing, smiting and bashing the trolls 
                      while the Simeron, Haven and Sandman fought the two ogres. 
                      Xiltara knew she was losing the duel with Castro and why, 
                      she had no clerics to heal her and her life drain was not 
                      enough to compensate for their healing magic. One orge bellowed 
                      and fell with a loud thud as the other turned and began 
                      to run. Seeing this, the trolls broke also leaving her with 
                      no choice but to join them in flight and hope she could 
                      live. Haven let out a yell and started to give chase but 
                      was called back by Cragghorst. They were all hurt badly 
                      and each one was too close to death to go charging off into 
                      the night. Simeron had to agree. The healing magic of the 
                      clerics had turned the tide this night but, that was gone 
                      as was Brell's gift to his two paladins, thier healing touch. 
                      Castro was low on mana and all were dangerously low on life. 
                      Just then, a flash of lightning and clap of thunder broke 
                      the silence as rain began to fall as if to confirm the groups 
                      feelings of dread. Simeron thought to himself that the rumbling 
                      in the clouds was not the only rumbling done this night. 
                      He knew in his heart that the rumble of war would soon overtake 
                      this place and others. So, looting the dead ogre, the band 
                      returned to Freeport while the Skorcher patrol and Xiltara 
                      returned to Oggok telling of the pitched battle to Bloodwyrm.

                  <div> Within days, the Skorchers had received word that many 
                    others were concerned over the Alliance and would rally to 
                    the call to destroy it. This had been what Bloodwyrm had been 
                    waiting for. The dwarves had made many enemies over these 
                    long years. The Crushbone Orc Clan, the goblins of Dagnor's 
                    Cauldron and the Butcherblok Mountains themselves, the Deadfist 
                    Orcs, the Dark Elves of Nerriak and so many more. Even some 
                    gnomes, necromancers all, had spoken to him of joining with 
                    the Skorchers in killing off all these dwarves. Yes, this 
                    was shaping up to be a very nice battle. 
                    <p> "The time has come to deal with this dwarven alliance 
                      once and for all. Today, I, Bloodwyrm, Warlord of the Skorchers 
                      have declared war on the Mithril Alliance. We will take 
                      special care to kill anyone that even speaks that name with 
                      anything but hatred." he told to his troops. "We will wipe 
                      out the very memory of this Mithril Alliance !!!" 
                    <p> In a hall far away, Durgan, Thergrim and Grimme sat discussing 
                      how the Alliance should go about setting up and doing its 
                      business when a high elf paladin knocked on the door and 
                      walked in. 
                    <p> "Well met dwarves of the MA. I am Palantir, friend of 
                      Simeron. I bring word that his warband was ambushed in the 
                      commons by a Skorcher patrol. All survived and even managed 
                      to fell one of the foul beasts. He said to tell you that 
                      they have received word that the Skorchers and their allies 
                      have declared war on you. We of the Blackwatch would like 
                      to help if you are willing." 
                    <p> "As are the Tal Kor." came a voice from behind him. A 
                      wood elf stepped into the hall. 
                    <p> "I am Celestak, also a friend of Simeron's. Well met to 
                      you all." 
                    <p> "It seems Simeron has been busy these long days in Norrath." 
                      smile Durgan to his fellow dwarves. "Too bad he seems to 
                      prefer elves to dwarves though". 
                    <p> "Aye," grinned Thergrim and Grimme. "One has to wonder 
                      if he has tree sap in his veins." Thergrim laughed. "But, 
                      you are both welcome. We will discuss how you can help us. 
                      And please tell us what our favorite troublemaker has gotten 
                      us into now...." 
                    <p> Simeron and the Warhammers boarded the ship bound for 
                      Kaladim. Along the way, while the others fished, watched 
                      sharks swim by or looked at the odd creature on the various 
                      islands, all he did was sit and dwell on the coming war. 
                      War brought so much carnage and waste of resources and lives. 
                      But, it had always been this way. Ogres and trolls were 
                      a dwarf's natural enemy as much as orcs and goblins were. 
                      Just as they had been part of the campaign against the Crushbone 
                      Clan Orcs and the goblinkin of the Butcherblok Mountains, 
                      so they must again set about building strong teams for the 
                      many skirmishes and open battles that would come in the 
                      near future. The good news was, there had been a dramatic 
                      increase in the number of members in the Mithril Alliance 
                      as well as several other guilds and orders wanting to help. 
                      The bad news was that most were untested in battle and had 
                      only the barest of training. Add to that the rumors of the 
                      Skorchers getting other evil groups to side with them and 
                      it spelled many deaths in the coming war. In all the warband's 
                      fights, it was the teamwork and trust of each to do what 
                      their job was that carried them through the hardest fights. 
                      The clerics healed, the rouges backstabbed and scouted, 
                      the warriors and paladins carried the brunt of blows and 
                      taunted their enemies to keep them off the rouges and healers. 
                      He had added friendly elves to increase the firepower of 
                      the groups and found that while elven mages couldn't take 
                      a hit very well, given a chance, they could inflict horrendous 
                      damage in a short amount of time and kill fleeing opponents 
                      without a lengthy chase that might bring other enemies to 
                      bear on the band when they were spread out. If the rare 
                      bard, ranger and/or druid could be joined, it opened up 
                      many possibilities. Many a time in his travels did the lively 
                      tune of a bard make the trip shorter or he find his spirit 
                      filled with lupine auras that did the same. And the tracking 
                      of rangers and druids was invaluable when hunting a specific 
                      target. As he watched Casto take a pot shot at a hill giant 
                      on a distant island, thus getting it to wade dangerously 
                      close to the boat, he had to shake his head. Yes, having 
                      elven friends was a good thing. 
                    <p> Xiltara had finally returned to her homeland. It was good 
                      to see it again. As she hurried to the guards and soldiers 
                      of her race though, she did not take time to enjoy it. A 
                      group of dwarves had attacked the guards at the pass and 
                      slew them. She had come upon the seen as the foul little 
                      pests were looting the fallen dark elves. They proceeded 
                      to head into Nerriak and she had to warn her people of this. 
                      It seemed that the war had hardly been declared and already 
                      the dwarves were infesting her homeland. Not infesting she 
                      reminded herself, not yet. One small band is not an army. 
                      But, it did have to be dealt with. 
                    <p> "Captain!" she yelled as she approached the first bridge. 
                      "Why have you allowed those accursed bearded gnomes into 
                      our homeland?" 
                    <p> "What bearded gnomes are you talking about miss?" came 
                      his reply. 
                    <p> "The ones that just killed your two men at the pass dolt! 
                      Now take your men and hunt them down and deal with this 
                      problem NOW." 
                    <p> The captain, who was not used to this kind of tone when 
                      someone addressed him, was incensed. 
                    <p> "And who are YOU to give ME orders might I inquire?" he 
                      hissed as he lowered his hand to his sword. 
                    <p> "Finish that move Captain and you shall serve as my slave 
                      in death." Xiltara hissed back. "I am Xiltara Necross. Of 
                      House Necross, first house of Nerriak and an initiate of 
                      the third circle in the Hall of Death. Do you wish to challenge 
                      me to a duel or should I just kill you all right here and 
                      now?" 
                    <p> The guard's eyes widened and the captain gulped, quickly 
                      moved his hand away from his sword and was visibly shaken. 
                      House Necross boasted the deadliest necromancers and shadowknights 
                      in all of Neriak. 
                    <p> "Forgive me please M'Lady, I did not recognize you." blurted 
                      the captain. 
                    <p> Xiltara's eye flared and her face grew stern. She wasn't 
                      powerful enough to even take the captain, let alone the 
                      entire group but, they didn't know that and many of her 
                      family could, though probably wouldn't. This would work 
                      to build her name among the soldiers of her race. 
                    <p> "Be thankful I don't have time to deal with you properly 
                      now. Go do as I told you and get replacements for your men 
                      here to guard this bridge. And if a single one of those 
                      THINGS gets away, I will do things to you that will make 
                      you welcome death gladly. Understand?" she said smiling 
                      evilly. 
                    <p> "Y-y-yes M'Lady. Right away." stuttered the captain as 
                      he ran off to get more troops. 
                    <p> As she entered Nerriak, she immediately headed to the 
                      Hall of Death. Once she had told the guildmaster of the 
                      events of the last few days, he brought it to the attentions 
                      of all the guilds and leaders in Nerriak. Over the next 
                      few days, it was decided that while Nerriak in general would 
                      officially stay out of the armed conflict, it would send 
                      ambassadors to the various allies of the Skorchers and allow 
                      any dark elf group or person to join with them upon Bloodwyrm's 
                      approval. As Xiltara once again began to cast her Gate spell 
                      to return to Bloodwyrm's land, she held not only this message 
                      in her hands but, she though, the final nail in the coffin 
                      of many a bearded gnome.

                  <div> Bloodwyrm liked what he saw before him. The Orcish Horde 
                    and several other groups had come to stand with the Skorchers 
                    against the Mithril Alliance. Xiltara had brought word that 
                    the dark elves officially would not get involved but, that 
                    any who wanted to had to go through him to do so. Also, the 
                    black elves had sent Ambassador DVinn to Emperor Crush of 
                    the Crushbone Orcs to add thier wieght to the already large 
                    mass set against the Alliance. Yes, things were looking most 
                    nice for the Skorchers. Soon, many stew pots would have dwarf 
                    meat in them. 
                    <p> Turning away from papers on hit stone table, he headed 
                      to his throne for some more beer and prehaps a halfling 
                      or two for a snack. Just as he sat down and grabbed a small 
                      cask of beer, Darrig entered the hall very upset. 
                    <p> "The Alliance has gained more allies to stand against 
                      us!!!" puffed Darrig. 
                    <p> "So? We smash dem too. Dey all little tings to us big 
                      ogres and trolls." Brassdog replied before stuffing some 
                      dwarf pickles into his gaping maw. 
                    <p> "And who exactly are these allies Darrig?" Bloodwyrm queried 
                      before taking a long pull of the amber liquid within the 
                      cask. 
                    <p> "I have heard rumors that the Blackwatch and several other 
                      guilds are joining with them. This does not help matters 
                      at all." Darrig replied. 
                    <p> No, this was not a good thing indeed Bloodwyrm thought 
                      to himself. The Blackwatch had many members. He wondered 
                      how many would show up to aid those accused dwarves once 
                      the war came to its full fury. 
                    <p> "Just the Blackwatch? What other guilds are answering 
                      the dwarven call to arms?" Bloodwyrm said to Darrig. 
                    <p> "I have heard Tal Kor mentioned and several smaller ones. 
                      This will give them much magic to support thier fighters. 
                      We need to find more help and soon." 
                    <p> "We have enough now but, will have more coming. The dwarves 
                      are already fighting the orcs and goblins of Faydwer and 
                      will not be able to send their entire force against us. 
                      Also, we have the Horde and other allies that will add to 
                      our already strong legions. No, we dont need more strength. 
                      We need to attack. And I have just the plan for that." Bloodwyrm 
                      said with an evil gleam in his eye.

                      </center>
                    <p> Across the Ocean of Tears, in the heart of Kaladim, Simeron 
                      sat and listened to an endless parade of speakers discussing 
                      the terms and rules of the Alliance. Some dwarves simply 
                      got up and left, stating that they were a member of thier 
                      clan but not of the Alliance. Other still were concerned 
                      that the clans would be absorbed into a single one under 
                      the Alliance. 
                    <p> "So much we've to do to prepare for the war and here we 
                      sit listening to idle prattle and worries of things that 
                      will never come to pass." he said to Cragghorst. "We'll 
                      never be ready at this pace." 
                    <p> "Well, you know our kin Sime." Cragg countered. "It takes 
                      forever for them to agree on something but, once the deciding 
                      is done, it done." 
                    <p> "Agreed but this is getting a bit too much. How hard is 
                      it to say Yes, we are going to wipe out the ogres and trolls, 
                      and be done with it?" 
                    <p> Cragghorst shrugged his shoulders and continued to watch 
                      the meeting unfold. Grimme, Thergrim and Durgan were discussing 
                      the Alliance plans with the large gathering of the troops 
                      from each clan. He notice Simeron seemed more agitated then 
                      normal, even for this kind of meeting. Simeron got up. gave 
                      a wave of his hand to the leaders and left. Cragghorst wanted 
                      to follow him and find out what bothered his Rik Drungi 
                      but, one thing he had learned from this old dwarf was that 
                      when the time came, Simeron would tell him what troubled 
                      him. So, with a sigh, he turned his attention back to the 
                      meeting where Grimme was explaining for the 11th time how 
                      clans could be members of the Mithril Alliance and still 
                      be independent too. 
                    <p> The tunnels of Kaladim were thier hazy selves as Simeron 
                      headed to the entrance. He had to get away from all the 
                      noise of the meeting and do some thinking on his own. Things 
                      were not to his liking at all. Too many of the Alliance 
                      were either not prepared for or unwilling to fight the upcoming 
                      war. Add to this that a patrol of the Trollslayers had not 
                      returned from Nerriak as expected, Dark Elves had been discovered 
                      to have a castle off Lesser Faydark called Mistmoore and 
                      reports had come in that they had sent an ambassador, DVinn, 
                      to the Crushbone Orcs. It all added up to something that 
                      left a taste of orge swill in his mouth. Bloodwyrm was behind 
                      this he knew and here they sat waiting to be attacked. As 
                      he passed the guards, they gave him an acknowledgable nod 
                      of thier heads which he returned. He headed toward the crossroads 
                      and several goblin camps around that location. Killing some 
                      of those green skinned termites would feel good. Along the 
                      way, he picked up several short beards who he promptly began 
                      training in group tactics. 
                    <p> 'This is what we should be doing,' he thought to himself 
                      as another goblin fell before the howling dwarves. 'Training 
                      those we know are going to be in the upcoming war.' 
                    <p> Silent and unseen stood a figure not far from the dwarven 
                      band. His eyes were cold and calculating, his chain armor 
                      and twin mino axes spoke of hundreds of foes vanquished 
                      but, his smile was as warm as the sun on a spring day. 
                    <p> "You old dwarf. You never tire of training the young for 
                      battle do you?" 
                    <p> Slightly startled, Simeron spun about with his two handed 
                      sword at the ready to find Celestak standing just out of 
                      reach. 
                    <p> "Dammit ya durn tree elf!" Simeron blustered. "You know 
                      better then that. Especially nowdays wit all the strange 
                      goings on 'round here. You damn near scared me sober!" 
                    <p> Celestak, still smiling that impish smile, walked up to 
                      his old friend and watched the young dwarves attacking the 
                      goblins. 
                    <p> "You really need to calm yourself Sime. Your a bit high 
                      strung these days." he chuckled. 
                    <p> "I've got cause to be too. As do you if your going to 
                      be fighting dem scum wit us. Hell, I'm beginnin' to wonder 
                      if we are going to be prepared for the war ahead at all. 
                      Nobody is training the new recruits becuase they are too 
                      busy with the damn Alliance rules." Simeron huffed back. 
                    <p> "I wouldn't worry over that too much." Celestak said. 
                      "We have more then enough to bring this war to a quick and 
                      decisive end." 
                    <p> "Maybe," Simeorn replied. "But that same idea was spoken 
                      when we started on the Crushbone Orc Clan campaign over 
                      30 years ago. We aren't much further along then we was when 
                      we started. Ah well, my Warhammers will be ready." 
                    <p> "I hope so, we have survived many a fight together and 
                      the thought of loosing you is not one I like much. Even 
                      though your grumbling is annoying." smiled the wood elf. 
                    <p> Simeron knew his friend was trying to lighten his mood. 
                      And, despite himself, it was working as it always did. He 
                      had found that in each race, there were those that could 
                      be trusted and those that could not. The trick was to find 
                      out quick which was which. Celestak had proven himself to 
                      him many times as had the others. As he turned his attention 
                      back to the group of short beards taking down the last goblin, 
                      he found himself still troubled about the upcoming war but, 
                      more hopeful now.

                  <div> Simeron watched his opponent closely, waiting. She was 
                    very agile and quick but, he was too so, it was a matter of 
                    act/react. Farona was as deadly an opponent as any dwarven 
                    male he had seen. Both on the battle field and in the council 
                    chamber. Now, they sparred to show the short beards the art 
                    that is battle, the dance of death. Farona brought her two 
                    handed sword around quick and cut short, trying to catch Simeron 
                    with his guard up but, the old dwarf had seen too many battle 
                    to fall for that trick and easily deflected the blow off his 
                    shield and sent a return strike with his hammer screaming 
                    at Farona. Just as quick though, she interposed her blade 
                    between her and the incoming weapon and parried the blow away. 
                    But, Simeron then trust his shield into her exposed ribbs, 
                    recieving a satisfying grunt from her in return. Smiling, 
                    he went back into his battle crouch. 
                    <p> "Your beard is getting longer but you still fall for that 
                      trick every time lass." 
                    <p> "Jest ya wait ya grizzle belly," Farona growled. "I ain't 
                      done jest yet. Have at ye!!!" 
                    <p> Farona lunged forward and Simeron stepped to the side 
                      only to be met by the pommel of her sword on his helmet. 
                      The klang almost deafened him and he saw quite a few stars 
                      even if the sun was high in the sky. A lesser dwarf would 
                      have collapsed on the spot but not Simeron. Dazed, he managed 
                      to put up a good defense till his head cleared a bit, even 
                      gaining back some of the ground he had lost. 
                    <p> "My my my, we do pack a wallop dont we gal..." 
                    <p> "Aye, that I do. Ahn ya can bet your beard I got more 
                      fer ya." Farona smiled. 
                    <p> "Oh really, well, let's see if you can hit with that thing 
                      as good as ya talk!" Simeron said as he suddenly closed 
                      on Farona. 
                    <p> Farona parried two blows of Simeron's hammer and dodged 
                      a shield bash. Missed with two swings of her own and kicked 
                      Simeron who blocked with his shield. She loved sparring 
                      with the old wardog almost as much as hunting with him. 
                      She wondered how he could keep up with such younger dwarves 
                      then himself. He had to be close to middle age but he seemed 
                      no older then herself. As she deflected another hammerblow, 
                      she saw that he had got her guard up again just before feeling 
                      that blasted shield slam into the exact same spot. 
                    <p> "Ooofff, now that tears it ya old fart. Ya hit da same 
                      spot!" 
                    <p> "But of course my dear," Simeron smiled. "What better 
                      place to remind you to keep that guard down." 
                    <p> Smiling, Farona said, "Alright, be dat way. Two can play 
                      at dat game." 
                    <p> She launched a quick kick that Simeron deflected with 
                      his hammer and slashed with her sword but was met by that 
                      blasted shield. Her second blow was again a hammer with 
                      her pommel but this time, Simeron jumped out of the way 
                      and she barely got her sword back to parry the return strike. 
                      The two dwarves continued to spar another five minutes like 
                      this with niether landing more then a glancing blow. Finally, 
                      they both agreed to take a break and pair up the short beared 
                      for further instruction. 
                    <p> "Your learning well lass." Simeron sat leaning against 
                      a tree and taking a long pull of water from his flask. "Your 
                      a fine warrior. As good as I have seen in many a winter. 
                      And I've seem alot of 'em." 
                    <p> "Thank ye." she said somewhat taken off guard by Simeron's 
                      uncharacteristic tone. "Ya ain't no whelp yerself ya know." 
                    <p> Simeron nodded at the compliment and grinned. It had been 
                      a long time since he had been this happy. The war was finally 
                      taking shape but, the training had begun in ernest now and 
                      he felt they would be much better prepared for the upcoming 
                      battles. Word that the Skorchers had gathered Dark Elves 
                      to attack the elven kingdoms had brought the elves into 
                      line with the Alliance out of sheer nessecity. Now, while 
                      the dwarves fought the ogres and trolls in the Desert of 
                      Ro, the elves would be defending Faydwer against the Dark 
                      Elves. It could be expected that some Dark Elves and Elves 
                      would be in Ro just like some dwarves would stay in Faydwar. 
                      The best part was he could see the others were beginning 
                      to work like teams. Farona, Brokkel, Dorgin and Dwinuk complemented 
                      each other well as did the many other small teams that had 
                      trained together these last weeks. Even his own Warhammers 
                      were stronger, better then before. With the elven and some 
                      gnomish allies, he was sure that not only would they win 
                      the War of Ro but, still come home to a safe and happy Kaladim 
                      and Faydwer. Still something troubled him but, he just couldn't 
                      put his finger on it. He told Farona he was going to go 
                      for a small walk and would return before the sun sank to 
                      mid afternoon. 
                    <p> Farona watched Simeron go with more then a bit of concern. 
                      He was not acting normal. Hadn't been since that ambush 
                      in the desert. She knew he was not scared, at least not 
                      for himself. And she didnt think it was for his warband 
                      either, at least it didn't appear to be. She turned back 
                      to the short beards and shook her head. All she could do 
                      was what all the others who knew him could do. Wait and 
                      see what happened. 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm was happy today. His plan was working well. 
                      Already many of the members of the Alliance and their allies 
                      were going to stay away from Ro to defend their pitiful 
                      homes. The Dark Elves had decided, at the suggestion of 
                      Xiltara, to invade Faydwer at the same time the battle would 
                      be joined in the Desert of Ro. What made this possible was 
                      the discovery of an underground route pass those blasted 
                      freeport guards. All one had to do was to sneak through, 
                      kill a human or two in the tunnels and then wait for the 
                      ship to come. Seems the captains are not to particular who 
                      you are if you have enough money or can eat them. As he 
                      set about drilling his troops, he watched them terrorize 
                      and kill a village of barbarian fishmongers in the commonlands 
                      in short order and then proceed to gobble up the dried fish 
                      and a few live ones they could catch near the lake shore. 
                      He looked over the pitiful loot and gave a grunt. 
                    <p> "We need richer targets then this." he said disappointedly. 
                    <p> "They are all in Freeport and you have forbidden us to 
                      use the passage to launch raids" grumbled Slooge. 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm turned and glared at the troll. "Yes I have 
                      and with good reason. If the stupid hoomans learn that we 
                      know about the passage, they will guard it or worse, block 
                      it. We cannot chance that for a mere triful of the loot 
                      we will get once we win the war. There will be plenty of 
                      time for sacking Freeport AFTER we have won." 
                    <p> "If we win." Slooge corrected. "We dont know for sure 
                      we are going to. We are badly outnumbered even with the 
                      Dark Elves." 
                    <p> "We are much stronger. And know the land better. We will 
                      win and I will tolerate no more of this talk." Bloodwyrm 
                      said ending the conversation. 
                    <p> "Besides, I have more pleasant things to attend to right 
                      now." he said as a barbarian female was brought before him 
                      bound and gagged. His troops leered and grunted as he drug 
                      her struggling form into one of the huts then when to find 
                      one for themselves. This had indeed been a good raid after 
                      all. 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm tossed the female onto the hide mats and told 
                      her in that awful common tounge that if she wanted to live, 
                      she best be still and quiet while he sat down and ate. To 
                      add wieght to his words he tore the arm from one of the 
                      dead males and began to eat it raw. My how he relished the 
                      terror and fear in her eyes. How he longed to see it in 
                      all of his enemies eyes. All the news he had heard was not 
                      good. Xiltara had brought word that Thurgrum and a small 
                      band of dwarves and elves had invaded Crushbone and killed 
                      not only the Emporer, Prophet, Royal Guards and many other 
                      orcs, freeing many elven and dwarven slaves, but that they 
                      had managed to kill Dvinn in a pitched battle. To add to 
                      this disaster, one of the slaves freed was a gnome of the 
                      Collective. That group of gnomish magic users that the necros 
                      had warned him about. Now, they had added thier powers to 
                      that of the Alliance. At least some had. Others were going 
                      to help the elves but the point is that more and more things 
                      were going wrong. 
                    <p> As he tore the other arm off the body and began to chew, 
                      he thought back at how this came to pass. It seems that 
                      an orc runner was attacked and killed in the Butcherblok 
                      Mountains that had a pouch of letters. Some were stolen 
                      of course but some were dispatches to Dvinn. Thurgrum was 
                      the leader of the group that did the deed and he immediately 
                      took them to Durgan who in turn asked Simeron about them. 
                      Of course that one knew who to talk to. Always he did. Simeron 
                      directed Thurgrum to take them to the Guildmaster of the 
                      High Elven Paladin guild and once there, Thurgrum was told 
                      to hunt down Dvinn and the Emporer, which they did. Now, 
                      the Crushbone orcs were in disarray and of no real help. 
                      On top of that, the goblins had become useless because the 
                      Alliance had started using them for training the new recruits. 
                      The good news was that Castle Mistmoore still was held and 
                      the Freeport Militia had told some of his human agents of 
                      a secret passage under the city that would conveniently 
                      be left unguarded for the right price. So, the war could 
                      be taken to Faydwer as well as here in Ro. As he wiped the 
                      fresh blood from his mouth and stood. He decided to have 
                      a talk with a certain dark elf female the next day. And 
                      with that thought, he grabbed his captive and began his 
                      other business.

                  <div> Thurgrum grunted in pain as the orc centurion stabbed 
                    him in his side with a shortened spear. He then landed a horrific 
                    blow to the creature's head with the shaft of his double bladed 
                    dwaven war axe, caving in its skull and killing it instantly. 
                    Pedron and Dekker were healing him, Varuss and Galleron while 
                    Suvious rained fire from the sky down upon the host of orc 
                    guards before them. Pawns fell like autumn leaves before the 
                    howling wintery winds, centurions began to turn and run only 
                    to be cut down by the mystical energies of the two clerics 
                    and the powerful mage and the few who didn't run were finished 
                    off by the two paladins and the mighty warrior. Within a matter 
                    of minutes, some 20 orc bodies lie strewn under the pink morning 
                    sky. 
                    <p> "What a reception." Pedron said. "You think they know 
                      we are here and our purpose?" 
                    <p> "Don't matter none." Thurgrum replied. "Dvinn is as good 
                      as dead by Brell." 
                    <p> "That is not so easy a task as you might thing Thurgrum." 
                      Suvious warned. 
                    <p> "Aye," added Varuss, "He is no whelp to be killed with 
                      fancy spells. He will require all of us to kill him, if 
                      we can." 
                    <p> "And don't forget that Emp. Crush and his blasted lackeys 
                      are right there too. The castle guard isn't going to be 
                      easy to deal with either." Galleron reminded them. 
                    <p> "Well, we will have to take things slow and steady then. 
                      Keep together and lets get moving once we have healed and 
                      recharged." said Thurgrum. 
                    <p> The group proceeded to the fort the orcs called a castle 
                      with one minor resistance and killed the four guards at 
                      the drawbridge. Opening the door to the castle proper, they 
                      were met with a host of orcs. Some were the larger legionnaires 
                      that were supported by orcish oracles. There were many centurions 
                      leading the charge against the team of battle hardened adventurers 
                      and the paladins and warrior took up positions in the front 
                      of the clerics and mage to receive the rush with weapons 
                      drawn. As the battle raged before them, the clerics and 
                      mage opened up on the oracles and the legionnaires. The 
                      battle was fierce to say the least. Both sword and sorcery 
                      erupting from both sides but the teamwork of the six brave 
                      veterans carried the fight, until the Emissary came down 
                      the hall. Thurgrum thought to himself that this had to be 
                      the BIGGEST orc he had ever seen in his life. It was as 
                      big as an ogre and hit just as hard with its spear. 
                    <p> "Fall back to the moat! We will make our stand there!" 
                      screamed Thrugrum. 
                    <p> Varuss and Galleron did a fighting withdraw along with 
                      Thurgrum while the two clerics and mage quickly set up on 
                      the other side of the moat. Once the three stout dwarves 
                      had backed over the bridge, they stood their ground while 
                      again, the mystical energies of the two dwarven clerics 
                      and the high elven mage blasted into the massed orcs on 
                      the other side of the bridge. It proved a good tactic as 
                      the orcs could only get a few of their numbers to bear on 
                      the three mighty dwarven fighters. Dekker and Pedron used 
                      the last of their power to heal Thurgrum and closed to melee 
                      with the orcs, determined to fight to the last if need be. 
                      The battle was not looking good however as Survious also 
                      ran out of mana and had to close to melee also. Just as 
                      Thurgrum was going to call for a retreat to the entrance, 
                      a dwarven warrior leapt over the moat howling with rage. 
                      His twin axes cut a swathe of death and gore as he charged 
                      into the orc's midst, headed to the Emissary. The Emissary 
                      saw this new threat and closed to strike down this crazed 
                      dwarf before he could do more damage but, was instead himself 
                      cut down under a flurry of kicks and chops. Seeing their 
                      savior cut down in battle and surrounded by a horde of their 
                      own dead, the few remaining orcs fled back into the castle 
                      to get more troops. Torrak came running up to the group. 
                    <p> "Go now while you still can. I will hold the bridge as 
                      long as possible then fallback to the entrance. Hurry!" 
                    <p> "Aye and thank ye kin. I was beginning to get a bit worried." 
                      Thurgrum said as the group headed to the gates of Crushbone. 
                    <p> It took a day to recover from that battle outside the 
                      gate. The orcs sent several raids of centurions and pawns 
                      at the small group during the night but all were repulsed 
                      without much trouble. The dawn light was a welcome sight 
                      though, the dark clouds that gathered spoke of heavy rain. 
                      The spell of it was in the air as the troop once again entered 
                      the land of the Crushbone Clan. Almost immediately they 
                      were set upon by a group of centurions and slavers lead 
                      by the Taskmaster of Crushbone and the Royal Trainer. Both 
                      of these orcs were almost as big as the Emissary had been. 
                      The battle again raged for what seemed like hours though, 
                      in reality, it was but five minutes. Victorious, Thurgrum's 
                      band looted the bodies of the fallen orcs and headed to 
                      the slave pens and mine to free the slaves held captive 
                      there. They fought the centurions and a slaver that were 
                      left there along with a single legionnaire before freeing 
                      many of dwarven and elven slaves. Lightning flashed across 
                      the sky as the rain began to fall in sheets. The wind began 
                      to blow in gusts as the storm unleashed it fury. The troops 
                      escorted the slaves to the gate, gave them what spare armor 
                      and weapons they had along with some food summoned by the 
                      clerics. Thurgrum directed the leaders, a dwarven smith 
                      and elven priest to the wood elves city not far from there 
                      and made sure the group of ex-slaves got through the gateway 
                      safely. He truly wanted to guard them all the way to the 
                      city but knew that he and his group had a far more important 
                      task at hand. So, turning back into that accursed home of 
                      the orcs, he and his band again passed through the mine 
                      area and slave camp in order to approach the castle from 
                      the back side and hopefully undetected. As they moved into 
                      the quarry area, several centurions, a legionnaire and two 
                      slavers attacked them. They were quickly overcome but, the 
                      element of surprise was lost. They found a few more slaves, 
                      one of which was a gnome magician who still had a weak fire 
                      elementalkin as his pet. As they released him he gratefully 
                      thanked them and rushed to the gate and into the Greater 
                      Faydark. His pet however went bezerk and had to be killed. 
                      As the little gnome left the place of his imprisonment, 
                      he called out a final thank you to Thurgrum and said he 
                      would tell all in his home of the service to him. Thurgrum 
                      and the other smiled and shook their heads at his speed 
                      and took bets on how long it would take the orcs outside 
                      the gate to recapture the little man. All wished him the 
                      best of luck and prepared for the final assault on the castle 
                      proper. 
                    <p> The rain continued to fall but not as heavy and the wind 
                      had settled much when they crossed the bridge that lead 
                      into the castle. It was colder now noticeably and a small 
                      shiver ran down Dekker's spine. Whether of apprehension 
                      or chill he was not sure. The bodies of the orcs slain earlier 
                      were still strewn about like discarded dolls of a spoiled 
                      child. At the top of the stairs they came upon the throne 
                      room of the Crushbone Clan. 
                    <p> Immediately the two oracles, four LARGE legionnaires, 
                      two Emissaries, the Orcish Warlord and Lord Danish all set 
                      upon the little band. The group was awed by the size of 
                      the Warlord and the orcish lord who were easily equal to 
                      any ogre or troll they had ever faced. The ensuing battle 
                      saw spells erupting from both sides and the howls of rage 
                      and pain from both sides. The Warlord and Lord Danish parried 
                      many blows and struck with terrible force as did the legionnaire 
                      and Emissaries. To their credit, Thurgrum, Varuss and Gallerom 
                      stood tall and firm though taking horrendous damage. Dekker, 
                      Pedron and Survious concentrated on the oracles and fell 
                      the foul beasts within the first minutes of the battle, 
                      then closed on the rest. Survious brought forth a fire that 
                      enveloped all their enemies while the clerics called out 
                      words of pain that struck all enemies who could hear them. 
                      In the end, not a single member of the band was dead, though 
                      many were sorely hurt, while the entire throne room was 
                      now clear of any orc that breathed. Quickly looting the 
                      bodies of the fallen, the group found a corner in which 
                      to rest and prayed they were not discovered. 
                    <p> Brell smiled on them then for the sound of the thunder 
                      and rain outside covered their movements while the flashes 
                      of light hurt orcian eyes and thus made them more stationary 
                      then mobile. A few hours later, they once again climbed 
                      a flight of stairs to reach the object of their quest, Dvinn. 
                      Again, orcs rose to their challenge and charged forward. 
                      This time Emperor Crush, his Royal Guard and his Prophet 
                      charged down from his tower uttering curses upon the host 
                      of friends. Centurions and Legionnaires joined the mighty 
                      orcs in battle and it was only with the healing power of 
                      Brell's clerics that they were able to over come them. Thurgrum 
                      received a serious blow to the head and Survious was nearly 
                      killed with the Royal guard plunged his bronze spear into 
                      his back as he tried to get away from him. The wound was 
                      deep and horrible. As the group prepared to go back to their 
                      spot to rest again, they heard a soft chuckle from up in 
                      the corridor. 
                    <p> "My you people are a bother. Now look what you have gone 
                      and done. Here I am, given the job of telling these smelly 
                      things what we expect them to do in the coming war and you 
                      have to go and kill them so I have to start all over again. 
                      I tell you, your just impolite." smiled the dark elf ambassador. 
                    <p> "Ambassador DVinn!" Thurgrum hissed. "Don't worry about 
                      that. When we are done with you, your black heart will be 
                      in my hand." 
                    <p> "Oh I have heard that one before you bearded gnome." jeered 
                      Dvinn as he twirled an ornate dagger absentmindedly in his 
                      hands. "And I not only still breathe but those that said 
                      such a silly thing do not. Now, you and your pitiful group 
                      will join them in the eternal darkness that is death!" 
                    <p> Dvinn launched himself down the stairway and struck like 
                      a snake at the group. Driving the dagger deep into Thurgrum 
                      and Varuss before anyone could react then jumping back out 
                      of range of return strikes launched too late. Howling in 
                      pain, the two dwarves charged forward while Galleron engaged 
                      a legionnaire that had come into the castle from outside. 
                      Dekker, Pedron and Survious all unleashed their most powerful 
                      spells only to see they had little effect on the dark elf. 
                    <p> "You think your pitiful magics can hurt me?" laughed Dvinn. 
                      "Come and feel what true power is!" 
                    <p> Dvinn parried a blow by Thurgrum and another by Varuss 
                      then jumped over the two dwarves and plunged his dagger 
                      deep into Dekker's right arm and again into Pedron's left 
                      leg. Pain exploded in both the dwarves causing them to lose 
                      their concentration. Survious again blasted Dvinn with a 
                      firebolt but the dark elf dodged to one side letting the 
                      bolt slam into the wall behind him. Still laughing he stabbed 
                      the mage twice in the stomach and chest. Survious fell back, 
                      critically wounded. Only the healing power of Brell saved 
                      him from death. Galleron rushed up from the dead legionnaire 
                      and bashed Dvinn on the side of his face, drawing a stream 
                      of blood. 
                    <p> Dvinn screamed with rage and landed blow after blow upon 
                      the brave dwarven paladin, doing truly horrendous damage 
                      to him. Again, the healing power of Brell saved a life. 
                      Thurgrum and Varuss attacked Dvinn from the back but the 
                      armor he wore seems to be deflecting most of the blows. 
                    <p> "Out the window and to the bridge!" shouted Thrugrum over 
                      the den of battle. 
                    <p> Quickly, they all jumped out the closest window with Dvinn 
                      hot on their heels. The Ambassador ran down the stairs and 
                      out into the courtyard where the group had jumped. All of 
                      them had taken some damage from the fall out of the window 
                      but, it had also given them time to form a defense. Dvinn, 
                      enraged, charged into them and was met by a hail of mystical 
                      energy and plain old flesh and steel. In return he cut open 
                      Thurgrum and Galleron badly. Varuss, already wounded from 
                      the battle before fell unconscience under the blows of Dvinn's 
                      blade, as did Dekker. Thrugrum had never seen such a frail 
                      thing fight with so much deadly power. Dvinn didn't even 
                      seem to tire. Pedron got both Varuss and Dekker back up 
                      and they all headed to the gate, hoping to get away or at 
                      least find some help. Dvinn however had other ideas and 
                      saw his chance to kill one of his enemies easily. He fell 
                      upon Thurgrum like a wall of stones upon the lowly cricket 
                      and drove his dagger deep within his shoulderblade. Thurgrum 
                      bellowed with pain and the world reeled. His spun about 
                      unable to think clearly. Galleron and Pedron again closed 
                      with Dvinn while Varrus called upon the miracle of the Healing 
                      Touch to return himself to full life. Galleron was the next 
                      one to take hits from Dvinn but they seemed weaker, as if 
                      the Dark elf was tiring. As Varuss came forward to engage 
                      Dvinn, he fell back and used his gift on Thurgrum, thus 
                      restoring the near dead warrior to prime condition. This 
                      had been what he was waiting for. Thurgrum launched himself 
                      into battle and both Dekker and Survious had gotten enough 
                      mana back to send a spell against Dvinn. But, even with 
                      all this and Dvinn hurt and tiring, it wasn't enough and 
                      Thurgrum knew they were doomed to fail. He and the others 
                      lost all hope when a host of centurions and legionnaires 
                      came charging around the moat from the camp area near the 
                      mines. It was at that point, they heard a dwarven war cry 
                      and Smeg and his team of adventurers charged into the orcs 
                      before they could attack Thurgrum's band. On top of that, 
                      the little gnome had sent help in the form of a gnomish 
                      wizard name Aljanon S. Havoc who quickly let loose a firebolt, 
                      striking Dvinn and drawing his attention. Dvinn turned on 
                      the little gnome in fury and this was his final mistake 
                      for, with his back to the dwarves, he could not see to avoid 
                      the many swings of hammer and axe. Thurgrum got the honor 
                      of the killing blow and took the dagger from Dvinn's hand 
                      and cut out his black heart as proof of his death. Survious 
                      asked for the dagger as a keepsake and the group heartily 
                      agreed. Thurgrum turned back to Aljanon only to find a small 
                      pouch left on the ground where the gnome had been just a 
                      moment before. Inside he found a letter to the leaders of 
                      the Mithril Alliance thanking them for saving one of the 
                      Collective's council members and pledging their aid in the 
                      upcoming war of Ro. As Thurgrum took his broken and battered 
                      group out the gates of Crushbone, he looked back at the 
                      bodies strewn about and the total chaos and disarray that 
                      they had wrought this day and had to smile despite the pain. 
                      They had struck a blow for the Light this day that would 
                      never be forgotten. And he knew that on his Throne of Bone, 
                      in the Hall of Blood, Bloodwyrm would soon know of it too.

                  <div> Simeron looked out over the hills and mountains of his 
                    beloved Butcherblok Mountains and let the cool night wind 
                    wash over him like the mountain streams he played in as a 
                    lad. He hadn't made it back to the training as he told Farona 
                    he would and he still had an uneasy feeling inside. A restlessness 
                    that he could not explain nor understand. So, as he had always 
                    done in the past, he had come to the high mountains to clear 
                    his head away from the din of battle and the preparations 
                    for war. Up here, on a clear night, you could see countless 
                    stars above and the beauty of the mountains and hills below. 
                    You could see all that you were about to defend and possibly 
                    die to keep safe. It put things into a better light yet, allowed 
                    you to think clearly with your head as well as your heart. 
                    Thurgrum had been choosen as General of the Home Army for 
                    his slaying of the orcish leaders and Dvinn. As such, the 
                    dwarves, elves and gnomes that stayed behind to defend Faydwar 
                    from the Dark Elven invasion would be under his command. Simeron 
                    knew Thurgrum well and a stouter, better commander would be 
                    next to impossible to find anywhere. He was fully battle hardened, 
                    as was shown in Crushbone, and was as stout a fighter as the 
                    dwarven race had ever bred. His core group were also, with 
                    many clerics and warriors numbered among them. To add to this 
                    force, the Wood Elves had sent rangers, bards and druids while 
                    the High Elves sent master magic-users and paladins. Even 
                    the little gnomes sent "scouts" along with more magic-users. 
                    The Home Army was a rare time when the Kingdoms of Faydwer 
                    had united under one cause, their collective defense. He could 
                    only smile at the thought of that. All it took to bring the 
                    leaders together was the threat of being wiped out by an outside 
                    force. The Expeditionary Army of Light also boasted many powerful 
                    leaders. The Alliance leaders themselves had joined with the 
                    Blackwatch, Kal Tor, the Collective and the Knights of Faydwer 
                    to put together a fighting force to not only defend Freeport 
                    and the humans but to launch attacks into the evil races home 
                    territories. Almost every good race, from halflings to half-elves, 
                    was represented. While Rivervale had officially taken a neutral 
                    stance, as had Qeynos, the little furfoots and half elves 
                    still had many in attendance in the ranks. His own Warhammers 
                    were to be in the spearhead of the attack into Neriak once 
                    Freeport was safe. Yes, they had all come far in these last 
                    few months. He took a deep breath of the wind into his lungs, 
                    letting its power fill him and cleanse his spirit. Soon, many 
                    of his friends and those gathered in Kaladim would never breathe 
                    Norrath's air again. That fact alone saddened him but, seeing 
                    what they would save comforted him. At least they had something 
                    worth dying for. 
                    <p> Somewhere near the pass into Neriak, Bloodwyrm and his 
                      Skorchers sat camped, waiting on the Dark Elves to arrive. 
                      The first part of his plan would begin tonight with the 
                      infiltration of the Dark Elves through the Freeport defenses 
                      and out onto a waiting ship they had paid to carry the "cargo" 
                      of Dark Elves to Faydwer. Once there, the force would swim 
                      ashore, meet with the gnomish necromancer and proceed into 
                      the Butcherblok and the Faydarks killing and destroying 
                      all they could. Xiltara would be with them and once she 
                      saw the force launching its attack, she would gate to Northern 
                      Ro where the Skorchers, the Orcish Horde and the remaining 
                      dark elves would launch an attack against the western gates. 
                      Additionally, Bloodwyrm would have several ogres and trolls 
                      attack from the secret passage under Freeport along with 
                      his human agents. This would make a quick battle and easy 
                      victory even if the Mithril Alliance did even show up. As 
                      the army of black skinned elves came out of the pass, they 
                      were each told the details of the attack and Bloodwyrm confirmed 
                      all the battle plans. Then, in the dead of night, they slipped 
                      into the cavern system under Freeport and out onto the waiting 
                      ship. As Bloodwyrm watched the ship sail away into the night. 
                      He knew the time had come to station his troops in the caverns 
                      and take up their positions to the west of the city. Turning 
                      back into the caverns, he did not see the small halfling 
                      hidden in the shadows. Nor did he hear his soft footfalls 
                      as he slipped down a side corridor and to the Smugglers 
                      Coven he was a member of. 
                    <p> Onis Thistlefoot, or Yardstick as he was called due to 
                      him being three feet tall, reported what he had learned 
                      to his leader. The slightly aging but still strikingly beautiful 
                      human female took it all in and then told her dwarven bodyguard 
                      to contact the Alliance with the news of the ambush, reasoning 
                      that if the orges won, her own business would be ruined. 
                      While they would provide no troops for the battle, they 
                      would, for a small fee of several cases of dwarven ale, 
                      provide "guides and trackers" so that a force might be sent 
                      to stop the ambushers in the caverns. Within minutes, the 
                      dwarf had returned saying that a mage had been sent to the 
                      land of Faydwer. About an hour after, the mage returned 
                      saying that a meeting would be needed to confirm the tale 
                      and if proved true, payment of the dwarven ale would be 
                      made after the battle was won. 
                    <p> Simeron returned to his small home in Kaladim and gathered 
                      all of his things. Sighing heavily, he loaded his backpack, 
                      donned his armor and weapons and closed and locked the door 
                      for possibly the last time. It was a good little home though, 
                      sadly, never had been more then just his. As he turned to 
                      leave Kaladim to go to the docks and the awaiting fleet, 
                      he paused to watch the children at play. A thought struck 
                      him then that a war like this must not be forgotten ever. 
                      That someone should keep a unified force of all the good 
                      races of Norrath to stand in the breach should something 
                      like this ever happen again. This force, prepared and ready, 
                      could act quickly while other forces were mobilized. As 
                      he walked out of Kaladim and through the mountains he called 
                      home to the docks, he began forming an idea of how and when 
                      to do this but first, he reminded himself, was the matter 
                      of the attack on Freeport and Faydwer. When he boarded the 
                      ship, Durgan and the other leaders pulled him aside and 
                      ask that he and Dorgin take thier warbands on a special 
                      mission. One that would take them into the caverns below 
                      the city and possibly, out into the middle of a battle where 
                      they had enemies on every side. Both dwarves accepted the 
                      honor with pride and told their bands of the details. To 
                      a person, all members accepted the mission without a word. 
                      As the ships docked in Freeport, the troops filed off the 
                      boats and into the city proper. The militia was very cold 
                      to them but the Truthseekers welcomed them with open arms. 
                      As promised, Onis was there with some "guides" and called 
                      for those assigned to the caverns to come. While the others 
                      were saying thier good byes, Simeron would have no part 
                      of it. 
                    <p> "I don't believe in good-byes." he told his friends, "Just 
                      till we meet agains. And as Brell is my witness, we shall 
                      meet again. Be it in this world or the next." 
                    <p> With that, the Rik Drungi of the Mithril Warhammers, his 
                      warband, Dorgin, Rik Drungi of the Crimson Foe Hammer and 
                      his warband waved and went in search of their enemies in 
                      the caverns under Freeport. Durgan, Thergrim, Grimme, Palantir, 
                      and Celestak gathered the remaining forces and headed west 
                      out of the city to meet Bloodwyrm's forces in the desert 
                      of Ro. The coming battle promised to be of epic porportions 
                      and would decide the course of Norrath for some time to 
                      come. Indeed truely, many things would change soon. Many 
                      things indeed.

                  <div> Thurgrum was impressed with forces laid out before him. 
                    Gnome and Halfling, High Elf and Wood Elf, Dwarf and Human 
                    all were banding together to meet the Dark Elves and their 
                    allies. The forces were in three main groups. The first was 
                    charged with defending the home of the High Elves and held 
                    many a mage and holy knight. The second stood between Crushbone 
                    and the tree city of the Wood Elves, manned by Rangers, Bards 
                    and Druids. The last, and largest, were the Gnomes, Dwarves 
                    and Humans in the Butcherblok mountains. The port had been 
                    posted with a triple guard and the other areas where the attack 
                    might have been launched were posted with lookouts. So, he 
                    was quite sure that regardless of what happened, the land 
                    of Faydwer would be safe. 
                    <p> As the sun sank into the sea and the blue sky turned an 
                      ominous shade of red, the first ships were sighted on the 
                      horizon. Their black sails filled with magical winds to 
                      speed their mission. Xiltara, a group of the Skorchers and 
                      several dozen gnome necromancers watched the approaching 
                      ships with dark glee. The forces of Faydwer had strengthened 
                      their port defenses but had only succeeded in weakening 
                      themselves, as they would soon learn. Cloaked with invisibility, 
                      they had come over a few at a time before the main attack 
                      fleet and now, joined with the gnomes that were already 
                      here, were in the exact place at the correct time. She signaled 
                      the attack to begin by summoning a greater skeleton and 
                      sending it against a hapless dwarf who was stunned to see 
                      this thing appear before her out of thin air. As the warning 
                      calls went out, magic erupted from all around the port area 
                      as the cries of battle mixed with those of the dying. Many 
                      of the defenders were killed in seconds as the forces of 
                      Darkness cast off their invisibility and attacked from within 
                      the port itself. The tactic worked well, for in a pitched 
                      battle, the port was taken by nightfall. The ships unloaded 
                      their "cargo" of Dark Elves, Ogres and Trolls without much 
                      resistance. Xiltara gave her last orders and returned to 
                      Bloodwyrm to report the attack had begun and tell of the 
                      great victory they had won. Quickly, the troops sacked and 
                      razed the port then headed toward Greater Faydark to join 
                      with the Crushbone Orcs to do the same to the Elven cities. 
                      They traveled through the mountains past the ruins of a 
                      dwarven outpost and a tower the gnome necromancers had built 
                      long ago. Many dwarven skeletons stood silent vigil for 
                      their masters and they felt that soon, many elven ones would 
                      be added to them.

                    <p> The stunned defenders quickly rallied to the threat and 
                      rushed to retake the port. Thurgrum, Varuss, Galeron, Farona, 
                      and Tuebits were with the first group that arrived. Seeing 
                      the carnage within the port, buildings and docks aflame, 
                      dismembered bodies of their friends and comrades strewn 
                      about, all there equipment gone, the leaders gave orders 
                      to hunt down and kill every last invader with no mercy or 
                      remorse. They followed the path of destruction left in the 
                      wake of the Dark Army and caught up with them near the pass 
                      into Greater Faydark. A great yell erupted from the forces 
                      of Light as they set upon the army of Darkness. The gnomes, 
                      dark elves, trolls and ogres turned and faced them with 
                      the same fervor. The battle was horrible, with bodies of 
                      the fallen literally piling up around the plains like cordwood. 
                      Thurgrum and the other leaders formed the spearhead of the 
                      attack and hit the middle of the dark forces lines. They 
                      were quickly engulfed in the dark tide and were hard pressed 
                      to survive. Farona, Tuebits, Varuss, Galeron, and Dregan 
                      formed a group about the leader while Dekker and others 
                      kept the escape route open for them. The battle raged in 
                      the plains until the morning sun again turned the black 
                      sky to purple, then red. As the sun rose high over the mountains, 
                      the green grass of the plain had turned to a sickly dark 
                      red/green as the blood of the fallen mixed together. Thurgrum 
                      and his core group still stood, albeit battered and bloodied. 
                      Around them lay the bodies of enemies and friends alike, 
                      melded into a single form. As the last of the dark army 
                      fled into the hills or into the Faydark, Thurgrum collapsed 
                      to the ground. Truly, this had been a horrendous battle 
                      that the forces of Light had won but, at a terrible price.

                    <p> Jadow stood with Celestak at the Crushbone gate. They 
                      both knew that the remaining Crushbone Orcs would be launching 
                      an attack soon on their home in the trees. The attack when 
                      it came would not be too difficult they assumed as the best 
                      and most powerful orcs had been killed earlier in a raid 
                      by Thurgrum. When the attack came however, it was more then 
                      they could ever have been prepared for. 
                    <p> Inside Crushbone, the orc oracles and warriors called 
                      to their gods for help in crushing the elves of the Faydark. 
                      They sacrificed slaves and other orcs in an attempt to call 
                      upon them to give them strength enough to win the battle 
                      dispite the weakening blow that had befell them. From deep 
                      within their caverns, Slashh, Urkk and Ville heard their 
                      minions cry. The Demi-gods looked down upon the forces of 
                      Good arrayed against their followers and decided to intervene. 
                      Appearing before the horde of orcs, they took charge and 
                      called for the strongest and most powerful orc left to come 
                      forward. In him they infused the spirit of power. He grew 
                      in size and strength until he towered over even the demi-gods 
                      themselves. With this new leader before them, followed by 
                      their three demi-gods, the orcs let out a cheer and charged 
                      out of the gate and into Greater Faydark and the army of 
                      Light. 
                    <p> At first, Jadow and Celestak were as stunned as the rest 
                      of the army of light. Its not everyday you see an orc the 
                      size of a tree that has seen 100 winters but, here before 
                      them was just that. Behind him stood three more orcs of 
                      huge size. They led a charge into the army before the gates 
                      of Crushbone with bloodthirsty zeal. Many of those near 
                      the gate were cut down in a single swing of the monstrous 
                      twin bladed axe wielded by the giant. If not for the quick 
                      thinking of the two wood elf leaders, the battle would have 
                      been lost right then. Both Celestak and Jadow called for 
                      the army to fall back from the entrance and regroup near 
                      the camps outside of Crushbone. The orcs, seeing the army 
                      in turn and run into the camps, surged forward, thinking 
                      they had routed them. The demi-gods knew better but before 
                      they could stop them, the mass of their army had charged 
                      into the camps. It was then that Jadow and Celestak played 
                      their trump card. High overhead in the trees were scores 
                      upon scores of elven archers. As the army retreated beyond 
                      the camp, hundreds of long bows twanged swift death as a 
                      hail of arrows blanketed the mists of the Faydark. Orcs 
                      were wounded and killed everywhere among the tents as the 
                      sheet of arrows fell upon them. At the second volley, the 
                      remaining ones figured out the trap and fled back to their 
                      gods. Seeing this, Jadow and Celestak again shouted commands 
                      and the army of Good once again charged into battle against 
                      the remaining orcs, the demi-gods and the huge avatar. The 
                      battle lasted well into the darkness of the night that is 
                      the Faydark. The avatar again cut down many members of the 
                      army in but a single swing but, he was rocked by the nature 
                      magic of the druids and the very earth rose up against him 
                      while lightning rained death down upon him. Tendrils and 
                      roots broke through the stone and entwined his feet and 
                      legs. Bursts of flame charred his body while ice slammed 
                      his form. Unable to take such a pounding, the giant orc 
                      weakened then fell. As his last breathe left his body, he 
                      thrust it across the entrance of Crushbone, crushing both 
                      orc and elf alike. The three demi-gods, seeing their avatar 
                      overcome, tried to rally the last of the orcs but after 
                      seeing their champion fall, they retreated back into Crushbone 
                      itself. The forces of good spilled over the dead body of 
                      the avatar like water over a damn and the demi-gods made 
                      their last stand near the castle where once Emperor Crush 
                      stood with Ambassador Dvinn making grand plans for the conquest 
                      of Greater Faydark. As the last of them fell, Celestak turned 
                      to Jadow and smiled. 
                    <p> "I think we may have a story to tell Simeron when he gets 
                      back my friend." 
                    <p> "Aye," puffed Jadow "That is IF he makes it back. I only 
                      hope more of the dark gods of evil don't come up from the 
                      bowels of the earth against them."

                    <p> At the gates of the High Elf city stood Aljanon with Palantir, 
                      Qinamil and Elindil. Word had just come of a force of undead 
                      and dark elves headed from Castle Mistmoore through Lesser 
                      Faydark. This could only mean that Manor Manyong had decided 
                      to join with the Skorchers and attack them. They had a small 
                      but powerful force of magic users and paladins of both the 
                      high elves and gnomes. As the first zombies and skeletons 
                      entered Greater Faydark, Palantir called for the paladins 
                      to join on him and together they charged into the undead 
                      army. Werewolves and dark elven guards were next through 
                      and were met by elementalkins and magic. Again the battle 
                      raged in the pass with neither side gaining a clear advantage. 
                      Great stone gargoyles descended into the fray and gnome 
                      necromancers sent their undead pets into the weakening paladin 
                      corp while unleashing life draining spells. A group of Minotaurs 
                      charged from the center of the line and broke through into 
                      the magic users. With their lines broken, the valiant defenders 
                      were in dire trouble when out of the gates charged the clerics 
                      of the temple. Screaming cries of hatred for the walking 
                      dead, they summoned their powers and both healed their fellows 
                      and brought holy damnation upon the minions of the undead. 
                      Even with the renewed strength, it was hours before the 
                      breach was closed and the remaining forces of Castle Mistmoore 
                      returned home. Sadly, brave little Aljanon did not survive 
                      the battle. He and his pet had stood his ground when the 
                      lines broke, taking a werewolf and two skeletons out of 
                      action before a stone gargoyle landed before him, killed 
                      his pet and ripped its claws across his chest, killing him. 
                      He was not the only one lost that night and as the forces 
                      of Castle Mistmoore fled back into the mists of the Lesser 
                      Faydark, all the survivors could do was watch them go. Too 
                      weakened to give pursuit.

                  <div> The army of Light moved through Freeport with little fanfare. 
                    Palantir has returned to Faydwer to help defend the High Elf 
                    city from an attack by the forces of Castle Mistmoore and 
                    news that all of Faydwer was in conflict had come to them. 
                    Reports were the port was lost with many dead and the home 
                    army was in pursuit of the force of dark elves that invaded 
                    their homeland. The weight of the matter before them had begun 
                    to be felt and even the normal indifferent citizenry of the 
                    human town gave encouragement to them for they knew, as this 
                    army went, so went their town. Outside, the leaders broke 
                    the army into groups. A reserve force would stay within Freeport 
                    while the main body of the army marched into the northern 
                    desert of Ro. Soon after they entered the desert proper came 
                    the first attack. Skeletal pets charged into the lead group 
                    while life-draining magics slammed into them. A small group 
                    of dark elven necromancers had sprung their ambush on them. 
                    Unfortunately for them, the entire army quickly engulfed them, 
                    destroying both their pets and themselves in a matter of minutes. 
                    None of the army had fallen and the leaders considered this 
                    an omen that the coming battle would be won by them most assuredly. 
                    As they approached a totem erected by some long forgotten 
                    peoples of the desert. They saw Bloodwyrm and his forces on 
                    the opposing hills moving into a position to attack. The two 
                    colossal armies spread out over the two hills and began preparing 
                    for the coming battle. Shamans and clerics used their magic 
                    to fortify their warriors, pets were summoned and weapons 
                    drawn and ready. At the leaders of both sides looked upon 
                    the host here, they knew one thing was certain, many that 
                    lived now would soon be dead and that while this battle would 
                    decide the war, it would be a long and painful end.

                    <p> Silently the little halfling lead the two warbands through 
                      the twists and turns of the caverns beneath Freeport. No 
                      torches burned, nor light globes shine. Even the magic weapons 
                      and shields were covered to block their light. But, the 
                      dwarves and halflings needed no light to see in them. Both 
                      races possessed great night vision. The little "guides" 
                      showed the group of dwarven warriors where the Skorcher 
                      patrols lurked within the cavern complex. Then, the lead 
                      the dwarves up some stairs to the exit. Now, dwarves were 
                      used to being underground but, the halflings were more then 
                      a little glad when they showed their charges the exit outside, 
                      for that meant their job was done. Onis Thistlefoot turned 
                      to Simeron and Dorgin. 
                    <p> "This is as far as we go as per our deal. Though I will

                      Were it not for the orders of my guildmistress, I would 
                      stand with you against the coming tide of evil. If you manage 
                      to slay the fiends quickly, you can exit here and get to 
                      northern Ro within a few hours. Again, I wish you good luck." 
                    <p> "You have honored your bargain good halfling." said Dorgin. 
                      "I hope that your mistress will reconsider should the militia 
                      turn on Freeport herself." 
                    <p> "Enjoy the ale my friend. It was a small price to pay 
                      for the information you brought to us. Without it, many 
                      of your cities citizens would be dead and possibly Freeport 
                      itself would fall into enemy hands. While we cannot know 
                      if we can prevent this, know that if it comes to pass, we 
                      will not know it for we will be dead." Simeron said. 
                    <p> With that, the "guides" disappeared down a side corridor 
                      and through what must have been a secret wall. Dorgin and 
                      Simeron gathered their members and moved quietly back to 
                      where the Skorchers had decided to launch their attacks 
                      from. The two dwarven leaders decided to attack the ogres 
                      and trolls from two sides. The two warbands moved into position. 
                      The Skorchers were looking out the hole they had torn in 
                      the brick wall, waiting for the sun to set. With a mighty 
                      roar to Brell, the clerics called down holy might as the 
                      warriors, paladins and rouges moved to attack. Caught unaware, 
                      the Skorchers reeled under the onslaught. Dwarves cut down 
                      ogres and trolls like a scythe gleaning grain from the field. 
                      Clerics healed, bashed and smited them with holy words of 
                      pain and power. But, the Skorchers had been well trained 
                      and despite the terrible damage the initial charge had done, 
                      stood their ground and regrouped. The battle in the halls 
                      was one sided though, the hallways were cramped for the 
                      larger ogres and trolls and they could not maneuver well 
                      in them. The initial charge had weakened them badly and 
                      despite their greater strength, the dwarves were able to 
                      dodge out of the way. Shamans healed their warriors and 
                      the few shadowknights in the group as best they could. In 
                      the end, all the Skorchers lay dead on the ground. Simeron 
                      and Dorgin took stock of their warbands. Dorgin had lost 
                      no one. But sadly, Castro, Zikar and Aragon had all been 
                      slain in the battle. Simeron stood looking at the bodies 
                      of his friends for a minute, gave a sigh and closed their 
                      eyes. He turned and called for a moment of silence for the 
                      fallen comrades then, with a grim face, gave the order to 
                      march to the desert to join the forces there.

                      </center>
                    <p> Bloodwyrm saw the army of the Light across from his own 
                      army of Darkness and realized that this battle would be 
                      far from easy. He did not think that this many soldiers 
                      would leave Faydwer with it coming under attack. Fortunately, 
                      he had strike teams within Freeport itself that would cause 
                      panic within the city and force them to send troops back 
                      to the city to defend it. Also, the Orcish Horde and many 
                      necromancers, both gnome and dark elf, had come to stand 
                      with them. As the sun began to sink to the horizon, Xiltara 
                      appeared and told him of the great victory they had won 
                      in the port of Kaladim. This is what Bloodwyrm had waited 
                      for. 
                    <p> "Our forces in Faydwer have began their conquest. We have 
                      taken the port of Kaladim with few casualties while striking 
                      a blow to our enemies. Now is the time to extinguish the 
                      Light once and for all!" 
                    <p> Grimme and the other leaders saw the army of Darkness 
                      prepare for the charge and rallied their forces. Both sides 
                      gave a shout. Even though the sky was clear, the charging 
                      armies made the dunes echo with the rolling sounds of thunder. 
                      Like the unstoppable force the Dark tide rolled down the 
                      dune to the totem to meet the immovable object, the army 
                      of Light. The crash of metal, wood, bone and magic all erupted 
                      when the two sides met at the totem. The leaders tried to 
                      maintain their lines, to keep some kind of order in this 
                      uncontrolled chaos but it simply couldn't be done. The din 
                      of battle, the screams of hatred and those of the dying 
                      drown out any and all hope for command. Lines blurred then 
                      disappeared as the battle raged on. For several hours, members 
                      of both sides sought out one of the other and locked in 
                      the dance of death that is battle. Ogre against Dwarf, Troll 
                      vs. Wood Elf, Dark Elf necromancy vs. High Elf wizardry. 
                      The afternoon turned to evening and evening to night and 
                      still the battle raged. Reinforcements came to both sides 
                      during the night and by dawn, both sides were exhausted. 
                      The living pulled back to their respective sides and healed 
                      the wounded. Bodies lie strewn about the desert like a child's 
                      dolls when they are done playing with them. Hundreds if 
                      not thousands of them, both good and evil, blanketed the 
                      desert sands now stained green and red with the blood of 
                      the fallen. The army of Light had carried the battle and 
                      now outnumbered the army of Darkness greatly. Simeron, Dorgin 
                      and their warbands had joined in the fighting sometime in 
                      the night and the two leaders had joined Durgan, Thergrim, 
                      Grimme and several other leader to draw up the final battle 
                      plans to wipe out the last of their foes. The battle had 
                      been costly, with about a fifth of their army now lying 
                      dead on the sands but, they had killed close to three fifths 
                      of the enemy army. As war goes, the battle of Ro was a resounding 
                      success for the Light. Dorgin was commenting on just that 
                      fact when a loud voice boomed across the desert. 
                    <p> "MY CHILDREN COME TO ME! I HAVE HEARD YOUR CALLS AND WILL 
                      VANQUISH THE SERVANTS OF THE LIGHT! COME TO RALLOS ZEK!!!" 
                    <p> Simeron turned with great concern to look out over the 
                      battle field as did all of the army. There, on the far hill 
                      stood the biggest ogre any had ever seen. Standing as big 
                      as the statue above the Kaladim gate, clad in plate-mail 
                      and wielding a twin bladed axe stood the God of War, Rallos 
                      Zek. Before him he had powerful minions and the forces of 
                      darkness swarmed about him. Some of the army of Light turned 
                      and ran right there. Other prayed to their own gods for 
                      salvation. All Simeron could see was a false god some of 
                      his kin had foolishly followed and the faces of Castro, 
                      Zikar and Aragon. With a bellow of rage, he charged down 
                      the dune and straight toward the war god. Others followed 
                      his lead and soon, another even fiercer battle raged. Rallos 
                      cut down warriors in single blows, kicked clerics across 
                      the dunes and raged among the army of the Light. His minions 
                      were as deadly as the god himself but, the forces of light 
                      would not surrender. At first, the main deaths were those 
                      of his followers, then slowly, one by one, his minions were 
                      vanquished. At the last the war god stood alone, towering 
                      over the remaining forces of light. They could see him weakening, 
                      his axe fell slower and less often, he staggered under the 
                      weight of it and the hammer blows of the warriors of Light. 
                      Finally, with a great bellow, the mighty war god fell to 
                      the ground, dead. A triumphant shout arose from the forces 
                      of the Light. They had overcome an evil god! Simeron kneeled 
                      on one knee next to Cragghorst and Dorgin. All three dwarves 
                      were covered in sand mixed with blood and sweat. A green 
                      armored female ogre and a swirling mass of blades were at 
                      the totem killing more of their comrades and Cragghorst 
                      called out to those around them to close on these new foes. 
                      Again the army of light stood against the evil god's avatars. 
                      Again they won the battle, losing more and more of their 
                      forces. As the sun set on that second day, the forces of 
                      evil were all but gone and the army of Light was devastated. 
                      The leaders figured they had maybe two fifths of the army 
                      left alive but, all of the opposing army was destroyed. 
                      Only a handful of dark elves and a few Skorchers were left 
                      to kill. Across the plain, the bodies were so thick that 
                      one could not step upon sand unless through blood or by 
                      moving a body. Simeron sat, covered in sweat, sand and blood, 
                      dejected. How high had the price of victory come. 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm was in pain and filled with rage. For all of 
                      his planning, all their preparations had come to naught. 
                      The biggest blow came with the defeat of their god's avatars. 
                      Many of his army simply turned and fled when Rallos Zek 
                      and the others fell. But, his Skorchers remained and a few 
                      Dark Elves. They were not done just yet and were calling 
                      upon the Faceless one himself to come claim victory as his 
                      own. Cazic-Thule heard their calls but was unconcerned. 
                      He had see what had happened to the other evil gods that 
                      descended onto the soil of Norrath and did not wish this 
                      end to befall him. But, as his servants continued to call, 
                      sacrificing some of their own members to gain his favor, 
                      he called his most powerful minions to him from the corners 
                      of Norrath and decided to make such a grand entrance that 
                      the tattered remnants of the good army would simply retreat 
                      to the city of Freeport where he could then wipe them all 
                      out at once. 
                    <p> A cry of alarm rose up among the troops near the shore. 
                      From out of the sea came the monstrous form of a troll as 
                      big as Rallos Zek had been. About him stood four ghouls 
                      armed with Dark Reapers. A shout of joy came from the enemy 
                      camp as Cazic-Thule manifested himself upon the face of 
                      Norrath. With this new threat, Simeron felt the battle was 
                      over. How could they fight yet another evil god? Brell and 
                      the other good gods had never appeared despite the prayers 
                      of their faithful. He could only think that they were needed 
                      elsewhere. The reserves had long since been used and all 
                      they had left was right here. As the huge troll waded ashore, 
                      then turned and began moving toward them. The last of the 
                      army of Light stood firm, to a person. Determine to fight 
                      to the bitter end before departing to their gods to ask 
                      why they were sacrificed by them, why they had allowed evil 
                      to win. Just as Cazic's evil laughter rolled across the 
                      dunes, they charged into their last battle. 
                    <p> Bloodwyrm stood back and watched with evil glee. His army 
                      was gone true but with Cazic here, they could still take 
                      Freeport and with it, eventually all of Antonica. Watching 
                      this troll god destroy all in his path would be the best 
                      part of the battle and he and the few members of the once 
                      great army of darkness found spots to sit and watch the 
                      destruction they have wrought. Their glee was bolstered 
                      even more when no good god showed up and the defenders stood 
                      their ground rather then fleeing to Freeport. 
                    <p> Cazic and his minions were even harder then Rallos and 
                      his had been and it was clear to all concerned that this 
                      time, they would not win. Simeron's heart was heavy seeing 
                      such proud, brave people die in a lost cause but he knew 
                      why they did it. He thought of his Butcherblok mountains, 
                      his friends now dead and those that soon would be. He remembered 
                      his little house and children at play. If he was to die 
                      here, forsaken by the good gods, then at least he would 
                      die honorably and with those worthy enough to die with. 
                      As he bashed one of the ghouls with Dwar-Glum, he resolved 
                      himself and his warband to their fate. It was then he heard 
                      it. Just as the sun broke the horizon, a rumbling came over 
                      the dunes. Bloodwyrm and his forces heard it too, as did 
                      Cazic and his minions. At first, it was a low, dull sound 
                      but soon, is became a deafening roar. Over the dune came 
                      the home army of Faydwer like a tide of goodness and down 
                      upon the evil troll god the wave crashed. Taken unprepared, 
                      the minions of the troll god faltered and fell almost immediately. 
                      Cazic lashed out and slaughtered many of the army but could 
                      not hold nor stand against the enraged forces of Light. 
                      His yell of outrage rocked the heavens themselves as his 
                      form crashed down into the sea. Bloodwyrm and the last of 
                      his forces disappeared back into Oggok and Grobb. Xiltara 
                      and the dark elves fled through the desert and into Neriak. 
                      Simeron stumbled back to where Dorgin and the other lay 
                      on the sand. 
                    <p> "If another evil god shows up, I will REALLY get ticked." 
                      he said to Cragghorst. 
                    <p> "If another one shows up I will personally question Brell 
                      myself why he let us die." replied the cleric. 
                    <p> "This was indeed a terrible war. One that will live on 
                      in memory for a long time to come. Where the very gods came 
                      down from the heavens." Dorgin said while looking over the 
                      shattered landscape. 
                    <p> "This must not happen again." stated Simeron. "We cannot 
                      allow something like this to ever happen again. Our children 
                      must know of this horror and avoid such a thing. How we 
                      can do this I don't know and as Brell is my guide, I only 
                      know it must be done." 
                    <p> With that, each of them found spot on the sand, cleared 
                      away the blood and bodies and lay down for a much needed 
                      sleep.

                  <div> Simeron left the boat and once again entered his beloved 
                    Butcherblok Mountians. It had taken weeks to get back here 
                    as the port was destroyed and many things had to be dealt 
                    with in Freeport. The forces of darkness had attacked all 
                    over Norrath and called down many of their evil gods. The 
                    only good god to appear was Mithaniel Marr. He had lead a 
                    force of Light into Neriak where Innoruuk appeared and met 
                    them along with the dark elven forces at the first bridge 
                    into the land of the dark elves. As the battle had been joined, 
                    it appeared that the forces of Light would have yet another 
                    victory. When Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, the halfling god appeared, 
                    the army of the Light cheered. That is until he turned on 
                    them and began to kill them by the droves. Mithaniel was the 
                    first to fall and Fizzlethorpe changed sides but was too weak 
                    to swing the balance back. Innoruuk fell but so did the halfling 
                    god. The remaining forces of the light were overwhelmed and 
                    the few surviving members of the army fled back through the 
                    pass into the commonlands, not stopping until they reached 
                    the safety of Freeport. In Halas, the barbarians had fought 
                    and killed the Gnoll god in a battle that left many dead. 
                    On Odus, the Erudinites had fought another bloody civil war 
                    between the necromancers and the goodly spell weavers, leaving 
                    that city and island in utter chaos. It seemed that all over 
                    the world the gods had come down to be among mortals. Yet, 
                    somehow he knew that the lack of good gods was in fact, a 
                    test of their creations. As he stopped in at Trumpy Irontoe's 
                    bar to get a couple of Trumpy's Tonics, he looked at how little 
                    things had changed in Kaladim. Unlocking the door to his house 
                    and putting things away kept him from deep thought but, as 
                    the fires burned low and the day came to an end, he again 
                    found himself headed to the mountain peaks to think about 
                    what needed to be done and what had transpired these last 
                    few weeks. He had faced the gods of his enemies and seen them 
                    slain. He had lost many a dear friend but had preserved the 
                    way of life he and his fellows believed to be right. The price 
                    had been terribly high and for all the deaths on both sides, 
                    nothing had really changed save more people were dead now. 
                    The Dark Elves had held Neriak, they had kept Freeport safe 
                    and the lands of Faydwer were still the same as before the 
                    war. All the resources lost, all the lives sacrificed in the 
                    pursuit of this war simply came to no gain at all. No, nothing 
                    had changed. Yet, he knew that in order to avoid this happening 
                    again. A group must be formed to stand in the breach should 
                    evil once again raise its head and the specter of war loom 
                    over any of the good people of Norrath. This group would need 
                    to be both powerful, highly skilled, steadfast, honorable 
                    and just. They should embrace all good races and classes of 
                    citizens of Norrath, not just a single one. As he thought 
                    about it, a feeling indescribable welled up within him. He 
                    knew now why Brell did not come, why so many had to die in 
                    this horrible war. It had been a test. Brell must have talked 
                    to the other gods and decided to place their creations in 
                    the forge of battle to temper them and make them stronger. 
                    He knew that the true story of this world wide struggle must 
                    never be forgotten nor repeated. And he new that most Norrathians 
                    would indeed forget and thus, repeat the same mistake over 
                    and over again. He could not allow this to happen. Climbing 
                    down from his mountain top, he quickly ran to Kaladim and 
                    spoke with Dorgin, Cragghorst and many others of the clan. 
                    He found his elven friends and told of his ideas to them as 
                    well as many others. Finally, he came to Durgan and the leaders 
                    of the Mithril Alliance and told them that he must take his 
                    Warhammers on a holy quest that would force them to leave 
                    their clan of Odin's Hammer and the Mithril Alliance as a 
                    whole. Some thought him crazy, other just plain stupid. But 
                    Simeron knew that what he felt came from Brell and the good 
                    gods. Over the next few weeks, he, Cragghorst, Dorgin and 
                    the others set about to form a group dedicated to the Light 
                    and all it protects. Naming the new order after his beloved 
                    Warhammers, Simeron drew up a charter for all to see. 
                    <p> It is this group, the Order of the Mithril Warhammers, 
                      that have taken it upon themselves to be the guardians of 
                      those that are under the protection of the Light. To defend 
                      those that can not defend themselves against the darkness 
                      that still dwells in this world. To carry the tale of the 
                      War of the Gods that was the last age. The descending of 
                      the gods marked the end of one era and the beginning of 
                      another. So, things had changed after all. They had been 
                      tested and found strong. Both sides had proven they could 
                      resist the other and that in the eternal war of the gods, 
                      mortals could tip the scales. But, the lessons learn would 
                      be told to the following generations and kept safe my the 
                      Warhammers for all future generations. Thus, at the dawning 
                      of this new era of Norrath, it is only fitting that the 
                      old pass away and from it come the rebirth of the new. 
                    <p> I have penned this tale of the War of Ro for all future 
                      generations of Norrath to read and know what happened in 
                      those days when the gods tread upon our soil. When honor 
                      and bravery stood against vile treachery and betrayal. When 
                      good people laid down their lives so that you may breath 
                      free air and have a safe home. Know that since those days, 
                      my Mithril Warhammers have remained faithful and true to 
                      our cause and will never stop until all that is evil has 
                      been purged from our world. So rest well good people of 
                      Norrath where ever you are and know that the first line 
                      of defense is manned by my friends and comrades. May your 
                      gods bless you with your hearts desires enough to make you 
                      happy and may your life be as full as mine own.
