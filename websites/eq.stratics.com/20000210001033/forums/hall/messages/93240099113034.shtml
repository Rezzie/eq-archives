Where did you hear that warriors are sopposed to be one of the best solo classes? Whoever told you this or wherever you read this was completely wrong. Druids, Troll SK, and Shamans are considered the best. (Shaman is up in the air until the verdict on the DoT nerf is in.)<p>You have to realize, that since you aren't posting from a rational position, you are not likely to get very positive reactions.<p>Plain and simple, if you wanted to be able to heal, you should have chose a paladin or something different. Warriors will never be able to heal. It's not warrior like. (Why would you think it is???) Keep in mind that the warrior. The only thing I am seeing being thrown your way is more warrior like abilities, you shouldn't expect anything that is not of the traditional genre of the class. (Could you see Conan casting heals on himself. I didn't think so.) <p>The warrior is a group class. NOT a solo class as you have found. Healers are you best friends as you are a Nukers best friend. Like it or not (and as many of us have found) this game has been tuned for groups. If it were tuned for solo play, groups would clean house...in effect ruining the balance.<p>You seem to have a pretty big problem with shamans. Let me put it this way. People that play shamans are attracted to the class because it is easy to find their role in the game. They can easily use the abilities to their strengths. Something havent figured out for your class appearantly. <p>As for bind wound...would you rather it not be in the game? Warriors are not healers. Plain and simple. <p>Taunt...Its hard to taunt a monster off a mage when a mage has been hitting it for 300 hp a nuke. Your taunts are accumulative, but if the mage is doing more damage, you won't be able to pull him off. (That's when an intelligent mage stops attacking till you draw him away.)<p>If you want regeneration, that's what a troll was for. Why would a warrior heal at an increased rate? There is no logical, historical, or fantastic reasoning other than selfish needs. Critical hit is great!! It still needs some fine tuning, but it is a step in the right direction for warriors. There are tons of warrior only items out there and when you finally get to the high 20's mid 30's you can hunt Cazic and get the Rubicite breastplate. Can you say regeneration? (Not to mention a modest STR bonus.)<p>I have partied with many groups. Tanks were beloved in every single one of them. Why? because casters need someone to keep the monsters attention while they get their spells off. You know what? Mana does not last forever...too many time I hear "OOM!!" and have to finish the monster off. Warriors can do this better than anyone. Your AC and damage is far better than any other class in this position. Dual strike with a Zwei? Throw in a kick every now and then. Oh yeah, that is some damage. You need to stick with groups and avoid solo fighting. Soloing will only get you kill at higher levels.<p>Well, I agree with you the warrior still needs some improvement as a class, realize that everything you want about the warrior is available at higher levels (Or lower levels if you choose a different race.) You will never see warriors with increased healing (That would give trolls a greater advantage) What you should do is present some solutions that are within the warrior genre. It's not easy thinking something like that up, is it? That's where Verant is having problems.<p>BTW- I have played Warrior, Paladin (2nd rate warrior with less maintenance), Monk, and Shaman. So far shaman has been my favorite, but I prefer to stand in the front line with a great sword in my hands. The Warrior has a specific role in this game...like it or not. It isn't going to change. I realized that a long time ago and felt it was time to move on.<p>If you choose to stay on the path of the warrior, do not complain about how rocky the path is, for the path will never change. (i.e. Verant made the warrior like it is for a reason ortherwise they would have made changed during the betas)<p>Good Luck
