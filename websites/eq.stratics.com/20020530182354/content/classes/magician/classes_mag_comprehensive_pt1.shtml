                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    magician is a versatile class. He or she are at home in a 
                    group at all levels or soloing up into the higher levels. 
                    The class, however, really shines for soloing in the mid levels 
                    from eight to the high twenties. The class can be successfully 
                    soloed beyond the twenties, but the game is designed to move 
                    you into dungeons once you get into the thirties. Dungeons, 
                    by their nature, are best approached in groups to reduce the 
                    risk to the player. So up through the twenties you can still 
                    find great hunting grounds outside where the magician&#146;s 
                    solo skills are some of the best in the game.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    In soloing these mid levels, however, there is a wide range 
                    of opinions on how to properly approach engaging mobs*. Each 
                    person has their system and vehemently defends it as the most 
                    effective way to win. Each system tends to focus in a narrow 
                    area (e.g., heal, hit, or nuke) based on the person&#146;s 
                    perceived understanding of the statistics involved (e.g., 
                    healing points vs. nuking damage) or their idea of the most 
                    efficient use of resources (e.g., most efficient use of mana). 
                    Players tend to apply these ideas generically to a wide variety 
                    of situations and claim that their way is clearly superior 
                    to other player&#146;s methods. As a result, new players (and 
                    some experienced players) have a difficult time sorting out 
                    all the strategies when deciding how to approach hunting the 
                    mob s in the game.</font></p>

                      before said attack.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    difficulty is that each system is right and each system is 
                    also wrong depending on how it is applied. How you engage 
                    a mob is very situation specific. The situation, then, not 
                    favorite style or statistics really dictates how the combat 
                    flows. So in order to consistently win engagements, you need 
                    to use a mix of methods to fit the situation.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                    would clearly be impossible to define every situation you 
                    will encounter and develop a winning approach for each one. 
                    We can, however, develop some criteria to recognize a limited 
                    set of situations that will cover most engagements you will 
                    face in EverQuest. We can also take the tools that the magician 
                    has for engaging mob s (e.g., direct damage spells, weapons, 
                    healing spells), group them based on how you use them in combat, 
                    and create set of engagement building blocks a player can 
                    mix and match to fit the situation. We can then apply the 
                    building blocks to our limited set of situations to define 
                    a set of specific hunting strategies that will cover most 
                    of the engagements you will face with mobs up to your mid 
                    twenties.</font></p>

                    a mob. These tools fall into a set of six groups based on 
                    how you use them in combat. Each of these groups of tools 
                    will have specific advantages and disadvantages when you use 
                    them in combat. Our first tasks in developing hunting strategies 
                    are to layout the tools and define how they group together.</font></p>

                    (aggro*). All mobs have a natural tendency to want you over 
                    your pet. The mobs seem to have a radius of interest around 
                    them. For example, a crocodile, spider, or snake usually will 
                    only switch targets from the pet to you if your standing right 
                    on them. Orcs, kobalds, and skeletons have a much larger aggro 
                    radius and will switch targets even with you at a distance. 
                    Your pet hitting and taunting the mob usually holds its attention; 
                    though sometimes they may turn to run your direction your 
                    pet most likely will draw the mob back. This scenario occurs 
                    when you are positioned at the outer range of the mob&#146;s 
                    interest radius. If you hit the mob, however, with several 
                    big damage spells he will ignore your pet and concentrate 
                    his attacks on you. In a multiple mob engagement being aware 
                    of the above is critical since your pet cannot hold all the 
                    mobs attention. Once you start burning the mobs your pet has 
                    not engaged will immediately jump on you. When this happens, 
                    it is very hard for your pet to get the mobs off again.</font></p>

                    your pet is a misunderstood set of tools. Players often seem 
                    to apply measurements to the healing tools that lead them 
                    into ignoring the benefits and favoring burn spells. The measurements 
                    generally fall into one of three areas:</font></p>

                      Speed of a burn versus healing spell</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
                    measurements do not capture the impact of the heal spell and 
                    ignores the main benefit of the heal spell, your pet now has 
                    extra rounds. If we shift to viewing damage over time, the 
                    heal spell does well as an alternative to a burn. A level 
                    16 pet can hit for 20, bash for 8, double attack, and has 
                    a damage spell (water and fire pets). While I have seen many 
                    sets of numbers on the water pet&#146;s ice spell, no one 
                    really seems to know exactly what it hits for. Roughly best 
                    guess is 15 to 20 for a level 16 to 20 pet. There are various 
                    ways to arrange the numbers, but the pet should hit from 15 
                    (partial hit) to 70 (full impact) in a round. With high agility 
                    pets, you can go several rounds without being hit. The damage 
                    over time for two rounds would be 30 to 140 and for three 
                    rounds would be 45 to 210. The heal spell in this range will 
                    heal about 40 or so. Given that the average mob in this range 
                    hits from 15 to 30, you can get a minimum of two rounds attacking 
                    and more than likely four to five rounds with one heal. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, 
                    the heal spell can be fairly efficient creating roughly 30 
                    to 210 damage for a spell using 25 mana points. A mob may 
                    hit for 20 points versus the 40 point heal however, a pet 
                    gets in several rounds and can inflict significantly more 
                    damage during retaliation. While a burn spell will bring a 
                    mob down faster; a heal uses less mana than multiple cast 
                    of high mana burns, cannot be resisted, and does not aggro 
                    the mob(s) on you.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    healing effect is more pronounced when you have a higher-level 
                    pet fighting a lower level mob (e.g., a yellow or black pet 
                    on a blue mob). Your pet hits more often, does more damage 
                    per hit, and gets hit much less. One heal in this situation 
                    is often all you need to finish the mob and you can meditate 
                    while he is fighting to recover mana.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                    is some controversy on the effect of healing the pet causing 
                    an aggro tendency. My experience has been that healing my 
                    pet does not cause mobs to aggro. I have discussed this with 
                    several clerics and magicians who agree. Many clerics use 
                    healing of pets as a standard tactic (their heals are much 
                    larger than yours). Test this out by fighting two blue mobs. 
                    Stand back at max range (outside of mob&#146;s radius of interest) 
                    and heal your pet. I have never had a mob come off the pet 
                    and aggro on me. Do the same experiment and hit one of the 
                    mobs several times with your best damage spell. He will likely 
                    leave your pet and run right to you.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    downside of this spell is the long cycle time. When fighting 
                    a higher-level mob with a lower level pet, you cannot always 
                    cast the spell fast enough to keep up with damage being delivered. 
                    This is more acute the higher your mob&#146;s level (e.g. 
                    level 20 mob verses a level 8, they just hit harder). </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, 
                    heal is a useful tool. It is, however, very situation dependent. 
                    Healing tends to work best on pets with high agility, good 
                    regeneration rates, and large damage spells (water pets with 
                    ice spell, air pets with stun). It also tends to work better 
                    with pets that are higher in level than the mob because the 
                    pet gets more hits in and takes less damage. Since healing 
                    your pet cannot be resisted, this tactic tends to work well 
                    against mobs that have high resistance to magic (damage spells 
                    don&#146;t work on the mob) and situations where damage spells 
                    will immediately aggro a mob on you. Healing is not better 
                    or worse than a direct damage spell, it is a tactic that must 
                    be applied in the correct situations where its advantages 
                    can shine.</font></p>

                    pets since they can cast a darkness spell to slow the mob, 
                    a fear spell to dismiss the mob, or a root spell to stop the 
                    mob. Necros DOTs do enough damage to kill mobs when combined 
                    with their crowd control. Magicians, on the other hand, need 
                    their pets to take and do damage. That is why we have four 
                    of them with different abilities. With our damage spells and 
                    a pet in combination, we can bring a mob down fast and reduce 
                    our need for crowd control. The key is to use the right pet

                    an extra edge. A recent change to the phantom line has given 
                    it a regeneration effect on hit points making the whole line

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bandaging 
                    is a skill that should not be overlooked. While I have found 
                    that it does not provide a lot of help during combat when 
                    solo, it can significantly reduce your downtime after combat. 
                    Also when you do group, you can heal the tank while he is 
                    fighting; something all tanks appreciate. The key is using 
                    the skill to build it. Since you likely have high intelligence 
                    (your primary stat) you will learn bandaging quickly. Hit 
                    points regenerate slower than your mana due to mediate and 
                    a high bandage skill lets you build to 50% of your total health 
                    very quickly. Practice on people sitting and healing, they 
                    appreciate it and your skill goes up fast.</font></p>

                    determine how to use them during an engagement, tactics. How 
                    you use them depends on what role you are playing in the engagement. 
                    The role you play can be defined in two dimensions: who is 
                    the primary tank (you or your pet) and who is the primary

                    wizard role requires your pet to tank and you to be the primary 
                    damage dealer using damage spells as tools. The goal here 
                    is to burn the mob down quickly with a series of damage spells 
                    while your pet acts as a barrier to keep the mob off during 
                    casting. Use your pet buff spells to ensure pet damage while 
                    burning and then send the pet to attack the mob while standing 
                    at a safe distance. Ideally you want to position yourself 
                    outside the mob&#146;s radius of interest so that your pet 
                    has time to taunt the mob back when it tries to aggro on you. 
                    You should, however, be close enough that you can use the 
                    pet report command to check the status of your pet&#146;s 
                    health. Use your highest-level damage spell and chain cast 
                    it until the mob goes down. I usually hit with two burn spells 
                    then hit pet report (you should hot key pet report) to check 
                    my pet&#146;s health and continue burning. </font></p>

                      work of many mobs. No need to wait several minutes, like

                      sand giants, and red mobs will all resist your spell completely 
                      or partially. The result is you will not bring the mob down 
                      as fast as you wish and you will waste mana in the process. 
                      Damage spells also have a tendency to fizzle. The fizzle 
                      uses mana and causes no damage. The result of the above

                      situations with multiple MoBs. You have little in the way 
                      of crowd control spells and your pet can usually only take

                    this role your pet tanks and also provides the primary damage 
                    while your tools in this role will be healing the pet. By 
                    standing back at the limit of the mob&#146;s radius of interest, 
                    you use your heal spells to keep your pet alive. Since your 
                    pet deals the damage, give it all the advantages you can through 
                    the use of pet buff tools. This type of engagement takes longer 
                    than the wizard role with the damage shield accumulating significant 
                    damage on the mob and the burnout spell turning your pet into 
                    a killing machine. The trick is remembering the long cycle 
                    time on the heal spell and to start healing before you thinking 
                    you need to. A water pet with its high regeneration rate in 
                    this role works even better. Keep your pet&#146;s health up 
                    in your target window so you can continuously monitor his 
                    status. Periodically use the F8 key to check the damage on 
                    the mob and see how the battle is going. Then hit F1 twice 
                    to get you back to your pet. If you get behind on heals, the 
                    long cycle time on the heal spell will force you to have to 
                    switch roles to save your pet. If you are keeping up with 
                    the damage or your pet&#146;s regeneration rate is helping 
                    to maintain its health, you can sit down and meditate until

                      rarely fizzle (even if it does the mana loss is small). 
                      Using this method ensures little chance of wasting mana

                    The role works best with a good water pet vs. other pets. 
                    The pet cleric tends to work best with pets that have high 
                    agility (water, air), strong regeneration (water), and good 
                    damage (water, earth), and a strong damage spell (water, fire). 
                    In some cases with tough mobs or mobs that are significantly 
                    above your pet&#146;s level, you will not be able to keep 
                    up with the damage the mob is causing. However, with a good 
                    water pet equal or above the mob&#146;s level this role works 
                    well. The water pet can deal lots of damage with both its 
                    melee attacks and spell attack (more so when it is at an equal 
                    or higher level than the mob). Because of its high agility, 
                    the water pet attacks more before it gets hit again. This 
                    amplifies the effect of heal with extra rounds before the 
                    mob hits. The water pet&#146;s high regeneration rate also 
                    amplifies the heal effect and its high damage allows it to 
                    last a long time against most mobs (combine this with its 
                    agility and it can often outlast an earth pet and deal more 
                    damage). </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    With high level or tough mobs you cannot always keep up with 
                    the damage. If the mob is several levels above your pet (or 
                    a tough mob) your pet cannot get in enough hits or damage 
                    spells to offset the damage the mob is delivering. This affect 
                    is larger the farther away you get from level eight (up to 
                    level 20 when you get the new heal spell). The mobs hit harder 
                    and their damage is greater in relation to the heal spell. 
                    Surprisingly, the damage shield will cause significant damage 
                    if given enough time to work. However, there are times when 
                    you just cannot cast fast enough to keep up with damage dealt 
                    to your using heals. </font></p>

                    in the game you can deal about as much or more damage than

                    are the primary damage dealer. After you pull, you step in 
                    and start to melee with the mob. The key here is to position 
                    yourself on the other side of the mob so that your pet is 
                    hitting the mob from behind. This gives the pet a bonus for 
                    hitting the mobs back. You can hit with your melee weapon 
                    (a primary tool) and time your damage spells (another primary 
                    tool) so you can burn between the mob&#146;s hits. Since you 
                    are in melee already, you do not need to worry about having

                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                    this role you tank while your pet is the primary damage dealer. 
                    You are going to be taking the damage and drawing the mob&#146;s 
                    attention while your pet can hit and cast uninterrupted. You 
                    do not, however, want the mob to aggro on you. You want to 
                    be able to step back when needed and let your pet take damage 
                    again. To prevent aggroing the mob you will use your melee 
                    weapons to attack. Your primary tools in this role are your 
                    hit point protection tools and your melee weapons. To engage 
                    with these tools, get to the other side of the mob from your 
                    pet while staying out of the mob&#146;s striking distance. 
                    When you are on the opposite side move in and hit the mob 
                    with your primary melee weapon. The mob should turn to face 
                    you and your pet will now be hitting the mob from behind and 
                    getting the bonus. Monitor your hit points closely and step 
                    back out when you reach one to two bubbles of health. The 
                    mob should then turn back onto your pet.</font></p>

                      really spiffy armor. Still get your raw silk armor early 
                      and be grateful for any higher-level armor you can obtain. 
                      Ensure you add phantom armor and shielding buffs. They do 
                      not add a lot, but everything will help. </font></li>

                      you could inflict some damage with your staff, but in the 
                      end it is your pet that is doing the primary damage. This

                      time to finish the mob.</b> This is the primary reason for 
                      using the role. You need to step in and take some punches 
                      to keep your pet alive a little longer. This role works 
                      best with a pet that can really deal damage with his spell 
                      (water, fire). You also should step in while your pet still 
                      has enough health to cover your escape (20-30% health). 
                      When you step away, you want to judge where the mob&#146;s 
                      health is and decide when if you need to make a break for 
                      it. </font></li>

                      Sometimes you will want to share damage with your pet to 
                      equalize out the party heal time. This is particularly true 
                      with earth pets. They have low regeneration and taking a 
                      few beatings will reduce the pet&#146;s downtime. The trick 
                      is to not make your pet wait on you to finish heal. You 
                      need to balance the damage taken so both of you finish your 
                      healing around the same time. </font></li>

                    Pulling a mob is a specific role you must play at the beginning 
                    of each engagement. This is one of the more important roles 
                    you will have since it sets the tone of the battle each time. 
                    In the end, the only part of the engagement you really have 
                    control of is where you fight the battle. Picking your spot 
                    is what pulling is all about.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    First, you need to spend a little time looking over the area 
                    you are fighting in. You need to find the spot where you want 
                    the battle to end up and there are several things to look 
                    for. Obviously being near any guards in the area or being 
                    near a zone would be helpful. They will help ensure your escape 
                    if things go bad. You also want to look for the flow of the 
                    mobs in the area and they generally follow set patterns movement. 
                    In many cases there is a &#147;highway&#148; that they move 
                    on. In Everfrost there is a mob highway south of the South 
                    Tower. In the Oasis of Marr there is the Orc highway inland 
                    and the Gator Alley right along the beach. In most areas the 
                    mobs appear and move in a predictable fashion. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    You need to find a spot that is away from the traffic and 
                    near friendly help or escape routes if possible. You do not 
                    want to start your engagement in the highway. Fighting in 
                    the highway will usually lead to multiple mobs show up uninvited 
                    and spoiling the fight (i.e., 3 snow leopards in Everfrost 
                    or a puma or mummy at the Oasis). I find that the edges of 
                    the zone or up next to mountains can work well. The mobs will 
                    not naturally cross these boundaries and tend not to move 
                    toward them. The spot becomes more important as the mob becomes 
                    more aggressive (e.g., aggressive orcs vs. passive crocodiles). 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Once you have your spot picked you have to get your mob there. 
                    I generally use a long-range spell like Flame Bolt (long range 
                    and the 45-47 damage will not usually aggro the mob on you). 
                    I set my pet up in the spot (pet sit command) and approach 
                    the mob flow. I will generally cast the spell and start to 
                    move back looking for the non-melee damage message. I keep 
                    the mob selected and, as I approach my spot, I send my pet 
                    out to meet the mob right behind me. In some areas with no 
                    aggressive mobs you can pick a spot very near the mob trail 
                    and just send your pet in. This method works well hunting 
                    crocodiles at the Oasis. </font></p>
