                    <div> Alicynn realized at a rather young age that appearances 
                      are everything. This knowledge came quick to her for she 
                      was an ugly duckling. 
                      <p> "You must not listen to what those wicked children say," 
                        Alicynn's mother would admonish. "They are jealous of 
                        your inner beauty, and it is they who are truly poor." 
                      <p> Such long-tongued speech might have been nonsense to 
                        a typical five year old girl, but the Erudites were a 
                        sharp bunch, even in youth. This is not to say that enlightenment 
                        came at early ages, however. Every living thing starts 
                        out as a child, and behaves as such through play, emotion, 
                        and cruelty. 
                      <p> Alicynn's face was not proportioned like a pretty face 
                        would be, with her hair a bit too frayed, her chin a bit 
                        too large, and her neck a bit too long. It was these aspects 
                        that her classmates at the Erudin Academy were all too 
                        eager to point out to her. "Fairies built a nest in your 
                        hair again, Ali!!" "You'd be pretty if you were an orc!" 
                        "Gnoll gneck!!" Greater intelligence didn't stem the predatorial 
                        nature of Erudin children, no matter how evolved the Erudites 
                        claimed to be. And why should it? The Erudites prided 
                        themselves on their superiority over other races, how 
                        could they not want superiority over one another as well? 
                      <p> A taboo attached itself to Alicynn, and even those children 
                        who pitied her avoided her for fear of catching stray 
                        insults like stray arrows in a fight. She had no friends. 
                        Sacrifice was something the children did not understand. 
                        Neither did Alicynn. All that she learned was that perhaps 
                        if there was someone uglier than she, she would not be 
                        the brunt of the jokes any longer.

                    II</font></b> 
                    <div> One evening, Alicynn's father was to leave the city 
                      for one reason or another. He was a magician, and they traveled 
                      all the time. Alicynn knew little about his job other than 
                      that he "made" things. But before he left, Alicynn heard 
                      a knock at her bedroom door, which opened immediately afterwards. 
                      Alicynn's father stepped into the room, smiling down at 
                      his daughter who was wrapped snugly in a cocoon of blankets 
                      on her bed. 
                      <p> "Alicynn... I've brought you something very special 
                        for while I am gone," he said. Alicynn's eyes lit up in 
                        anticipation. Gifts are always mystical to children. 
                      <p> "What is it?" she asked, sitting up. 
                      <p> "A friend," he answered, and looked back to the door. 
                        Alicynn gasped in delight. She was going to have a friend?! 
                      <p> There was a quiet plodding as a very short, stout figure 
                        plodded into the room. Alicynn narrowed her eyes in the 
                        dim light to try and make out its features, only to realize 
                        that it had none. The scent of rainwashed stone filled 
                        the room. 
                      <p> "HELLO ALICYNN!", came its deep and not quite natural 
                        voice. 
                      <p> It was roughly humanoid in shape, possessing two arms 
                        and legs and a bulge where a head might have been. But 
                        it couldn't have been more than 3 feet tall. Alicynn reached 
                        out to touch it, and her fingers caressed cold, dusty 
                        stone. 
                      <p> Her heart sank in her chest. Alicynn didn't quite know 
                        what they were, but she knew that her father made them. 
                        If he'd been a carpenter, he might as well have made her 
                        a toy soldier and called it a friend or a wooden pony. 
                        It wasn't a friend, it was a walking rock. 
                      <p> "Thank you," she whispered, turning her face away in 
                        shame and sadness. She'd never felt so pathetic in her 
                        entire 5 years of life or at least the 3 that she could 
                        remember. 
                      <p> Her father kissed her cheek and hurried out of the room, 
                        late for whatever he was leaving for. Alicynn began crying 
                        the moment her door closed. 
                      <p> The small earthen elemental plodded closer to the head 
                        of her bed. 
                      <p> "ARE YOU IN PAIN?", it intoned in its flat and seemingly 
                        emotionless voice. 
                      <p> "No. Go away." 
                      <p> " I AM TO STAY WITH YOU." 
                      <p> "I don't want you!!" she shouted, quickly catching herself 
                        for fear her parents might hear. But they didn't, they 
                        had already left for the docks. 
                      <p> "BUT WHY? I AM YOUR FRIEND NOW." Its voice seemed so 
                        very apathetic, like it had no choice in the matter. It's 
                        hard to sound like anything else in a monotone. 
                      <p> "Why should I?" she whispered. "Why should you care? 
                        You're just a pile of rocks." 
                      <p> "I AM TO WATCH OVER YOU." 
                      <p> Alicynn's mouth opened to answer before the answer had 
                        formulated there. It closed as Alicynn gradually understood. 
                        It was a babysitter. Additional protection in her father's 
                        absence. She turned her face back into the pillow and 
                        cried, ignoring the elemental's further inquiries.

                    <div> Few days went by that Alicynn didn't express her discontent 
                      with the stone guardian which followed her like a puppy, 
                      both to her mother and to the elemental itself. But the 
                      elemental never replied to her harsh words, and her mother 
                      only admonished, "You must not say such wicked things for 
                      you're acting jealous of his inner beauty, and that will 
                      make you truly poor." 
                      <p> Alicynn resigned herself. If the elemental had any inner 
                        beauty, it certainly couldn't express it very well. But 
                        it stayed by her side constantly, save for when its broad 
                        arms smacked into a tree or an encroaching wall. It seemed 
                        quite clumsy, and Alicynn took to calling it "Bumpy". 
                      <p> A few days later, when Alicynn finally returned to school, 
                        she feared what would happen. She'd be mocked for having 
                        a rock for a pet, or perhaps earn another scalding nickname, 
                        or some other unspeakable child-worthy torture. 
                      <p> "What is -that-?" one of her many nameless tormenters 
                        barked from across the courtyard in front of the children's 
                        academy as she approached it. 
                      <p> She glared back at him without stopping her hurried 
                        walk, and shouted back, "Bumpy." 
                      <p> The children began to descend upon them. Not so much 
                        upon them, but it. 
                      <p> "Bumpy?!" one asked incredulously. 
                      <p> The elemental had snatched the name the moment it had 
                        heard it, as they are born nameless. And one name is as 
                        good as another, so long as it's given. Though Alicynn 
                        and the children couldn't know it, Bumpy was filled with 
                        pride, and stood as tall as he could, stating, "YES, THAT 
                        IS MY NAME." 
                      <p> Almost simultaneously all the children laughed. "What 
                        a dumb name!!!" "Yeah, and my name is Dumpy!" "He sure 
                        looks like he's bumpy!!" 
                      <p> Alicynn cringed at first, not realizing that suddenly 
                        she was not the focus of attention and malevolence. Bumpy 
                        was. 
                      <p> Jeers and insults and pokes and shoves came from every 
                        direction, although none seemed to affect the small elemental, 
                        which turned to and fro, somewhat confused. He couldn't 
                        feel the pokes and shoves, Alicynn could tell. As for 
                        the jeers and insults, she figured they couldn't be affecting 
                        it either. Why should he care? He was just a pile of rocks. 
                      <p> Besides, for the first time, she wasn't being laughed 
                        at. She smiled as much as she dared. Bumpy stood still 
                        and silent until the children finally filed into the school 
                        at the sound of the bell tower. He then dutifully followed 
                        Alicynn into the building, who didn't give him a second 
                        glance. Sacrifice was something she didn't understand.

                      insults wherever he was from the children, most of whom 
                      didn't know what he was, therefore labeling him a freak-thing. 
                      And Alicynn enjoyed a certain peace, a hollow peace. She 
                      couldn't quite tell what it was that tainted this time of

                      to her previous existence. But she was no longer the ugliest, 
                      the funniest looking. That was something, wasn't it? 
                      <p> "Tomorrow is ValorTime's day," the teacher explained 
                        as classes drew to a close. "We celebrate Valor, Sacrifice 
                        and Love among one another by giving a gift to those who 
                        are important to us. Nothing fancy, now." 
                      <p> Most of the children glanced among one another in confusion. 
                        They had celebrated ValorTime's day before, but never 
                        had it been explained to them. It was just another chance 
                        to get gifts. Valor was beating up a goblin, they knew 
                        that. Love was what their parents did. And Sacrifice was... 
                        well, they didn't know. 
                      <p> But the illumination only slowed them a bit when the 
                        bell rang and they flew out the door and away from their 
                        schooling. Alicynn followed slowly, her mind a blank, 
                        still contemplating what was wrong in her mind that seemed 
                        even more compelling after the Teacher's announcement. 
                        Bumpy walked evenly behind her, still shielding her from 
                        the harsh words that would otherwise have stricken her. 
                      <p> That night she strung together a series of colored goblin 
                        beads onto a thread in a semblance of a necklace. Beads 
                        were plentiful as many adventurers sold them to vendors 
                        throughout the city, and after being painted and polished, 
                        could be made quite pretty. Alicynn thought it was a good 
                        gift, but couldn't think of anyone to give it to. She 
                        decided that she would give it in return to the child 
                        who gave her a gift the next day. 
                      <p> She slept soundly, Bumpy standing silently by her bed.

                    <div> ValorTime's day was marked by ribbons and banners throughout 
                      the school and city. No real teaching took place throughout 
                      the day, there were mostly parties and such in most of the 
                      classrooms and the children were allowed to wander about. 
                      Bumpy attracted many shouts and irate comments as he frequently 
                      stumbled into, or was stumbled into by passing children 
                      and teachers in the crowded halls. Near the end of the day, 
                      the children convened in their respective classrooms and 
                      gift giving time was announced. 
                      <p> Homemade cards, barrettes, wooden toys and candies were 
                        swapped from hand to grubby hand. Insincere blessings 
                        of "Happy ValorTime's Day" sometimes preceded an exchange, 
                        but more often items were grabbed and hurriedly eaten 
                        or stashed away. 
                      <p> Alicynn sat patiently waiting for a gift, a paper, a 
                        kind word to be given to her, her string of beads clutched 
                        tightly in her hands, eager to give it away. But nobody 
                        approached her. And in short order, the exchanges were 
                        nearly complete, and children were making their way out 
                        the door with their newfound and hollow treasures. 
                      <p> Hollow. It finally occurred to her. The poison which 
                        had seeped into her peace for the last few days was a 
                        fact: She wasn't at peace. She was simply alone. For all 
                        the horrific taunting and pain she'd endured at the hands 
                        of her peers, she was no better off now, for like before, 
                        she was still friendless. She was still ugly. And now 
                        she was even worse, for in addition to being friendless, 
                        she was just as bad as those who were so malevolent or 
                        cowardly to attack or ignore Bumpy- 
                      <p> "ALICYNN?" 
                      <p> Her jaw was hanging open, her eyes wide as she began 
                        her descent into despair once more, when the deep voice 
                        caused her to start and look down. 
                      <p> Bumpy was standing before her. A small daisy had grown, 
                        apparently only in the last few minutes, from the earthen 
                        top of his head. A stony arm reached up and plucked it 
                        between two thick, stony fingers, and then extended towards 
                        Alicynn's lap-resting hands. 
                      <p> "HAPPY VALORTIME'S DAY." 
                      <p> His voice, still monotone, deep, and steady, sounded 
                        different to Alicynn. Not because it had changed, but 
                        because only now was she able to hear the honesty, and 
                        the spirit inside the stone body, more authentic than 
                        any words she'd heard since the day her father kissed 
                        her goodnight in her room. 
                      <p> The beads fell from her hands and she ran out the door.

                    VI</font></b> 
                    <div> It was nearly a half hour later when she collapsed, 
                      crying, in the forest surrounding the city. The daisy was 
                      still in her fingers. How could she have been so selfish? 
                      So cruel? How could she become like all the others that 
                      she hated so viciously, and ignore the one being that cared 
                      about her? 
                      <p> "There there. It'll all be over soon." 
                      <p> She looked up, startled. A tall woman was standing before 
                        her. Beside the woman was an equally tall skeleton gripping 
                        a wicked-looking mace. 
                      <p> Alicynn shrieked and shrank back. "Wh...wh.. w-wh..." 
                        she stammered. 
                      <p> "Who am I? Or what is he? Or where are you?" the woman 
                        spoke in angled tones. "I can't tell what you're trying 
                        to ask, I'm afraid... Besides, I think you know who I 
                        am, and what he is." 
                      <p> The Necromancers had a hall hidden in the forest near 
                        the city, for they were not tolerated within. No surprise, 
                        as they looked upon killing people in the same way that 
                        most people looked upon hugging people, like it was a 
                        courtesy. And that was exactly how this woman was looking 
                        upon Alicynn. 
                      <p> The woman licked her lips. "It's been so very long since 
                        I've freed such a young soul into ultimate peace..." she 
                        murmured, her eyes showing a perverse excitement. With 
                        a sidelong glance, the skeleton began towards Alicynn, 
                        mindless murder evident in it's bony grin. 
                      <p> A thumping noise came approaching behind her, and suddenly 
                        Alicynn's view from the ground was blocked by brown stone. 
                      <p> "I AM SORRY, BUT I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO HARM ALICYNN." 
                      <p> Alicynn gasped, as an even greater fear clutched her 
                        heart. "Bumpy, no!!!" 
                      <p> There was the crunching sound of breaking stone, followed 
                        by the crunching sound of breaking bone, followed by a 
                        startled shriek. Alicynn rolled to one side to see what 
                        was happening. The necromancer was fleeing into the forest. 
                        Bumpy had his long arms wrapped around the Skeleton's 
                        pelvis, and the Skeleton was flailing wildly with it's 
                        mace at Bumpy's back. Chips of stone flew from his body, 
                        and snaps repeated themselves as the Skeleton's body was 
                        crushed in Bumpy's strong arms. 
                      <p> Alicynn began screaming. She covered her head as a bone, 
                        or rock, was flung from the melee and struck her face. 
                        She was left with only sounds, the brainless cackle of 
                        the Skeleton combined with the horrid crunching noises 
                        of the battle. Minutes later, there was finally silence. 
                      <p> She looked up. Nothing recognizable remained of the 
                        Skeleton's lower half but powder and chips. It's arms, 
                        ribcage, and skull were scattered about, mercifully bereft 
                        of animation. 
                      <p> She sucked in her breath as she saw the large stone 
                        heap that remained of Bumpy nearby. His arms were gone, 
                        or least unrecognizable. His legs were gone. The largest 
                        remaining piece looked to be his body. Alicynn jumped 
                        to it and wrapped her arms around it, feeling it quiver 
                        slightly beside her. 
                      <p> His voice came. It was quieter, more distant, but strong 
                        as it had always been, coming from beyond his body. 
                      <p> "I HAVE TO GO NOW, ALICYNN." 
                      <p> Alicynn began to cry. "No... please don't. Bumpy, please 
                        don't..." 
                      <p> IT'S OKAY, ALICYNN. YOU ARE SAFE NOW... 
                      <p> She opened her tear-filled eyes and looked at the earthen 
                        spot where the daisy had grown, feeling it to be the closest 
                        to his face as she could muster. She gently brushed her 
                        fingers over the dusty surface. "I'm sorry, Bumpy. I'm 
                        so sorry for how I treated you... I-I never knew..." 
                      <p> The voice began fading away, but she heard every last 
                        word. There was happiness in them. 
                      <p> DON'T CRY, ALICYNN. I WAS ABLE TO PROTECT YOU. I'M THANKFUL 
                        FOR THAT. A GOOD LIFE FOR A PILE OF.. ROCKS...

                      forth. She asked for a gift; an enchantment, to be placed 
                      upon the daisy, that it might never wilt. To this day she 
                      still has it, and carries it with her everywhere upon her 
                      beaded necklace. 
                      <p> Every time she summons an elemental, she asks if they 
                        knew Bumpy. She hopes beyond hope that perhaps someday,

                        is at last reunited with her one true friend. 
                      <p> Until then, sacrifice is something that she understands.
