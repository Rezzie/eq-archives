Please make note of this, and excuse our mistake.  <br><br>I found this  <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000100.html">here</a> at the  <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro&BypassCookie=true">Official Everquest Forums</a> <br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="a00000" size=2><br>I wanted to give you all a brief explanation about how to use /report.<br>When you have a problem in game where there is text describing the problem in your chat window, /report allows you to send that information to us. This information comes directly off the server and is stored to a database here, so there is no concern about anyone using /report to cheat. This is the most reliable way to get your information to us.<br><br>The most common example for using this feature is when someone is harassing you. Use /report to send us the offensive text and then send in a /petition with full details of the incident (include the fact that you've used /report as well, so the GMs know that it's there).<br><br>/report will only send us the text that is currently visible in your chat window. So make certain that the text you want us to see is visible when you use /report. Scroll up until you have what you need in the chat window.<br></font></blockquote><br><blockquote><FONT face="verdana" size=2 color=#050056> <br>Also, the syntax for /report is /report &ltname&gt. The &ltname&gt is the name of the person you are reporting about. If someone is harassing you, use their name. But if you are reporting something that happened to you, such as a bug that made you fall for 10,000 points of damage, then put your character's name after /report.<br></font></blockquote><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" color="a00000" size=2><br>Nothing else is needed with /report. Please don't type /report &ltname&gt and then a lot of text explaining your concern. Use /petition to explain the concern.<br><br>Correct use of the /report feature can make it much easier for us to get things straightened out when there is a problem.<br><br>Alan<br><br></font></blockquote><br> </font>

This means that some food items will not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain your character longer than they did before.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat.  This fellow has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to.  We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to work with this patch.<br><br>- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character was healed or damaged by spells.  This could be seen, for example, when a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go back down a bit right afterwards.  There was no error in the assignment of healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed.<br><br>- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different bracer graphic than you would.  Now everyone (including the wearer) will always see the same bracer texture.  If you have two bracers that have a different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).<br><br>- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to accidentally zoning back the way they had come.  You should be facing the right way when you make that zone transition now.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This should make at least one quest more available.<br><br>- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens.  Hopefully this will allow Troll bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items.  Previously, if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy.  Now he will have 4 in either case.<br><br>- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains.  Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests.  Hopefully these changes will dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.<br><br>- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This is the beginning of our overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious.<br><br><br>** Improved and New Features **<br><br>- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of your corpses.<br><br>- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, etc...) from merchants.  It works the same way as sell in that you can hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item.<br><br>- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with /wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is).  You can now use /wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window separately.<br><br>- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them.  This will work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 'auto-equip' area of your character profile.  So if there is already a piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for it.<br><br>- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when the chat bar is up.  When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names.  When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your last target.<br><br>- /assist has an added parameter.  /assist on and /assist off will determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist.  So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage your character's auto-attack.  This change will be persistent, so it will remain as you left it when you log out.  /assist also now has a range of 200 feet.<br><br>- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins.  This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong item.  PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it.<br><br>- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than just 'hail'.<br><br>- Added /charinfo command.  Currently this command only reports the zone where the current character is bound.  We may add further information as things progress.<br><br>- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported).<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two one-handed weapons.  What will happen now is rather simple.  The very next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it.<br><br>THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your inventory.  So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in your inventory.  And don't panic, the items didn't disappear.  :)  But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to fit into your main inventory).  If you end up with a No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a problem...<br><br>Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged.  Right now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is created.  We're working on fixing that bug.  We decided to make this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the old scabbard.<br><br>This new scabbard will have a special ability.  It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them.  Simply place a Sword of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button.  The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the permanent epic sword.<br><br>Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones.  That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and combined the swords for the first time.<br><br>- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it's a big two-handed axe...).  If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out.<br><br>- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character inventory upon disconnection with the server.  If you are disconnected from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to that character within 30 minutes.  After thirty minutes those No Rent items will be deleted.  There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe.  No reimbursement will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner.<br><br>- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the "Pouch of Quellios" as intended.  If you have one of these items and it still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch yours for a new one.<br><br>- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.<br><br>- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly.<br><br>- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced.<br><br>- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3.<br><br>- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed.  If you're wearing these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd announce it anyway.  New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped armors and on the questable armors.  Because the Velious textures can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be loaded by default by the game.  If you want to see the new textures you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE.<br><br><br>** Trade Skill Changes **<br><br>- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry made for their god.  For those that not only sing around the campfire, but sing about the campfire!<br><br>- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed.  Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear.  But if the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it.  Those items should no longer seem to disappear.<br><br>- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel Chestplate has been increased a little.<br> <br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making cultural armor.<br><br>Enchant Velium<br>Enchant Mithril<br>Enchant Adamantite<br>Enchant Steel<br>Enchant Brellium<br><br>- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis Lazuli to Malachite.  They now use the same reagent as every other Magician pet spell.<br><br>Minor Summoning: Earth <br>Minor Summoning: Water <br>Minor Summoning: Fire<br>Minor Summoning: Air<br>Elemental: Earth<br>Elemental: Water<br>Elemental: Fire<br>Elemental: Air<br><br><br>- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets will now appear upon a successful use of the spell):<br><br>Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)<br>Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)<br>Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)<br>Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle)<br><br>- Cannibalize IV now exists.  This spell is now available in Velious.<br><br>- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved.  They now return more mana to the caster than they did before.<br><br><br>** Class Specific Changes **<br><br>- Monk weight allowance has been increased.  Every 15 levels monks will get an extra 1 stone weight allowance.  The post 50 weight allowance has also been increased by 2 stone.<br><br>Level 15, Limit 15<br>Level 30, Limit 16<br>Level 45, Limit 17<br>Level 51, Limit 18<br>Level 55, Limit 20<br>Level 60, Limit 24<br><br><br>- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.</font></blockquote> </font>

Saturday night (Pacific) I was in North Karana and saw a Guide, The Dryad Knight of The Green, suffering the same afflictions as the rest of us while sitting before the fire at the gypsy camp.  He said he was disgusted by the decay in the land but not much more.<br><br>I talked to the farmers, put some rabid creatures out of their misery, and generally wandered about all the Karanas checking for tracks of unusual creatures.  Around midnight (real time- no idea of the game time but it was at night) I was near the barbarian fishing village and farm fields in West Karana when a farmer shouted out something to the effect that "The plague is upon us- run for your lives!"  At last, something was going to happen...<br><br>Although I had checked tracking just a moment before, and saw nothing unusual, when I checked again I was surprised to see nothing but "a swarmling" for most of the list  (They were all con green to a Level 36 Druid).  Although I was not buffed, except for SOW, and at about 10% mana, I ran to find one of these things.  As it turned out, they were small green beetles about the size of typical fire beetle.  One attacked me at the Miller fields on sight but was easily despatched.  All of a sudden, a short ways away, I saw a similar beetle but it was very large.  This was The Swarm Mother, which conned blue, and was running toward me.  With it hitting me for 60-80 points of damage a hit, me at almost no manna, and just lower level folks nearby, what ensued must have been the longest bug-kiting in the history of the Karanas.  About 20 or more minutes later, it at last fell.<br><br>All I found on it's ichorous corpse were two fire beetle eyes and a diamond.<br><br>My thoughts (now where is my copper?),<br><br>Neurot Oldegrowth, 37th Rank Soldier of Tunare</blockquote><br>Thanks! </font>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We've been recieving a lot of reports on the GM events revolving around Bertoxx and the Karanas. Here's a report from Tarask of the Saryn server:<br><blockquote><br>The plague seems to have started in West Karanas on the morning of Friday the 13th of April (real time). <br><br>"I had little time to adventure that day, but managed to get a kindly wizard to port me into the North Karanas to investigate the rumor of a bug invasion.  Immediately upon arriving, I felt weak and my eyes began to to itch.  Evil magicks had accursed this land.  I started to make my way to the gypsy camp where a guild brother waited.  Along the way, I passed animals afflicted with rabies and strange beetles not common to this area.  I set about destroying the afflicted animals, least they attack a farmers family.  Soon however, I realized that there were far to many for myself alone to kill and continued toward the wagons.<br><br>I met with Medikar and his companions.  They did not know the source of the strange occurrences and knew only that it seemed to be a plague that had started in West Karanas.  The adventurers were valiantly trying to defend the inhabitants from the dangers that had arrived with this plague.  Our healers tried to cure animals of the disease, but their spells had no effect.  Even trying to stem off the beetle invasion seemed futile as every one we killed seemed only to be replaced by another.  One of the party pointed out a strange green mist that seemed to cover whole of the land.  The mist was so light that it could only be noticed when peering into the distance.  This seemed the likely cause of my weakness.  It was obvious that no simple actions would rid us of this curse.<br><br>The group began to search the area hoping to discover the cause of this atrocity.  I headed to a nearby farm to question some of the local townsfolk about the sudden changes.  Indeed, the farmers knew the cause of this curse.  The God, Bertoxxulous, sought revenge on the inhabitants here for the death of one of his high priests.  His Bloodsabre cult enlisted the aid of Dark Reflection to bring about a threefold plague.  Animals were stricken by rabies, a hoard of beetles invaded the realm, and a green mist hung over the land that threatened to poison crops whenever rains fell.  The villains had transformed Karana's blessing rain into a curse!<br><br>We contempated for a moment on the possible locations of the groups involved.  A Bloodsabre faction is known to reside in the Qeynos sewer system.  Dark Reflection is the name by which gnomish necromancers of Ak'Anon go.  These areas are to far removed for the casting of a spell of such magnitude however.  I suspect a circle of mages to be hiding in the mountains of West Karana.  Indeed, I remember passing many shady characters there while I had recently traveled these lands.  My friend, Zior, was willing to help me investigate my suspicion, but I was called away before I could lead him there.   I do not yet know if he was successful in his venture."<br><br>Tarask Painkeeper <br>Dragonchow on Saryrn</blockquote><br>Thanks! </font>

The <name> is the name of the person you are reporting about. If someone is harassing you, use their name.

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We have received more information regarding the GM event the other night.<br><blockquote>In what I think is a related bit of lore, a female paladin or cleric in Qeynos talks about a plague in the Karana's caused by the Heretic Erudites, and that her mother died in it. She also discusses the Realm of Heroes, which I believe is part of a Epic Quest. I don't remember exactly what the woman said, as it was over a month ago when I talked with her on the Erollisi Marr server. But, she claimed that the Heretics had caused a plaque among the animals of the Karana's, and that many clerics and paladins fought against the rabid beasts, including her mother, who died. And I believe she also said she fought, and as she believed she was about to die, she prayed to her god (The Tribunal I think), and was lifted to the Realm of Heroes, only to be sent back to serve among the mortals again. A similar quest NPC is in most major cities, talking about this Realm of Heroes, and Coins of some sort. Might want to do more research on it, as I can't give you the full details on this woman and what she says.<br> <br>Jaarus Star<br>Order of Ascension<br>24th Circle Wood Elf Warrior<br>Erollisi Marr</blockquote>We also received this from Aravail:<br><blockquote>Re the GM Event last night which you report on Luclin, and which also happened on Innoruuk.<br> <br>It was a shambles. Yes, there was a green mist and it brought with it rabid wolves, griffawns and other diseased animals, and there was talk of a swarm being defeated but I never saw one. Yes, talking to farmers in West Karana yielded the information that Bertox's high priest had been slain and as a result the Plaguebringer would visit disease, swarms and much worse upon the land. Yes, a lvl 1 shadowknight called Faraeb (not receiving tells and assumed by all to be a GM) called out that he was a messenger of Bertox and who would wreak destruction upon Qeynos. Yes, we all gathered in WK to defend the pass to the Qeynos Hills and outside Qeynos itself. Yes, we even learnt from a Priest in the Temple of Life in Qeynos that Mordavin, the man responsible for the (attempted?) resurrection of Bertox, had been discovered and slain by Antonius Bayle but that Mordavin's lover remained at large drinking with a bunch of scoundrels in the Lion's Mane Tavern in Qeynos. I forget her name.<br> <br>But no, we never found the lover - she was not on tracking - and nothing more happened. In time we all drifted away, at least that was the state of affairs when I retired for the night. As of this morning sickness messages are still received in the Karana's (affecting North East and West) but the mist has gone and nothing else seems to have happened.<br> <br>In all therefore it was much more of a non-event that an event, it provided some entertainment and did cause a great many to join together in a common stand against the evil forces. Just a shame that no eveil forces ever turned up..... Even more of a shame that we got no information as to what was going on, there was a lot of speculation that Faraeb was no more than a player exploiting the situation with some (excellent) role-playing that had us all going.<br> <br>Was it just a spoof event for Friday 13th? Was it part of a weekend-long quest? So many of us recalled with pleasure the Halloween event with the undead of the early times in EQ which has never been repeated or equalled. Was it a prequel to a new Plane being introduced? The trouble is no-one knew, and therefore the whole night descended into a farce.<br> <br>The exchanges with a number of NPC's suggest something is afoot, but as for what I simply don't have a clue. Wish I did! :)<br> <br>Loremaster<br> <br>aka Aravail, Druid of the 41st season on Innoruuk.</blockquote>Thank you both Jaarus and Aravail for this information! </font>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We just received a report on a harrowing event that took place last night on the Luclin server. Here is the report:<br><blockquote>April 12th, 2001 10:00pm - 12:30am<br>The Buggy Bug, a Plague of Questions?<br>A suspected GM event occurred last night on the Luclin server.  <br> <br>All travelers to the East Karana or North Karana during the evening hours were struck by a horrible plague of various ailments, including runny nose and blurred vision.  The sickness didn't have any major effect on magical or fighting capabilities.  The sky was over cast with a sickening green fog, that had the thickness and texture of Ogre snot. <br><br>As the plague spread the intelligent races alone were not the vectors for the disease, many animals became rabid as well, causing increased danger to travelers.  <br> <br>The confusion that followed was great and the solution, when I was forced to leave late in the night, was unclear.  At first many groups of adventures sought to destroy all of the rabid animals but it soon became clear that with elves and humans alike infected nothing short of killing every living thing in the two areas would end the disease.<br> <br>Powerful clerics of the Realm attempted to cure the pestilence but no magic possessed of the mortals could bring relief from the dread pox.  Then news came that farmer Miller had knowledge of a swarm that presumably carried the plague.  The Swarm Queen was in short order hunted down and killed.  It was reported that a necklace was looted from the feted corpse of the Queen,... this was then promptly sold to a merchant and lost!  At this point any hope of finding a cure seemed to fade away.  The plague did not leave with the slaying of the Swarm and the green fog did not lift.<br> <br>As the Night of Pain progressed without resolution some began to question if the gods had forgotten us.  Others insisted it was the work of Bertoxxulous the Plaguebringer and then they even called out his name to face him in combat, which surely would have brought about the death of all present.  No further words of any worth were gained in the night.  Many local peoples were inquired including the Gypsies and the Ancient Treant Xanuusus, but these few could tell us not.  <br> <br>As I left late in the night the plague was not ended and the greater number of adventurers had retired to rest.  I felt honored to have been present at one of the great events to touch the Karanas... I think.  Nothing really seemed to happen and no one could say what was to be done? The gods were to vague in their task for us.<br> <br>-- Celistian, Druid of the Realm of Enlightenment</blockquote><i>Note: If anyone has more information about this event, please send it to us!</i><br><br>Thank you Celistian! </font>

There is some great information here.<br><blockquote><div align="center"><b>In Development</b></div><br><br>              We're finally starting to get back on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:<br>            <ul><br>              <li><b>Loot rules in the Warrens:</b> We plan to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be eliminating several ways around the current &quot;Trivial Combat Code&quot; as well as looking at the problem of &quot;spell twinking&quot; in regards to the loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Stonebrunt Mountains:</b> The next &quot;free&quot; zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Dungeon Touchups/Revamps:</b> We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Big Changes Planned for PvP:</b> We've had a number of meetings lately to plan changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually be going up are still to be announced.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Continued UI Enhancements:</b> A number of things are planned, from allowing people the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look on the screen.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>3D Engine Enhancements:</b> One of the first things up is the enhancement of the engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the &quot;moving stair step&quot; visual artifact that you see in distant places where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance will be greatly improved.  Update: This is actually now implemented however is not yet bug- free.  You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini.  Note: If your card doesn't support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash.  Also, your Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in the works.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>The History Unfolds:</b> Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history and the future of the world will be made known.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants:</b> We're going to continue adding more quests and flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races' territories.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>New NPC Return Policy: </b>Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a mob and gotten the &quot;Thank You!&quot; message? We are currently working on a way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b> Class Balance Discussions:</b> Some recent changes have been introduced as a result of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback as we see fit.<br>              </li><br>              <li><b>Velious Magic Resistance:</b> In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion, we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player characters.</li><br>            </ul><br>            We'll fire off more updates as we have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!</p><br>            <p>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>            </p></blockquote> </font>

What do you know about them?  You've grouped with them sure, maybe you even are one.  Necromancers are the masters of the dead, reaching beyond the bounds of the grave to magically manipulate their dark minions. With the ability to command an undead being the Necromancer makes an impressive group member but they can also solo most effectively. But how much do you really know about these undead masters of Norrath?<br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the wicked undead masters of the realms.  Running around with skeletons isn't all that necromancers can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Necromancers of EverQuest.<br></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE> </font>
