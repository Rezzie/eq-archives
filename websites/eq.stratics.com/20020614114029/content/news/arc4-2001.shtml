The changes implemented include some that weren't announced previously:<br><br>- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP encounters. In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now. PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.<br>- Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the person killed. In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.<br>- Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.<br>- On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights. We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the  loser in PvP encounters.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote></font>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here's today's patch message:<br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">*** Important Reminder ***<br><br>Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It is also important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.<br> <br>** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<br><br>We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it right away after the patch.<br><br>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of <br>them disappearing.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br>*** Patch Message ***<br><br><br>** Zone Changes **<br><br>- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...<br><br><br>** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br><br>- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that were never intended to stack.<br><br>- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br><br>- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br><br>- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been changed to be more appropriate.<br><br><br><br>** Features and Interface Changes **<br><br>- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist without the %t.<br><br>- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<br><br>- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message was already set to user color 15.<br><br>- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list <character name>_<#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br><br>- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade item names.<br><br>- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br><br>- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br><br>- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they don't show up otherwise).<br><br>- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this to annoy players that had ignored them.<br><br>- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to annoy people that had ignored them).<br><br>- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name, such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<br><br>- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface (mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must use this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it. REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to reboot your machine.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br><br>- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br><br>- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of your waist.<br><br>- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. <br><br>- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable.  There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so we had to disable that for these items.<br><br>- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different. Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br><br>- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<br><br><br>**  Other Stuff **<br><br>- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level bard title.  :)<br><br>- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote></font>

They are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals... but how much more is there to know? <br><br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about these casters of mass destruction.  Teleporting people around isn't the only thing that they do well.

Here is a snipplet:<br><br>Jeff says that when you load up Luclin you will have the option of picking options for a new character model or setting the options for your existing characters. This means that if you are a troll you have the choice of changing to the new troll model or keeping your old one. The new engine supports a large array of hairstyles and colors. It hasn't been decided yet but its possible you will be able to change your hairstyle after the initial changeover. Also items and equipment is separate from the character models(detachable geometry).<br><br>You can find the rest of the interview <a href="http://www.everlore.com/viewarticle.asp?id=435844">here</a>.<br></blockquote><br>Thanks!

It has been a great success... with the exception of last month, when it had to be cancelled due to lack of interest (the weekend it was scheduled for, there were a large number of raids happening, and it seems people are more interested in ph4t l3wtz than helping their community). Since then, I have thought long and hard about the faire... and whether it should continue. I decided I would give it one more try, and depending on the reaction of the community, I would either end it or continue it. I planned to do so this month, but am, unfortunately, unable to. <br><br>However, that does not mean that there should be no Faire. If someone else would like to take it upon themself to host the faire, then by all means, do it! This is an effort of the community, not of any one person, and it is the community's task to help each other out and stick together.<br><br>Hopefully, by next month things will have settled and I can put the faire together again, properly. Thank you, my friends, for understanding, and I hope I haven't let anyone down who was looking forward to this month. I'm looking forward to seeing you all in June!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</blockquote><br>Thanks!

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> EverQuest Stratics is looking for two energetic and exciting new individuals to help us upgrade our news coverage. These two positions will play a very large role in the future direction of the EQSS web site. The positions include a new EverQuest Stratics News Lead and also a brand new position that we&#8217;ve never had before, an Event Coordinator. Both of these positions will require good communication skills, an ability to manage information in a timely manner and also someone who is looking to have a good time. The absolute key to both of these positions is a desire to have a fun time interacting with the EverQuest community. <br><br>We are also looking for daily news and event reporters as well &#8211; so even if you&#8217;re not interested in these two positions, perhaps helping out with the news or events might interest you. <a href=mailto:eqadmin@stratics.com?subject=EQSS News Openings>Please let us know</a>.<br><br><blockquote><b>EverQuest Stratics News Lead</b> - News is submitted to the EQSS web site on a daily basis, this information needs to be organized and compiled into our news system. Some of this news is geared directly toward the community, while some of it is general in nature. If you&#8217;d like to help coordinate a team of news reporters and writers, please get in touch with us. This is the first of many steps to begin revitalizing the entire EQSS web site.<br><br>We need someone who is reliable, energetic and excited about helping the EQ community. Solid writing and editorial skills are required. Being a good team leader is also important for this position. If you are interested in learning more, please <a href=mailto:eqadmin@stratics.com?subject=EQSS News Openings>drop us a note</a>.<br><br><b>EverQuest Stratics Event Coordinator</b> - This role is very similar to the News Lead with one key exception. This person must go out and become actively involved with the EverQuest Community. Go out and touch base with the various guilds, community leaders,  keep in close contact with Verant (i.e. the Guides and GMs) and also work in cooperation with the EQSS news team. <br><br>We want to begin posting as much news about every wedding, GM event, Guild event, Guild war, and player gatherings as we can. In the past we posted this information as it came in. We plan to change that. This person (and those working on the team) will actively seek out such information as well as ask for submissions. We want to begin publishing as much event information as possible and eventually on a server-by-server basis as well.<br><br>This position more than anything is about having a great time, getting to know the vast majority of the EQ community and also helping to provide an excellent resource for the entire EQ community.</blockquote>If you feel you have the right stuff for either of these positions, please get in touch with us right away. Experience is a big plus here. It is the first step of many to really improve the EverQuest Stratics web site. <a href=mailto:eqadmin@stratics.com?subject=EQSS News Openings>Please contact us</a> if you would be interested in either of these positions, or if you&#8217;d just like to help out. We would love to hear from you!

Game Cards will be sold in retail stores this fall throughout Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia as well as North America.  Additionally, JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau) credit cards are now accepted, making EverQuest(r) and SOE's other massively multiplayer games more accessible to an international audience. <br><br>Currently, SOE requires an American credit card number to subscribe to the online game and ultimately this has limited EverQuest's growth abroad.  Game Cards will allow cash holders to experience the best-selling online game of all time in 90-day increments and will be available on retail shelves worldwide. <br><br>The JCB Card offers a great opportunity for SOE to reach gamers in Japan and many other Asian countries.  With over 40 million cardmembers worldwide, JCB's sophisticated global payment system network has made it the number one card in Japan and number four internationally among all of the major credit cards. <br><br>"There has been a universal increase in demand for access to our best-selling game, and now we have found a way to reach this broader market by changing our billing methodology," said Scott McDaniel, Vice President of Marketing, Sony Online Entertainment. "We're looking forward to inviting a whole new group of players into the world of EverQuest."<br><br>The EverQuest online game currently boasts more than 385,000 active subscribers, and recently released a popular expansion pack to the game, EverQuest(r): The Scars of Velious(tm), last Fall.  During peak periods, more than 90,000 adventurers and dragon slayers have explored the EverQuest world simultaneously.  The active global EverQuest(r) subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the "real" world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy, Germany and New Zealand. <br><br><a href="http://www.station.com"target="_blank">The Station(r)</a> is the official provider of EverQuest(r), with software updates and news about the game, message boards and other community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for the EverQuest monthly subscription fee of $9.89.<br><br>Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), the online gaming division of Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment, is a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming. Headquartered in San Diego, California, SOE develops, publishes and distributes entertainment for the PC and online markets.  With more than 10 million registered users, SOE's award-winning website, <a href="http://www.station.com"target="_blank">The Station(r)</a> hosts a  variety of entertaining games and player communities spanning all genres.

There will be a baseball point coming.<br><br>"My good-natured character, Bingbong," -- whom Glanville described as "a dwarven Paladin," whatever that is -- "was at a little lower level (in status) than his," Glanville said.

I saw some NPC gnomes, so those _might_ be the new gnome looks, but that's neither here nor there. The plan is that when you buy Luclin you get to decide whether to see the updated player models or the older player models. If you choose the updated models, you get to pick re-pick what you look like. I still had a ton of questions at this point, but they got washed away. What I thought important was that you will get to decide between the old and the new and also get to pick your specific new look.</blockquote><br>You can read his full commentary and add your own comments <a href="http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/eq/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=eqwestwood&Number=534095&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part=">here</a>.<br></ul><br><br>By the way, yes, I know what else "SOL" stands for.

It also means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning.<br><br>** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE **<br>** PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH!              **<br><br>We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in an check on it right away after the patch.<br><br>So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here's the Patch Message for this week. Thanks to ShinZed for the heads-up.<br><br><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">May 8th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br><br>** PvP changes **<br><br>We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:<br> <br>- Consider:  /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character.  The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him.  The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack.  And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.  This will only take effect on PvP servers.<br><br>- Sanctuary Levels:  Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.  This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.<br><br>- De-Leveling:  Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two levels higher.  This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character.  This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise).  So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br><br>These are the first of the things that we plan to.  We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.<br><br><br><br>** Quest Changes **<br><br>-  We've made a change to the Velious armor quests.  The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give out rewards for these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to.  You will have to be considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able to complete these quests.  If you are doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less picky, and they only require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.<br><br>- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it should.<br><br>- Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You cannot remove this effect." Changed by popular demand... :)<br><br>- Food Emotes:  Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly display the appropriate emote to those in the area.<br><br>- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.<br><br>- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow.  We will not be listing the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their ability to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this property).<br><br>- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of charges.  You may need to contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting strangely.<br> <br>- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item.  Be aware, once you remove it from your finger, it will not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.<br><br>- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering.<br><br>- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display the correct number of charges.<br><br>- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0.<br><br>- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots.<br><br>- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.<br><br>- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large.  This might cause you a little reorganization in your inventory.<br><br>- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash.<br><br>- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes and Additions **<br><br>- Translocation spells:  Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay, Tox, North, Combine and Group).  Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the Wizard remains behind.  Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their own bind points.  Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily).  The others are available on an exclusive vendor.  All Translocate spells (even the original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the target will be sent.  And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.<br><br>- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased.<br><br>- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to Customer Service Resurrection so that players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit Points and Mana.<br><br>- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.<br><br>- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep.  This change was made to prevent an exploit.<br><br> <br>** Feature Additions and Changes **<br><br>- Looting text has been changed.  You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages.  This <br>has been changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of as real.<br><br>- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just looted.<br><br>- Expanded Friends List:  The Friends List will now hold 30 character names.  And each character has its own friends list.  You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside the game.  You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory.  The files will look like this:  <character name>_<#>.ini.  The default Friends List for existing and new characters will be your old Friends List.<br><br>- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up another item while they are open.  This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.<br><br>- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the container selected and clicking the sell button.  The merchant will tell you that you need to empty the container before the merchant will buy it.  This should prevent folks from accidentally selling items that they did not know were in those containers.<br><br>- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.<br><br>- There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally".  This is the highest level of friendliness that an NPC will register using the /consider command.  The faction required to reach this rating is significantly higher than 'warmly'.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Absor, Abashi, and other random Verant employees (who also probably have names beginning with "A") had a field day on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1">Developer's Corner</a> today.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000153.html">Why is Stormfeather so rare?</a><br><blockquote><br>Players have timed this guy to a 19 hour spawn who sometimes skips. This, combined with Lodizal (an even rarer spawn) make it almost impossible to complete the Iceland map quest without days of mindless, boring waiting. I've heard reports of players sitting for 80 plus hours waiting for this guy. The quest already has one bottleneck with Lodizal as players must be lucky enough to be in on the kill, and also win the roll. The Stormfeather thing is excessive. Why should we have to sit around for countless hours to complete a quest? Could you maybe look into upping the spawn time, or perhaps at least change it from skipping spawns?<br><br><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">While I didn't personally design the quest I have assisted players in it's completion with my play character. One friend doggedly camped the spawn location for over two days straight before obtaining the component it carries. Another friend put a bounty out for players who were hunting the normal spawns in the area, he paid a generous sum to the first person to tip him off when the creature appeared. I guess it's up to you how you want to play the game and how important each particular item is to your character.<br><br>It's a random spawn, not timed, and as you pointed out it can be very rare. The quest yields arguably the best facepiece in the game so I don't predict a reduction in the difficulty of obtaining it.<br><br>As a team I know we're committed to pushing the envelope in regards to what we can pull off contentwise. I feel we've made some significant enhancements lately that will enable us to provide even more compelling content in the near future. <br><br>- Steve Burke</font></blockquote><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000151.html">Theft of Thought not Thieving Enough?</a><blockquote><br>I figured i jump in with a spell question (hope Mr. Poe isnt to busy atm =)<br>Im using ToT on mobs one common thing seems to happen, the higher level the mob the less you receive back into your mana pool.<br><br>I can understand this from a resist point of view or whatever (personally i would rather it be a stable amount like harvest), but my question is this;<br><br>Does the gain back into ones mana bar refloect how much was taken from the mob? Or do you always take a set amount from the mob, its just how much you receive that is level dependant?<br><br>Thanks<br><br><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">Theft of Thought takes a set amount of Mana from your target and returns it to you. This amount scales up as you level. The numbers will be the same for both sides, meaning if you take 100 mana from the target you will get 100 mana. The mana stolen, and the mana returned are both level dependant.<br><br>- Lawrence Poe</font></blockquote><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html">Questing for XP, not loot (long)</a><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000"><br>Hi Relbeek,<br><br>After reading your email I think you're either a bit psychic or you've had our meeting room bugged.<br><br>Seriously, we've had a few discussions lately that have resulted in some changes being made. These changes will enable us to implement some of the suggestions you've made here, as well as some not mentioned such as quests that players can only do once in their lifetime. <br><br>We're all working on creating more original, compelling content with enticing rewards.<br><br>- Steve Burke</font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Steve "Mennix" Fuller interviews SOE President and CEO Kelly Flock. Here is a portion of this excellent interview:<blockquote><b>Steve Fuller</b>: In your opinion, how do you think SOE has set the standard for the future of massively multiplayer online games (MMOLG) that all other companies would follow with the creation of EverQuest?<br><br><b>Kelly Flock</b>: In several areas. No other game in this genre has experienced the level of updating that goes on in EQ. Everything from expansion packs to new graphics to new quests. The game stays fresh and will continue to be improved. So, any other competitor has to have a plan to ensure ongoing maintenance and development. This will be beyond many publishers and developers. EQ also pioneered the Player vs. Environment model. Before then, Player vs. Player was the rule. It turns out that PvE is a lot more fun. Another area we've spent a lot of time on is in developing and supporting the community, so EQ becomes much more than just a game, but a complete social circle of many players.</blockquote>You can read the entire interview at the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/features/standards.jsp" tagrget="_new">Harpy's Head Tavern</a>.<br><br>Steve also writes the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/weekly.jsp" target="_new">Dear Mennix</a> column which is posted every Monday and Thursday.<br><br>Thanks Steve!

The only characters allowed in the Arena on Test for the main event will be the champions, the judges of the event and the event staff, other members of Verant Interactive, and members of the press who signed up with the Events Staff at least three days in advance via email at Eventmaster@station.sony.com. <br><br>All other characters on Test found in the Arena during the main event will be summoned out of the zone and bound so they cannot return. If a second character is found to enter the Arena for any reason, it could be considered disruption and subject to action taken against the account. <br><br><br>Lady Madera "the Chosen"<br>Ozzmar the Calm<br>Dartok Gnomemuncher<br>Namdarie the Steadfast<br><br> <br><br><b>Tuesday May 8th 2001 </b><br><br>Karana 4:00 PM PST <br>Drinal 4:00 PM PST <br>Tallon Zek 5:00 PM PST <br>The Tribunal 5:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Wednesday May 9th 2001 </b><br><br>Povar 4:00 PM PST <br>Xev 5:00 PM PST <br>Fennin Ro 6:00 PM PST <br>Tunare 7:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Thursday May 10th 2001 </b><br><br>Brell Serilis 5:00 PM PST <br>Bristlebane 5:00 PM PST <br>Xegony 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Friday May 11th 2001 </b><br><br>Quellious 5:00 PM PST <br>Vallon Zek 5:00 PM PST <br>Bertoxxulous 6:00 PM PST <br>Zebuxoruk 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Saturday May 12th 2001 </b><br><br>Test Server 1:00 PM PST <br>Rallos Zek 4:00 PM PST <br>Tarew Marr 4:00 PM PST <br>Veeshan 5:00 PM PST <br>Druzzil Ro 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Sunday May 13th 2001 </b><br><br>Ayonae Ro 4:00 PM PST <br>Morrel Thule 4:00 PM PST <br>Solusek Ro 4:00 PM PST <br>Erollisi Marr 5:00 PM PST <br>Mithaniel Marr 5:00 PM PST <br>E'Ci 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Monday May 14th 2001 </b><br><br>Innoruuk 4:00 PM PST <br>Terris-Thule 4:00 PM PST <br>Lanys T`Vyl 5:00 PM PST <br>Tholuxe Paells 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Tuesday May 15th 2001 </b><br><br>The Nameless 5:00 PM PST <br>Cazic-Thule 5:00 PM PST <br>Torvonnilous 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Wednesday May 16th 2001 </b><br><br>The Seventh Hammer 5:00 PM PST <br>The Rathe 5:00 PM PST <br>Prexus 6:00 PM PST <br>Saryrn 6:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Thursday May 17th 2001 </b><br><br>Vazaelle 5:00 PM PST <br>Luclin 5:00 PM PST <br>Rodcet Nife 5:00 PM PST <br><br><b>Friday May 18th 2001 </b><br><br>NO EVENTS <br><br><b>Saturday May 19th 2001 </b><br><br>Finals on Test 12:00 Noon PST </font></blockquote>

        <div><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Absor posted the following to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&number=1"target="_blank">Developers Corner</a><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000150.html"target="_blank">First wave of PvP changes</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#a00000">When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br>Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br><br>Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br><br>De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br><br>There may very well be other changes in the patch, so read the patch message carefully. And this is only the first of the things that we plan to change, so don't worry that this is all that we plan to do. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can.<br><br>Alan</font></blockquote><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000149.html"target="_blank">Possibility of new Enchanter spells in upcoming patch</a><br><br><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size=2 color="#05056">First off,<br>This is NOT a rant or anything like that.<br>Just a simple question. <br><br>Is there any more spells expected pre-SoL for enchanters? <br><br>Looking at the higher level spell choices our selection seems to dwindle considerably compared to other INT and WIS classes. <br><br>Wizards 59th + 60th Combined = 11 spells<br><br>Enchanters 59th + 60th Combined = 7 spells<br><br>/shrug Just hope to see alittle creativity come out of next major patch to hit test. Please consider.<br><br><font color="#a00000">We currently have no plans to add new Enchanter spells. But you never know what will happen.<br><br>As for the number you've quoted&#8230; well, you'll also note that Enchanters have, by far, the largest selection of spells. I have no problem with them having the smallest selection at any given level (or two). <br><br>The number of spells a class has isn't necessarily an indication of the usefulness or desirability of those spells, and most certainly isn't a gauge of the value of a class (or the creativity of Verant).<br><br>Alan</font></font></blockquote>

Shadow Knights are the evil counterparts to Paladins. Part warrior and part necromancer, these evil knights use the powers of the undead to aid them in their battle against the forces of good. Shadow Knights work best in group combat but through the use of a pet and their dark magic can solo very effectively. But there's so much more to these dark knights .. how much do you know about them? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the dark warriors of the realms.  Harm touch isn't the only thing that shadow knights can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Shadow Knights of EverQuest.<br><br><a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/">PlanetEverQuest</a><br></blockquote>Thanks!
