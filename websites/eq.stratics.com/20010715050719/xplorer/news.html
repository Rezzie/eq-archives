<p align=center>Hail there, and welcome. Here I've typed down my adventures, thoughts and whatever dealing with EQ. Whether you are an experienced EQ player or a newbie struggling for your life, I hope you will enjoy this site.

<p><b>News Entry - 000427 - 6:45pm CET</b>

<p>1 Story added!
<br>17 Screenshots added!

<p>While the journal lies dead and deserted I've decided that I will keep the story and screenshot sections alive. This pause of mine from the journal has left me with a lot of time to think and I'll probably be experimenting a bit with the whole site in the near future.

<p>One idea I have is that I will change the screenshots layout so that I will have more text to attach to each picture. Thus, while brief, I will still be able to talk about my journies. Then, if I would someday decide to come back in full scale with the journal I wouldn't have to make a massive update of 30 pages telling you what you've missed =).

<p>Besides that and some graphical changes I'll try my best to fill out the stories section (it's a tad empty, I know).  If you happen to have a story (or an article for that matter) please email me at <a href=mailto:xplorer@stratics.com>xplorer@stratics.com</a>.

<p>Right now I can offer you another well written story from Remelio. Keep up the good work you writing fool =P.

<p>That's all for now.

<p>Just my luck... I'm finally getting ready to play my first real session of EverQuest since I quit and what happens? It's patch day (horay!).

<p>Anyway, thanks goes to Remelio for writing up a story to keep you readers out there busy until I return to the lands of writing. If there are any other readers out there holding on to a story, then please send it to me. I, for one, would love to have something to read for a change =).

<p>I've also added a couple of screenshots which were taken before I quit EQ (except for one). I don't know if I've written about them in the journal, but in any case, they're there.

<p>That's it for now.

<p>Well, before people start complaining on my definition of "soon" (Verant and OSI look like saints compared to me =)) I will give you some detail on what is going on.

<p>Remember that virus infection I had some months ago? Well, now it turns out that it could be a candida invasion in my body, which would explain the difficulties I have had with school recently.

<p>Anyway... there will be a journal update as soon as I'm feeling somewhat better. And, believe it or not, I've decided to come back to EQ (with a new philosophy on playing!).

<p>Just wanted to let you know.

<p>Christmas is here and I've decided to take some time off of both EverQuest and the journal writings. I have enough as it is with all my homework (just 8 weeks behind :\) so there really isn't any time for me to play EverQuest.

<p>Anyway... Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! <br>(I refuse to use the word 'millenium' as it is so hyped out of proportions ;)).

<p>If you came here from the stratics you've already read this.

<p>XEJ is finally updated with a brand new entry, including 22 screenshots!

<p>Unfortunately, I missed out on documenting a lot of stuff, such as being drunk, the changes to Kithicor, etc. The reason why is because I am lacking a great deal of interest in EverQuest at the moment, possibly forever. It does, however, include my thoughts on South Ro, the Class Specific Armor and some other things, including an interview about that friggin' thing called "the corpse bug".

<p>Enjoy.

<p>I'll keep you posted whether I'll continue to play EQ or not.

<p>Sorry about the late update. I had some trouble with the stratics server, but they seemed to have fixed it now.

<p>This journal entry actually includes some rants (not that there has never been any before). I was in a bad mood last night when I rounded it up, so you could say that my Crobaaz writings were utterly interrupted for some bashing. Enjoy :).

<p>Hail readers,

<p>The roundup for the summer and the last couple of weeks is finally done, and I'm back on schedule.

<p>There are actually two journal entries in this update. My plans were to write everything in detail as things had happened to me, but during the second entry I finally realized that I wouldn't have the time to do that (being, what? two weeks behind?). So I did a quick roundup. Sorry about this, but all this writing and the fact of being behind were driving me crazy.

<p>Failed my driving test so I've not been in the writing mood, sorry about this. I've started to work on the journal entry though, but I'll take some time writing down the things I've done for the last couple of weeks. There's no ETA on the update as for now, but hopefully it'll be up before Thursday.

<p>Good news is though that this will be the last huge update for some time. School has begun now and it's back to the happy eight or nine hours a week of EQing. In short, there'll be a more regular flow of updates now (every Sunday-Monday), but not as big as they've been during the summer (some people will be pleased by that though :)).

<p>Oh btw... Atherion is now a proud owner of a lastname, but I won't give it out here :). Thank you all who took the time sending in your ideas on lastnames. Appreciate it a lot!

<p>Well, I guess that's all for now.

<p>The journal has grown in size now (377kb), and it's divided into four different parts (journal.html, journal1.html, journal2.html and journal3.html). So if you get confused, don't panic :).

<p>Announcement I: Looking for more story writers! I know there are tons of good writers out there who probably have one or two lying around, if so... send them in!

<p>Email is: <a href=mailto:xplorer_21@hotmail.com>xplorer_21@hotmail.com</a>

<p>Announcement II: More like a competition actually :). Atherion _will_ be hitting level 20 now before the end of the summer, and he needs a lastname! I'm bad at this stuff, and haven't been able to think of one (mostly because Atherion is a long name, so some lastnames doesn't sound right). So if you got an idea of one... send it in!

<p>Email is... er... just look above :).

<p>Announcement III: Are you playing on Tarrew Marr? Are you over 30ish in level? Do you have a pile of bone armor in your bankbox? If so, contact me ingame or through email, and I'm sure we could make a deal on those Bone Leggings, thanks.

<p>There... I just used this page for my own personal needs, go <a href=http://www.microsoft.com>sue</a> me :).

<p>Oh! also want to thank everyone who has taken the time to email me, appreciate it! Unfortunately, I haven't been able to reply them all, sorry.

<p>Had some trouble accessing the EQSS server before I went to the hospital for two days, so I was not able to update the page until now. Just check out the entry below for more details on what I have added.

<p>There'll be a more detailed update tomorrow with a journal entry as well, stay tuned.

<p>Journal Updated!
<br>Three Screenshots added (100 total!)
<br>Stories Section Updated!

<p>That's right, the stories section is finally up! Thanks goes to Seriph for breaking the ice and becoming the first author of the stories section. Hopefully others will follow his example. It's a little bit thin (the stories section, not Seriph's story :)), but hopefully it will grow larger in time.

<p>If you want to add your story, then send me the story in the actual message, since hotmail tends to screw up anything that is attached *shrug*. The address is <a href=mailto:xplorer_21@hotmail.com>xplorer_21@hotmail.com</a>.

<p>Thanks.

<p>Journal Updated!
<br>Over 10 screenshots added!

<p>The hard parts of the driving school are over and during the following week I can solely concentrate on EQ.

<p>The journal entry covers this weeks sessions until yesterdays (Friday). Enjoy!

<p>Also, a reader has emailed me his story (can't check for his name, damn hotmail... I'll work on it), and we'll start with that one tomorrow, the story section will finally be up I guess! :)

<p>Cya for an update tomorrow.

<b>News Entry - 990711 - 6:48pm CET</b>

<p>Just made some changes here and there for easier navigation. This is the first time when I actually feel like I have no control over the page at all :). So please, report any dead links to me. Just press the yellow Xplorer thingie on the left navbar, thanks. Note though that the stories section is not up yet.

<p>Also, the documents _are_ on the EQSS server, all except for the left nav bar. I don't know, but it may load slower than the rest of the page. Hopefully I'll get my hands on a working counter script soon which can be used through the stratics.

<p>I'll probably play EQ tomorrow for 5 hours, but I will mainly be hunting in the Karanas, so you won't miss out on anything (I hope :)). There'll be an update on Saturday-Sunday though, stay tuned.

<b>News Entry - 990710 - 6:20pm CET</b>

<p>Journal Updated!
<br>Over 20 screenshots added!

<p>It's confirmed, Xplorer's Everquest Journal is now a part of the Everquest Stratics!

<p>I hope that both the EQSS and my journal will benefit from this, and that it will now be easier for new readers to find this site (and for old readers to continue finding this site :)).

<p>The actual documents aren't on the EQSS server yet though, so you may experience some excessive loading times. I'll have to get my hands on a new CGI script for a new counter before I transfer it all over to the stratics. Hopefully I'll find a sollution to this within the week.

<p>Also, the journal has been updated, but be warned; It's three weeks worth of reading material, so you might want to grab something to eat before you start reading :). I apologize for this, having huge updates, but it's just that it took my whole last Saturday and this Saturday to finish writing it.

<p>By that I would also like to inform you that the timeline may not be totally precise, you might get confused, I sure have been :).

<p>Anyway, that's it for now. I'm guessing my next update will not come until next Friday.

<p>Heya

<p>Caught an ugly summer cold and I've been missing out on EQ for a whole week now. Read more about it in the journal.
<p>Also want to say that I did get the additional 30 hours/week and that you'll probably see updates coming throughout the whole week. Unfortunately, there won't be any updates after next Sunday. I'm studying for my driver's license and it'll take about two weeks to finish the course, take the tests and get, hopefully, photographed :).
<p>Updates will come as usual after the second week of July though.

<p>Journal Updated!

<p>I thank the stratics for mentioning my site again. The counter did another jump from the middle 800's to 1570.

<p>I'm waiting to add the stories section. You won't be able to send me any at the time anyway, due to my crappy hotmail address. Hopefully I will have a fix on this problem shortly. You can still send me emails though.

<p>Speaking of emails. I want to thank all of you who took the time and gave me your comments on the page and questions about it. The response of the new color scheme has been good too so far, so if there aren't too any complaints coming I'll probably keep it.

<p>That's it for now, stay tuned for more tomorrow.

<p>The journal file was getting a bit big, so I've started a new document for the new entries. You can still check out the old ones by pressing "Older Archive".

<p>The stories are still not up. I'll make the main document tomorrow, and add a feature for sending in your own stories, stay tuned.

<p>Heh, big mistake :). Here I go and tell you it's "retreive" and not "retrieve" while I actually ment that it was "receive" and not "recieve". D'oh :). Thanks goes to Ron who mailed me informing me of my mistake.

<p>Also received some other mail from you readers and it's always nice, knowing that there are actually people out there enjoying my site. I can tell you that there's been a somewhat huge journal update, along with my first little "rant" if you can call it that. The stories will be up soon, hopefully during the next week. But I need more stories, please send me one at <a href=mailto:xplorer_21@hotmail.com>xplorer_21@hotmail.com</a>.

<p>Journal Updated!

<p>Proud to say that the screenshots are up. Hopefully you'll find them interesting. The quality of the pictures is somewhat bad, but hopefully that will be balanced out with faster loading time.

<p>Also made a HUGE spell check on my original journal (in word format). Ugh, I feel awful. First and foremost: "retreive", not "retrieve" :). Secondly, it's "annoying", not "annyoing" (now that's annoying :). I'll implent the spelling changes to the HTML journal soon.

<p>The stories section will be up any day now, with some stories from Veon. When all the sections are up I'll send a longer and more detailed text about my site to the stratics. Hopefully they'll re-add me.

<p>I'm not sure, but I think the annoying (note the correct spelling) scroll thingie for Netscape users is gone. If not, drop me a <a href=mailto:xplorer_21@hotmail.com>mail</a>

<p>That's all for now, cya next week.

<p>Cool. I thank the stratics for announcing for my page, I appreciate it. The counter did a jump from about 70 to 420 :). I also received some emails and I'll take one email into discussion later. Anyway, with people reading this page now I really feel motivated to continue updating this page, and I'll do my best :).

<p>For all of you new readers I can tell you that this site will mostly be updated during the weekends, but late entries may appear throughout the week.

<p>Right now I really want to get the stories section up and running. I'm told to receive a couple of stories in the near future from a friend of mine. I'll also make it possible for all you people out there to email me the stories to a specific email (Hotmail isn't really up to it).

<p>Well I guess that's all. Stay tuned during the remainder of the weekend.

<p>Made it easier to navigate in the journal, using a "Next Journal Entry" anchor system. I hope everything links correctly. If not, drop me a line (press the Xplorer thingie in the left frame). Also discovered that there's an annoying scroll thing in the logo frame when using Netscape. I'll fix that shortly. I'll also add a kick page as soon as I remember that meta tag :).

This page will be updated during the weekdays as well. The journals will still only be updated during weekends, and maybe an update on Monday or Tuesday, depending on how busy I've been.

<p>Later this week I'll add the stories and screenshot sections as well. The page is a little bit shaggy on the whole, but I'll make it better in time, so hang in there.
