      <p>Guide Kovarid's Tale<br>
      <br>
      Legend speaks rarely of the greater gods, the rulers of the Planes of Power, but of the hatred felt towards them by the Giants there are stories aplenty.<br>
      It is said that a Giant is born into the world seething with disgust for these gods, possessing a deep felt fear and mistrust of those greater than them.<br>
      That the Giants confide only in each other, often attacking other races with whom they come in contact with, is rarely disputed and a fact well known by almost all the peoples of Norrath.<br>
      But perhaps they deserve pity and not hate in response, for no other race in the history of the world has suffered such persecution in their past.<br>
      It was during the Second Age of Norrath, when the gods still seeded the lands with life, that Rallos Zek, the warlord, did create the Orcs on Faydwer; and the Giants and Ogres on Antonica.<br>
      The Giants, being one people at that time, flourished in the Northlands, vast and fertile grasslands that stretched from the ocean to great mountains both to the east and south.<br>
      In seclusion they made the huge cities and castles, and built a civilization rivaled at that time by very few of the other intelligent races.<br>
      They were a strong nation, and worshipped their creator, the Warlord.  Armies and outposts guarded the passes leading into the Northlands, and the few times their home was attacked, the invaders were utterly crushed.<br>
      Far to the south, another civilization grew to great power as well.  The Ogres also worshipped the Warlord, even more fervently than the Giants.<br>
      Their empire constantly expanded, eventually even to other dimensions, and upon invading the Plane of Earth they did do battle with the Council of Rathe.<br>
      And while the Ogres to this day sing songs of their initial victory over these twelve mighty beings, it is also true that when one of these gods fell, soon another arose from the earth to take his place.<br>
      The Ogres could do little against a foe eternal, and were eventually defeated, their armies forced to fall back through the portals that had brought them to that plane.<br>
      Hoards of earth elementals and flesh eating plants pursued them, even into Norrath and southern Antonica fell victim to the wrath of the Twelve Gods.<br>
      The empire fell, and the surviving Ogres lost both their knowledge and unity, and have dwelt ever since in small villages, warring between themselves over petty things, their former glory gone forever.<br>
      Rallos Zek looked down upon the Ogres, and in seeing their defeat grew angry.  And while he was lesser deity, he was still the god of war, and in his arrogance he too opened a portal to the Plane of Earth and led his forces to invade it.<br>
      An inconceivable battle ensued, one of which history says little other than the heavens themselves shook, and in the end even the Warlord was defeated by the Council of Rathe.<br>
      He and his minions were cast back into the Planes of influence, and the greater gods came together, creating a barrier such that no lesser god or creature could ever pass into the Planes of Power again.  They also saw fit to punish Rallos Zek for his treachery and arrogance.<br>
      The Ogres, being already dispersed and defeated, they chose to ignore.  But the Orcs and Giants, also of the Warlord's creation, were to feel their wrath.<br>
      The fate of the Orcs is almost totally known, for they are not a people to keep history, concerned only with the present.<br>
      But the Giants remember, for the greater gods came together and in their combined might brought an age of ice to the Northlands.  Their civilization fell swiftly.. their cities and holds crumbled in the cold, their crops and livestock froze and died.  Famine and chaos spread everywhere..  and the surviving giants boarded a vast armada of ships and sailed east and then south to escape the curse.  But the greater gods saw this too, and watched their escape, conferring with each other.<br>
      And when the fleet reached a point between Antonica and Kunark, they summoned a hurricane of unearthly power, with gales and waves greater than any sailor had ever seen.<br>
      Many ships were sunk, and over two thirds of the armada were  blown by the might winds into the shores of the nearby islands, to be dashed against the rocks and cliffs.<br>
      One third came ashore east of the Oasis of Marr, in the Desert of Ro, while the other landed in the Burning Wood, on the west coast of Kunark.<br>
      The remaining third of the Armada sailed on, praying that they had escaped.  But the Warlord could do nothing in their aid and Xegony, Queen of Air, drew wind to their sails and led them to the coast of Velious.<br>
      Where they landed short on supplies, and unable to sale further.  Thus the greater gods brought their final curse upon the Giants, for they had fled the Northlands to escape an age of winter, only to find themselves marooned on an entire continent of eternal ice and snow.<br>
      In desolation that was the Desert of Ro, many of the Giants died from heat and lack of water.  The few who survived became a wandering band of nomads, fiercely afraid of others, attacking anyone who would wander into their ever moving camps.<br>
      They are called the Sand Giants by those who have encountered them and lived to tell the tale.  Those who landed on Kunark became the Hill Giants and Mountain Giants, and were soon enslaved by the Lizard Men, rulers of the Iksarian Empire.<br>
      It wasn't until that empire fell that these giants became truly free again, able to begin anew.  The final group of giants, those who landed on Velious, became the Frost Giants and Storm Giants.<br>
      These were the mightiest in the armada, those who survived the great hurricane, and it was their anguish and pain as they were blown south through the waters that named the Ocean of Tears.<br>
      They eventually adapted to the cold, and began to rebuild a civilization in parts of Velious, always careful to stay clear of the Ice Dragons who also dwell there.  But whether Frost Giant, Sand, Mountain or Storm, they remember and they curse to this day, the greater gods, the rulers of the Planes of Power.<br>
      And that is the end of my little tale.<br>
