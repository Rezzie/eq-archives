Stonetooth. You can reach him by going into the mines invis, taking first
right, going down a ladder, then hopping over three sections of rail, then
entering a large room, taking a left, then a right. He's behind a large chunk
of crystals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Normon Stonetooth seems to ignore your greeting, peering at the stone in front
of him intently as if reading some invisible text. After a long while he sighs
deeply and says, 'Somethin I kin help ye with, whoever you are?' </span><span

Normon Stonetooth speaks as he continues staring at the stone, 'I mine. So they
call me a miner. Name's Normon, Normon Stonetooth, Normon the miner..,Did I say

Normon Stonetooth says 'Well I look fer Velium acourse. But ye know, I pull
very little of it out o the mundane rock these days. Sometimes I hear it
whisperin to me. The stone, the Velium, everything down here talks to each
other. If ye're lucky enough they tell ya secrets. That be why I listen more
these days than pull Velium. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Normon Stonetooth snickers and says, ' Now iffn I told ye that it wouldn't be a
secret no more now would it? No, I cant tell ya what they tells me, but I kin
help ya ta listen. But first ye'll need ta do me a favor heheh.' </span><span

Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahh, well me pick is a bit dull, don't cut like it

pick axe and and tell him Stonetooth sent ye. Then give it to him, wait fer him
ta sharpen it, an bring it back to me. Then I'll help ya ta listen to the
stone.' </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Hakon is in a
weapon shop near the bank in Thurgadim. Give Hakon the Pick Axe and &quot;a
small piece of velium&quot; (these are the stackable kind from Crystal Caverns,
dropped off orc miners).</span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

So place yer focus on the stones ye wish ta speak with and get yerself real
slow, both yer body an yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em.
An that's what's to it. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You receive
an item in return called a <a href="javascript:;"><span style='color:black'>Velium
Focus</span></a>. You then bring this Velium Focus item to Phenocryst, a named
geonid in Wakening Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves. You can hail him
and such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can tell. <i>It's
very important to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo
does not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro
the geonid. No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.</i></span><span

font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You say</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>, hail Phenocryst. <br>
Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if you are hearing your own
thoughts. 'We sense you are attempting communication with us but do not
understand what it is you are trying to convey. We are eager to know more.
Perhaps there is one who knows the language of the stone and will speak with
us' </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Hand
Phenocryst the Velium Focus. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Phenocryst speaks to you from within your
mind, 'You know the stone! This is wonderful! The fullfillment of the prophecy
is now one step closer. The most ancient of the stone tells us that one not of
stone will come forth and act as our harbringer of asscention. We believe you to
be our harbringer. Please help us!' </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You say</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>, 'how can I help you?'<br>
Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as conveys a sense of joy
empathically. 'It is said that the harbringer will find all of our people and
unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences and perhaps then
be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our asscention. We implore you
to find others like us and make them aware of us. You know the language of the
stone and can tell them. We await your return with proof that you have spoken
to them.&quot; </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Now you have
to go to Crystal Caverns. If you invis up and head down into the caverns,
you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area, then a tentacle terror and
spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone
out point. That long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the
same as the ones in Wakening Land. Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't
matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with
the following message: </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you
as anything of importance. You attempt to speak with the geonid through your
velium focus but all you are able to hear is the same though over and over..,
Eat. You have gained no knowledge from these creatures but you notice your
focus has been altered slightly.</span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>The
description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered. Take it back to
Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him. The following will happen:</span><span

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a
feeling of disappointment washes over you, 'It seems the others are not aware
of themselves yet. We are alone..So many questions yet we can find no answers.
We have been given a very special gift but without direction we are lost. We must
find who has made us aware of ourselves and why it has done so.' </span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You say to Phenocryst, &quot;Find what?&quot; <br>
Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to it. We must make
ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be constructed to amplify
our voice. The stones we will need are not found in this area though. We hear
whispers of stones far away that have the ability to channel and amplify our
thoughts. We ask you to gather these stones for us harbinger.&quot; </span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You say to Phenocryst, &quot;I will gather
these stones for you.&quot; <br>
Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you Harbinger. We need 3
crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron. These
minerals will only be found deep within the earth where the geology is relatively
stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right crystals. Return it to me
with the 3 crystals and we will construct our Menhir. Please hurry Harbinger,
our prophecy awaits. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Phenocryst
gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones. It's a magic, lore,
no drop Elbaite Focus <i>(picture needed)</i> that has 5 charges of Identify.
It looks like a fire emerald. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>The stibnite
crystal is found in The Great Divide. If you enter the wurm caves in the center
of that zone from the south, go up to the first right, go in and take the next
right, you'll be in a room with two spawn points for wurms and there's a patch
of blue crystal at the back of the room. The stibnite is behind the crystals
and looks like a bag on the floor. It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think. The
description of the item is &quot;<a href="javascript:;"><span style='color:
black'>Bent Metallic Crystal</span></a>&quot;. It weights 20.0, is magic, lore,
and no drop. When you identify it, it identifies as &quot;Stibnite for the
Menhir&quot;. To identify an item using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself,
pick up the item and right click it on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory. It
won't change the description of the item, it'll just tell you what it is in
your chat window. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>The Beryl 
    crystal is in Split Paw. Apparently, this crystal can spawn in a few different 
    places within Paw. The easiest one is found when you enter Split Paw and walk 
    just until you reach the first open room, it's in there on the floor at location 
    0,0 pretty much. It's not so much a room as it is an open patch in the hallway 
    with straw on the floor. Two gnolls spawn here on either side of the room. 
    The spawn time here is probably the same. The second place known for it to 
    spawn is behind onf of the stone pillars near the entrance of the underwater 
    tunnel leading to the Ishva area (+690, -17). The item is called a Reddish 
    Crystal and it's also magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 10.0. It identifies 
    as &quot;Beryl for the Menhir&quot;. </span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>The crystal 
    of purest iron is in Burning Woods. It's sitting on the bottom edge of the 
    crashed meteor near Slixin Klex. It's item description is &quot;<a href="javascript:;"><span
style='color:black'>Heavy Metallic Crystal</span></a>&quot; and is magic, lore, 
    and no drop. It weighs 14.0. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Take these
three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening Lands to Phenocryst and
you're ready for the next step. Get 1-2 parties of 50+ players and bring 'em
with you. Due to the dragon that spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon
portal, you might want to approach from skyshrine. If you're going along the
wall from skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the
second cave entrance along the wall. Phenocryst is closest to that entrance.
Get to know the path between you and him at this point so you're familiar with
how to get out in a hurry. At this point, all the geonids should con amiable to
you. Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this faction adjustment. Make
sure you have a ranger in your party of friends. You're going to have to track
down some triggered MOBs and fight them. You submit the items to Phenocryst. </span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills
your mind. 'We have always held our memories within the earth and stone but
only recently have we become aware of them. We do not know what happened or who
gave us this wonderful gift but we can now access those memories and are aware
of it's storage. With that knowledge has come questions and desires. When the
prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers and fulfill our desires.' </span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into
your mind again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a mark of
your friendship with us. Now we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the
stones speak.., There is a problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3
of them. They must not disturb us while we construct the Menhir! Please stop
them Harbinger! bring us proof of their distruction along with your Focus and
then we will begin the calling. Our asscention is at hand!'</span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You lose the
focus and the three crystals and in return gain another focus item with the
description &quot;Azurite Focus&quot;. It's a magic, lore, no drop item
weighing 0.5. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Now head
outside and start tracking. After a few minutes, two &quot;accolyte of
Zek&quot; giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a Bloodpriest
Loukond will show up on tracker as well. You'll have to run out and pull the
accolytes to you once you track them. If they are snared, they still run quite
fast. These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant. Make sure you
pull these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest. They get
attacked by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before
you can do the job. If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do.
After killing both accolytes, loot them. Each one has a medalion that has the
description, &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;, which is magic, no drop, and
weighs 2.0. After the accolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest.
Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand
outside it if nobody pulls it. After a minute of standing outside the cave, he
depops, which is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop first) then
the bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find him, the
accolytes might not). The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as magic
resistant. He drops a third and final medalion with the same description. You
must get all three medalions in order to for this part to prove fruitful. When
you kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek (worse),
Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better). The giants
never enter the caves to attack the geonids or anything. Everything will happen
outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either. The
Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant
who wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this
quest. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Now. Take
your Azurite Focus and the three medalions to Phenocryst. Submit them to
Phenocryst. </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Phenocryst 's thoughts become your own, a
feeling of joy overwhelms you, 'Because of you we can at last speak with our
maker. We were once given a gift, and we ask that you accept this gift from us
now so that we may come closer to that which we owe our sentience to. Now..,we
must construct the Menhir..' </span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>You lose the
Azurite Focus and medalions and get the following item in return, which is, it
seems, the reward for this quest.</span><span style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>Then then
geonids, led by Phenocryst, start walking around, through the halls and such.
When this happens, you see the following message: </span><span
style='color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

stones about you begin to resonate seemingly at its command. The Geonids all
begin moving, all to construct the Menhir.&quot; </span><span style='color:

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>I'm assuming
they get together at this point at make their <a href="javascript:;"><span

around to watch because we got some tar goo on us and that put a dampener on
things real quick. <i>It's very important to note that although geonids con
indifferent or amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a
geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid. No idea why this is, it doesn't
make any sense, but it's the case.</i> Also, enchanters can skip a huge chunk
of this quest by casting Collaboration on Phenocryst and starting from the
point where to say to him &quot;I will gather these stones for you&quot;. The
Velium Focus half gives you the faction to be able to tell that to Phenocryst. Provided
an enchanter MAKES him amiable, they don't have to bother with the first half.</span><span
