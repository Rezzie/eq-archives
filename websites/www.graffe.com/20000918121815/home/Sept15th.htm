          Well, here I sit at work.. plugging away at the site needing to go home. 

          But I really wanted to give you guys something to look at before I called

          lower spell and one for the higher. Follow the same guideline as the

          More roleplay news for Xegony and a shameless plug for my guild =)</p>

        <p>&quot;Greetings Norrath, <br>

          To my dismay, it was brought to my attention that a great artifact was 

          stolen from the Darkmoon treasury a few days ago. The culprit has turned 

          out to be none other than the barbarian Leber, a former slave to our 

          High Lord Graffe of Darkmoon. I say former because as of now he will 

          be hunted down and killed on sight. Word has reached us that the filthy 

          barbarian is holding our artifact in exchange for the release of his 

          two children, currently being held captive inside Neriak. For many years 

          Leber has served as a slave to Graffe, while the High Lord held the 

          children in a dungeon within the dark elf city. Now Leber believes he 

          may purchase his children's lives with the exchange of our artifact. 

        </p>

        <p>I am offering a grand reward for the safe return of Darkmoon's artifact. 

          The reward will be a pack full of various magic items that we have collected 

          over the years, plus some platinum. The hunt will start on <b>Sunday 

          at 9:00 am PST - 12:00 noon EST, September 19th</b>. This hunt will 

          be open to only the Dark Races (dark elves, trolls and ogres). Leber 

          has been known to be able to travel wide distances in just a short while, 

          so we assume that our search will take us all across the continent of 

          Antonica. The first of our evil brethren to find, duel, and slay the 

          heathen must bring back the artifact (a staff) to Nektulos and you will 

          be handsomely rewarded with riches of great power. Be forewarned, we 

          have information that Leber has sought out help from his pale skinned 

          allies, so this may require a coordinated search with your fellow brethren 

          of Innoruuk. Any and all that feel up to the challenge must meet in 

          Nektulos forest in front of the pyramid before the starting time of 

          the event so myself or High Lord Graffe may take your name. Any late 

          comers will be welcome to register their name with Darkmoon as long 

          as they start in Nektulos forest.</p>

        <p>I wish all the luck to my dark friends, may Innoruuk guide your steps. 

          <br>

          Keiote' Drak'Uben <br>

          Darkmoon Patriarch <br>

          (Xegony)</p>

        <p>(ooc/ the barbarian Leber is in his low teens, so it should be easy 

          enough for a low level player to best him in battle. The hard part will 

          be finding him. Leber will not be hiding in any so called "good" city 

          but he may travel from zone to zone. Only those that have given their 

          names to a Darkmoon rep in Nektulos may dual the filthy barbie)&quot;</p>

          A bit of roleplay news for the Rallos Zek Server was sent in...</p>

        <p>&quot;The Dark Race Bezerkers Event!<br>

          Hail the minions of Innoruuk, Rallos Zek, and Cazic Thule! We the perpetrators 

          of Hate cordially invite all fellow Teir'Dal, Trolls, and Ogres to spread 

          the Hate, War, and Fear out amongst the Light Dwelling races of Norrath 

          on the Rallos Zek server.... Starting at 1 pm (central Earth time) on 

          September 26th, a bezerker event will be held to spread the wrath of 

          THE dark gods amongst the light dwelling races. Teams of dark races 

          will be assembled by the Bashers before the start of the event. After 

          assembling our might in Innothule swamp, each contestant team will be 

          given charge to kill as many light-dwelling PLAYER CHARACTERS as possible 

          between Innothule Swamp and West FreePort. A referee will be assigned 

          to each group to tally kills. The team that has the most confirmed kills 

          will receive a hefty reward of 200 plat to be divided equally amongst 

          the winning team members. Looting of ye slain victims is also allowed 

          so the bounty received has the possibility to be much greater.<br>

          <br>

          If interested in attending, email the event coordinator at <a href="mailto:pawnofhate@hotmail.com">pawnofhate@hotmail.com</a> 

          for Rules of the Event. Due to the limited number of referees, preference 

          will be given to those who email early. Please provide your character 

          name. If you plan on organizing your own team then provide us with your 

          team members' names. Characters without team members will be assigned 

          one. Max number of members per team is 5 and max player level is 20.&quot;</p>

          There is a new server player event website that I suggest you go check 

          out. It's a bit bare now, but hopefully with your help, this page can 

          get off its feet and be a great resource for events! Here is a bit of 

          info that was sent in:</p>

        <p>&quot;I have started a new EverQuest related site. It is called EverQuests 

          and I would like it to be a repository for player run events. I will 

          have a page for each server with events for that server sorted by date. 

          Eventually, I would like to add search capabilities and the ability 

          for people to add their own events. Right now, all players would need 

          to do is send me email at <a href="mailto:arncota@everquests.com">arncota@everquests.com</a> 

          and I will add the event to my page.&quot;</p>

        <p align="center">So, if you are planning any events on your server, give 

          this guy a yell and help him out a bit.<br>

          Seems that the original poster of the &quot;Camp Banning&quot; to EQVault 

          had his wired crossed just a bit. You can read more on it over at EQVault, 

          but what Verant is doing is politely telling the high level players 

          that are camping a low level item, to move on if there is another lower 

          level group there that wishes to take the spawn. This is a far cry from 

          &quot;GMs are now warning High level people (40+) that are camping for 

          Jboots, that they are exploiting&quot;. The GM's will only step in and 

          ask the high level players to move on if they do not yield to a lower 

          level group that wishes the spawn. Now.. if you argue with the GM, you 

          bet your hiney you'll get a warning. =)</p>

        <hr noshade>

        <p>- 10:30am PST<br>

          I read on EQVault where somebody submitted info that Verant is warning 

          and banning high level players for camping lower level items such as 

          Journeyman Boots. I cracked up when I read this and I wanted to know 

          where this guy got his information. Don't beleive it at all. The only 

          way you can get a warning is if you blantantly kill steal and argue 

          with a GM. I was amazed that EQVault even posted that.. haha!</p>
