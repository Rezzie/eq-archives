      <p>Now, there is a lot of questioning going on about where it takes us. 
        I asked GZ but he couldn't confirm (with good reason.. I didn't expect 
        him to). My gut feeling tells me it is part of the Kunark expansion but 
        some think it is to somewhere near Permafrost. Time will tell and I will 
        be sure to inform you all.<br>

        WHAT: Festival <br>
        WHERE: Qeynos Hills on Tunare server <br>
        WHO: Abjurators Anoymous <br>
        WHEN: Friday, Feb 4, 2000 @ 6:00 PM Mountain Time (7PM Central, 8PM East, 
        5PM Pacific)</p>
      <p>Abjurators Anonymous is having their first ever guild festival in celebration 
        of their100 member mark! Here are a few events we plan to have... Find 
        the dead! Here are the rules... One unlucky character named Arcanine is 
        going to DIE in several places all over the Qeynos Hills Area. The members 
        who wish to play this game must pay 5pp to join, and come to the North 
        Qeynos Zone. Once everyone is in N. Qeynos, Arcanine will zone in and 
        give them all consent to loot his corpse. Everyone will zone into Qeynos 
        Hills and begin to run madly around looking for the corpses which will 
        be looted for prizes and money! (Kind of like an easter egg hunt, but 
        with human flesh instead of boiled egg) All members must be in the North 
        Qeynos zone to play, latecomers will most likely not be let in. If any 
        member zones before everyone has consent, it will be considered cheating 
        and they will be disqualified with no refunds, with possible risk of loss 
        of guild membership. Don't cheat. :) </p>
      <p>Lottery! The rules for the lottery are simple. To enter the lottery, 
        you must buy a "ticket" for 5pp. You can buy asmany tickets as you wish. 
        Each player who enters will be given a number for their ticket, and then 
        the ticketmaster will use the /random command. The grand prize winner 
        will receive a Staff of Writhing! The first prize will be a Flowing Black 
        Robe! The second prize will be 40% of the lottery money, and the third 
        prize will be 25% of the money! (You can't win twice, sorry.) </p>
      <p>Duels! Duels will be held in Qeynos Hills near the undead runes. Both 
        players will pay 'x'amount of pp to the referee (depending on how much 
        they have to spend). When both players accept the challenge, the duel 
        will begin. When the battle is over, the ref will give the victor his 
        money and his challengers money. (Challengers should generally be within 
        2 levels of each other) This event should last no more than an hour. </p>
      <p>Drunken Brawls! Drunken Brawls will be just a bit different. *grin* The 
        players will be given 5 or 6 of their favorite alcoholic beverages. Once 
        the players are good and drunk, the players will give some plat to the 
        ref. The battle will commence once both players shed their weapons into 
        their backpacks. The opponents will fight hand to hand with no ability 
        to cast spells. After the brawl has been fought, the victor will be given 
        their money, and also their opponents money. (Booze compliments of Ceenla 
        and Ibzen)</p>
      <p>Tailoring! Raw Silk will be made by Ibzen for all of those who need some 
        fairly good caster armor! Just bring him the spider (not spiderling) silk, 
        and he'll make you some fancy clothes to show off.</p>
      <p>Jewelry Making! Karshek, a jewelrer at (97), along with a couple other 
        jewelrers will be open to making jewelry for all those who need it. Just 
        supply the metal and gem, and he'll make you virtually any silver or electrum 
        jewelry you can think of! Might I recommend the Silver Rose Engangement 
        Rings, and Silver Jaded Rings. Jaded Electrum Bracers are also great.</p>
      <p>Language Trading! Know a language? Teach it to a friend.</p>
      <p>Wedding of Iueanea and Raianu! 2 of our newest members are currently 
        engaged, and they're historic marriage may be one of the guildevents at 
        this party! Good luck u2!</p>
      <p>There will be ALL these events and more! Some events may be subject to 
        slight change, but this is kind of the plan. :) See you on the 4th! Power 
        to the casters! <br>

        from Brad's mouth on chat:<br>
        <b>Aradune</b>: the kunark release date is April 24. that's a pretty darn 
        solid date</p>
      <p><b>Aanamdar</b>: Is there any possibility of getting to beta test the 
        expansion if your not on the test server?</p>
      <p><b>Aradune</b>: there will be a small, closed beta test for kunark<br>
        <b>Aradune</b>: that's all we really need in that it's still the same 
        game and all<br>
        <b>Aradune</b>: same mechanics<br>
        <b>Aradune</b>: we just need all the new zones tested<br>
        <b>Aradune</b>: the best way to get in the kunark beta is to be a helpful 
        player on the test server who we know and can trust<br>
        <b>Aradune</b>: someone who is really there to help us and not just play 
        on the least crowded server :)</p>
      <p><b>Byron</b>: Are we going to see moer big monsters like the sea serpent 
        and the giant shark..maybe a roc? ..we need some mroe to keep us busy.. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Aradune</b>: yes<br>

        Not much for us in this patch except the loss of levitation in the Plane 
        of Sky. Here's that partial message:<br>
        <b>The Plane of Sky </b><br>
        All spells that grant levitation will no longer function in the Plane 
        of Sky. This affects spells cast by Wizards, Enchanters, Shamans, Druids, 
        Necromancers, and Bards. The Plane of Sky is designed to be completed 
        in certain fashion, and the existence of these spells allowed the islands 
        to be completed out-of-order. <br>
        A teleporter will be placed on the first island in the next patch to allow 
        people access to the room below.<br>

        <i>&quot;There was a GM event in CB on Innoruuk Tuesday night, and I was 
        summoned by the gods to BB, oh well.<br>
        I was in CB to visit friends and whooped a couple of Orcs who were killing 
        folks. Then 3 super-orcs appeared, acting strangely. Not having been in 
        CB in some time, I assumed they were just rare. Wrong. Their names were 
        DaBasher, DeBasher and MeBasher.<br>
        I hit 1 and was attacked by Crush and Royal Guards. LOL at least I got 
        to kill Crush (no tunic).<br>
        After medding up, healing, and listening to the 3 Orcs shout for all non-Orcs 
        to flee or die, I was invited to help some old Druid friends kick their 
        Orc behinds (No I have not been Power-Leveling, I just play WAY too much 
        - 19 days playing in the 70 calendar days I have had the game). We attacked 
        these Orcs (I did not con them, everything in there should be green to 
        me). I kept casting Leatherskin to reduce interrupts, nuked away and we 
        had one almost dead. Suddenly I was zoning, with an almost-full health 
        bar! LOL I thought I was dying and lagged. <br>
        Anyhow, I popped up in BB with a message on my screen that said "You Have 
        Been Summoned By The Gods!" And there was a LVL 50 standing there, (not 
        tagged as a GM) who I recognized as a GM, nevertheless.<br>
        It was cool being summoned, but I still would have rather they just gave 
        me a tell to quit it and let them play, at least I could have watched. 
        The 2 druids whooped them all anyway. :)<font size="1">&quot;</font></i><font size="1"><br>

        Chron X announces Expansion Set 4, "Whiteout". Check it out at <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/chronx" target="_blank">http://www.station.sony.com/chronx</a><br>
        - Whiteout includes 74 new cards which fully compliment the latest battleground, 
        "Antarctica". Whiteout introduces a new keyword, "Arctic", on some assets. 
        These assets, like the existing Mawson assets, do not suffer from the 
        usual penalties associated with the Antarctica map - they do not take 
        damage if unprotected by a base and they do not have their firepower reduced. 
        Arctic assets are more expensive to move, but a whole range of decks specialized 
        to the Antarctica map can be built around these assets. With their immunity 
        to cold, they will be able to survive in an enemy's Headquarters city, 
        where a non-Arctic defender will not have the firepower to dislodge them. 
        Because of their higher movement costs, Arctic assets are less likely 
        to be seen on other maps, with one exception. Whiteout introduces the 
        Freak Blizzard intervention. With this in play, anyone can create "blizzard" 
        conditions in any city on any map. The result is the same as a city on 
        the Antarctica map. Imagine the enemy's surprise when his assets suddenly 
        start freezing to death in the Pacific!<br>
        - Whiteout also introduces a powerful new enhancement, "Double Agent". 
        Double Agent can be used on your own assets to untap them. It's the only 
        non-program that can do so, but you run the risk of the card being used 
        against you next turn.<br>
        - Take advantage of the new Player Referral program to get FREE cards! 
        For every registered player you refer you receive a FREE 15-card Booster 
        Pack from Chron X.<br>

      <b>Player</b>: I have an SB Live with the latest drivers. Luckily the crashes 
      have stopped but I've noticed a difference in the 3D effects. I noticed 
      my rear speakers are a lot more active. If someone casts a spell behind 
      me only the rear speakers emit the sound. Before you could still here it 
      in the front speakers. Also the ambient sounds are louder. Anyone else notice 
      this? This may be why some people do not hear wolf howls anymore...perhaps 
      they don't have rear speakers? I still hear the wolves. 
      <p align="left"><b>Brad</b>: Actually, that was our original plan. We were 
        working with Creative on using SB Live cards much more effectively, but 
        some code was checked in prematurely and we got some crash bugs :( Our 
        goal was (and is) to use the four speaker sound more effectively, use 
        reverb in caves and such, etc. - Brad<br>

        It's seems that the website that hosts www.keithparkinson.com has been 
        shut down. I'm not sure if it is from the extra strain I may have caused 
        with the link in Saturday's news (I sure hope not and that is somewhat 
        doubtful). I have been a fan of his artwork long before Everquest came 
        around so I know the URL is correct. Give it a few days and try again 
        if you wished to view his site and artwork.<br>

        Well, just as I said in the news a few days ago<font size="1">,</font> 
        <i>&quot;I only pray whatever tweaks they did to the code do not get erased 
        with the next patch&quot;</i>, looks like it happened. What started to 
        be the best sounding experience in my Norrathian life, is now driving 
        me batty. It seems that the sound realism cannot be adjusted and is stuck 
        on full throttle. Get next to the ocean and it sounds like the high-school 
        bully just flushed your head in the toilet.. run through West Commonlands 
        and it sounds like you have a parrot and 1000 crickets in your front pocket. 
        I'll poke around and see if the boys and girls at Verant are working on 
        a solution.<font size="1"> <br>
