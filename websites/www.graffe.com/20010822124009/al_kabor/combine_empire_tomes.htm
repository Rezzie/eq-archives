      <div align="center"><b>Combine Empire Tomes</b> 
        <p align="left">It has been a while since I have written these journals; 
          however, recent findings have urged me to make note of research of the 
          utmost importance. Where to begin&#133; </p>
        <p align="left">Months ago, I traveled to the continent of Kunark with 
          Firiona Vie and her companions. When she spoke of traveling to this 
          land to confront the Ring of Scale about memories that were taken from 
          her, I must admit (only to myself of course) that I hesitated in offering 
          to join with her and the others. The Ring of Scale obviously has a great 
          deal of power and influence. In spite of my misgivings, though, I decided 
          to travel along with them. If somehow the Ring of Scale somehow cleared 
          memories of great powers I once had, it would be of great importance 
          for me to retrieve said power.</p>
        <p align="left">Upon setting foot onto Kunark, an Iksar shaman named Danak 
          Dhorentath, assuring Firiona that he would assist her, offered the use 
          of his special portal. Within a few moments, and with serpentine speed, 
          Danak Dhorentath grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm. Taking her by surprise, 
          he pulled her into the gate which disappeared with a hiss, leaving nothing 
          more than the smell of ozone hanging in the air.</p>
        <p align="left">In the months following Firiona Vie's kidnapping, I remained 
          on Kunark researching the Iksar and seeking clues to her whereabouts. 
          The continent is covered with decrepit remnants of what were obviously 
          once grand, architecturally sound monuments of the Sebilisan Empire.</p>
        <p align="left">Venturing through what is known as the Burning Woods, 
          I happened across a city that rests high up on the mountainside. I later 
          found out that this was Chardok, the city of the Sarnak. It was dangerous 
          to enter, but I managed to remain hidden and make my way through the 
          tunnels and burrows to find an archival library that most likely belonged 
          to the inhabitants. Judging by the bits and pieces of tomes I found 
          here, the Sarnak have been studying the Iksarian magical powers.</p>
        <p align="left">As I explored further, I found quite a few unique looking 
          tomes that were sealed with some form of magic. The covers of these 
          ancient tomes were inscribed with a symbol that belonged to the Combine 
          Empire. It appeared obvious that these tomes hadn't been opened for 
          at least two to three hundreds of years. In order to study these tomes 
          further, I decided to quietly bring them back to my laboratory in Erudin.</p>
        <p align="left">When I returned to my laboratory, I managed to decipher 
          some of the symbols on the bindings. By repeating a series of phrases 
          and casting cancel magic on a few of these tomes, I managed to open 
          them. There are still some that I cannot open.</p>
        <p align="left">These ancient tomes are written in a multitude of different 
          languages. To my dismay, some of these ancient tomes were inscribed 
          in a language even I could not decipher. There are several different 
          sketches throughout the tomes. These sketches include symbols, creatures, 
          maps and charts of the Combine Empire.</p>
        <p align="left">From what I could understand of these tomes so far, there 
          appear to be unknown magical powers that are waiting to be unleashed. 
          Magical scrolls, which contain the key to these powers, have been hidden 
          all across Norrath. There are many cities from the past that lie in 
          ruins now and are hidden in the depths of the planet. One of the tomes 
          directed me toward both the City of Mist and the Crypt of Dalnir. With 
          the assistance of others, I journeyed to these locations and obtained 
          a few scrolls which I immediately brought back to my laboratory. </p>
        <p align="left">In order to determine what magical powers they possessed, 
          I knew that I must gain more knowledge about the language in which they 
          were written. It was imperative that I delve into the depths of the 
          unknown in order to find more documents that would enable me to further 
          this research.</p>
        <p align="left">A couple of months ago, Sorko Talvazon, one of my research 
          assistants, happened across the ruins of the ancient city Kaesora. He 
          found an ancient library there that contained many old books and scrolls. 
          Before he could get a closer look at the documents, the ghostly inhabitants 
          almost killed him. He had to quickly gate away in order to survive. 
          He brought this information back to me, his mentor, hoping it would 
          aid me with my research.</p>
        <p align="left">Sorko, despite his usual incompetence, created a map of 
          his journey to this city. We met up in the Overthere as he gathered 
          additional support. To save time, we gave each of those strong enough 
          to assist us a potion of the Field of Bone which, when drunk, teleported 
          us to a location directly in front of the ruined city of Kaesora's entrance.</p>
        <p align="left">Once in the city, Sorko Talvazon led us through the many 
          drops and turns of this undead infested dwelling. The sight of the library 
          amazed me. Its tall pillars stood gloriously along the marbled walls. 
          Inside, there were many books; most were not legible, but I'm sure I 
          will find quite a few of them useful as I continue my research.</p>
        <p align="left">As I went upstairs to the balcony, I came across a couple 
          of tomes that had the symbol of the Combine Empire on the front. All 
          but one of these tomes were sealed with magical powers similar to those 
          which sealed the ones I found in Chardok a few months past. As I flipped 
          through the pages of the opened tome, I noticed yet another symbol that 
          I recognized from the tomes that were back in my laboratory. As I studied 
          this symbol in connection with the other symbols surrounding it, I discovered 
          that it was a reference to the magical powers of teleportation. It would 
          appear to be possible for a skilled wizard to teleport its target to 
          another location without going through the bother of traveling there 
          himself. I immediately brought this tome, and the others, back to my 
          laboratory.</p>
        <p align="left">My research continues&#133;</p>
