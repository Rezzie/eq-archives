        <p align="left">Here is a guide on how you can raise your baking skill 
          quickly and cheaply. Be warned that this can get boring and you won't 
          make any interesting food. This guide is really only usable by Good 
          Races unless for some reason you have faction with Erudite vendors and 
          High Elf vendors. There are probably other vendors for Evil Races but 
          I do not know of them. Another way to get around this problem is to 
          have an alternate buy the items and transfer them to your character.</p>
        <p align="left"></p>
        <p align="left">The key to raising your baking skill is fish rolls. Fish 
          Rolls will take you all the way to become a master cook for the <a href="../quests/duties_for_the_crown/index.htm">Shawl 
          Quests</a>. When making fish rolls, you must combine one fresh fish 
          with one batwing. The stacks of batwings are purchasable from a vendor 
          in a small shack in East Commons. If you zone into East Commons from 
          the road in West Commons, and look directly to your left, there will 
          be a group of small houses. Walk towards these houses and the single 
          one on the right has an Erudite vendor that sells stacks of batwings. 
          I suggest buying as many of these except for one slot of your inventory. 
          This should be at least 250-300 batwings. Next, teleport to Greater 
          Faydark and run to Felwithe. Head towards the South Felwithe zone, but 
          right before you zone in, there is a small Bait shop with a nice lady 
          that sells fresh fish. Buy as many of these as you can. Then, to the 
          right of this shop, behind a femal jewelry NPC, is an oven. In this 
          oven, combine your fresh fish with batwings, 1 by 1. When you run out 
          of fresh fish, continue to restock them at the baits shop. And when 
          you run out of batwings, just run back to the Erudite vendor that sells 
          them. Doing this repeatedly will bring your baking skill all the way 
          up to 135, but you can stop at 122 if you are just doing the <a href="../quests/duties_for_the_crown/index.htm">Shawl
