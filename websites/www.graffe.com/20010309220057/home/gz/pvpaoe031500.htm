        <hr noshade>
        <p> If you don't play on the PVP servers and don't understand where this 
          is going, I'll explain it here: 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Picture a nice day in the bottom of Guk. Your group's tank runs out 
            to bring back something to kill. Upon his return with the one Dar 
            Ghoul Knight, the room spawns as well. Now you have 4 mobs instead 
            of one. Those of us on the non-PVP servers, would probably fire off 
            an AoE upon the mob that the tank is fighting and then watch the surrounding 
            mobs writhe in pain as their HP gets pulled from them. Well, this 
            isn't the same scenario for PVP players. If they are to cast an AoE, 
            everything in the AoE's radius takes damage.. including players. Because 
            of this, it is not too wise to use your AoE's.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now I spoke to Geoffrey Zatkin again concerning this subject and here 
          is some of what he said:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><b>GZ: it has always been that way - in the same way that a caster 
            can hit themself with their own AoE. Because AoE's are more deadly 
            on PvP servers, they are more deadly to everybody.</b></p>
          <p>Graffe: So no change in the future then? Not even to exclude just 
            your party members?</p>
          <p><b>GZ: AoE spells were balanced damage wise vs. NPC's. NPC's have 
            more hp (by far) then PC's. Beings able to nuke with impunity all 
            hostile pc's but not your own people, especially if they are all close 
            together, would be very, very unbalanced.</b></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now with our true damage being in certain AoE's, this is a downside 
          to playing on the PVP servers if you do not play there to do combat 
          with others. There are a few ways this <i>could</i> be resolved but 
          it would be up to Verant and the players on the PVP servers. One, make 
          AoE spells to be effective to mob's only (much like Fear and Charm now). 
          Two, reduce the damage AoE's do to player characters (much like root 
          has been nerfed on pc's). Keep in mind that not everyone on the PVP 
          servers would want this to happen. Some play there to do battle and 
          player kill, others play there to adventure with the risk of player 
          killing.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><b>GZ: One of the problems is that *if* we change anything, we will 
            have unhappy players. Lowering damage on AoE's will make unhappy wizards. 
            Making AoE's not wax your own party will make Wizards too powerful 
            in PvP - unhappy players again. This is an issue where no matter what 
            we chance, we will have unhappy players. In a situation like this, 
            we will stick to the original design of the game.</b></p>
          <p>Graffe: I totally understand that point. I just keep going round 
            and round trying to find a viable way to allow PVP'ers a way to use 
            them. I use them, and with thier flaws, I still love them if they 
            are used at the right time.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Geoffrey had a suggestion to help, but not solve, the issue and it's 
          a fairly simple one.
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left"> 
          <p><b>GZ: tell them not to have their buddies stand there - or to, if 
            they are going to use fire AoE (as an example) in combat, to make 
            sure their buddies are immune to fire. </b></p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div align="left">After looking all of this over, I had to think about something. 
        This is also the way it is on the regular servers if you choose to go 
        PVP by visiting the Priest of Discord. Or, picture your guild heading 
        out to 'The Arena' (granted there is no mobs there) to do battle with 
        another guild. If everyone is up on the battle platform duking it out 
        and a wizard casts an AoE, it is going to hit <i>everyone</i>, including 
        his guildmates and party members. I doubt that is any consolation to the 
        wizards on the PVP servers, but I just wanted to you to know that it can 
        happen on the regular servers if you choose to go PVP.</div>
