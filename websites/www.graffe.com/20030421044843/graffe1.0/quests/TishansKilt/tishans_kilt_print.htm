<p>This quest is given by Vilissia within the Temple of Solusek Ro. If you ask 
  her about the Tishan's Kilt, she will tell you this -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Vilissia says</b> 'Tishan was once counted among the mightiest of wizards 
    – and his items are items of power. If you are interested in acquiring Tishan's 
    Kilt, you must take a Shadowed Ball from our mortal enemies the Shadowed Men 
    and bring it to Trankia in the Everfrost Mountains.</p>
</blockquote>
  
<hr noshade>
<p>There is more to this quest than meets the eye. You will learn this if you 
  make it to Trankia within the Everfrost Mountains. If you wish to know the complete 
  spoiler for the quest, click below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="../../armor/legs/tishans_kilt.jpg" width="310" height="125"></p>

<p align="center"><a href="#popdown" onClick="MM_showHideLayers('spoiler','','show');MM_showHideLayers('document.layers[\'riddle\']','document.all[\'riddle\']','hide')"><img src="spoiler.gif" width="130" height="27" border="0"></a></p>

<p>This quest begins at Vilissia in the Temple of Solusek Ro. She only lets you 
  know to bring a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('shadowed_ball.jpg','shadowedball','width=330,height=145')">shadowed 
  ball</a> to Trankia (one of the two barbarian females next to Sulgar of Ice 
  Comet fame) in Everfrost (loc is about +3030 by -2395). This item is rare but 
  you can try the following method to help your chances of making the shadowed 
  ball drop. <i>(remember that all shadowmen items are NO RENT, which means they 
  will dissapear if you log off) -</i></p>
<ol>
  <li> Find a Shadowed Man carrying something that looks like a Shimmering Orb.<br>
  </li>
  <li>If they do not agro you, proceed to step 3... if they do agro you find a 
    druid or ranger to Harmony them.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Give the Shadowed Man 2 weapons (rusty/shadowed/fine steel - anything works).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Shadowed Man will now equip both weapons thus forcing the &quot;orb&quot; 
    (which is really the Shadowed Ball) into his inventory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Kill the Shadowed Man and he should drop the Shadowed Ball.</li>
</ol>
<p>Giving Trankia the shadowed ball will result in her talking to you - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Trankia says</b> 'You must be another one from Vilissia. I will tell you 
    what I tell all the others – you must help be [avenge] my [brother] before 
    I will help you attain Tishan's Kilt. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, she gives you your first of two <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('tattered_note.jpg','tatterednote','width=330,height=145')">notes</a> 
  as well, basically it says a reminder of your deed.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>You say</b>, 'How can I avenge your brother ?'</p>
  <p><b>Trankia says</b> 'My brother was part of a raiding party that adventured 
    into the Caverns of Guk. Somewhere within he was betrayed and left for dead 
    by the dastardly brother of Karg IceBear – Martar. I want you to find me what 
    remains of my brothers body and bring it back to me. I am told that he died 
    within a mine shaft. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mine shaft is more a section of Upper Guk that is a little like a maze. 
  The exact location of the mob you are looking for is +1420 by +340, a Froglok 
  called a Shinta Warrior (no, not Shin, Shinta). There are two other Froglok 
  warriors next to him who will aggro to you as well. The Shinta seems to always 
  drop a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('barbarian_head.jpg','barbarianhead','width=330,height=145')">barbarian 
  head</a>.</p>
<p>After you give the head to Trankia -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><b>Trankia says</b> 'Oh Wulfthan, look what has become of you. I told you 
    that you should not have trusted Martar. <name>- as a final service, I want 
    you to kill Martar IceBear for me. He is known to roam these parts. Bring 
    me the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('warthread_kilt.jpg','warthreadkilt','width=330,height=145')">Warthread 
    Kilt</a> that he wears and my two reminder notes, and I will give to you Markars 
    Kilt. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You get your second note at this point in time as well.</p>
<p>I hired a local ranger to help me find Martar Icebear, who seemed to spawn 
  near the frozen river. I finally caught up with him within sight of the Permafrost 
  entrance. Martar conned blue to me at level 41, and took about 900 points to 
  kill. As a bonus, since he is from the Icebear clan, he dropped a Cloak of the 
  Icebear as well as the kilt!</p>
<p>Now take the kilt, and the two notes you previously obtained to Trankia, and 
  she will give you Tishan's kilt.</p>
