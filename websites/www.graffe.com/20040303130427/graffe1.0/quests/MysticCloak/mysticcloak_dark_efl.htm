      <p>You need to get 3 clay balls from Cazic Thule upon the Clay Golem found 
        wandering within the maze (<a href="../../maps/_cazic_thule_maze.jpg" target="_blank">see 
        this map of the maze</a>). Each ball will turn you into a earth elemental 
        which has high faction with ALL high elves EXCEPT the guards. So basically, 
        you can talk to any High Elf or Erudian you want, just don't let a guard 
        see you. Even if you have a decent faction with the guards, changing into 
        the earth elemental will make them scowl at you. BE CAREFUL!</p>
      <p>Goto Felwithe and find Tolkar Parlone, he is the fisherman near the water. 
        One guard roams from the water to the town (10 min roam), just stay invisible 
        until he walks off. Use one clay ball and morph into an earth elemental. 
        Walk over to Tolkar, give him the letter and gate out. </p>
      <p>Go to Erudin, this part is tricky, find Trilani in the Enchanter Guild. 
        There is one guard that walks from right in front of her to the upstairs 
        (5min roam). Find the safe spot, which is located on the stairs to her 
        room and morph into the earth elemental. When the guard leaves for the 
        3rd floor, run over and get your cloak. Return to the lower staircase 
        and zone out.</p>
