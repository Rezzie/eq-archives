       1/1. You will learn skills much quicker with a high intelligence level compared 
       to someone with low intelligence. Intelligence also reduces the chance of 
       spell fizzles. Intelligence over 75 reduces fizzle rate by 1% for each point 
       over 75. Minimum is 5%. [from GZ]</td>

         <p>In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided 
           to provide them with general information as to what the stats do. I'm 
           going to post them here. </p>
         <p>This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them 
           or release more info. We changed our minds.</p>
         <p>That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true 
           that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than 
           others. </p>
         <p>We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations 
           have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in 
           debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that 
           it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better 
           attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something 
           as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for 
           more than a year.</p>
