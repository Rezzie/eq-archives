(loving referred to by some as &quot;Money for Nothing.&quot; )<br />
<br />
Regional Trade is the primary money-making activity for the Diplomat who doesn't mind a little travel. It consists of three phases, which must be completed in order to make a profit:<br />
<br />
1) Bring up the Wholesaler trader in a city using Civic Diplomacy. Buy the commodity offered by the city.<br />
2) Determine where the commodity is being purchased. Travel there.<br />
3) Bring up the Demand trader in the destination city using Civic Diplomacy. Sell the commodity you are carrying.<br />
<br />
While easy in concept, the process of becoming a successful regional trader requires an initial outlay of coin, a time commitment to get started, and the determination to connect the dots in a three continent-spanning trade web on several different levels.<br />
<br />
This teaser assumes you understand the concepts behind Civic Diplomacy. If you haven't read &quot;Changing the World: Civic Diplomacy and You&quot;, I would suggest you do that now!<br />
<br />
The Commodities<br />
<br />
There are three types of commodities offered in the Regional Trade system: White Market, Gray Market, and Black Market.<br />
<br />
White Market commodities are purely legal and easy to obtain. Gray Market commodities are difficult to obtain, and subject to taxation if you are caught with them in your inventory! Black Market commodities are highly illegal, and carry immediate monetary and faction penalties if you are caught with them. Guards are always on the look out for goods from the Black Market!<br />
<br />
The White Market<br />
<br />
White Market commodities are produced by every city without any practical limit. They are salable on any other continent. The White Market is the least profitable, but the easiest to play and not subject to interference from other players.<br />
<br />
The White Market trader appears when a threshold is reached in the Civic Diplomacy choice of &quot;Trade Routes&quot; (Gossip, Merchant). The Presence requirement to be able to discuss Trade Routes with Merchants can be acheived entirely by purchasing clothing from clothing vendors around the world, and being able to engage in Civic Diplomacy.<br />
<br />
The White Market is completely legal. Commodities are freely available at every city and continue to be available until the threshold is reached to despawn the White Market trader. There is no limit to how much of a commodity you can buy from a White Market trader.<br />
<br />
The White Market, unlike the Gray and Black Markets, use the same NPC for both buying and selling. You can sell Hagpearls in Bordinar's Cleft and buy up Widow's Lace from the same NPC to go trade elsewhere.<br />
<br />
White Market commodities, like all regional trade commodities, are heavy, and care must be taken to ensure you don't greedily overburden yourself!<br />
<br />
Some example White Market commodities are: Widow's Lace (Bordinar's Cleft), Hagpearls (Khal), Umbral Jade (Caial Brael), and Soul Candles (Hathor Zhi).<br />
<br />
Example of White Market gameplay:<br />
<br />
You decide to engage in some Regional Trade for your night's activities, so you put on your Merchant Presence clothing. You go up to merchant citizens of Khal and engage them in Civic Diplomacy on the subject of &quot;Trade Routes.&quot; Garnering the help of others, you quickly pull the lever of Trade Routes to a high number, spawning the Wholesaler for the White Market.<br />
<br />
Buying up a large amount of Hagpearls, you know that you cannot sell them anywhere on Qalia, but you CAN sell them on Kojan or Thestra. Spying the ferry to Thestra, you hop on, and are deposited in Konarthi Point - a quick run to Dahknarg.<br />
<br />
In Dahknarg, you begin speaking with the merchants again about &quot;Trade Routes,&quot; and quickly get the Wholesaler for the city spawned there. Selling your Hagpearls, you take that profit and buy up Moontotems, the White Market commodity for Dahknarg. Now, your only decision is whether to head back to Qalia, or journey to Kojan!<br />
<br />
The Gray Market<br />
<br />
The Gray Market ratchets up the difficulty level several notches. Gray Market commodities are not illegal - they are just subject to taxation! You won't get in trouble for carrying these highly sought after goods, but you may find it uncomfortable for your coinpurse.<br />
<br />
Gray Market commodities are only valuable in two cities in the entire game world. Each commodity is also more valuable than the White Market, but carries with it the added challenge of being valueless just about everywhere.<br />
<br />
The Gray Market traders also have a limited supply - and demand a limited amount as well. Each trader has a capacity to buy or sell 200 of its preferred product, then leaves! While the trader will come back if the lever is still set for it in Civic Diplomacy, he will appear in a new location and be limited again to 200 purchases or sales.<br />
<br />
Gray Market traders also despawn naturally when their Civic Diplomacy lever drops below the threshold that allows them to appear.<br />
<br />
There are two Gray Market traders in a city. One is a Wholesaler that sells Gray Market goods, and one is a Demand buyer who purchases the specific goods demanded by the city.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for would-be trade magnates, only one Gray Market trader can be up in a city at a time - either the Demand buyer or the Wholesaler. They are on opposed levers in Civic Diplomacy! Thus, if some players are trying to sell gray market goods in a city, and another group of players are trying to buy gray market goods in a city, they will hinder each other.<br />
<br />
In order to spawn the Gray Market Wholesaler, you must do the Merchant Entertain called &quot;New Products.&quot; In order to spawn the Gray Market Demand buyer, you preform the Merchant Interview &quot;New Markets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, there is a way to increase the buying and selling capacity of an individual Wholesaler or Demand buyer. The Merchant Incite &quot;Market Shift&quot; will increase the amount the Wholesaler can sell, and the Merchant Convince &quot;Open the Coffers&quot; will increase the amount the Demand trader will buy.<br />
<br />
To recap the challenges with Gray Market trading:<br />
<br />
1) The levers to spawn the buyer and seller NPCs are opposed.<br />
2) The commodities you buy can only be sold in two cities on Thestra.<br />
3) You have to figure out for yourself where things are bought and sold.<br />
4) The buyer and seller have limited capacities to buy and sell.<br />
<br />
The good news here is this: there are two &quot;trade routes&quot; in the game, in which you can travel from one city to another in the Gray Market without pausing. We have dubbed these the &quot;Spice Road&quot; and the &quot;Silk Road.&quot; Learning either of these routes will allow you to more quickly travel the continents selling and buying and profiting!<br />
<br />
Some example Gray Market commodities are: Firekisses, Solemnithrans, Fogroot, Kojani Poetry, and of course, Goblin Sauce.<br />
<br />
The Black Market<br />
<br />
For many players the ultimate test of their trading skill, the Telonian Black Market is a shadowy organization that is rumored to use paths hidden under the very continents to move their vile product.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake - the player who engages in the Black Market is not leaving any doubts about their moral compass when they are caught carrying these evil products. Instruments of pain, strange foods and drink, literature to make a Necromancer's hair curl - all of these are available from the shadowy figures who ply this trade.<br />
<br />
The Black Market is both profitable and dangerous. Random inspections by guards will earn you large faction penalties and cash fines. Some creatures that normally would ignore you will find the product you carry angering and may result in attack.<br />
<br />
The Black Market will not be put in in the first passes of Regional Trade. Like all good things, it must stew a while while the pieces are put into place to make it work perfectly.<br />
<br />
Black Market goods are only demanded in one city per item. The city contains a single NPC who will purchase these products. This NPC is not spawned through standard Civic Diplomacy but by a secret method only those accepted by the Black Market reveal.<br />
<br />
Some example Black Market goods are Slaughterpets, Psychic Jelly, Dreamlotus, Assassin Shades, Sunscorchers, and Soulcoal.<br />
<br />
Regional Trade is a ways away, and while the Gray and White markets will be in for Beta 3, the Black Market will not be in the game until late Beta 4 or post launch.<br />
<br />

Wow, that just screams cockblock.<br />

<br />
Just like AA. Excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jadrax</div><div class="date">October 12th, 2006, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in essence adding an elite style trading system sounds cool, especially wth random guard searches and stuff.<br />
<br />
Problem is its tied to the really deplomacy system, which seems at a casual glance rather crap. ;o/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delores Mulva</div><div class="date">October 12th, 2006, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They had to add some way for people progressing through Diplomacy to get money, and this seems like a fair in-theme way to do it. I'm pleased to see that thought has been put into making Diplomacy completely self-sufficient, since many other games have made alternate styles of play (like tradeskilling) depend completely on PvE progress. My concern, just like the last thread, comes in this description of the process:<br />
<br />
<br />
You decide to engage in some Regional Trade for your night's activities, so you put on your Merchant Presence clothing. You go up to merchant citizens of Khal and engage them in Civic Diplomacy on the subject of &quot;Trade Routes.&quot; Garnering the help of others<br />
<br />
...&quot;Garnering the help of others&quot;. So even the White Market, the easiest market to play, requires the aid of others to get the appropriate NPCs spawned, and if the trade lever is like the other city levers then other diplomats working on other things could block it (or conversely the trade types could block other stuff in the city). But like all contested content, I'm sure those diplomats will appreciate their accomplishments all the more when they finally spawn the basic White Market NPC! Perhaps they'll put updates on their guild web sites - &quot;The haters said we couldn't do it, but MERCHANT AKBAR SPAWNED BITCHES!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxyn</div><div class="date">October 12th, 2006, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They had to add some way for people progressing through Diplomacy to get money, and this seems like a fair in-theme way to do it.<br />
Except that it's based on limited supplies of goods, and assumes cooperation with other players to even get the vendors to spawn.<br />
A much bigger PITA/cockblock design than killing monsters and doing quests.<br />
Any word on Diplomacy quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delores Mulva</div><div class="date">October 13th, 2006, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The White Market, as described, has no limits on supplies of goods other than the despawn time for the vendor. I agree that the &quot;cooperation required for basic game function&quot; part stinks, but forced grouping is part of the McQuaid paradigm and I'm not surprised to see it here too.</div></div><hr />
