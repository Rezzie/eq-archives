      <p align="left">The Combine Empire uncovered a vast amount of ancient magical 
        powers. As I read through the tomes and manuscripts that I found amongst 
        what were left of great structures upon Kunark, I managed to translate 
        many of the encrypted symbols. The ancient tome that I found hidden in 
        the lost city of Kaesora provided me with the key to deciphering many 
        of the other tomes.</p>
      <p align="left">With a great expenditure of magic power, a wizard can send 
        his target to a location without needing to travel there himself. Sorko 
        Talvazon and I have experimented with various semantics and incantations 
        with mixtures of different components. We've managed to reproduce this 
        translocation effect for some of the spells but there are still quite 
        a few we cannot repeat. Some begin to cast but suddenly stop as if something 
        is missing from the formula.</p>
      <p align="left">These experiments must continue, however, I cannot afford 
        to waste any more time with them. I must press on with my research. I 
        have asked Sorko Talvazon to deliver a few experimental scrolls to one 
        of my former assistants, Terblyn Zelbus. The foolish gnome wasn't much 
        of a help to my research, but I believe he should be capable enough to 
        distribute the scrolls to the younger wizards.</p>
      <p align="left">I have sent Terblyn the scrolls for the spells that seem 
        to be the most stable at the moment - North Karana, Greater Faydark, Toxxulia 
        Forest, and one for the Combine structures in the Dreadlands. While the 
        younger wizards experiment with the first group of translocation spells, 
        my assistant and I shall steadily work on deciphering the some of the 
        other readings.</p>
      <p align="left">I am one with great knowledge - One who can read and speak 
        any language existing across Norrath and yet&#133; I cannot translate 
        the mysterious language that is used in some of these tomes.</p>
      <p align="left">While trying to decipher one of the tomes, I happened across 
        some notes on the side of one of the pages. Scribbled in the Combine language, 
        this finding appears to have nothing to do with translocation. Though 
        incomplete, it does make reference to a very potent spell being powered 
        by components from icy lands. I must not disclose this new information 
        to my assistant.</p>
      <p align="left">My research continues...</p>
