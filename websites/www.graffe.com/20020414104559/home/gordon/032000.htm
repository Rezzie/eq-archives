        <p><b>Hello all,</b> 
        <P><b>I promised this weekend that I'd come back today and respond to 
          the two points made in the original author's post. I'm afraid that that 
          doesn't necessarily mean that Wizards in general will like the response 
          though.</b>
        <P><b>I'm going to start with the second point, because my request for 
          more information is important in regards to my response:</b>
        <P>POINT #2 - WIZARDS DO NOT WANT TO NE THE 'MOST POWERFUL' CASTER, THEY 
          JUST WANT TO DO MORE DAMAGE LIKE VERANT SAID THEY WOULD 
        <P><b>This weekend, I asked how the author defined "damage", meaning that 
          damage is not a standalone concept. Damage could be defined as damage 
          per spell or damage per point of mana, in which case Shamans or Necros 
          would seem to take the cake. It could be defined as damage per "load" 
          of mana, in which case Necros would seem to edge out there as well. 
          It could also be defined as complete damage potential, in which case 
          one of the pet classes (necros/magicians) would seem to have an edge. 
          It could also be argued that Enchanters have the largest damage potential 
          due to charm, and their ability to make a pet that hits in the 90s. 
          I've actually seen an enchanter solo 5 spectres at once using charm 
          and mez. </b>
        <P><b>"Damage", from our point of view, is defined as damage over the 
          shortest period of time that the character can inflict that damage. 
          The statement that wizards have no rivals when it comes to inflicting 
          magical damage is true under this definition. So, as to the quoted "Point 
          #2" above, wizards do indeed do more magical damage than the other classes. 
          </b> 
        <P>POINT #1 - WHAT IS THE MOST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION OF VERANT'S WIZARD 
          DESCRIPTION?
        <P>A. This means that Wizards can out-damage every other spell caster. 
          In exchange for this power, wizards will be one-dimensional, lacking 
          the variety of spells that the other classes have. Wizards will have 
          no pet, no real buffs, no group buffs, no group friendly spells, no 
          healing spells, no DoT spells, no Bolt spells, no shield spells, no 
          disease or poison spells, etc.<BR>
          <BR>
          or<BR>
          <BR>
          B. This means wizards have no rival at chain-casting the 'direct damage' 
          variety of spells. Thus it is possible that in a short period of time, 
          a wizard might possibly out-damage another spell caster, but if you 
          are talking about a 90 second fight, instead of a 30 second fight, Wizards 
          will do much less damage than many other casters. And when you reach 
          level 50, you will have to have an enchanter and/or shaman with you 
          in order to be effective. 
        <P><b>First, addressing option "A". Though I did say that wizards are 
          rather straight forward, they are far from "one-dimensional" and they 
          aren't exactly "lacking the variety of spells that the other classes 
          have". In addition to direct-damage spells of 3 out of the 5 types (which 
          no other class has), they also have roots, stuns, movement slowing (e.g. 
          Bonds of Force), and travel spells, as well as a reasonable series of 
          self-buffs. This is not a one-dimensional class. Now people can feel 
          free to insist that all of those other spells "suck" and therefore refuse 
          to count them in their estimation, but they are counted, and do not 
          suck, in ours. </b>
        <P><b>Option B, though essentially correct, is an entirely minimalist 
          point of view that could be adopted by any class in order to emphasize 
          their weakness. As for the suggestion that wizards have to count on 
          a shaman (or other resistance debuffer) to be fully effective, we have 
          no problem with agreeing with that. In the same fashion that a melee 
          character needs to count on heals and buffs to be fully effective, it 
          is reasonable (to us) for wizards to count on a resistance debuffer 
          in the same way. </b>
        <P><b>Now I'm fully aware that there are people out there who now dislike 
          their class or don't feel it is what they had envisioned, but it is 
          what we envisioned. I'll agree that there is not much I could do to 
          help these people come to like their class, short of handing out enhancements 
          just for the sake of enhancing them. Wizards are essentially well-balanced, 
          and we won't be making any massive changes to them aside from the general 
          refinements we make to all classes as time goes on. Much in the same 
          fashion that rogues need to insist upon their value to the group and 
          overcome the stigma of months and months of posts complaining about 
          how ineffective they are, wizards now need to do the same. </b>
        <P><b>I know I get flamed every time I say this, but if you dislike you 
          class that much, I'll suggest you play another. That's why we provide 
          14 of them for you to choose from, since not everyone is suited to play 
          every class. </b>
        <P><b>Thanks for listening,</b>
