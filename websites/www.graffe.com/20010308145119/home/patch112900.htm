        Day*</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems 
        reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay 
        issues: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Corrected 
          an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction 
          with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum. 
          Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the 
          appropriate direction. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Random-effects 
          on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player 
          character rather than an NPC. The change last patch reduced them to 
          a rate below player characters. As part of this patch, target-specific 
          random effects will only work if the target is the intended type. For 
          instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" 
          on a summoned NPC instead of everything. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added 
          some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by 
          people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few 
          minutes. For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, 
          this should address the issue. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Made final 
          positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards. Included in these 
          changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed 
          a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting 
          to get back in.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added 
          some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select 
          screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping 
          is enabled. Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to 
          release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable 
          until the next version of DirectX is adopted. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Changed 
          customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" 
          setting instead of the "Backspace". This means that you can now assign 
          "Backspace" to a function in game. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Corrected 
          a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" 
          under some circumstances. There is still a potential for this to happen 
          with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near 
          future.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Corrected 
          a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than 
          intended after the server had been up for a while.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Higher 
          level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability 
          to dual-wield without being handed weapons. The calculation used to 
          determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into 
          account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher 
          for the Shadowknight) will have this ability. It is possible that you 
          could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet 
          that will not have this ability.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bards 
          of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, 
          two score and nine, for you they are meant. Abandon your mates, though 
          they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Monk's 
          hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed 
          blunt skill. </font></li>
