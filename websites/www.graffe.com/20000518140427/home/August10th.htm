          - 5:15pm PST<br>

          I've been in contact with Geoffrey Z (Lead Spell Designer/Programmer 

          for Verant) as of late and I thought some of you might find our conversation 

          of interest. This is concerning our Resist problems we as Wizards face:<br>

        </p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Graffe:</font> The largest complaint 

          I receive is our +6 level damage cap. This is hard for me to respond 

          to the viewers with due to the fact that I don't have the exact numbers 

          on why this happens. What they are complaining about is that if we cast 

          on a beast that is of 6 levels higher than us, we get a full resist. 

          This greatly reduces our use in a higher class group. I do know that 

          when I fire upon a red and it resists the spell fully, it still takes 

          that resist as a full hit and adds me to its hatred list. Here is the 

          scenario that I have personally experienced. I cast Thunder Strike on 

          a mob (which would normally do 250 damage at my current level) and it 

          resists the cast fully. If I do not wait for the tanks to raise its 

          hatred level to them and I cast it again for a full resist, it will 

          come directly for me. From higher level wizards, I hear that the Fire 

          Giants within Solusek resist everything they cast (that comes from two 

          wizards, one level 49 the other 50). I was told by my level 49 contact 

          that this is due to an exploit that could be taken advantage of. My 

          suggestion is that the resist cap is removed, but do not let us hit 

          for our full damage... lessen the damage on tougher creatures so that 

          we can once again be useful within a group. Not only used for evacuation 

          purposes. </p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Geoffrey Z: </font>It actually isn't 

          a 6 lvl cap - it is >5 lvls OR more than 1.2 of the casters level - 

          so at higher levels, you can effect things 7-9 levels above you. Anything 

          which falls into the above catagory gets a much better saving throw 

          - not 100%, but much better. This was done for balance reasons - most 

          classes use indirect magic to get around it. The Wizard does have trouble 

          in that they do not get any good indirect magic (healing, damage shields, 

          quickness spells, etc.). It is one of the downsides of playing a Wizard. 

          Have a good one. :)</p>

          Received a really cool (lame word, I know) email from a viewer in Australia 

          that has an 'Aussie Only' Guild upon Rodcet Nife. If you're from down 

          under and wish to team up with some of you own kind, give this lad a 

          tell. I'd list his email here, but I'm not that cruel.</p>

          New patch info important to Wizards to take effect tomorrow morning:<br>

          <br>

          1. Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable.<br>

          <br>

          2. Players whom have the "Box of Abu-Kar". Next week, we will be performing 

          an update which will remove the Box of Abu-Kar from player's inventories 

          and replace it with "Salil's Writ" (a Research component). This means 

          that if you do not remove all of the items that are currently stored 

          within the Box of Abu-Kar, they will all be lost when the update is 

          performed. </p>

          While I have been working on other projects for the site, my mailbox 

          has been getting flooded with submits. Hope to have the majority of 

          them up today for you. Please remember not to edit your submits and 

          send them in bitmap form if at all possible. I know these files are 

          big, but when you convert to jpeg or gif, most people reduce the quality 

          of the image. To keep the images clean, it's just easier for me to do 

          all of the editing. Thanks!</p>

          Thought I was going to be the first to have this for you.. but my contact 

          fell thru. EQ'Lizer was the first to get the stat pic of this new robe. 

          I wont post until I get the info the honest way.. but here are the stats 

          upon the Crimson Robe of Alendine that is found upon Cazic Thule within 

          Fear:<br>

          I meant to post this information a while back but apparently it skipped 

          right by me. It seems that if you take the two different Runes of Fulguration 

          to a vendor and try to sell them, they will be worth two different amounts. 

          The lower priced rune is for the lower research spells and the higher 

          priced is for the higher research spells. Many people sent this info 

          in and I don't have all of thier names in front of me to give credit 

          for. I all can say is thank you and I'm sure the rest of the Wizzies 

          out there thank you also. I will have some minor item additions later 

          today. Have a great morning... - Graff&euml;</p>

          is an exerpt of what she told me:<br>

          - &quot;The casting time is virtually same as Rend so it's about 9 seconds 

          I'd say. There is a slight refresh delay after casting the spell, like 

          maybe 4 seconds instead of the normal 2 for other spells&quot;</p>
