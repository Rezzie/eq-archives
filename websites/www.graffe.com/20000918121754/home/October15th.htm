        concerning the Staff of Temperate Flux. It seems that Gardern does not 

        tell you where to get the Staff of Ro which is needed to make the Staff 

        of Temperate Flux. However, there is an NPC for Enchanter quests named 

        &quot;Romar Sunton&quot;. He gives a quest concerning the Darkwood Staff. 

        Romar says this Darkwood Staff is also known as the Staff of Ro. This 

        has not been confirmed as the correct ingredient, but it sounds pretty 

        logical.<br>

        the Temple of Solusek Ro:</p>

      <p>This from Nezzar Enkahmin of <clockwork brotherhood> Rodcet Nife :<br>

        <i>&quot;Greetings, I am emailing to let you inform players of the possibility 

        of the Specialization Removal Quest being inop. My character's name is 

        Nezzar, I play on the Rodcet Nife server, and am a level 31 wizard. I 

        followed the quest, giving the ruby to Ostorm like he had asked. He then 

        said that my specialization is now at 49 and I got faction adjustments 

        415 and 416. He then asked for the 50 gold pieces I owed him. I paid him 

        and went on my way. Went to guild, tried to train in it, but it said that 

        it was maxed. While fighting, during a med period, glanced at my skill 

        levels and noticed that my abjuration was average while my evocation was 

        at below average. The skills were not reset. Now, the only thing I can 

        think of is the possibility of the 50 gold pieces being to nullify this 

        effect. I am not sure of this, the 50 gold pieces were in brackets, but 

        only after doing the quest, giving him the ruby, I was in a conversation 

        with another at that time and lost the NPC talk so I could not bring up 

        that dialogue with the NPC Ostorm. If anyone out there is going to do 

        this quest, have them ask about the gold pieces and what they are for 

        before they pay for it. It may be that it cancels the effect. Warn the 

        others. I have submitted a feedback after I noticed it, (I had done a 

        petition, but the 2 GM's online got off line before answering my petition), 

        and I am waiting on an email from Verant if they respond. Thank you&quot;<br>

        </i>Thank you Nezzar!</p>

      <p>This from Solice:<br>

        <i>&quot;In the temple. Beware the genie </i>(Tazgar, the Efreeti)<i>. 

        If you hail him you take a faction hit. You should be able to identify 

        him. He is the one surrounded by corpses. It seems to have a varrying 

        effect. But 2 different reports. One person hailed him over and over and 

        the whole temple turned to warmly. Another did it and the whole temple 

        went aggro on him. Just be wary, even hailing him causes a faciton adjustment.&quot;<br>

        </i>Thank you Solice!</p>

      <p>If you do mess up your faction somehow, killing off Shadowmen will raise 

        your faction with the inhabitants of the Temple.</p>

        givers: turn on your log file and stand near both of the NPC's (Vilissia, 
        and Gardern). There will be so many people spamming, it is too hard to 
        catch all of the details. Once you have stood there long enough, log off 
        and go read your log file for the quest info. I also took it upon myself 
        to update the map I had for the Temple to show where the Wizard quest

        for a bit until the server wide message came through that Xegony was coming 

        down for a server-side patch. So, here I am posting a picture of the waiting 

        line to get into the zone. Looks like a bunch of quest hungry people out 

        there. If you wish to submit any quest info, please take your time with 

        it and make it read as if you were turning in a term paper. I get many

        and the Ice Comet Quest:</a></font> A bit ago Kryogen Katspaw posted some 

        of this info to the General Message Board. I have confirmed it so I will 

        post it here so all can read: If you are still not able to speak to Sulgar 

        within Everfrost Peaks concerning the Ice Comet Quest, there is only one 

        thing you can do... and that is petition so that a full GM can help you. 

        There is faction that Sulgar is based on called 'beta-neutral'. Everyone 

        that cannot talk to Sulgar is trying to find a way to raise this faction. 

        This is a faction in game that is not supposed to change so that anybody 

        can speak to NPC's with this type of faction.. no matter what they have 

        killed in the past. Apparently, there was a mob within Mistmoore (a werewolf) 

        that did effect this faction when killed. This mob has been fixed but 

        unfortunately, before it was, it effected a few Wizards out there. So, 

        if you wish to have this corrected... write a nice petition stating your 

        problem with Sulgar and maybe.. just maybe if your server's GM is online 

        and feeling kind, they will help you out. There is no promises and don't 

        say &quot;Graff&euml; said you would change it for me!&quot; because I 

        didn't say it. =) Good luck!<br>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Quests for Wizards within 

        the Temple of Solusek Ro: I've seen a few upset people on the message 

        boards, within my e-mails, and over on the Wizard Mailing List concerning 

        the lack of Wizard quests within the upcoming zone of the Temple of Solusek 

        Ro. I posted to the mailing list saying not to get upset yet because the 

        zone is not completed. In saying that, it seems some changes have already 

        taken place within the new zone. Tirion of Povar sent in this e-mail:<br>

        <br>

        &quot; After I heard there wasn't any wizard quests in the temple I decided 

        I had to take a look for myself before I believed it. I found two npc's 

        on the balcony opposite of the mage's quest. Gardern gives the quests 

        for Staff of Temperate Flux and Weeping Wand and Vilissia gives quests 

        for Runescale Cloak, Tishans Kilt and Acumen Mask. Gardern seems a bit 

        bugged... I can't get past the first hail, but Vilissia is working fine.</p>

      <p>Vilissia will make the Runescale Cloak if you give her a Lizardscale 

        Cloak and three Runes of Scale. The runes can be found on saltwater crocs 

        in Guk, deepwater caiman in Oasis and firescale crocs in Rath Mountains. 

        For Tishans Kilt, which I am assuming is going to be a lower magic resist 

        effect on it, you need to take a Shadowed Ball, from shadow men, to Trankia 

        in Everfrost (I am assuming it continues from there.) And for the Acumen 

        Mask she wants a Glowing Mask from a Skel Monk in Guk, Patch of Shadow, 

        Darkbone Skull from Unrest and a Bonechipped Mask from a Goblin Headmaster 

        in OOT. &quot;</p>

      <p>Thank you Tirion!<br>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Qenelin Bu'Khma mailed 

        in some information and pics of the new upcoming zone, Temple of Solusek 

        Ro. Here is an exerpt of his info and the pics to follow:</p>

      <p>&quot;....The zone is very small. I've found one secret passage, leading 

        me to Tazgar (a cool looking NPC who did not answer Hails) and barring 

        more, the whole zone is the size of Northern Felwithe, if not smaller. 

        I must admit, it was beautiful to behold. The furniture and buildings 

        looked great . So why was I disappointed? Well, first of all there are 

        NO WIZARD QUESTS, that I could find. All I found were Cleric, Mage, Enchanter 

        and Necromancer quests. Classes that already have an abundance of quests, 

        if you ask me. Not that I'm against, but Wizards got the shaft, once again, 

        and that angers me. Moreover, all the quests were similar to the crafted 

        armor quests - bring me this and that and I'll give you this and that 

        armor/weapon/spell. Nothing to think about, nothing to explore, just straightforward 

        "go camp that mob" quests. Finally, there are just not that many quests. 

        Qeynos has more quests than this, I am sure. Oh yeah, there is one guy 

        who will (assumingly) erase your specialization. This is for those who 

        went over 50 on the wrong skill and want to change it. No big deal.&quot;</p>
