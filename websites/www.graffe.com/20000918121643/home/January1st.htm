          wrote this editorial called &quot;Unfair Stereotypes in EverQuest&quot;:<br>
          There are two main stereotypes in EverQuest to my knowledge. One, the 
          kill-stealing Wizard, and two, the kiting Druid. I have not played a 
          Wizard, but have enough Wizard friends to know that they are snubbed 
          enough by the general EverQuest population to make it a problem. Personally, 
          as a Druid, I have had several encounters with people who have put me 
          in this stereotype and have treated me rather unfairly. <br>
          Yes, there are kill-stealing Wizards, and yes, there are also kiting 
          Druids. But what you don't see/hear a lot about is kiting Bards, or 
          Necromancers; or kill-stealing Enchanters. Do not misunderstand, I am 
          not stereotyping these classes. Far from it, but I am saying that each 
          of those classes have the potential to kill-steal, or kite. <br>
          For example, Bards are MUCH better kiters than Druids. Their Selo`s 
          Accelerando song is faster than SoW after Level 6. They also have multiple 
          DoT/DD songs, which do not require mana. Therefore, since they are faster 
          than Druids, and have the potential to do more damage (since they do 
          not need mana to inflict it), they are perhaps the best kiters in EverQuest. 
          <br>
          Wizards have a horrible reputation for stealing kills with their high 
          damage DDs. But, a Level 4 Enchanter could steal a kill from a Level 
          50 Wizard any day. How? Enchanter's Mesmerize-Line of spells give them 
          the potential to steal ANY kill. They simple cast Mesmerize on the target 
          when it is at a sliver of life, and then kill the target before the 
          person who was fighting it before can react. Mesmerize acts as a memory 
          wipe, and therefore allows an Enchanter to kill-steal without having 
          to use high power DDs. <br>
          The vast majority of Wizards do not steal kills. The same goes for Druids. 
          A recent news article on EQ Vault said, and I quote: "Why are some of 
          these spawns EXACTLY 12 hours apart which allows kill stealing wizards/druids 
          to teleport in 15 seconds before the creature spawns and kill it and 
          steal it from the group that has been sitting there waiting for hours?" 
          That is a horribly unfair statement. Excuse me? Wizards and Druids have 
          Personal and Group Teleports, yes, but not to specific NPC spawns. We 
          don't have a spell that is called "Personal Teleport: Froglok King" 
          or "Personal Teleport: Hadden." Eight out of the fifteen classes in 
          EverQuest recieve the spells "Gate" and "Bind Affinity," therefore, 
          Druids and Wizards are not the ONLY classes who have the potential to 
          steal kills. <br>
          My intent in writing this editorial was to try to make people think 
          before they say, "Druids suck! All you do is kite all day," or "Your 
          just a kill-stealer like ALL Wizards!" So, in conclusion, I ask the 
          general EverQuest population not to judge Wizards, Druids, or any other 
          class by what others of their class may have done, but to judge them 
          by their actions. <br>
