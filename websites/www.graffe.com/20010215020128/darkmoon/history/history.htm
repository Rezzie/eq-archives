        Sworn History of Darkmoon<br>
        As Told by Xu'raz, Son of the Third Gem </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000"><br>
        If by reading the history of our great people from Human text, you might 
        otherwise consider our race to be inherently evil. To understand the true 
        history of the 'Dark' Elf people and the mighty army of Darkmoon, you 
        must understand the history from -our perspective. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">You 
        all may have read the history of Necromancy, in the eyes of Aradune Mithara, 
        a great work of art from a well meaning Ranger. But his writings are not 
        complete. They only briefly tell of the suffering my race has endured 
        at the hands of the Erudite &quot;Spies&quot;, and more importantly that 
        disgusting Lich Miragul. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">When 
        the Erudites first came to us, they seemed to be a peaceful race of Humans. 
        Unlike their savage Barbarian cousins, they were polite and articulate. 
        They showed us the basics of their 3 groups of magic. We found this magic 
        to be amusing and simple! In time we revealed the great magic of my ancient 
        fathers to them, later to be called Necromancy by the gullible masses. 
        <br>
        We soon noticed a negative change in the Erudite men. They became very 
        aggressive and impatient with us. When we taught them a powerful spell, 
        they would study and turn our magic into their own twisted ideas. They 
        always wanted more from us and began to use the very things we loved against 
        us. We felt betrayed by these invaders and sought to oust them from our 
        great underground city. They resisted us and took captive the daughter 
        of Grethis, the Wife of the Dragon Guardians. Fearing wrath from our God, 
        we gave in to the demands of these Erudite Drigse ('Dark' Elven tongue 
        for Bastards). After raping our lands of ideas and culture they took this 
        knowledge back to Miragul and formed a 'new' study of magic. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">This 
        spawned the birth of the Darkmoon Army. A small band of brave Elves that 
        began to meet in secret every opportunity they could find. Their goals 
        were simple, ousting the Erudites from Neriak with any means possible. 
        They planned a great rebellion that would hope to forever oust the Erudites 
        from our homeland. The fighting was hard and deadly. Many of our brothers 
        and sisters were slain. The Erudites had also taken heavy casualties. 
        It became impossible for them to stay and they began to flee from our 
        lands. <br>
        They plundered our resources and defiled our Elven maidens. They slaughtered 
        hundreds of our children after the Darkmoon uprising. Their gentle child 
        spirits can still be felt around Neriak, singing our painful history into 
        our hearts. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">Over 
        time our people formed a widespread religion and culture out of Miragul's 
        twisted version of the great magic of my Fathers, now called Necromancy. 
        Some modern 'Dark' Elves even support the Lich Miragul in his continued 
        warping of our old ways. They see it as the only hope for our dying race, 
        to join the only powers that oppose the human invasion of our lands and 
        the extinction of our people. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">My 
        'Dark' Elven friends, the only hope for our race is unity. Miragul is 
        just as bad for us as the Erudites that invaded our lands so long ago. 
        Now we have Human armies camping outside of our sacred homelands, along 
        with their Dwarven and Elven allies. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">I 
        am helping to build the only known 'Dark' Elf army that will fight the 
        Humans who seek to kill us, the Erudites who stole our ideas, the Dwarves 
        who want our resources, and the Elves who unfairly fear us. Most of all, 
        we seek to end of the existence of Miragul, the demented lifeless Lich 
        who sends endless armies of undead against us. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">The 
        modern Darkmoon army provides true unity within our race. We provide our 
        members with valuable resources and the opportunity to gain the great 
        experience necessary to make you a truly powerful 'Dark' Elf. </font></p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255,255,255)"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FF0000">Join 
        us as we tell our enemies that we will no longer stand for the destruction 
        of our people. We will no longer tolerate the starving of our children 
        and the enslavement of our ideas.<br>
        Do not sit quietly as the spirits of our ancestors watch our actions. 
        We will not allow our race to be destroyed in the faces of the generations 
        that fought so hard for us. I extend my invitation to join the mighty 
        army of Darkmoon. </font></p>
