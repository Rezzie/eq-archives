       <P>So you've hit level 16 and it's time for research to begin? Let me lay 
         some of the ground work for you and hopefully you will go away enlightened 
         after reading this.</p>
       <p>You acquire the skill research at level 16 however, until level 20 you 
         will basically only be able to put 1 training point into the skill and 
         you won't be able to skill it using practice research. The 1 point will 
         allow you to research the level 16 spells and give you a 16 in the skill 
         but level 16 spells don't become trivial until you have 21 points in research 
         so plan carefully. At level 20 is when research actually takes off and 
         you can start working on the skill properly. This does not mean there 
         is nothing for you to work on until level 20. First thing you should do 
         is kill some wisps and turn in the Greater Light Stones to get your Research 
         Concordance for the practice research quest detailed here. There is a 
         noticeable experience gain and the money you get from the quest is more 
         than worth your trouble.</P>
       <p>Print out a copy of the ingredients for the various research runes and 
         get a feel for what you should start collecting. Since most of the stuff 
         is lower level loot that everyone takes for granted (most notable are 
         the Rawhide and Ringmail armor items required for levels 24-39 practice 
         research) it's a good idea to start collecting the items when you get 
         experience for killing the MoB's that carry the loot.</P>
       <p>Now you're level 20 so it's time to start working on your skill! You've 
         collected the items to make the level 16 practice runes and you have a 
         concordance of research. So let's take a look at the ingredients:</P>
       <p>Practice Rune Azia: Lapis Lazuli, Bat Wing, and Bone Chips</P>
       <p>Practice Rune Beza: Turquoise, Fire Beetle Eye, and Any Rusty Slashing 
         Weapon</P>
       <p>Pull all these items from your bank and head to your local Guild. For 
         every Rune you make you will need to purchase a piece of parchment (which 
         do not stack, bad Verant) this item is used up in the making of the practice 
         rune. You will also need to buy a quill, which is also an ingredient, 
         but this item is not expended when creating a practice rune.</P>
       <p>So for your first Rune you will place One of each of the required items 
         into your concordance:</P>
       <p>1-Lapis Lazuli, 1-Bat Wing, 1-Bone Chip, 1-Parchment, and your Quill</P>
       <p>Hit "Combine" and you will have created 1 Practice Rune Azia. Continue 
         this process until you have made all the Azia and Beza runes you have 
         ingredients for. Do not forget to include the Parchment and the Quill 
         with the making of each rune. Making Practice Runes themselves will give 
         you no skill and you cannot fail at making them.</P>
       <p>Now pull out your Lexicon (or whatever your class uses for making spells 
         bought from a vendor in your guild). Place 1 each of the Practice Runes 
         Azia and Beza you have created into the Lexicon and hit "Combine" and 
         you will have created a "Complete Practice Rune". This is what you will 
         be gaining skill with just like any other trade skill. The parchment and 
         quill are not needed when combining runes in the Lexicon only when making 
         the practice runes in the Concordance. The only thing that should ever 
         go into your Lexicon are Runes.</P>
       <p>Collect Items and continue this process until the Practice research runes 
         for whatever level you are doing become trivial when you combine them 
         in your Lexicon. Then it's time to move on to the next level of Practice 
         Research.</P>
       <p>Things to keep in mind:</P>
       <ol>
         <li> Your training points are a finite resource. Do not use them to bump 
           up your research skill when you first get research. You want to wait 
           until you get enough cash and enough training points to max your skill 
           out if you so desire.<br>
           <br>
         </li>
         <li>You will accumulate a lot of lower level runes that you should use 
           to skill your research with. This will help since some of the practice 
           ingredients are a pain to acquire at times.<br>
           <br>
         </li>
         <li>There are certain levels of practice research that you may want to 
           skip entirely. For example level 44 Practice research requires Giant 
           Fire Beetle Eyes which are not too easy to acquire.<br>
           <br>
         </li>
         <li>If you have saved most of your training points and you get tired of 
           collecting all the practice research items or you're level 49 and you 
           want Ice Comet to be researched the first time with the first set of 
           runes you can dump all your points into the skill and max it out(There 
           still is a chance for failure even if you're maxxed in the skill).<br>
           <br>
         </li>
         <li>If you so desire the Practice Research Runes will skill you all the 
           way to max. Just make and combine your level 16 practice runes and move 
           to the next level when they become trivial. You will actually be at 
           level 20 but the Practice Runes you are using are level 16.</li>
       </ol>
       <p>When making spells you need the right combination of Runes in order to 
         make your spells. For example: Identify requires a Rune of Fahalem and 
         a Rune of Substance. Place 1 of each into your Lexicon and hit "Combine". 
         If you are successful you will have created the scroll Identify which 
         you can scribe into your spell book. You do not use a parchment or quill 
         in your Lexicon.</P>
       <p>Runes for spells are random loot found on MoB's of the appropriate level. 
         Level 16 runes are found on MoB's level 16-19. Make friends since they 
         will give you a lot of runes for free. Check Vendors near a Dungeon that 
         would contain the appropriate level MoB's. Keep an ear open for auctions 
         for some of the more rare runes.</P>
