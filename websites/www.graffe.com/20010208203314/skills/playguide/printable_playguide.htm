      <p><font size="2">So, you want to make a wizzie eh? Good choice! I'm Lindiien 
        Lightbringer of the Xegony server. In the last few weeks I've gotten many 
        tells from wizzies who are having trouble with their class and need advice, 
        so I decided to make a wizard play guide to help everyone out. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Note- in this guide I will set forth a series of situations 
        and explain what to do in each case. <br>
        Note- all of these scenarios are group combat </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Ok, a point about wizards. Most people think we are just 
        nuke, nuke, nuke. But what defines the nuker from the wizard are these 
        strategies which I will teach you in this guide.</font></p>
      <hr noshade width="200">
      <p><font size="2"><b>1. To nuke or not to nuke? That is the question. (doh, 
        too much Shakespeare class sorry)</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2">This part of the guide is about what type of spells 
          to use, which is only a decision between our two types: Nuke or Stun.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">ONLY use stuns on critters that dish out massive amounts 
          of damage like spellcasters. Or maybe the Ghoul Lord who triple hits 
          for 120 and hopefully, if ya get lucky, has his wonderful sword which 
          procs for 70 damage. :P The reason for this lack of usage of stun is 
          because it is very in-efficient mana wise. Markar's Clash costs exactly 
          half the mana that Ice Comet costs while it does 200 damage to Ice Comet's 
          1120 damage. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">For example, if you stun a Greater Kobold ( warrior 
          type creature ) you will stop it for 5 or so seconds preventing it from 
          doing MAYBE 100 damage to your tank while causing you to lose 200 mana 
          and only do fairly insignificant damage to the kobold. But, in the case 
          of a casting creature like the Ghoul Arch Magi, you may prevent a nuke 
          or Gravity Flux which has the potential to do 2400 damage total to the 
          group ( 400 or so per group member) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Hopefully this explanation shows why stunning a warrior 
          type of creature is fairly worthless, while stunning a magic caster 
          can save the group. Therefore, don't stun melee stuff because it's a 
          complete waste of mana. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>2- When to Nuke</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2">Note- the key to being a good wizard is NOT being afraid 
          to take damage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Scenario 1- One creature pull, group is full health 
          and mana:<br>
          In this case the group is ready to kick this things ass so don't waste 
          too much mana on it, nuke it once or twice then meditate. If you over 
          nuke it and use 60% of your mana the rest of your group will be ready 
          for another fight while you are LOM and need to med which will cause 
          them to have to sit around and wait for you. Whereas if you nuke it 
          once or twice and med, the mana usage should be distributed fairly equally 
          throughout the group causing a uniform downtime between all the mana 
          users which will lead to less downtime</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Scenario 2 - Multi creature pull:<br>
          In a pull where you get 3 or so creatures the key is to drop one of 
          these creatures ASAP. If you sit and wait for the tanks to do some damage 
          to the critters to avoid getting hit yourself, the tanks will get mauled 
          while you wait. If you do this, the group will most likely end up dead 
          pretty damn quickly. As I said at the beginning of the guide, don't 
          be afraid to take damage. Right when the tanks start to fight assist 
          the main tank and nuke the creature until it's dead. You probably will 
          get hit but don't be afraid, the tank will taunt it off of ya pretty 
          fast and then you can nuke it again :P just make sure you get that first 
          creature down ASAP. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Another tactic which I use along with the above tactic 
          is this: Pick a target NONE of the tanks are fighting. Nuke it until 
          it charges you. Run out of the room, root it, run back in and employ 
          the above strategy, DONT NUKE THE ROOTED ONE, concentrate all damage 
          on the target the tanks are on like I stated above in order to get that 
          one down ASAP. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note- some locations will be too dangerous to do this 
          like if there are several creatures outside.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note- if you get a crappy root and it breaks quickly 
          just run back out and do it again :P</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Note- only employ the root strategy on tank creatures, 
          if you do it to a caster it can just sit there and nuke you making your 
          effort pointless</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">This strategy eliminates one tank creature from the 
          fight completely until you are done with the others and are ready to 
          give the rooted creature a proper beating.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>3- What to do when critters get really pissed at you/ 
        when sompin beats on ya.</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2">Whatever you do, DON'T run around like a chicken with 
          no head screaming GET IT OFF. It just makes it harder for the tanks 
          to get a hit in on the creature so it will be on you longer. Either 
          stand in one place and tell the tanks sompin is trying to ruin your 
          beautiful face, or run TO the tanks so they don't have to search around 
          for your creature in the midst of the fight. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Also, I see a lot of casters who start to melee attack 
          the creature when they get attacked… umm WHY? You may inflict a whole 
          9 damage to the beast which I assure you ain't gonna matter. But, in 
          inflicting this 9 damage you have managed to piss it off even more due 
          to all your misses which will make it that much harder for a tank to 
          get it off. So, don't go melee cuz it just leads to getting pounded 
          even longer.</font></p>
        <hr noshade width="200">
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2"><b>4- General Notes</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Meditate during fights when you go LOM, don't go melee 
          cuz you aren't gonna even hurt the creature.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Don't trust inviso, it always wears off at bad times 
          :P</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Make sure you have the right spells up, it always sucks 
          to go into battle then realize you have your level 4 spells up (unless 
          you are level 4 heh).</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Lindiien is GOD, you will give him all your worldly 
          possessions. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <hr noshade width="200">
      <p><font size="2">If you still think you want to be a wizard, I will tell 
        you it's a really fun class :P but here is a question that can determine 
        whether or not you have what it takes. If you answer it right, you have 
        what it takes, if you answer it wrong. Who cares make a wizard anyway</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Question:<br>
        A hill giant leaves Freeport heading directly west at a speed of 10 meters 
        per second, at that exact same moment a griffon starts flying directly 
        east from Qeynos at a speed of 12 meters per second. If they continue 
        this course at this speed, what is the probability that someone will make 
        a druid at the same instant in time when they meet? </font></p>
