          If the Combine Empire spires are the most potent waypoints for magical 
          travel on Norrath, does that mean a Translocate: Great Divide spell 
          is forthcoming? Those spires sure are neat, but I'd love to actually 
          be able to use them for something other than keeping the falling snow 
          off my head as I hunt dire wolves.</p>
        <p>Thanks.</p>

          <p>Ok guys I'm going to ask everyone to please remember this is a Fantasy 
            Role Playing game. Before translocate spells were added to the game 
            a dynamic event happened. If you were not fortunate enough witness 
            the event I apologize. I know there are a lot of times when magic 
            just shows up on Norrath, but sometimes it is discovered as opposed 
            to just showing up. We have detailed plans outlining the Translocate 
            line of spells. While I appreciate the feedback, I'm going to ask 
            that you please stop asking for more locations, and simply let the 
            world unfold around you. </p>
          <p>Thanks</p>

          <p>Guys, we're doing this the way you're always asking us to do it, 
            with in-game plot. For those of you that did miss the events, you 
            can always check out the web site for clues on what's going on here 
            *cough* journalofalkabor *cough*. Yes, we actually thought this all 
            through&#133;</p>
