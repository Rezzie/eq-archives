      <p align="left"><font size="2">*Level 1 Character Purge* </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2">We've decided to postpone the previously announced purging 
          of level 1 characters that had not been played in the past 30 days. 
          Should we reschedule this process in the future, we will again give 
          fair warning prior to implementing the purge.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2">*Today's Changes* </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2">Today's patch consists mostly of content changes within 
          EverQuest, such as new quests, corrections to existing NPC texts, and 
          adjustments to spawn times associated with quest NPCs and other NPCs 
          in general.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2"> /help will now display emotes, guild commands, and 
          normal commands separately.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">/sit will cause your character to sit. "/sit off" will 
          cause your character to stand. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"/cast #" (where # is 1 to 8) will cast the spell memorized 
          in the corresponding slot. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"/book #" (where # is the even displayed page number 
          divided by 2) will take you to the corresponding page of your spell 
          book. For instance, to flip to page 27/28, type "/book 14". </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"/doability #" (where # is 1 to 10) will fire the specified 
          ability. Abilities 1-6 are those that are set on the "Abilities" page; 
          Numbers 7-10 represent those that are set on the "Combat Skills" page.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">/whotarget can be typed to do a /who on the targeted 
          PC. </font></li>
        <li> <font size="2">"/language #" (where # is a number corresponding to 
          the desired language) selects the chat language to use in general communication. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"/language help" displays a list of available languages 
          and their corresponding number. "/language" alone displays the current 
          language.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">/meditate causes you to sit down, open your spellbook, 
          and begin meditation. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">In "HUD" mode, the Chat Box will now take advantage 
          of higher resolutions to display more text before wrapping down to the 
          next line. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Fixed a bug that allowed users to /quit out of the 
          game immediately without penalty. Normal operation is supposed to cause 
          /quit to leave the character in-game and linkdead for a period of time 
          to discourage this action. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Again changed the functionality of the "U" ("use") 
          key. It will no longer inspect players or loot corpses. All other changes 
          implemented in the last patch stand. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Added new customizable color options to the EQCLIENT.INI. 
          The working documentation for this is below. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges 
          to "disappear" when the last charge was used. The item never really 
          disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging. It no longer appears 
          to disappear. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation* </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe 
        with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added 
        by eqgame.exe with default values. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The [TextColors] section contains entries for various 
        text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and 
        Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 
        and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay 
        mode, and black in normal mode. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing 
        the file: </font></p>
