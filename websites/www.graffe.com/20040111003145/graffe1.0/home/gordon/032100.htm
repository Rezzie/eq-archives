        <p>Abashi/Aradune could you put the following to a vote/poll for all players to
give input:
<p>Question: How would you define the role of a wizard given that the manual
states "When it comes to dealing out damage, Wizards have no rival"?
<p>A1: The most damage in the shortest amount of time.
<p>A2: The most damage overall.
<p>A3: The class with the most direct damage spells.
<p>I'm not even asking you do anything about the results other than post them to
this thread. I'm only asking this so that you can see what a
"reasonable" person would assume from the manual's definition.
<p>Thank you,

<b>Hi Brent. It's been a long time since I've seen your posts on the boards. I'm
glad to see that you are still around.</b>
<p><b>As for your poll, we try to keep the focus of polls to something that
affects most, if not all, of the players in the game. Class-specific issues
don't belong in a login poll, when only a percentage of the people would have
any frame of reference. The poll itself would only serve to identify how many
people may have misunderstood our intent, and I don't want to give the
impression that the issue is being put up for some type of majority-driven
redesign of the core game engine.</b>
<p><b>Also, in the case of definitions, people would tend to vote for what they
feel it should be, rather than what it is. I've stated our stance on the wizard
issue, and as the creator of the game, it is our right and responsibility to
establish the definitions for the various things that we published. If some
people misunderstood, I apologize, but in this case the perception of those
players is out of line with the vision, not a case where the vision is out of
line with the perception of the players.</b>
