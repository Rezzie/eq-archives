Last week I was in a conversation with Lawrence Poe (if you don't know by now, he's been our spell guru at Verant for quite some time.. picking up where Geoff Zatkin left off) when he slams me with the statement that he's not working on EverQuest anymore.  'Oof' was the first thing that came to my mind.  So I asked him if he was going to go flip burgers for a living.  It turns out that he will still be working for Verant on an unannounced project doing gameplay systems and mechanics. He seems to be really happy and excited. (before the e-mails start: yes, I asked him about the unannounced project and he didn't share any info.) <p> Why am I writing all of this?  Well, in my eyes, Lawrence Poe did a phenomenal job of filling in where Geoff Zatkin left off.  He had his own ideas on what wizards should be and he used the playerbase’s ideas and knowledge to the fullest.  He watched, listened, implemented, and tweaked our class into something we should all be thankful for. <p> So to wrap this up, thank you Lawrence.  Thank you for taking notice to a class that was lacking and having the cahones to do something about it.  I’m sure there are still the few blind wizards that will chastise you but know that the mass majority of us thank you from the bottom of our mana reserves.  Good luck on your new adventure in game development!</p>

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">Poe Talks About Caster Concerns:<br>
<p>Lawrence Poe took the time to comment on some caster aspects of the game at  the Dallas Fan Faire.&nbsp; Here are a few Wizard-related issues he spoke about.&nbsp;  If you wish to read the entire transcript you can check it out over at <a target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">CastersRealm</a>.</p> <font size="2"> <blockquote>   <address>     <span style="font-style: normal">Q. Recently there was a major revamp to      melee classes, is anything in line to casters?<br>     <b>A. We have been taking a look at that. I can't say anything on it since      nothing is set in stone yet, but we have been talking about it a bit.</b></span></address>   <p>Q. What do the familiars do?<br>   <b>A. The lower level ones add resists and see invis etc.&nbsp; As you get the    higher level ones they will add to your mana pool, give more resistances,    decrease your fizzle rates, things like that.&nbsp; The familiar problem with them    poofing when you invis yourself, that was meant to be fixed before release&nbsp;    But eventually you will be able to invis yourself and lose your familiar.&nbsp; It    is on the list.&nbsp; No ETA at this time.&nbsp; With familiars also if they die you do    lose your mana, but they aren't meant to do it if they just poof from    invisibility or something.&nbsp; So I'll look into that.</b></p>   <p>Q. What happened to the Wizard anchor spells?<br>   <b>A. They never really made it out of the concept stage.&nbsp; They won't be going    in as far as I know at the moment.</b></p>   <p>Q. Is there any cap on Flowing Thought?<br>   <b>A. Yes, you can never get more than 15 points of Flowing Thought active at    a time.</b></p>   <p>Q. Why don't the Wizard Luclin gates work off Luclin?<br>   <b>A. It was designed by the team that it would be that way.&nbsp; All I can really    say.</b></p>   <p>Q. Any chance we will get the drop rates for Kunark spells increased?<br>   <b>A. There's something of a phenomenon here because all the class spell drops    are the same percentage.&nbsp; I read a lot of class forums and things, and really,    Shamans just seem to be really unlucky.&nbsp; I'm serious, all the spell drops are    on a very even percentage chance they can drop.&nbsp; I do concede though that    maybe they could be looked at across the board.&nbsp; It isn't a Shaman specific    thing though.</b></p>   <p>Q. Can we get the grouping requirement for Translocates taken off now we    have the confirmation box?<br>   <b>A. It's something that's being talked about.&nbsp; It may not happen but it is    being discussed.</b></p>   <p>Q. Will we ever see normal invisibility not have a random duration?<br>   <b>A. I don't think so.&nbsp; That was a design decision from some time ago in the    life of EverQuest and I really don't foresee it changing.</b></p>   <p>Q. Any chance of ever having a mana bar shown to your group?<br>   <b>A. That's a design decision and not one I can make on my own.&nbsp; But I think    you should be able to see other people in the groups mana.&nbsp; If you can    recognize their physical condition you should be able to recognize their    mental condition too.</b></p>   <p>Q. Have you ever thought of taking some of the randomness out of the    distance traveled with Shadowstep?<br>   <b>A. Honestly no.&nbsp; I don't know what would be involved in changing that    aspect of the spell.&nbsp; I'll write it down, but really its not something we've    looked at much before.</b></p>   <p>Q. Is there any chance that the West Karana spires could be moved somewhere    closer to Qeynos?<br>   <b>A. Despite the fact we added a new druid location to the Surefall Glade you    have to understand to graphically move the spires would be a 6 - 7 meg patch    that every player would be forced to download.&nbsp; That would just get very    messy.&nbsp; It's extremely unlikely we will ever move the West Karana spires this    late in the game.</b></p>   <p>Q. I find as a gnome I am interrupted far more than other races is there    any reason?<br>   <b>A. That really shouldn't happen.&nbsp; Being interrupted is generally caused by    a movement of your character not damage.&nbsp; I don't think Gnomes get moved any    easier than any other race but I can test it.</b></p>   <p>Q. Can you give us more information on how the mana cap was changed with    Luclin?<br>   <b>A. You used to only be able to get 1 point of mana for every int/wis over    200. They changed that with Luclin and you can get a lot more mana now, but    I'm afraid I can't give you any more details than that.</b></p>   <p>Q. What ever happened to the caster focus items that were coming with    Luclin?<br>   <b>A. Unfortunately even though we did design a bunch of them on paper we just    ran out of time in getting them in.&nbsp; I think its important that casters have    certain items they really want to chase after like melees do with haste and    stuff so hopefully they will get added in when the programmers have some time    to get back to them.</b></p>   <p>Q. Is there any chance of the exact number of mana being shown to a player    like for health?<br>   <b>A. I don't have a problem with the number being shown but there is people    on both sides of the argument on the development team.&nbsp; Given how long its    been the way it is, it would probably take everyone on the team really wanting    it to get it changed so I think it is fairly unlikely it will ever happen.</b></p>   <p>Q. What is spell shield for since it doesn't prevent melee?<br>   <b>A. I'm sorry if Wizards have to buff on raids as a cause of this spell    going in.&nbsp; But since it stacks with Rune it really is a great spell for    helping people live through AoE's.&nbsp; It just means Wizards get to do more good    stuff for their group overall.&nbsp; (Spellshield is a magic damage only rune type    spell).</b></p> </blockquote> </font></p>

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">January 23rd Patch Message... /thank Verant:<br>
<p>All I can say is that was one hell of a patch.&nbsp; Changes effecting  Wizards are in bold.&nbsp; Thank you, Verant!</p> <p><b>Quest Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li>Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. Please see the    Developer's Corner on our web site for more details</li>   <li>Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest    armor</li>   <li>Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated    quest</li>   <li>Grimling Blood should now be dropping</li>   <li>Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item    to the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct NPC to hand    the item to</li>   <li>In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you complete    the task that he asks of you</li>   <li>Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders</li>   <li>Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth</li>   <li>Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping</li>   <li>Quest of Nobility should now be working properly</li>   <li>Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold</li> </ul> <p><b>Item Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li>Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral Plains.    Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the    classes. The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others. In all    instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised. Several    items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded</li>   <li>Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the    plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes    on the chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the plate equipment list.    This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use. Our    Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent</li>   <li>Ghoulbane is now No-Drop</li>   <li>SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used    from inventory)</li>   <li>Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces</li>   <li>Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces</li>   <li>Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races</li>   <li>Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable</li>   <li>The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic</li>   <li><b>Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and    range slots</b></li>   <li><b>Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary,    and range slots</b></li>   <li>Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown</li>   <li><b>Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate</b></li>   <li>Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now</li>   <li>Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged. The    &quot;range&quot; value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing    them</li>   <li>Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other    pieces</li>   <li>Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate</li>   <li><b>Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor</b></li>   <li><b>Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor</b></li>   <li><b>Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash    when inventory is opened</b></li>   <li>Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights</li>   <li>Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves</li>   <li>Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item</li>   <li>Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races</li>   <li>Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore</li>   <li>Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus</li>   <li>Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues </li>   <li>Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect</li>   <li><b>Added &quot;Recommended Level&quot; equal to the current item use level for the    several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip    them and/or use their effects. Setting the &quot;Recommended Level&quot; field like this    just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item. The    actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely    informational</b></li>   <li>Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had been    erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These were primarily    items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all    Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from    use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value</li> </ul> <p><b>Zone Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li>Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead</li>   <li><b>Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus</b></li>   <li><b>Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level    Luclin encounters</b></li> </ul> <p><b>Horse Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li><b>Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands who    will buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in the Bazaar</b></li>   <li><b>Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when    stunned was causing warping and other bad things</b></li>   <li><b>Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect    people on horses properly</b></li>   <li><b>Horses now levitate when their rider should.</b></li>   <li><b>Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to    follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person    you are following is on a horse</b></li> </ul> <p><b>Spell Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li><b>Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with    the spell level</b></li>   <li>Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc'    generated by Instrument of Nife</li>   <li><b>Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed    and now work in the planes </b></li>   <li>Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain    skill in an instrument when they are not using one.</li>   <li>Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing    weapons</li>   <li><b>Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced</b></li>   <li>Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable</li> </ul> <p><b>Visual Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li>Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small</li>   <li>Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear    off</li>   <li>Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at    all) when a player zoned in</li>   <li>Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races)    should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was    wearing</li>   <li>Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell    was cast on them</li>   <li>May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game</li>   <li>Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some    zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope)</li> </ul> <p><b>Performance Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li>More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones</li>   <li>&quot;Hitch&quot; created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now</li>   <li>Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a    character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money</li>   <li><b>Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should    now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills</b></li> </ul> <p><b>New Features</b></p> <ul>   <li>Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will    reduce the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this does    nothing. Normal click increases the resolution as it always has and still    wraps back to 640 after the highest resolution your machine supports.</li>   <li>Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and    getting the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all    EverQuest players (these features were restricted only to Velious owners) </li> </ul> <p><b>PvP Changes</b></p> <ul>   <li>It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team on    Sullon Zek</li> </ul> <p><b>Alternative Advancement Abilities</b></p> <ul>   <li>Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 minutes</li>   <li>Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target</li>   <li>Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning</li>   <li>Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just those    cast on yourself</li>   <li>The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when using    Chaotic Stab</li>   <li>LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted</li>   <li>Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted</li>   <li>Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described</li>   <li>Leech Touch should refresh properly now</li>   <li><b>Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second</b></li> </ul> <p>All I can say is that I am very, very, very happy with this patch. ;)&nbsp; </p> <p>Comments, questions, complaints?&nbsp; Discuss them in <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=11934.topic"> here</a> in our forums!</p> </p>

<p>After over a month of waiting it appears that our Familiars can finally be  buffed!</p> <p>Wait, it gets better.&nbsp; Not only can our Familiars be buffed up with the  Firetree series, but they can also be buffed with spells such as Aegolism,  Spellshield, and Divine Strength.&nbsp; Even more importantly Familiars  can now be healed.&nbsp; Perhaps now they won't die so quickly when used against AE mobs. </p> </p>

<p>It seems that Absor has recently updated Verant's list of Luclin bugs and  issues to be fixed.&nbsp; Hopefully these will all be completed within the next  few weeks.</p> <p><b>Issues Effecting Wizards:</b></p> <ul>   <li><font size="2">Wizard pet buff spells do not appear to be functioning    properly</font></li>   <li><font size="2">Familiars die when the wizard cast invisibility.
