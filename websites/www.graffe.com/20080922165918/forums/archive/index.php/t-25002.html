I'm driving a hovercraft over a river/canal system, being pursued by a chopper that keeps dropping fucking mines on me and trying to blast me with a machine gun.. there are cars perched up on the banks of the canal and enemies push 'em down to crush me if I'm not careful.. it's badass.<br />
<br />
I got stuck though; I'm at an apparent dead end where there are two boats blocking one way &amp; a gate blocking the other. I assume I have to get past the boats and then open the gate but I've got a headache so I'll have to try to figure it out tomorrow. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my experiences so far it appears to be a fancy launch bar that sits in my task bar and takes up memory.<br />
To get to that point though I had to enter my details and spend several hours watching a status bar not moving.  Apparently at various stages it was verifying my account (which it couldn't do), downloading files (worrying after I've just installed the game), and then unlocking files (which I gave up on after an hour with no change at 70%, game runs now anyway).  There also wasn't anything in the way of instructions on what to do/expect with any of this in the box which was disappointing.<br />
<br />
You then register the game to your personal stream account.<br />
<br />
I also imagine that this is going to make lending the game to my friends to try after I finish it rather difficult and really make it tough for someone who wants to sell the game after they beat it.</div></div><hr />

The physics engine is AMAZING. So much  so that figuring out the puzzles is a much more fun ordeal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Istari</div><div class="date">November 18th, 2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah I like how they do puzzle progression in HL2 as opposed to a lot of other games. for instance, I recall another game made you click on a tree to chop it down and make a bridge. it had me stuck for like 20 minutes. no other tree in the game could even be interacted with but for some reason this one was choppable. it's always been my contention that if you make these puzzles for progress, you shouldn't do it in ways that the game world works a different way just for this specific instance. nor should you play find-the-lever.<br />
<br />
HL2 manages to make its puzzles out of things modeled off of the real world. all of its physics work the same way in every area. no longer do you have a choppable tree where everything else is indestructible. this works to its benefit because you are not searching around for some stupid random item that works differently from the rest of the world, or pressing 8 billion buttons right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dephton</div><div class="date">November 18th, 2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game is amazing, and i had no issues with steam.  there was a fuckup regarding the storebought boxes on release day but it has since been fixed.  I didnt keep up with the steam content at all until release day, and i bought and downloaded the entire game overnight.  it was about 4 gigs, so i found this to be acceptable, and i never had to see a shitty eb employee.<br />
<br />
A more accurate description of steam, is that is offers up valve content delivery, offers a buddy list, anti cheat, and anti piracy protection for valve games.  it makes server browsing a cakewalk, getting updates easy, and is not very intrusive.  overall, if you have a good net connection and are somewhat comfortable with doing more with a pc than pressing next&gt;next&gt;finish, its a great thing.<br />
<br />
Half life 2 has surpassed my expectations, except the only multiplayer is cs: source, and i hate cs.  I want hl2 deathmatch and tfc:source!  I was impressed with doom, but seeing hl2 really kinda makes me dissappointed with doom3.  hl2 runs EXTREMELY smooth, has a much more detailed gameplay experience, and is simply tons of fun.  It really reminds me of the impact original half life had on fps games when it came out.  half life was truly innovative and groundbreaking, and half life 2 is as well, maybe even on a greater scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Istari</div><div class="date">November 18th, 2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the lack of tfc:source is a major letdown for me. how hard is it to port the mods over to the new engine? it couldn't have costed more than two weeks out of their long development cycle and would have added immensely to it</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's my standard MO, I make a real attempt to lob a basket or can at every innocent head I can.<br />
<br />
I also make a point of smashing as many windows as possible, preferably by throwing things through, oh, and tearing all the tv's out of the wall.<br />
<br />
I went through Ravenhome last night. Oh my god ... it was creepy. I kept thinking... &quot;this is how Doom should have been.&quot; <br />
<br />
Really?  With the gravity gun and sawblades I couldn't help but spout off as many Evil Dead and Army of Darkness lines as possible.<br />
While I'm having a lot of fun I'm mixed over which game (Doom III/HL2) I prefer.  I seem to be constantly looking at loading screens in HL2, so much so that I've taken to keeping a book on my lap as I play.  <br />
<br />
Overall Doom III runs slightly better on my system, my HL2 will lock up when I run over a particularly complex trigger for about 30 seconds or so, usually happens once or twice each mini-level.  Everything thing else is utterly smooth.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing FPS games since the original Wolfenstein/Ultima Underworld.. but for some reason, I can't play HL2 for more than 2 hours because I get motion-sickness.  I've wasted dozens and dozens of hours of my life away per single-sitting on all kinds of FPS game like UT2003, Doom3, and EQ, but I never got such a bad case of motion-sickness like HL2.  I feel like a frigging newbie..<br />
<br />
I never did get stuck on a puzzle for more than 10 min.  They were all intuitive and fun to solve.  Right now, I've finished the water levels and just got started on the Black Mesa.<br />
<br />
---- SPOILER BELOW ----<br />
Thanks for tip on spoiler! :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've gone through sewers and the air-boat level.  It's pretty fun blazing through sewers and swamp with that boat.  Man it's fast and sturdy!  The choppers were being a PITA especially when you had to dodge the chopper fires and had to run around the alleys and fences in the warehouse.  I did get a good revenge but more choppers came later!  So I said f00k it and just got on the airboat and blazed past several sections until I finally got that heavy machine gun installed.  I hope I didn't miss any interesting puzzles or easter eggs. <br />
<br />
Man the airboat kicked a$$ once I got the machine gun installed, though! :evil:</div></div><hr />

i'll be working black mesa today, and i will see if i still get sick.  i didnt even realize thats what had happened until you mentioned it, and ofr a game to cause that for me, it just makes the experience that much cooler, lol, cause none ever have.<br />

I still like halo's health system much more than HL's. halo is really a run and gun tactics game, when played on heroic/legendary, while HL is more of a survival-oriented sort of game: survive and progress. you get limited ammo/health to make use of in HL, whereas Halo gives you limitless health regeneration and about 20 times as much ammo as you could possibly use. <br />
<br />
halo 2/half life are so different as to be incomparable- they may as well be in different genres. it's hard to say which I like more though. I lean to halo 2 at the moment though.</div></div><hr />

This never really changes, seems as you go on the guns seem to have smaller and smaller spare clips.  I'd start listing them but it would take away the joy of finding them.<br />
I tend to switch guns constantly just to make sure that any spare clip lying around won't go to waste.<br />

carry 2 automatic rifles, 2 pistols, the GG, the shotgun (think I have something under the shotgun as well...), RPG, grenades + whatever is to come with zero problems, more than 3 speedloads for the 357 and you are out of space.<br />

<br />
the thing about HL2 isn't that ammo is scarce but that you either can't carry enough ammo for the gun or you go through ammo way too fast. the overwatch standard gun is an assult rifle for which you get 30 + 60 rounds while the SMG will peal off entire clips mega-fast. the second pistol never gives me problems but I usually use it as a sniper rifle of DOOM.<br />
<br />
on one level I noticed something like 30 rounds of rocket ammo lying around, which really does nothing for me because I can't carry nearly that much ammo. with the overwatch guns, there's always a pulse ammo full symbol popping up on me because the capacity is too low on it. you'll still go through it fast and run out if you use it in a place w/o pulse ammo around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the thing about HL2 isn't that ammo is scarce but that you either can't carry enough ammo for the gun or you go through ammo way too fast. the overwatch standard gun is an assult rifle for which you get 30 + 60 rounds while the SMG will peal off entire clips mega-fast. the second pistol never gives me problems but I usually use it as a sniper rifle of DOOM.<br />
<br />
on one level I noticed something like 30 rounds of rocket ammo lying around, which really does nothing for me because I can't carry nearly that much ammo. with the overwatch guns, there's always a pulse ammo full symbol popping up on me because the capacity is too low on it. you'll still go through it fast and run out if you use it in a place w/o pulse ammo around.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you see rocket ammo lying around you are going to have to blow something up in the next minute or two.  <br />

Also, with ammo, once you reach the halfway point in your ammo supply, switch to a different weapon.  If you cycle throuh your weapons like that you will never have a problem.  I was never out of ammo.</div></div><hr />

I was just giving the crazy estimate of hmm. I was driving my boat around dodging rockets though which did screw with my aim, not that it really mattered. I don't need to work on my aim- in tribes I get tons of midair discs(like 25% of my offense is bolstered by style from it) which requires stupid precision.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have never gotten anywhere close to out of ammo in HL, even in ravenholm I had tons left. still when compared to other games I've played recently - farcry, halo 1 and 2, the MOHAA games, chronicles of riddick, and a few others I can't think of - ammo is damn scarce per gun. this is of course balanced by that you can hoist all of the weapons at once, something which is compensated for by the limited guns shooters which give you 90 billion rounds for all your guns.</div></div><hr />

The gunships only take three rockets on easiest, I guess thats what they balanced it against.  Not that they're paricularly tricky to shoot down once you get the hang of how they move.  <br />
The rockets also work very nicely on groups of people.</div></div><hr />

You might find this link handy. I don't think its explained all too well in the game exactly went on prior to the game and thus why everything is why it is. I've not actually completed the game yet as I keep having to do uni work but I am getting there putting in 15mins here and there and ot into, &quot;Entaglement&quot; chapter so far. This link should not spoil anything for anyone as its storyline for what happened prior to the game, but I won't quote it just in case:<br />

The rockets also work very nicely on groups of people.<br />
balancing vs difficulty is bullshit. <br />
<br />
Gunships take 6 rockets on normal already, so especially the Jail breakin mission is ridiculously frustrating when you have 3 rockets vs 2 gunships and almost no health / shield stuff lieing around. You have to blow your cover 3 times to run to the rocket crate to rearm, and be damned if you miss ONE of the 12 shots.<br />
They're not hard to hit but when you're under fire it's not easy. <br />
HL2 is a little too quicksave / load heavy for my taste, I didnt quickload as often in Doom3 nightmare as in 3 halflife scenes  (2 gunships, soldiers from 4 directions later and finally 4 striders outside the museum, which is the ultimate suck because you don't get any rockets till your mates die.)<br />
other than these shitty points the game was damn awesome (-:<br />
<br />
why are all these fps games so short anyway? 15 hours is way too short. half life has much more level content in the game on account of the huge driving regions yet ranks in for that size. where's 30-40 hours of playtime? this is something we should be seeing in fps games.<br />
30-40h FPS games... that's where people start to whine that it gets too repeatative. the ideas to fill 40 hours of FPS are enough for 3 games of today's standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Istari</div><div class="date">November 21st, 2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't played the mission quine is alluding to, but there's a question. would it be possible to use the gravity gun to pull those rockets across and drop them in a neat pile there? it picks them up but I don't know how the level is.<br />
<br />
on fps duration... they are already too short. but people replay halo twice over without complaining of it being repetitive. I think a great example of a game which could run 30-40 hours as an fps and still not be repetitive is Chronicles of Riddick. combine this game with half life 2 and halo 2 game elements and you have the best game ever. riddick, if you don't know, had a compelling stealth game, melee combat game, and shooter game all rolled into one. with HL2's physics/gameplay aspects and a halo-ish health system you'd synthesize the best. face it: shield/health pickups are nowhere near as compelling as self-recharging health/shields that you see in xbox games. <br />
<br />
a fps can integrate melee, stealth, vehicle action, and shooter eliments all with the same game engine and make it work well. these are 4 totally different gameplay styles that are all compelling. riddick was so good because of this. so while a shooter can be 20 hours and get repetitive, a game with all of the above can be 50 hours and compelling. FPS developers need to do this. <br />
<br />
it would work something like having an opening sequence where you're in a regular shooter. then you lose your weapons somehow and have to do a melee game, or ring fighting whatever- riddick had only a small shiv-fighter section. you have to sneak through some area without guns or limited guns use and then steal a vehicle and drive off. FPS has a LOT more than just shooting at its fingertips, and it's a shame that most developers don't utilize the variety in gameplay that FPS can bring. if you haven't, play riddick, it's a really awesome game and illustrates this. half life does so for the vehicle action.</div></div><hr />

No problem. I'm not even sure where exactly it comes from myself. It was linked to me by my housemate earlier today, although I noticed at the top it says:<br />
<br />
Transcript of early script as seen on page 142 of Prima's Raising the Bar book<br />
<br />
Not sure what the &quot;Raising the Bar&quot; book is, presumably a HL2 Strat compliment, but it has come from Prima. I hope it is officially recognised and not just fabricated by Prima because in my opinion it does kind of bring some patchy stuff together. To my knowledge its not in the game, but it should be!<br />
<br />
I would say more about the aliens but I don't know how to use that Spoiler feature  :o<br />
<br />
EDIT: A quick search on Google turned up this on &quot;Raising the Bar&quot;; http://www.primagames.com/strategy/book/6534/<br />
<br />
Seems like a good enough official source in my opinion based on its listed items there.</div></div><hr />

good luck getting there while being shot at by striders.<br />
<br />
in the middle bunker are only rockets because rocket soldiers died there.<br />
<br />
 	I haven't played the mission quine is alluding to, but there's a question. w <br />
<br />
can't G-Gun move the solid metal ammo crates, and in both &quot;low ammo&quot; points I referred to that's the only source (other than looting your dead buddies weaponary, with the problem that they are all alive at the beginning, leaving you with 10-15 seconds of dead time while waiting for 1 of them to get killed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easily done by using the sprint key, using cover and not running through wide open spaces. It does take some skill though. I can run from the start of the ground floor sequence to the middle bunker while having helped kill two striders and not getting shot once.<br />
<br />
<br />
in the middle bunker are only rockets because rocket soldiers died there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well no, I think you will find the map contains the spawned objects from the start. By standing up on the roof, before the load section, and looking down the scripted events do show an NPC being shot and killed who has a rocket launcher. But after the load section the scripted sequence places some bodies which are posed, rocket launchers and ammo in the same positions.</div></div><hr />

Looks like you found one.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so this one took about 12 hours, bout as long as Halo2. Frankly, I felt the gameplay was a bit similar to H2 in that &quot;ok guys, I was done with this section 15 minutes ago&quot;.  Many of the parts seemed to just overstay their welcome.  The fan boat seemed overlong and repetitive. Under the train bridge, having to go back after the generator was turned off, was a bit much.  The 'don't step on the sand portion' ... geh, jump puzzles suck it.<br />
My favorite parts were Ravenholm, and any of the city 17 portions.  That futuristic urban combat thing really works for me.<br />
<br />
As for the story... wtf?  They tell you dick about Freeman, dick about what happened between Black Mesa and city 17, dick about where this scientist came from, wtf the combine are -- nothin.  <br />
<br />
In HL1, the vortegaunts were allied with the headcrabs, and there were a few other nasties mixed in.  In HL2, gone are the other nasties, the vortegaunts are good guys, the combine came from nowhere, and everyone hates the headcrabs -- even though the combine seem to be intentionally launching them into the city.  Not a bad bioweapon I suppose, but it really doesn't fit the past story by itself, and they never bother to mention how we got here.<br />
<br />
The ending gave no resolution to anything, and seemed to be a story cop-out.  Not nearly as bad as halo2, but we have no idea what happened to anyone or anything.  Frankly I was getting a little tired of the super grav gun gameplay at the end -- cool as it was to rip stuff out of the walls.<br />
<br />
<br />
All that said, the game was definitely cool overall, and I'm glad I bought it. <br />
<br />
However, being done, I will now promptly uninstall it, because Steam is an egregious and wholly unacceptable incursion into my computer.  Thanks but no thanks Valve, I don't want your pop-up ads, I don't want your thing runnin at startup -- though I can turn both of those behaviors off, I see no reason why they should have been enabled by default.  Any piece of software that I paid $50 for, and then promptly shows me advertisements is untrustworthy, and it will not be tolerated.<br />

I also don't understand why I get screwed, having bought the damn box, by having to be logged into Steam and have the disc in the drive to play.  Steam downloaders don't need the disc, so wtf?<br />

Thanks for the game again Valve, and as for your publishing aspirations -- well, you got that 'fuck the paying customer' part on your first try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah.  they changed half life to the source engine to see what issues modders would have when porting preexisting mods to the new engine.  they posted that htey chose very specifically not to alter any story or gameplay, so you wont see a grav gun and televisions being ripped out of walls i dont think, but all of hte textures and scientists should pwn.  I'll load it up tonight if i can to give it a go.<br />

also, where are you guys getting /played.  only after beating it?  does leaving the game paused count towards this time?</div></div><hr />

Good old looking at the watch when starting to play and going &quot;Oh crap!&quot; when you look again and notice you have spent 5 hourse playing non-stop. At least that's what I do. :)</div></div><hr />

Installed HL2 from CDs. Created Account, logged into steam, it decrypted the files.  At it's recommendation, I upgrade my video drivers, reboot.  Upon boot, first thing I see is a big popup ad for some HL2 event.  And it wasn't some other spyware, it was from the steam process.  Had a buddy who installed it complained of the same thing.  <br />
<br />
When I booted my machine up the second day to play some more, hello another Steam popup.  Maybe people who bought it over steam don't get that, or maybe you already turned off the notifications , I dunno.  I do know that Steam has popped up 2 unsolicited advertisements on me.  After that, I found the option to disable them.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly being stubborn - because, well ffs, what benefit do I get for having steam running in the systray?  Screw this 'it isn't that invasive' reasoning.  Why does Valve assume I want it there when I'm not playing HL2? Why do I have to authenticate online, and have the GD disc in?  <br />
I'm the consumer here.  I see no technical necessity for it to be running at bootup and no benefit to me, the consumer who bought the thing from the store.  Were I using it for its electronic distribution features, that'd be one thing.   But making an impression like that, I'm not in too much of a hurry to jump on that bandwagon.<br />
<br />
I installed steam so I could play HL2 and that's it.  At the very least, they should have left it optional.  Were it optional, were its load on bootup and notification options disabled by default, I'd probably feel very different about it.  But they're not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
here's a tip. right click steam, go to settings, click the interface tab, and uncheck the launch on startup box. steam is a horrible idea, or at least in execution. the game should not take SIX HOURS out of the box when I get it to run, especially a single player FPS! I shouldn't have to do an online registration to run a game, especially a lengthy one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 OK I think I remember this part. Basicaly what I did was this:<br />
<br />
Get your Gravity Gun ready, start up the car. Outrun the gunboat, it will probably keep up with you, but jump the bridge, turn the corner. Park the car up FAST as you can to the debris using Handbrake, and get the hell out of it. Don't try to blow that thing up.<br />
<br />
Now using your gravity gun, clear out the blue cars (and any other cars you feel necessary to clear a path) with the LEFT click, fast as you can. You will be under fire but use the cars as shields. Hop in your car and tear it as fast as poss, turbo might cause you to lose control, so if you have to lose a bit of health here don't worry too much, there is a tunnel up ahead and I believe the next load point. I did this and lost a bit of HEV to gunfire whilst escaping - hope this helps and is the right part! <br />

When you go looking for the story you can almost find it.  It appears that you can repeatedly talk to some of the vortegaunts by hitting the 'use' key.  Some of them, instead of running through a couple canned responses, will tell you bits of their story.  I'll probably restart again though, because I didn't try talking to as many of the humans as vortegaunts.<br />
<br />
Basically, it looks like the vortegaunts were mostly unwilling slaves.  They negotiated some sort of surrender to a 'lesser master' and a 'greater master', who then used them as shock troops to invade other worlds. When Gordon Freeman slew the 'lesser master' at the end of Half-Life 1, and the vortegaunts saw their opportunity for freedom, and their resistance began.  This also explains what that laser beam was doing to the captured vortegaunts in the citadel; it was re-enslaving them to the master.  Similarly with civil defense in city 17.  They would be humans who were enslaved in the same way as the vortegaunts were.<br />
<br />
The vortegaunts also use alot of pseudo-phsyics babble to try to get around to the idea that everyone exists as an extradimensional being, interconnected to one another.  They insinuate Gordon is like them.  They also mention something about a guiding force that is directing them, and Gordon alike; someone/thing that watches them.  Sounded a little like they were talking about the G-man.<br />
<br />
Dr Breen, the adminstrator of Black Mesa at the time of HL1 was the one who negotiated Earth's surrender.  Eli Vance will share some of that story if you look at the cork board of newspaper clippings when you first get to Black Mesa East when he tells you to look around a bit.  The newspaper clippings give the overall picture of: 7 hour war, Breen negotiates surrender, etc.  Can't read much past the headlines, even with the HQ textures.  I'd imagine whatever Dr Breen was talking to at the top of the Citadel was what the vortegaunts call the greater master.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much what I came up with, though granted I haven't gone past Black Mesa East yet.<br />
<br />
Couple easter eggs I noticed:  on the cork board at black mesa east it looks kinda like one of the headlines says something about 9/11.  thought that was ... out of place, but worth mentioning.  <br />
Also, more interestingly, and game-story pertinent it looks to me like the G-man was one of the original black mesa scientists.  When you get to the first resistance hideout, to the one with the Dr with the pet Headcrab Lamarr.<br />
(Hedy Lamarr, get it? Actress turned inventor of torpedo guidance systems? I digress)<br />
<br />
Anyway, when he looks into the retinal scanner to open the secret door to the teleport room, you'll notice a picture next to the scanner.  The picture is a group photo of scientists from Black Mesa and amongst them you can see: Eli Vance, his wife, the Dr with the headcrab, and someone on the end with sunken eyes who looks a hell of a lot like the G-man.  <br />
<br />
Also, I'm guessing Eli's wife died in Ravenholm given how long Alyx pauses -- but I don't remember whether Eli said she died earlier or not when I looked at the picture.</div></div><hr />

Eli makes a crack that Gordon doesn't look a bit different than he did on the day of the Resonance Cascade at Black Mesa (while Eli has greyed considerably).  The fact that the G-man can effectively stop time for Gordon at the end of HL2 pretty much solidifies it.  It's possible that the G-man sent him on dozens of other one-day escapades (he runs through the events of HL2 in one day; well, one day to him anyway, the weeklong slow teleport notwithstanding) -- but since Gordon doesn't seem to have any memory of anything else, but remembers Black Mesa just fine, I'd doubt it.</div></div><hr />

Great pics! <br />

I did exactly the same as what you did in pic2 although it took me a while to come to that decision. I also had much fun piling up all the crap in the various rooms to block one door completely with barrels, boxes and stuff. They probably just used the other door but I found it forced them to come through the way I had two turrets set up in the cabinets, thus quicker annihilation! Butt-kicking for goodness as Minsc would say! :grinyes: <br />
<br />
On that last pic, a quick note. I'm guessing the one on the right is the &quot;G-Man&quot; earlier referred to? But a thought on that - remember one of the scientist skins in the original Half Life was a G-Man looking type, so it probably has nothing to do with him. I think Draxyn mentioned that above by the way somewhere. And the scratched out one, presumably Dr. Breen the Administrator?</div></div><hr />

That's the full HL1 game in their new 'Source' engine.  They touched up the graphics, and added one or two minor changes - but that's pretty much it.  I don't think you can buy it by itself.<br />
<br />
And as for Maurley's system, I agree.  You should be able to play, but at diminished settings.  The CPU will likely be your biggest bottleneck given the physics and AI.  And yeah, setting Steam set to offline mode is huge for those on the lower end systems.</div></div><hr />

I spent the first 15 minutes walking around throwing things at people.  I was annoyed that there was so much litter for me to throw and even more annoyed that I wasted my time being juvenile.  :)<br />
<br />
Steam doesn't run when I play the game so I am confused at Draxyn's comment regarding Steam in offline mode.  Can someone elaborate for me?<br />

Other than that, I am amazed at the attention to detail the programmers put into this game.  It is very immersive.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed that, for a program just sitting there 'at the ready' is uses 2% of my system's resources, and sometimes more.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal, but it irks me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that HL2 multiplayer is finally out, it's pretty fun, but the downside is that it's all about the grav gun. Even throwing a napkin kills a person in one-two hits. Yet shooting them in the face with a gun requires several shots.<br />
<br />
Go figure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunal</div><div class="date">December 15th, 2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this past weekend I had a chance to try out Half Life 2 on my brother-in-law's computer.  First impressions follow - but first - do you have to log into STEAM every time you play?  It took like three attempts for my bro-in-law's login to get accepted and just to be allowed to start the game.  Also, on the first login, the game downloaded something deathmatch-related and he lost all of his savegames.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, I got in there eventually and started the game.  I can see how the game's physics are impressive and it runs flawlessly.  Excellent game technically.  At the start the atomosphere is that of a city under martial law, replete with guards that look like refugees from Pink Floyd's The Wall.  <br />
<br />
Then I found out that if I walked up to them and bumped em, I would get tazered.  This was cool, I thought, now lets push the envelope.  I bumped em over and over and they kept tazering me.  <br />
<br />
Then I found out I could pick stuff up and the fun rally began.  I threw a milk carton at a guard and he chased me down to tazer me.  But he would only chase me so far before giving up.  Soon I realized that I could do anything to the guards with complete impunity.  Except for being tazered a bit then left alone, that is.  One guard ended up with a pallet leaning against his head, after having been pelted by everything from paint buckets to plastic milk crates to glass bottles.  I was particularly proud of that one.<br />
<br />
What I didn't warm up to is the fact that the first part killed the immersion for me.  They should have sent me to prison or something for what I was doing.  Sure its just an intro, but I was disappointed that there seemed to be no consequences.  It picks up when the game really starts, but why have the guards in the introduction to the game be so milksop and dumb?  <br />
<br />
Not dissing the game, just the intro to the game.  Everything's pretty much been said about the rest of the game and I wanted to get this off my chest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first thing the guards do is prevent you leaving and throw you in a cell for a little &quot;chat&quot;.<br />
Pretty immersive I thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it gives you the chance to get used to an environment where you can interract with just about everything.<br />
<br />
Most people don't think to pick up the little things and in this game, the little things can be very useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The music cues were pefect. Especially toward the end &quot;stay safe&quot; and elevator begins to lower, music kicks off. awesome.<br />
<br />
I thought the ending was fine, nearly every question is (in a way) left without answers, but that seems to be the point. G-Man drops in out of nowhere to be the &quot;right man in the wrong place&quot; or whatever the quote was at the start. Then he steps in out of nowhere to take you back to nowhere, leaving you in some sort of timeless place where he can come and get you again. I think a big set up for HL3.</div></div><hr />

I liked seeing how long you could get them running for by jumping the guide fences in the queue lines and continually throwing things.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed that, for a program just sitting there 'at the ready' is uses 2% of my system's resources, and sometimes more.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal, but it irks me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that HL2 multiplayer is finally out, it's pretty fun, but the downside is that it's all about the grav gun. Even throwing a napkin kills a person in one-two hits. Yet shooting them in the face with a gun requires several shots.<br />
<br />
Go figure!<br />
yes but you can actually catch G Gun attacks with your own G Gun ^^<br />
and especially in long distance fights G Gun is useless</div></div><hr />

It's basically a 3rd party program that they use to register CD-keys, and distribute mods.  It takes a ton of system resources also.  Basically, you log onto steam, then get to choose which game you want to play, even if it is offline campaign games like HL, HLS, Opposing Force etc.</div></div><hr />

Yep.  Steam will then decrypt the files installed on your computer so that you can actually play the game that you bought.  :angry:</div></div><hr />

I couldn't even get through the first level in painkiller. I didn't feel like there was any strategy at all. Massive amounts of mobs just keep coming at you and that seemed to be about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxyn</div><div class="date">February 20th, 2005, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I decided to reformat my hard drive at home, to try to clear up some annoying minor issues.  This is never a difficult process because I keep a ghosted copy of my 'clean' system on another partition, and all my data is stored on a non-system drive as SOP.  <br />
<br />
However, Steam/HL2 are not part of this ghosted image.  Though, the data is all safely stored on my data drive.<br />
<br />
So I will once again state my complaints against the ridiculousness of Steam.<br />
<br />
I have installed, decrypted and registered the game files that are on my data drive.  I went through this ridiculous process when I first installed the game.  But the record of this 'installation' is gone now, apparently stored in the registry or elsewhere on my active OS partition.  Fine. Whatever.  <br />
<br />
So I run steam.exe.  First and foremost I see a big popup letting me know what's going on in the crowbar-wielding community.  I still don't give a fuck and once again have to go into steam's settings and turn off all notifications in the 'messages' tab.  This would be the same ad crap I was referring to in my earlier anti-steam diatribe.<br />
<br />
Now that that's taken care of, I select 'Half-life 2' which is still listed under 'my games'.  This is slightly reassuring because it demonstrates that Valve is well aware that my steam account has indeed properly purchased a copy of Half-life 2.<br />
However, steam now lets me know that it's about to install HL2.  <br />
This bothers me.  Half-life 2 is installed, decrypted and registered. wth?<br />
<br />
On the up-side, it does say that the local files I already have will be used first, and steam will only download what I need.  So I figure, well that isn't so bad. It does apparently also recognize that I have all the data, so this should be fairly quick.<br />
<br />
Clicking 'Ok' I expect to see anything other than the crap that confronts me next:<br />
The Steam servers are currently too busy to handle your request. Please try again in a few minutes.<br />
Gee, thanks Valve.<br />
I'm so glad that I can play this wonderful offline game of yours, according to the whims of internet conectivity and your network capacity.  What a wonderful way you have found to lose a customer.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Postscript - and yes, I tried Steam in offline mode.  Of course, there's no option to run steam in offline mode - you have to seperate yourself from the network, then run steam and select 'offline mode'. (this selection lasts only as long as you're off the network.  You can choose to run in offline mode, but if you reconnect your network connection and run steam again, it'll helpfully switch you back into online mode.  thanks again guys)<br />
<br />
Wisely Valve has protected themselves against any possible such wittiness of software pirates with the insidious:<br />
That game is not ready to be played in offline mode.<br />
Gee. Thanks.  Don't even go as far as Microsoft's hackneyed product authentication and tie the registration to a plurality of hardware devices.  Nope - go ahead and tie the authentication directly to the operating system installation in particular.<br />
Because, you know, gamers never have to deal with crappy drivers which never quite uninstall cleanly and require a reinstall.  Nope.  No-one in the PC gamer community could ever fall victim to such an outlandishly preposterous situation as having to reformat...<br />
<br />
On the upside, my problem does appear to have been remedied.  After quite a bit of UT and WoW testing.  Fuck you again Valve.</div></div><hr />

My internet connection went down a few months ago and now steam refuses to run until it can talk to the outside world. Some crap about not storing my password on the computer even though it ran happily until a few weeks ago. <br />

<br />
Heres a short list:  <br />
1) Textures disappear while playing (not all the time, and I think this may be my video card overheating from constant play)<br />
2) After downloading a map, it crashes back to the initial screen, and the UI is completed fubared (all information contained in boxes is squished into a tiny area).<br />
3) Sound will suddenly start stuttering, usually when I'm in a large explosion.<br />
4) Sometimes it will randomly 'crash' while loading a new level (it almost always loads the first level).  By 'crash' I mean everything works fine, but when I try to join any game it boots me back to the start screen, but everything works fine, no UI errors</div></div><hr />
