      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">We're happy to present today's patch, 
        which focuses primarily on addressing issues that have been brought forth 
        by EverQuest players. We appreciate the opportunity to spend some time 
        focusing on specific issues important to you. Today's patch includes the 
        following:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999">*Disciplines*</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Resistant&quot; Discipline 
          now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 1.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Holy Forge&quot; Discipline 
          now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 2.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Weaponshield&quot; Discipline 
          now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Leechcurse&quot; Discipline 
          now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Deftdance&quot; Discipline 
          now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Puretone&quot; Discipline 
          now lasts 4 minutes instead of the previous 2.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Sanctification&quot; discipline 
          now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The &quot;Unholy Aura&quot; Discipline 
          now gives a 50% bonus to Harmtouch (compared with the previous 25%) 
          and causes it to save versus disease, which should result in even fewer 
          resists in most high-level encounters.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">*Spells*</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">&quot;Lay on Hands&quot; has been improved 
          starting at 40th level.<br>
          - The &quot;Summon Corpse&quot; spell is now available to Shadowknights.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">Corrected a bug that was causing damage 
          while using the &quot;Trueshot&quot; Discipline to be the same regardless 
          of the quality of your bow.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The spells &quot;Focus of Spirit&quot; 
          and &quot;Visions of Grandeur&quot; now stack.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">&quot;Harmtouch&quot; is now resisted 
          as if it were a &quot;Lifetap&quot; spell, meaning that it is all-or-nothing, 
          and nearly unresistable with exception to encounters that are immune 
          to magic or out of the acceptable level range. In addition, maximum 
          damage for Harmtouch has been increased starting at 40th level.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">We fixed a bug that caused &quot;Lure&quot; 
          type spells (Wizards) to be resisted more than they should have been 
          in certain types of encounters.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">Melee attack timers will no longer 
          be reset when a SK, Paladin, or Ranger cast a spell. Previously these 
          classes had to wait a full attack delay after casting before they would 
          attack via melee again. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">*Miscellaneous*</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">You may now adjust the clipping plane 
          in the Hole. Previously, the clipping plane was fixed. Many people requested 
          the ability to bring the clipping plane closer to allow them to improve 
          their client's performance.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">Fixed several problems with trade-skill 
          components that were not dropping. Also added some new recipes.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">Fixed the Iksar &quot;Shackle of Steel&quot; 
          quest. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" color="#999999">The additional options for /camp (/camp 
          server, /camp desktop) have been implemented. /camp server will take 
          you to the server-selection screen. /camp desktop will cause EverQuest 
          to terminate and take you to the desktop.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">*Root and Snare*</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Root-type spells and &quot;snare&quot; 
        type spells now use a separate spell effect. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Previously, &quot;Root&quot; spells would 
        overwrite any snare effect upon the target. When the root would wear off, 
        the target began moving at full speed. With this change, when root wears 
        off, snare will still be in effect. This has a few added effects on the 
        other end. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">For instance, root will no longer cancel 
        SoW or Journeyman's Boots effects. It also allowed us to correct a long-standing 
        bug that was allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's 
        Accelerando if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was rooted. 
        As mentioned in a previous patch where the first part of this bug was 
        fixed, this was not the intended effect.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">*Looting NODROP Items*</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">A new command is now available to EverQuest 
        players. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">In order to prevent the accidental looting 
        of NODROP items, the /lootnodrop command has been added to the client. 
        The command supports three options: ALWAYS (Default) - You will be presented 
        with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP item. 
        SOMETIMES - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when 
        attempting to loot any NODROP items that your race and/or class cannot 
        use. NEVER - NODROP items will be looted without confirmation. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">It is highly recommended that you DO NOT 
        CHANGE this from the default option, as the GM staff cannot assist in 
        cases of accidental looting.</font></p>
