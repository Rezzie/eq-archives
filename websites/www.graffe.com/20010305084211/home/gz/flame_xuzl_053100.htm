        <div align="left">
          <p><b>Graffe</b>: Can you explain the thought behind the Flaming Sword 
            of Xuzl? Lots of mana (700), hits for 50, has very, very, low hp (dies 
            in one hit from a blue mob), and also dies after the mob is dead.</p>
          <p><b>GZ: Think of it as some of the ultimate indirect damage. It is 
            a &quot;pet&quot; that hits pretty damn hard. But you can't treat 
            it as a pet because it really isn't a pet. The sword won't tank, it 
            won't taunt, etc. What it will do is hit really hard against creatures 
            with massive resistances. If you send it in to a fight first, it will 
            die. If you send it in to a fight once there are 5-6 people hitting 
            the monster, then it should last the entire fight and do some serious 
            damage. If people are thinking of it as a pet, they are going to be 
            seriously disappointed - wizards don't get pets in the EQ sense of 
            the word. This is another way to do damage that just happens to involve 
            a npc.</b></p>
