      <p>The Quest starts in Najena, in the jail cells that are guarded by Moosh 
        the Ogre Guard. In the cell that has the injured Halfling is a High Elf 
        enchanter named Linara Parlone. When you hail her she speaks of being 
        released and says that the key she needs is on a Priest that is now in 
        an estate. [/ooc She is speaking about the '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('a_priest_of_najena.jpg','apriestofnajena','width=420,height=320')">a 
        priest of najena</a>' in Unrest (loc +504, +65 on the third floor). He 
        is a rare spawn (a normal ghoul spawns in his place and the spawn rate 
        is once every hour), and was blue to me at Lv 37. Three shots of 318 and 
        he was dead. He drops the Tarnished Bronze Key.</p>
      <p>Once you get the key from the Priest go back and give it to her. She 
        will give you a sealed note. She then tells you to bring it to her father. 
        [/ooc her father is one of the fishermen near the lake in Felwithe. His 
        name is Tolkar Parlone. His loc is -60 + 680.] He gives you a Faded cloak 
        and tells you to bring it to his wife in Erudin so that she can enchance 
        it for you.]</p>
      <p>Bring the Faded Cloak to the Enchanters guild in Erudin and on the second 
        floor of the Enchanters guild you will find her mother, his wife, Trilani 
        Parlone [loc +530 +730]. Give her the Faded Cloak and she will then give 
        you the Mystic Cloak [8 AC, + 5 int, + 5 Magic Resist. 10 charges of Steelskin.</p>
      <p>ALL parts are NO DROP, So once someone gets the key, they must do the 
        rest of the quest. </p>
      <p>This quest is geared for light races. If you are a Dark Elf and wish 
        to obtain this cloak, click <a href="mysticcloak_dark_efl.htm">here</a>.</p>
