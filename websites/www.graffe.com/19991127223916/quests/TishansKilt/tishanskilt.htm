  <p>This quest is given by Vilissia within the Temple of Solusek Ro. If you ask 
    her about the Tishan's Kilt, she will tell you this:<br>
    Vilissia says 'Tishan was once counted among the mightiest of wizards – and 
    his items are items of power. If you are interested in acquiring Tishan's 
    Kilt, you must take a Shadowed Ball from our mortal enemies the Shadowed Men 
    and bring it to Trankia in the Everfrost Mountains.<br>

  <p>This quest begins at Vilissia in the Temple of Solusek Ro. She only lets 
    you know to bring a shadowed ball to Trankia (one of the two barbarian females 
    next to Sulgar of Ice Comet fame) in Everfrost (loc is about +3030 by -2395). 
    I had to camp a very long time to get one, but was told that the shadowmen 
    in South Karana drop them more frequently (YMMV)</p>
  <p>Giving her the shadowed ball, Trankia says 'You must be another one from 
    Vilissia. I will tell you what I tell all the others – you must help be [avenge] 
    my [brother] before I will help you attain Tishan's Kilt. (At this point, 
    she gives you your first of two notes as well, basically it says a reminder 
    of your deed) </p>
  <p>You say, 'How can I avenge your brother ?'</p>
  <p>Trankia says 'My brother was part of a raiding party that adventured into 
    the Caverns of Guk. Somewhere within he was betrayed and left for dead by 
    the dastardly brother of Karg IceBear – Martar. I want you to find me what 
    remains of my brothers body and bring it back to me. I am told that he died 
    within a mine shaft. </p>
  <p>The mine shaft is more a section of Upper Guk that is a little like a maze. 
    The exact location of the mob you are looking for is +1420 by +340, a Froglok 
    called a Shinta Warrior (no, not Shin, Shinta). There are two other Froglok 
    warriors next to him who will aggro to you as well. The Shinta seems to always 
    drop a barbarian head. (lore / no drop, 2 weight)</p>
  <p>After you give the head to Trankia, Trankia says 'Oh Wulfthan, look what 
    has become of you. I told you that you should not have trusted Martar. <name>- 
    as a final service, I want you to kill Martar IceBear for me. He is known 
    to roam these parts. Bring me the Warthread Kilt that he wears and my two 
    reminder notes, and I will give to you Markars Kilt. (You get your second 
    note at this point in time as well) </p>
  <p>I hired a local ranger to help me find Martar Icebear, who seemed to spawn 
    near the frozen river. I finally caught up with him within sight of the Permafrost 
    entrance. Martar conned blue to me at level 41, and took about 900 points 
    to kill - he seemed to be about as hard as his brother Karg (not a serious 
    challenge). As a bonus, since is IS an Icebear, he dropped a Cloak of the 
    Icebear as well as the kilt!</p>
  <p>Now take the kilt, and the two notes you previously obtained to Trankia, 
    and she will give you Tishan's kilt </p>
