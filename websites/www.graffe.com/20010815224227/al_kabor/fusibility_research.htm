        <p><b> Fusibility Research</b></p>
        <p align="left">This is a summary of one player's encounter with Al`Kabor 
          in Great Divide: </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Well I suppose I'll just start from the beginning. 
          Some guildmates and I were doing some clearing in Plane of Mischief 
          when another guildmate says in guildchat &quot;uh, what is Al'Kabor 
          doing in GD&quot;. Thinking this would probably have something to do 
          with the likely GD Translocate, or the anti-gate spells coming in a 
          future patch we decided to show up and see what he'd be talking about. 
          We ported over and ran to the spires where a gathering of people were 
          listening to him.</p>
        <p align="left">When we arrived he was talking about his Fusiblity research 
          and the ore needed to experiment with it. Eventaully he told us that 
          he needed us to go into a nearby cave (ended up being the shardwurm 
          cave) and find the ore.</p>
        <p align="left">Following his instructions we moved to the shardwurm cave 
          and discovered an air elmental holding what looked like a velium great 
          staff called 'Guardian Monel'. When hailed he spoke of how he was guarding 
          the fusible ore and how he also had a brother in Western Wastes which 
          did the same. We told the guardian we were there for the fusible ore 
          and he stated that as long as he was there to guard it we wouldn't be 
          getting any. This was basically a queque to fight him so after about 
          a minute he went down and had &quot;fusible velium ore&quot; on his 
          corpse, although it was not lootable (I'll guess due to the fact that 
          he was being controlled by a GM).</p>
        <p align="left">Al'Kabor arrived inside the cave near the guardian corpse 
          and &quot;looted it&quot;, talking about how he had what he needed now. 
          He then requested the help of an assistant for a second task, and this 
          is where I got lucky. I stated that I was willing to help him (and of 
          course my friends tried to make me sound like a good choice as well), 
          and he started to ask me about what research I have done lately. I was 
          stumped for a second but decided to talk about my interest in Translocation 
          spells. he asked me how I knew of them and I mentioned the gnome vendor 
          in the temple of Solusek Ro, which he criged at the thought of (hehe). 
          He then said &quot;You seem to be of knowledge Zealpath, I believe I 
          can trust you to be my assistant&quot;, and told me to invite 5 others 
          who were present: a guildmate of mine Balludar, Exodux, Raging, Larian, 
          and Shaithan. He gave me a &quot;Full Box of Fusible Velium Ore&quot;, 
          and gave the others coins whose names I did not catch (very hard to 
          concentrate when you're<br>
          the focus of a GM event =0). Finally Al'Kabor started talking about 
          how the type of fusible velium ore that we had found was going to be 
          used by Makil to attempt to create a Sceptre which could contain the 
          energy of the elements.</p>
        <p align="left">He then asked if we were ready, and after getting grouped 
          up I stated that we were.</p>
        <p align="left">He then summoned the group I had formed to Western Wastes, 
          near a large block of spiked velium crystals, stating that Makil would 
          be along soon. Makil showed up shortly after that and Al'Kabor told 
          my group to give the items he had given us to Makil and we would be 
          rewarded. Upon handing in the box I recieved an incredible item, The 
          Sceptre of Al'Kabor, whose stats you will see in the attached screenshot. 
          The people who were in my group also turned in their coins and recieved 
          items although I was in extreme tell hell at the time and did not catch 
          the specific stats on any of the items recieved aside from the fact 
          that the one my guildmate got was a very nice + sv all earring (we had 
          a ranger, paladin, another wizard, an enchanter, and a rogue along so 
          not all of the items were caster oriented).</p>
        <p align="left">After that Al'Kabor told us to gate back to Great Divide 
          and that was the end of the event seemingly. All I can really say at 
          this point is that I feel honored to have been chosen and this quest 
          was an amazing experience. In a game like EQ the chance to roleplay 
          in a practical way only comes along so often, well this was definitely 
          one of those times.</p>
