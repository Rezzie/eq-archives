New Hot Zones <BR>

All New PVP System for PVP Servers * <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
<BR>
The Watch List: <BR>
- Safe Zones: We’’re still looking into a better solution for the problem of safe zones. Expect some kind of change in the future. <BR>
- Point System: There are still concerns of potential exploits with the point system at this time. Therefore the selection of PvP items available on the merchants will be limited to consumable items for now. We’ll monitor the accumulation of points after this update. If all goes well, we will add a selection of equipment to the merchants in the near future. <BR>
- Sullon Tokens: As a secondary concern with the point system, we are delaying the addition of the turn-in quest for Sullon Zek tokens. If there’s a potential problem with the point system that eventually requires us to make adjustments to the way points are awarded, we don’t want players to end up with less than full credit for these tokens. Once the point system has had any potential issues ironed out we will add a quest to turn in your tokens for PvP points. <BR>
<BR>
PvP Combat Changes <BR>
<BR>
- Melee attacks have a 50% increased range. This does not affect thrown weapons or archery. <BR>
- The maximum damage any one spell can do is now capped at 40% of the target’s total hit points, down from 75%. <BR>
- Archery damage has been increased to 80% of its base damage in PvP, up from 66%. <BR>
- Being stunned while on a horse will now cause the horse to disappear. This only applies to stuns caused by other players. <BR>
- Lowered player melee mitigation, effectively lowering Armor Class by 20%. This will increase the damage potential of melee weapons in PvP. Originally the targets full armor class was considered. <BR>
- Player spells now have a separate duration field for PvP. Individual spells will continue to be tuned during beta. <BR>
- Player spells now have a PvP specific resist mod. Spell lines with resist mods differing from their normal adjusts initially include: <BR>
Movement Rate <BR>
Root <BR>
Enthrall <BR>
Mana Drain <BR>
Stuns <BR>
Direct Damage <BR>
Damage over Time <BR>
Pet procs/innates <BR>
- Added higher level snare spells for rangers/druids with increased resists mods. This should allow them to land snare spells with similar frequency to other snare spells. These spells are available on the PvP merchants for 1 point each. <BR>
- Necro and Mage pets have had their PvP resists increased to closer match the existing Beastlord pet resists. <BR>
- Lowered the duration of most snare, Enthrall, and Root spells and abilities. <BR>
- Berserker snare is no longer unresistable. <BR>
- Added a set of pumice stones to the PvP merchants that will cast various forms of dispel magic with a 1.5 second cast, 12 second cast time. <BR>
- Arena deaths will now place you at your bind point, and not in shadowrest. <BR>
- PvP Resurrection effects now last 5 minutes + 1 minute/negative vitality point. The Max duration is now 15 minutes instead of 25. <BR>
- Made further changes to prevent hill ghosting. Please test this and give feedback. <BR>
- Ranged weapons are no longer restricted by the Z axis, allowing greater freedom of use on varied terrain. <BR>
- Snare will now properly slow mounts. The mount will still be faster then normal running while snared, but will considerably decrease their movement rate. <BR>
- Spells now have a minimum chance of landing of 5%, up from 2%. <BR>
- Water will no longer cause you to be immune to people outside of water and vice versa. <BR>
- Zoning with low health will no longer set your hit points equal to the amount of +HP gear you are wearing. <BR>
- Players killed in PvP combat will now spawn in Shadowrest with full equipment. A naked corpse will remain in the location they died for 3 hours. Note that this effectively removes item loot from Rallos Zek. With the addition of no drop augments it became rather trivial to effectively remove item loot from the server anyway, and we felt the benefits of the new death system outweigh the benefits of an item loot system. <BR>
- Players who are killed in PvP combat will respawn with special resurrection effects on them. The duration of these effects is variable dependant on how frequently they die. <BR>
- Summon Corpse Potions are now usable by any class/race. <BR>
- A system to score PvP kills has been implemented. For more information see below. <BR>
<BR>
Scoring System <BR>
<BR>
- The new scoring system will award points to any player who kills another player. If the player is grouped the points will be split between the players in the group. The points awarded will be based on three things: <BR>
<BR>
1. Level of the killer <BR>
<BR>
2. Scoring Modifier <BR>
<BR>
a. Level Difference (Each kill has a base point cost determined by the level of the killer. All subsequent modifiers apply to this base number.)For each level the killer is above or below the victim, the scoring modifier increase by one point. If you kill some one who is higher level than you, you’ll gain more points than you will for a lower level character. You will also subtract points from your modifier for killing a player lower level then you. <BR>
<BR>
b. Infamy Difference - Each time you kill another player, points are added to your infamy pool. At certain thresholds a player will gain an infamy level. When a player is killed, the infamy levels are compared and the killer gains a scoring modifier point for each infamy level his victim is above him. He can also lose scoring modifier points for killing someone who is of lower infamy. Infamy will gradually deteriorate while the player is online. <BR>
<BR>
c. Vitality score - When a player is killed their vitality is set to –10. For each 5 minutes they are alive, they will gain back two points of vitality. This vitality total is added directly to the scoring <BR>
<BR>
d. Group bonus - Groups of 4 or more will receive a bonus % of points for each kill. 4/10%, 5/15%, 6/20%. <BR>
<BR>
3. Time since the victim was last killed by the same player. Players that repeatedly kill the same player will see a steep decrease in the amount of points a player is worth. They will gain half the points for the kill they normally would for each time they kill that player in a 24 hour period. After the score has dropped below 1 point, they will begin to lose points for killing the same player. <BR>
<BR>
Example: Frizznik kills Rytan. Frizznik is level 60, while Rytan is level 62 for a level difference of 2. Frizznik has an infamy level of 5, while Rytan has an infamy level of 2, which results in infamy difference of –3. Rytan has not recently been killed, so his vitality is 0. Level Difference + Infamy Difference + Vitality = Scoring Point Modifier or 2 + (-3) + 0. <BR>
<BR>
- Each scoring modifier point adds or subtracts 5% to the base score. Normally Frizznik would gain 100 points for killing Rytan, but because of the scoring point modifier he will gain 95 points instead. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Leader Board <BR>
<BR>
- The leader board tracks the players with the most total PvP. A number of other useful statistics will be available in the leader board. <BR>
Point Rewards <BR>
- A player’s point total is capped based on their level. They cannot gain more points once they hit that cap, although they can gain more infamy. There will be a number of consumable PvP items that will be focused on PvP combat, and will only function against other players. <BR>
<BR>
Windowed Mode * <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
The EverQuest process is now more friendly. Alt+tab'ing to other windows should be much more responsive.You can also choose to adjust your maximum Frames Per Second(FPS) in the Options Window under display settings. The valid range for the slider is 10 to 100. The default is 100 which means EverQuest will not throttle your FPS. Lowering your setting will cap your FPS at that value and free up the CPU for other tasks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hot Zones have changed! * <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
<BR>
Hunt for greater XP rewards in the new Hot Spots. Make your way to the following zones. <BR>
<BR>
60-65 Plane of Torment <BR>
55-60 Chardok <BR>
50-55 Grieg's End <BR>
45-50 Nurga <BR>
40-45 City of Mist <BR>
35-40 Kaesora <BR>
30-35 Dalnir <BR>
25-30 Hollowshade Moor <BR>
20-25 Runnyeye <BR>
<BR>
Kill a few goblins for me. Oh, and that Grieg guy. <BR>
<BR>
AA Changes <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
- The cleric AA Touch of the Divine has had its healing power increased. The original ability has been refunded, so players who wish to retain the ability will need to purchase it again. The portion of the AA that will remove detrimental effects, when it goes off, will not be going in with this update. <BR>
- The necromancer AA Swarm of Decay has been refunded. <BR>
- The shaman AA Call of the Ancients has had its description changed to reflect the fact that the summoned ward casts healing spells, not endurance regen spells. The ability has been refunded because of this confusion. <BR>
- The rogue ability Seized Opportunity has had its chance to work significantly increased. <BR>
- The druid ability Viscid Roots was increasing the chance for roots to break, not decreasing it. This has been corrected. <BR>
- The paladin ability Hastened Piety now affects the reuse time for both Hand of Piety and its upgrade, Pious Supplication. Previously, it wasn’t affecting Pious Supplication. <BR>
- When an AA is an upgrade of another AA and both are triggered abilities, players can make a hotkey and use either one, but will only get the upgraded effect if they use the hotkey for the upgraded ability. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tacvi Changes <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
- Tacvi will no longer give lockout timers. Instead, when you beat an encounter there, you will gain a timer for that specific event. Then, when you come back to the zone, if that timer hasn’t expired yet that particular event won’t be up, but other events in the zone will be if it has been long enough since the last time they were defeated. <BR>
- Loot in Tacvi has been given a thorough audit. Many changes were made including changes to the statistics of the items, changing item names, changing where the items drop, and over a dozen new items were added to the zone. <BR>
- The Tacvi zone timer was increased from 6 hours to 12 hours. <BR>
<BR>
Misc. <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
- Diamond Dust will now drop more frequently in permafrost and can now also be found in SolusekB * <BR>
<BR>
- Names will now scale with character they’re associated with. So a giant will have a much larger name than a Halfling will while retaining its much smaller brain. <BR>
- Names for larger characters will be visible from a greater distance than the names for smaller characters are. They will also scale up slightly as you increase your distance from a character, making them more readable from a greater distance. <BR>
- Tinting should now work properly again on Robes, let the Fluorescent Pink tinting begin! <BR>
- We have added Tooltips for your status bars.* <BR>
- We have made some changes to the fonts EQ uses so that they are more clear and visible. <BR>

Raid Window Additions <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
<BR>
- The raid window contains a new row of buttons which the raid leader can use to organize the raid members into groups. <BR>
- Lock/Unlock: The raid must be locked before the raid leader may use any of the new buttons. <BR>
- RemLeader: Removes the 'Group Leader' flag from the selected player from the 'Players Not in a Group' list. (Only 12 players may be Group Leaders, so this may be necessary to allow creation of a new group with a new leader). <BR>
- NoGroup: Removes the selected player from their current group and put them into the 'Players Not in a Group' list. <BR>
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: Moves the selected player into the numbered group. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consent Changes * <BR>
_____________________ <BR>
<BR>
There are some new consent commands available for groups and raids. <BR>
- /consent group -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by all of your current group members <BR>
- /consent raid -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your raid (including people who join the raid later) <BR>
- /consent guild -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your guild <BR>
- /deny group -- removes the flag <BR>
- /deny raid -- removes the flag <BR>
- /deny guild -- removes the flag <BR>

------------------------------- <BR>
<BR>
With the update on the 14th, we changed the AA system to allow for more flexibility and control as we move forward and add additional AAs. All of the over 300 AAs were affected by this change. Some of the AAs have since been behaving incorrectly and we feel that these AA problems are enough of a hindrance to gameplay that it is necessary to correct them tonight. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the list of changes we have for you tonight; <BR>
<BR>
- AA abilities that were previously usable when using a discipline, sitting, or under the effects of stun, divine aura, or silence should once again be usable in those situations. <BR>
- Resolved an issue with Warriors Shielding that caused it to cancel instantly <BR>
- A bug in the Iksar Necro skullcap quest that allowed players to obtain it illegitimately has been fixed. <BR>
- Several tradeskilled items have had their values modified to prevent a profitability exploit. <BR>
- The key to Veeshan's Peak is now No-Drop on Firiona Vie <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We apologize to those of you, who had raids and other activities scheduled tonight and thank you for your patience. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks all! <BR>

Headlines! <BR>
------------------- <BR>
Veeshan's Peak has been re-worked. Enjoy the new challenge. <BR>
A new Adventure Zone appears on Stormhammer. <BR>
You can now remove augments without losing them. <BR>
<BR>
Veeshan's Peak! <BR>
------------------- <BR>
With this revamp we have Updated the level and NPC list for the zone: Please note that this zone is now an elemental level zone! The entry quest to Veeshan’’s Peak has been changed. The original key quest has not been modified. However, the new entry quest uses the old key and offers an alternate quest to do instead of the original key quest. <BR>
<BR>
- Items in the zone are now of elemental planes quality. <BR>
- Faction now matters: Dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now speak to players if you have the correct faction and can understand them. <BR>
- New quests and lore: The dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now give players the option to acquire items through questing for them. <BR>
- The zone is now an exp zone as well: Hunting in the areas before the dragons yields experience and loot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New Adventure Zone for Stormhammer <BR>
------------------- <BR>
Stormhammer gains a new adventure zone. This is a 2 group adventure zone for characters of level 65. <BR>
<BR>
Can you help the Eldritch Collective find and rescue Professor Bartleby Beckelbracker? Search the Desert of Ro for the whereabouts of Bartleby and his assistant Bomo and try to save them from the steel clutches of their enemies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Augment Removal * <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- You can now purchase special "distillers" that will remove augmentations without destroying them. These distillers are sold by a merchant in Butcherblock. The item inspect window for an augmentation will tell you which distiller is required to remove it. <BR>
<BR>
- The existing solvents can still be used to destroy an augmentation if you don't want to keep it. You no longer need a different solvent for each augmentation slot. The interface will allow you to select which augmentation you wish to delete. <BR>
<BR>
- For those with custom UI's, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the new augment window. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pets * <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet. <BR>
<BR>
- Pets can be shrunk again. Please wash them in only Cold water to prevent inadvertently reducing their size. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tribute Changes * <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- Some items have had their favor value lowered. <BR>
<BR>
- Players will now "Pre-pay" for tribute benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining. <BR>
<BR>
- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be "Pre-pay" (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed. <BR>
<BR>
- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected benefit load, but will not be able to "preview" the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the benefit will do when activated. <BR>
<BR>
- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active and gray when they are not. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Item Changes <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- Manastones will no longer work in Forgotten Halls. It was not intended for the item to be used there and some naughty folks were taking advantage of the zone. <BR>
<BR>
- Malcohm Thimbleton, in the Plane of Knowledge will now swap out some Robe Graphic items for Tunic Graphics. * <BR>
<BR>
- The Staff of Revealed Secrets now has a 2hb weapon model instead of the little stick it had before. Enjoy your bigger stick. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
UI Changes <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- It is now possible to display your mana as a numeric value on your inventory screen. * <BR>
- By mousing over your buff icons, you will now be able to see the buffs remaining duration. * <BR>
<BR>
Berserkers <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- Berserkers now have innate crits beginning at level 12. <BR>
- Tainted Axe of Hatred now comes in stacks of 20. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Additional Notes <BR>
------------------- <BR>
- You now have the ability to sell back LDoN items and augments to the adventure merchants for a percentage of their original cost. * <BR>
<BR>
- We have increased the number of NPC debuff slots from 30 to 50. Necromancers rejoice. * <BR>
<BR>
- The Doppleganger AA's re-use timer has been reduced to 30 minutes. * <BR>
<BR>
- Sprint and Planeswalk have had their movement rate increased. * <BR>
<BR>
- Beware! Many named mobs in Gates will now summon. <BR>
<BR>
- The Hide all traders option, for the Bazaar, will no longer need to be reset each time you enter the zone. * <BR>
<BR>
- /stopspellcast will no longer give spells recast delays. <BR>
<BR>
- Leadership: Group/Raid mark npc should now update for people that are added to the group or raid. <BR>
<BR>
- Main assist will no longer clear if the main assist zones. <BR>
<BR>
- Bards should once again play the stringed instrument animation when playing a stringed instrument song. <BR>
