<p>Let me say a few things before you read any further into this quest. I have 
  done this in two ways so I don't ruin the quest for anybody. If you wish only 
  to see the text within the book &quot;The Wheel of Tarton&quot; given by Sulgar, 
  click on 'Riddle'. If you wish to see the complete spoiler, click on 'Spoiler'. 
  If you get confused with what rods you have in your inventory, you can use the 
  identify spell on them to confirm. Good luck! - Graff&euml;</p>
<p>The Ice Comet Rune Quest starts by talking to Sulgar within Everfrost. To find 
  Sulgar, zone out of Blackburrow and head for the North wall (loc +3033, -2393). 
  He is standing next to two Barbarians. <i>If you cannot interact with him, petition 
  a GM to correct your beta-neutral faction. If the GM will not help you, Merloc 
  Kole of The Rathe says that all parts of the Tishans Kilt Quest will up your 
  beta-neutral faction.</i> Also, you can try asking about 'Tarton Wheel' (leaving 
  off the apostropy and the s in 'Tarton' and see if that helps) Once you have 
  the rods, go back to Sulgar and ask him for the chest <i>(Be sure to get the 
  chest last for it is a NO RENT item. Once you log out, the chest and everything 
  in it will dissapear)</i> which you need to combine the rods. Upon a successful 
  combining of the rods, you make two items. One is the Staff of the Wheel and 
  the other is the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../equipment/miscellaneous/star_of_eyes.jpg','starofeyes','width=330,height=145')">Star 
  of Eyes</a>. Either of these items you can keep (many use the staff for it's 
  intelligence bonus) or return both to Sulgar in trade for the runes.</p>

<p>This list gives the complete location of each rod that needs to be found for 
  the quest.</p>
<p>1. Azia- In Erud's crossing on the deep part of the ocean floor past the shipwreck 
  infested with undead, location -1162, +2340 (one user suggested levitating to 
  find the coordinates first, then diving for it). Use the best of your shields, 
  load your fades, shadow steps and gates. Acquiring this rod can get ugly. Seems 
  that 'Killer Sharks' (level 40) inhabit this area and make it very difficult 
  to acquire the rods. Some say the sharks see through invisible and some say 
  they cannot. - <b>you have been warned</b> - For even more help on this rod, 
  I suggest looking at this <a href="erud_rod/azia.html" target="_blank">walkthru</a> 
  and also reading this <a href="Azia.zip">text file</a>.</p>
<p>2. Beza- In Everfrost, within the underwater caves, it is in the "house" all 
  the way back and right in the cave, where three Ice boned skeletons guard it 
  in the center of the room. To find the hole in the ice that leads to the underwater 
  cave, goto +2420, -4060. You may or may not need enduring breath for this swim 
  depending on your swimming skill. Jump in the water and swim North. Once you 
  hit dry land inside the cave, keep right the whole way until you reach the &quot;house&quot;. 
  (mob info correction by Talisin Sa`Lidar)</p>
<p>3. Caza- Lake Rathe, Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel 
  leading to a stone tower, its on the top floor of the tower (need enduring breath 
  for this one). This is guarded by water goblins that may attack unprovoked. 
  Be careful for some say they can see through invisiblitly also. - you have been 
  warned - </p>
<p>4. Dena- Dagnor's Cauldron, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. If you 
  face with your back to Kedge Keep, it is directly diagonal left, in a corner. 
  Loc -890, -740.</p>
<p>5. Ena- Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you 
  need a group for, unless you are brave and kamakaze it. Warning: depending on 
  how your video card / colors are set up, the floor may be the same color as 
  the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the Hand and the 
  dar beating on you. </p>
<p>6. Fana- Oasis is correct but the tower is underwater next to the above ground 
  tower, this one is on the top floor of the tower as well. This is guarded by 
  water goblins that may attack unprovoked. Be careful for some say they can see 
  through invisiblitly also. - you have been warned - </p>
<p>7. Geza- Highpass Hold is correct, it is in the water near the waterfall closest 
  to the Tiger's Roar Inn, there are two waterfalls there, the rod is in front 
  of the one closest to the Inn.</p>
<p>8. Heda- Erudin is wrong, it is within the Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark pit 
  there. Some High Elves with the wrong faction may have to deal with an NPC by 
  the name of Riggin Vix, in which they may be KoS to.</p>
<p>9. Izah- Neriak is correct, but it is in the water in front of the bar called 
  "The Blind Fish". The bar has four glass windows that are underwater and the 
  rod spawns right in front of those windows. (If you do not know Neriak or are 
  not welcomed there, I suggest creating a newbie Dark Elf to get familiar with 
  the waterway area, the guards, and the location of the rod before attempting 
  to grab this one. There are MANY guards that patrol the bridge area but you 
  will be safe in the water - Graff&euml;)</p>
<p>10. Jaka- It is in Unrest but not near a mob that drops dwarven armor. It is 
  in the water outside to the right of the mansion. Near where the the Gnome Spelunker 
  is. Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to the Spelunker, there is a 
  very shallow tunnel that is to the right. Within that tunnel lies the rod.</p>
<p> The Runes of Frost and Astral are NO DROP items from the quest as is the scroll 
  they make.</p>
<p>Statistics on the Star of Eyes: It is a jewel that can cast unlimited identify 
  spell.<br>
  Statistics on the Staff of the Wheel are found in the picture at the top of 
  this page.</p>
