          Well I dealt with it long enough. Evil races are really getting worked 
          over in Kunark. There are a couple threads going on the Official Everquest 
          Forum concerning the issue. One is an overview of the complete problems 
          evil races have (which I started... and if you know if I posted there, 
          it really has to bother me) and the other has to do directly with the 
          Brain Bite quest for Concussion (not started by me).</p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>Yesterday afternoon, a few GMs got together and set up a match 
            between "Ahkim Sandstorm" and "Daldrum Oakbreak" in Oasis.. A sand 
            giant and a hill giant, who were fighting over "Granny's" will.. There 
            was constant bickering over who was Granny's favorite and what-not, 
            while "The Referee", a female halfling, directed the fight.. Players 
            were allowed to buff and heal the two Giants, but not to interfere 
            directly with the fight (a few people were summoned a way).. After 
            several minutes of boxing, and occaisional feign deaths, Ahkim fell, 
            and the players supporting Daldrum cheered.. Those who supposedly 
            roleplayed the best were awarded with cash, and one particular cleric 
            in his teens was given a "Sandal Shield": 15 AC, +5 STA, -9 CHA.. 
            After thanking everyone for their support, Daldrum ran off into the 
            Ocean.. Only to return when some Wizard that had been summoned away 
            came back with Ice Comet loaded.. Won't say his name, but he dispatched 
            the Giant quickly, and I believe he dropped 1 copper, as did Ahkim. 
            Thanks to the GMs of Veeshan for setting this up.. We never have events

          Grimstaff took the time to confirm the recent patch fix that took care 
          of the Practice Research components. Here's what he had to report:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>OK I checked out the Practice Research components, and ALL of the 
            missing ones now drop: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Giant Bat wings drop off Giant bats in Misty Thicket at least (possibly 
            in Butcherblock, it was oddly devoid of bats, while Misty had like 
            5 times the usual number). </li>
          <li>Bixie Wings drop off Bixies in Misty Thicket at least. </li>
          <li>Giant Scarab Eyes drop off the Scarabs in North Ro at least (possibly 
            beetles in Misty) </li>
          <li>Froglock eyes were dropping off various frogs in Guk and probably 
            Innothule Swamp. </li>
          <li>I didn't kill the Queen to get her eyeballs and see if those were 
            the right ones because I didn't want to run all the way to Queynos 
            to check and was low on plat to get the gem for that level.

          </font>Cylus of Povar stopped by Xegony last night and paid me a visit 
          to give me some details on the level 59 spell, Flaming Sword of Xuzl. 
          Cylus is the first level 59 I know of to scribe and use the spell. By 
          the way the spell was described to me, it sounds a lot more like a toy 
          spell than anything useful. The 'pet' is an animated two hand sword 
          that is <u>not</u> flaming. It has very low hit points (dies by one 
          hit from a blue mob) and slashes for around 50 damage. Once cast, the 
          sword will only attack the targeted mob and once that mob is dead, the 
          sword dies as well (if it lasts that long).<font size="1"> <br>

          Mootalpar Darkreign of Rodcet Nife wishes to thank his guild of Vengeance 
          for helping him obtain some Carmine items. Not only did he walk out 
          with a Robe, but gloves and a turbin also! Why can't this happen to 
          all of us?<br>

          Kushinata of The Nameless wrote this <a href="../oddities/wizard_pet/index.htm">editorial</a>

          Colbens sent in some info concerning the news from yesterday concerning 
          the Kunark Spell Exchange quest:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>It's my understanding that you must turn in ALL FOUR spells that 
            barnal wants and he will give you ONE of his. Thats why Barnal took 
            they pillar of lightning and didnt return anything. <br>

          The Kunark Spell Exchange quest seems to be broken as well as Concussion. 
          I've had a lot of reports about it and here is Rogen of E'ci's info 
          that he supplied:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><i>Barnal Flamehand asks for scrolls and if you turn them in he will 
            give you a scroll of his own, however if you give him Pillar of Lightning, 
            a spell he wants, he will not give you ANYTHING in return, just take 
            your spell. Just a warning to Wizards not to turn this spell in yet. 
            </i> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> <font size="1">Thanks to everyone that sent in the info!<br>
