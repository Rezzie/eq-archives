  <p align="left">The subquests are the quests for the medallions of Jarsath, 
    Obulus, and Kylong. Each of the 3 medallions consists of 3 pieces each (9 
    medallion pieces + the tooth = 10 piece total quest for the key). Once you 
    have all 3 medallions you simply hand them in along with one of Trakanon's 
    fangs to get your Key of Veeshan.</p>
  <p><i><b>NOTE</b>: You can not use the tooth dropped off the named trakaraptor 
    in Trakanon's Teeth, it must be from the actual poison dragon Trakanon in 
    Sebilis.</i></p>
  <p><i><b>Hint</b>: If you get the medallion pieces mixed up in your inventory, 
    just cast identify on yourself while the pieces are on your cursor and it 
    will give you the name of the segment your holding.</i></p>

  <p><b>Medallion of Jarsath ::.</b><br>
    This quest is given by Xiblin Fizzlebik (-5777, +2943) in Timorous Deep, like 
    each of the medallions, there are 3 pieces you must return to him for the 
    Medallion of Jasarth. By the way, this is the &quot;easy&quot; medallion. 
    :)</p>
  <p>The first portion is located in Firiona Vie and is dropped off the ancient 
    Jarsath. The ancient is a level 40 Iksar skeleton monk (4000 HP) that spawns 
    very close to the mouth of the drolvarg temple at +647, -2097 and roams down 
    the hill to the nearby drolvarg camp then across the road a bit and back. 
    I suggest killing all non-drolvarg NPCs in this area (which there are very 
    few) to get him to spawn, and from what I could deduct the placeholder is 
    a leech that wanders in this area (Note: this does not mean he necessarily 
    does have a PH, it may just be a long spawn but this is what it appeared to 
    be like). Also he is the only undead mob in the whole zone (at the time this 
    was written, assuming they don't add any), so sense the dead works great if 
    you have it. Approximate time it took me: 2 hours.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The next piece is on the blood gill marauder at the bottom of Lake of Ill 
    Omen at -376, -52. He is a static non-roaming lake goblin with 2 lesser guards, 
    level 35-39, and the marauder himself is level 40 (3000 HP). He hits around 
    the 90s, guards hit in the 70s. His spawn point is a few feet inside the &quot;entrance&quot; 
    to the underwater temple here (so bring your fishbone, local enduring breath 
    caster, or potions), even though it ends in a dead end (Note: this is the 
    future site of the zone-in for the pending underwater dungeon). Approximate 
    time it took me: 5 hours, but I left and came back once or twice and likely 
    missed his spawn, I have returned twice since and he was already up both times.</p>
  <p>The last piece is incredibly easy, it's just a bag sitting on the ground 
    in the Swamp of No Hope at +52, +2935, there are no dangerous NPCs in the 
    area. The exact respawn time of the bag is unknown to me, but reasonable. 
    Approximate time: However long it takes you to run to the Swamp.</p>
  <hr noshade width="200" align="left">
  <p><b>Medallion of Obulus ::.</b><br>
    Slixin Klex (-681, -1127) in Burning Woods holds the quest for this one.</p>
  <p> This is one of the more agonizing pieces, requiring you to kill the pained 
    soul in Trakanon's Teeth. The pained soul has a single spawn, static, Iksar 
    spectre placeholder at -1835, -4368, which is pretty close to the ramp that 
    leads down to the Sebilis bubble. He is about level 44 and hits for over 100 
    and his placeholder spawns every 8.5 minutes exactly. Approximate time: It 
    took me 6 hours, and from what I have heard it typically ranges from 4-10 
    hours for him to show up.</p>
  <p>The next portion is from Dreadlands, dropped off a rotting skeleton. The 
    rotting skeleton has a single, static, non-roaming placeholder that spawns 
    at +2246, -5113 which is up on the ledge above one of the spider intensive 
    areas here. As you are exiting the Frontier Mountains zone, hug the wall left 
    and stay up farily high on it to find him. The spot has a quick (7 minute 
    exactly) respawn, but he is somewhat uncommon, and is level 43 (5000 HP). 
    Approximate time it took me: 2 hours.</p>
  <p>The final medallion piece for this quest has its own subquest from Ssolet 
    Dnaas (+4010, +396) in Warslilks Woods. Contrary to the guide on AllaKhazam's 
    site (which is what I tried to do the quest with, but lacks a ton of critical 
    information), you can't kill him for the piece or hand him the burnished wooden 
    staff from Chardok, handing him the staff is your only option. The staff is 
    a random drop on any mob in Chardok (45-60 zone), and drops quite frequently 
    (6 dropping in one night of hunting is not uncommon). The only problem is 
    he is on some type of Iksar faction (not Legion of Cabilis because I am warmly 
    to them) which most non-Iksars are KOS to. Unless you somehow have good enough 
    faction with him to receive the quest, you have to bring along an enchanter 
    or bard to charm him, he is level 50 and very buggy (ie he won't even leave 
    his spawn point if agro'd). Once he is charmed simply hand him the staff to 
    get your medallion piece. Approximate time: Minimal hours of Chardok hunting 
    + however long it takes you to find an enchanter and take them to Warslilks 
    Woods. </p>
  <hr noshade width="200" align="left">
  <p><b>Medallion of Kylong ::.</b><br>
    This is the last and in my opinion hardest medallion. The quest is offered 
    by Professor Akabo (-2540, -2994) in Lake of Ill Omen. NOTE: The professor 
    cons dubious to most people, but will still give you the medallion as long 
    as he offers you the quest.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Chardok: There is a subquest in Chardok given by the NPC ratman Niblek for 
    the first piece. He requires you to bring him a Black Sapphire and a Ruby 
    (I buy rubies in Highpass) for his medallion segment. View <a href="chardok_map.gif" target="_blank">this 
    map</a> and note that the gold section is where you would be entering the 
    tunnel from. However, the directions to his area are simple, and he doesn't 
    roam. As you run up the ramp to the exit a bit and turn around, look to the 
    left of the castle and you'll see a ledge that leads to a tunnel. You need 
    levitate to get up here, and either a group to clear the way or invis (Note: 
    invis works great here on all the mobs in this tunnel except chodikai &quot;dog&quot; 
    models which there can be none or several in the path, up to you if you want 
    to risk it, I did). Follow the tunnel down until the first fork which is Y-shaped 
    and take a right, at the second fork which is T-shaped take a left, and a 
    right again at the 3rd and last fork which is also T-shaped and just hug the 
    wall right. Once you start seeing ratmen slaves (around the 3rd fork) you 
    are pretty much safe from harmful NPCs except the slaves themselves which 
    are like level negative 10. (aka if you actually die to these slaves solo 
    or not you have no business in Veeshan's Peak :P) Niblek is indifferent to 
    everyone as far as I know, simply hand him the 2 gems for your piece and you 
    are set. Approximate time it took me: 15-20 minutes, I got seen by a dog once 
    and had to gate, rest, and try again (but thats not counting getting gems, 
    I already had a black sapphire when I decided to do the quest). </p>
  <p>Kaesora: Now to the dungeon of Kaesora. There is a piece sitting on the ground 
    on the 2nd floor of the library here, click <a href="kaesora_map.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> 
    for a map. Kaesora is a low (30ish) level zone and you will need both regular 
    invis and invis vs. undead to get down here if you really don't want to be 
    seen, but the majority of the MOBs in the way are undead (the spiders are 
    live). The &quot;respawn&quot; on this piece is 2 hours, 10 minutes. Approximate 
    time: 5 minutes if the medallion segment is up to 2 hours 10 minutes if you 
    just missed it.</p>
  <p>Karnor's Castle: This is the hardest section of all save the tooth from Trakanon 
    in my personal opinion. It is located in Karnor's Castle on Verix Kyloxs remains. 
    He is a level 51 shaman Iksar skeleton, and a fairly rare spawn. Verix spawns 
    in the sewers. Enter sewer from moat, when you rise out of the water take 
    a right and then the next right (if you take either of the lefts you come 
    across additional water spots). You'll be in a room with a staircase on your 
    right-ish and two adjacent rooms on your left. First left room has 3 skeleton 
    pops, next room has 4ish skeletons and Verix or his ph. Verix is a shaman 
    and he summons.</p>
  <p>The placeholder is the &quot;decayed kylong&quot;, who spawns every 20-30 
    minutes. This particular area of Karnor's is a great place to farm since you 
    can pull turnkeys and skeletal caretakers here. Approximate time it took me: 
    5-6 hours, it varies.. but the hard part is getting a group competant enough 
    to hold the area for a while. </p>
