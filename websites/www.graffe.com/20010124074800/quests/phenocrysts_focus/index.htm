  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deep 
    in the bottom of the mines in Thurgadin resides a Coldain drawf named Normon 
    Stonetooth. You can reach him by going into the mines invis, taking first 
    right, going down a ladder, then hopping over three sections of rail, then 
    entering a large room, taking a left, then a right. He's behind a large chunk 
    of crystals. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, 'hail Normon Stonetooth' <br>
      Normon Stonetooth seems to ignore your greeting, peering at the stone in 
      front of him intently as if reading some invisible text. After a long while 
      he sighs deeply and says, 'Somethin I kin help ye with, whoever you are?' 
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, 'who are you talking to?' <br>
      Normon Stonetooth speaks as he continues staring at the stone, 'I mine. 
      So they call me a miner. Name's Normon, Normon Stonetooth, Normon the miner..,Did 
      I say I mine?' </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, 'what do you mine?' <br>
      Normon Stonetooth says 'Well I look fer Velium acourse. But ye know, I pull 
      very little of it out o the mundane rock these days. Sometimes I hear it 
      whisperin to me. The stone, the Velium, everything down here talks to each 
      other. If ye're lucky enough they tell ya secrets. That be why I listen 
      more these days than pull Velium. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, 'what secrets?' <br>
      Normon Stonetooth snickers and says, ' Now iffn I told ye that it wouldn't 
      be a secret no more now would it? No, I cant tell ya what they tells me, 
      but I kin help ya ta listen. But first ye'll need ta do me a favor heheh.' 
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, 'What favor?'<br>
      Normon Stonetooth says 'Ahh, well me pick is a bit dull, don't cut like 
      it should. Up in the city proper ye kin find a weapons smith named Hakon. 
      Take me pick axe and and tell him Stonetooth sent ye. Then give it to him, 
      wait fer him ta sharpen it, an bring it back to me. Then I'll help ya ta 
      listen to the stone.' </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hakon 
    is in a weapon shop near the bank in Thurgadim. Give Hakon the Pick Axe and 
    &quot;a small piece of velium&quot; (these are the stackable kind from Crystal 
    Caverns, dropped off orc miners).</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hakon 
      Brightsteel says</b> 'Excellent! I'll get ta work now.' Hakon whistles an 
      unfamiliar tune as he repairs and sharpens the pick axe. 'Here ye are Zeldan 
      . Watch that old Stonetooth, he's a few steins short of a keg, if ye know 
      what I mean' </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
    get the pick back plus the following faction adjustments: Coldain (better), 
    DainFrostreaverIV (better), Kromzek (worse), and Kromrif (worse). Go back 
    into the mines and return the pick axe to Normon. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Normon 
      Stonetooth says</b> 'Ahhhh, good work Tashia. Now ta speak with the stone 
      ye need somethin ta focus on. Use this piece o Velium as yer focus. Ta speak 
      the language o the stone ye need ta slow down like the stone. Rock looks 
      like it don't move but it does, just real slow. So place yer focus on the 
      stones ye wish ta speak with and get yerself real slow, both yer body an 
      yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An that's what's 
      to it. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
    receive an item in return called a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('velium_focus.jpg','veliumfocusstat','width=330,height=145')">Velium 
    Focus</a>. You then bring this Velium Focus item to Phenocryst, a named geonid 
    in Wakening Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves. You can hail him and 
    such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can tell. <i>It's 
    very important to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo 
    does not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro 
    the geonid. No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.</i></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, hail Phenocryst. <br>
      Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if you are hearing your own 
      thoughts. 'We sense you are attempting communication with us but do not 
      understand what it is you are trying to convey. We are eager to know more. 
      Perhaps there is one who knows the language of the stone and will speak 
      with us' </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hand 
    Phenocryst the Velium Focus. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phenocryst 
      speaks to you from within your mind, 'You know the stone! This is wonderful! 
      The fullfillment of the prophecy is now one step closer. The most ancient 
      of the stone tells us that one not of stone will come forth and act as our 
      harbringer of asscention. We believe you to be our harbringer. Please help 
      us!' </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>You 
      say</b>, 'how can I help you?'<br>
      Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well as conveys a sense of joy 
      empathically. 'It is said that the harbringer will find all of our people 
      and unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences and perhaps 
      then be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our asscention. We 
      implore you to find others like us and make them aware of us. You know the 
      language of the stone and can tell them. We await your return with proof 
      that you have spoken to them." </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
    you have to go to Crystal Caverns. If you invis up and head down into the 
    caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area, then a tentacle 
    terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel leading 
    up to a zone out point. That long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids 
    and they con the same as the ones in Wakening Land. Give one of them the focus 
    (any one, doesn't matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll 
    get it back with the following message: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
      geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as anything of importance. You 
      attempt to speak with the geonid through your velium focus but all you are 
      able to hear is the same though over and over.., Eat. You have gained no 
      knowledge from these creatures but you notice your focus has been altered 
      slightly.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered. Take it back to 
    Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him. The following will happen:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phenocryst 
      sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling of disappointment washes over you, 
      'It seems the others are not aware of themselves yet. We are alone..So many 
      questions yet we can find no answers. We have been given a very special 
      gift but without direction we are lost. We must find who has made us aware 
      of ourselves and why it has done so.' </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
      say to Phenocryst, "Find what?" <br>
      Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to it. We must make 
      ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be constructed to 
      amplify our voice. The stones we will need are not found in this area though. 
      We hear whispers of stones far away that have the ability to channel and 
      amplify our thoughts. We ask you to gather these stones for us harbinger." 
      </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
      say to Phenocryst, "I will gather these stones for you." <br>
      Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you Harbinger. We need 3 crystals. 
      One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron. These minerals 
      will only be found deep within the earth where the geology is relatively 
      stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right crystals. Return it 
      to me with the 3 crystals and we will construct our Menhir. Please hurry 
      Harbinger, our prophecy awaits. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phenocryst 
    gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones. It's a magic, 
    lore, no drop Elbaite Focus <i>(picture needed)</i> that has 5 charges of 
    Identify. It looks like a fire emerald. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide. If you enter the wurm caves 
    in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the first right, go in 
    and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two spawn points for wurms 
    and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back of the room. The stibnite 
    is behind the crystals and looks like a bag on the floor. It spawns every 
    1-2 hours or so I think. The description of the item is "<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('bent_metallic_crystal.jpg','bentmetalliccrystalstats','width=330,height=145')">Bent 
    Metallic Crystal</a>". It weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop. When 
    you identify it, it identifies as "Stibnite for the Menhir". To identify an 
    item using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right 
    click it on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory. It won't change the description 
    of the item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat window. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    Beryl crystal is in Split Paw. Apparently, this crystal can spawn in a few 
    different places within Paw. The easiest one is found when you enter Split 
    Paw and walk just until you reach the first open room, it's in there on the 
    floor at location 0,0 pretty much. It's not so much a room as it is an open 
    patch in the hallway with straw on the floor. Two gnolls spawn here on either 
    side of the room. The spawn time here is probably the same. The second place 
    known for it to spawn is behind onf of the stone pillars near the entrance 
    of the underwater tunnel leading to the Ishva area (+690, -17).<br>
    The item is called a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('reddish_crystal.jpg','reddishcrystalstats','width=330,height=145')">Reddish 
    Crystal</a> and it's also magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 10.0. It identifies 
    as "Beryl for the Menhir". </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods. It's sitting on the bottoem edge 
    of the crashed meteor near Slixin Klex. It's item description is "<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('heavy_metallic_crystal.jpg','heavymetalliccrystalsstats','width=330,height=145')">Heavy 
    Metallic Crystal</a>" and is magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 14.0. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take 
    these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to Wakening Lands to Phenocryst 
    and you're ready for the next step. Get 1-2 parties of 50+ players and bring 
    'em with you. Due to the dragon that spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon 
    portal, you might want to approach from skyshrine. If you're going along the 
    wall from skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the 
    second cave entrance along the wall. Phenocryst is closest to that entrance. 
    Get to know the path between you and him at this point so you're familiar 
    with how to get out in a hurry. At this point, all the geonids should con 
    amiable to you. Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this faction adjustment. 
    Make sure you have a ranger in your party of friends. You're going to have 
    to track down some triggered MOBs and fight them. You submit the items to 
    Phenocryst. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phenocryst 
      makes no sound but it's voice fills your mind. 'We have always held our 
      memories within the earth and stone but only recently have we become aware 
      of them. We do not know what happened or who gave us this wonderful gift 
      but we can now access those memories and are aware of it's storage. With 
      that knowledge has come questions and desires. When the prophecy comes to 
      be then we will have our answers and fulfill our desires.' </font></p>
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phenocryst 
      's familiar thoughts flood into your mind again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, 
      take this Focus as a mark of your friendship with us. Now we can construct 
      the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak.., There is a problem. Ones of 
      flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of them. They must not disturb us while 
      we construct the Menhir! Please stop them Harbinger! bring us proof of their 
      distruction along with your Focus and then we will begin the calling. Our 
      asscention is at hand!'</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
    lose the focus and the three crystals and in return gain another focus item 
    with the description "Azurite Focus". It's a magic, lore, no drop item weighing 
    0.5. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
    head outside and start tracking. After a few minutes, two "accolyte of Zek" 
    giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond 
    will show up on tracker as well. You'll have to run out and pull the accolytes 
    to you once you track them. If they are snared, they still run quite fast. 
    These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant. Make sure you pull 
    these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest. They get attacked 
    by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you 
    can do the job. If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do. After 
    killing both accolytes, loot them. Each one has a medalion that has the description, 
    "Holy Symbol of Zek", which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0. After the accolytes 
    are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest. Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually 
    walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody pulls it. After 
    a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops, which is why you have to 
    do the accolytes first (they pop first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to 
    the cave probably if you can't find him, the accolytes might not). The bloodpriest 
    cons blue at 52 and is just as magic resistant. He drops a third and final 
    medalion with the same description. You must get all three medalions in order 
    to for this part to prove fruitful. When you kill the giants, you take the 
    following faction hits: Kromzek (worse), Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), 
    and ClawsofVeeshan (better). The giants never enter the caves to attack the 
    geonids or anything. Everything will happen outside the caves and the giants 
    won't aggro the dragon if it's up either. The Bloodpriest Loukond is also 
    not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who wanders in the area 
    sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now. 
    Take your Azurite Focus and the three medalions to Phenocryst. Submit them 
    to Phenocryst. </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phenocryst 
      's thoughts become your own, a feeling of joy overwhelms you, 'Because of 
      you we can at last speak with our maker. We were once given a gift, and 
      we ask that you accept this gift from us now so that we may come closer 
      to that which we owe our sentience to. Now..,we must construct the Menhir..' 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
    lose the Azurite Focus and medalions and get the following item in return, 
    which is, it seems, the reward for this quest.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../../equipment/miscellaneous/phenocrysts_focus.jpg" width="310" height="125"></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
    then geonids, led by Phenocryst, start walking around, through the halls and 
    such. When this happens, you see the following message: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Phenocryst 
      begins to resonate. All the stones about you begin to resonate seemingly 
      at its command. The Geonids all begin moving, all to construct the Menhir." 
      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm 
    assuming they get together at this point at make their <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('menhir.jpg','menhir','width=660,height=500')">Menhir</a> 
    and the quest is over. I didn't stick around to watch because we got some 
    tar goo on us and that put a dampener on things real quick. <i>It's very important 
    to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo does not and 
    if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid. 
    No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.</i> Also, 
    enchanters can skip a huge chunk of this quest by casting Collaboration on 
    Phenocryst and starting from the point where to say to him "I will gather 
    these stones for you". The Velium Focus half gives you the faction to be able 
    to tell that to Phenocryst. Provided an enchanter MAKES him amiable, they 
    don't have to bother with the first half.</font></p>
