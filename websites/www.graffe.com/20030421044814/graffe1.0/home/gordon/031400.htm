        <p>You miss the whole point entirely - Wizards have many weaknesses, a total
lack of spell diversity, no pets, no real buffs or debuffs, no group friendly
spells, and no variety. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, the trade-off was supposed to be doing more damage than any other
class. More damage and more powerful are two totally different things. <i>Why</i>
do necromancers and mages consistently out-damage wizards, yet necromancers and
mages have buffs, debuffs, pets, healing, invulnerability, DoT, and on and on
and on?</p>
<p>Verant has given Wizards all the down-sides to being a one-dimensional damage
dealer, but the fact is that we do <u>not </u>do more damage than mages or necromancers.
How can you justify that?</p>
<p><b>No where did anyone say this, and I'm sorry if that's what you got out of
the FAQ. Take the FAQ to mean direct damage, or take it to mean damage in a
given amount of time, in either case, wizards take the cake. You do more damage
in X seconds than anyone else can do. You're spells do more damage than anyone
elses direct damage spells.</b>
<p><b>Did you expect that you'd be able to do more damage in a full load of mana?
I'm sorry, that just isn't the case. Most of the other casting classes can do
more damage than wizards can in a full load of mana, it just takes a LONG time
to do it.</b>
<p><b>I wouldn’t expect this to change dramatically. We are toying with the
idea of giving you a new series of spells to help in certain conditions, but
that’s basically it. Nothing dramatic.</b>
