          <i>&quot;Hiya Graffe....I can confirm what Tyria sent to you. Last night 

          I sat down in the bank to make extra spells and try Energy Storm...I 

          fished thru 3 different bags, collecting Fulgration runes. I have 3 

          piles of them, one which is stacked, and 2 individuals that do not. 

          Same price at the vendor, too. I failed at my attempt of energy storm, 

          too (rats). Cheers!&quot;</i><br>

          <i>&quot;Weird thing happened to me. i hit 29 and wanted to make energy 

          storm, which required a rune of fulguration. i looked in my packs, and 

          in fact did have 2 different runes of fulguration that did not stack. 

          i asked around, and was told to check a vendor. the vendor gave me the 

          EXACT same price down to the copper for each different rune of fulguration. 

          i had a 50/50 chance to make the spell and guessed right, but this was

          Hail Norrath Travelers, I am pleased to announce that after months of 

          work EverQuest Maps has finally opened it's doors in hopes of providing 

          an invaluable resource to the EverQuest community. Since it's opening 

          one week ago many players have contributed to the site's 40 maps, over 

          60 landmarks, and almost 600 items in the database. Almost every aspect 

          of the site can be discussed and commented so players can share and 

          correct information. Expect much more in the months to come as we bring 

          you information about a zone's beastery and NPC as well as Merchants. 

          I hope to see you there! <br>

          sent this in:<br>

          <i>&quot;For those of you that have accidentally lowered your faction 

          in the Temple of Solusek Ro, there is an easy way to regain the faction. 

          In Mistmoore, there is a mob called Ssynthi, which I believe drop the 

          Robe of the Keeper. If you go into the crypt in front of where he spawns, 

          there should be a flower on top of the casket. If you pick this up and 

          give it to Ssynthi, your faction with Shadowmen will go down, and your 

          faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro will go up. The flower spawns 

          very fast, so you could do this quite easily. However, I am not sure 

          if Ssynthi will attack you if you already are KoS in the Temple.&quot;</i><br>

          Thanks Merlynn!<br>

          On a side note, I do know that Ssynthi will not talk to you if the NPC's 

          in Solusek Ro will not talk to you. If this is the case, spend a lot 

          of time killing off Shadowmen or ask a group camping them if you can 

          throw in a couple damage spells here and there just to get faction (Bonds 

          of Force or non-damage spells will no longer effect faction. I've even 

          noticed that you have to do more than 'a little' damage to get a faction 

          adjustment. Your lowest level DD or AE will not always work) - Graff&euml;</p>

          in the geometry in Upper Guk while looking for the Necromancer's hidden

          my petition, I fell through the world and took the 'ol 10,000 hp damage

          Xentrix for coming to my rescue! With all of the people complaining 

          about customer support, I feel they need some good publicity. Not once 

          was I ever helped in Ultima Online *yuck*, yet in Everquest, I have 

          at least always been contacted. The Guides and Senior Guides give up 

          play time to log in and deal with our problems. I think they need a 

          good word or two. Also learned a new trick from a Guildmate Cleric, 

          Nytewolf. He was able to Experience Res me <b>twice</b> (after I had 

          a brain fade and pulled the full Shadowmen camp spawn on top of me) 

          which almost gave me all of my experience back (around 80 to 90 percent). 

          I'm sure this will soon be nerfed. =) In completing the quest, I added 

          a bit of extra info to the spoiler part of the quest page to help you

          a friend of mine that volunteered to help me out with things here when 

          I start getting bogged down. Everyone, meet Cypren Kennelan. Cypren 

          has been a very good friend in my short Everquest life and has always 

          stunned me with his knowledge of the game and it's dynamics. He came 

          to me the other day and offered his help and I must say I am one lucky 

          person to have him aboard. He will be here as backup for me when the 

          e-mail load starts to grow, so if you have been holding off mailing 

          me because you knew I was swamped, feel free to hit that send button! 

          Cypren can be reached directly at <a href="mailto:cypen@graffe.com">cypren@graffe.com</a> 

          or you can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">graffe@graffe.com</a> 

          with any questions and we both may answer you. Here! Here! Cypren!</p>

          don't ask me to teach you all of them, I need my game time too...hehe).

          in concerning the Ice Comet Quest:<i><br>

          &quot;I am a level 25 wizard, and since I'd recently heard that any 

          level wizard could collect the 10 rods and create the staff of the wheel 

          I decided to give it a go myself. While trying to obtain the Erud's 

          crossing rod, which I think is definately that hardest to get, I found 

          a nice trick that might be worth trying if you have a high-ish swimming 

          skill and feel lucky. I had died 4 times trying to get the rod in Erud's 

          crossing and was close to giving up, as the killer sharks seemed to 

          be there EVERY time I took the dive, and would attack me immediately, 

          and could see through invisibility, so I decided to make one last charge. 

          There are a lot of pesky zombie sailors running around the island and 

          a few of them spawn next to the boat that is just infront of the rod. 

          As I jumped into the water a few of them attacked me, but i kept swimming, 

          and they followed me down and to my utter surprise, the killer sharks 

          started attacking the zombies instead of me, which gave me the time 

          I needed to grab the rod and swim like hell towards shore. I owe my 

          life to one of those zombies :) ....so, it may be worth while dragging 

          a few zombie sailors down after you to distract the sharks while you 

          make off with the rod. It worked for me :)<br>

          <i>&quot;I got my staff of the Wheel when I was lvl 25 as well. But 

          I asked a GM this, and a GM told me this. That the Staff of The wheel 

          has nothing to do with Research, but has a failure rate, as in, if a 

          Warrior got the stuff and combined the staff, he could get a Wheel staff, 

          although could not use it. But that same warrior could also fail. Research 

          has nothing to do with it:) Enjoy Glinlor Stormweaver 32th Circle Wizard
