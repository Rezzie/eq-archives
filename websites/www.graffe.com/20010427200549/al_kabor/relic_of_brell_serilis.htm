      <div align="center"><b>The Relic of Brell Serilis</b> 
        <p align="left">At last, with the long sought after scroll in his possession, 
          the mighty Al'Kabor unravels the secret behind the demise of the Kedge 
          race. Phinigel Autropos, the last surviving Kedge, consigned his brethren 
          to permanent undeath with a magical spell of great power. Al'Kabor, 
          armed with this knowledge, confronts Phinigel. The unspoken threat that 
          he could use the very same spell on Phinigel himself is made clear, 
          unless Phinigel cooperates with the wizard. The last Kedge is not one 
          to take such threats lightly, however, and though he could more than 
          likely destroy arrogant Erudite, he reasons it wiser to teach him a 
          valuable lesson rather than risk his own life.</p>
        <p align="left">Phinigel uses his arcane magic to send out a vision of 
          an ancient artifact, long guarded by his minions, the aqua goblins. 
          The Hammer of Dagnor Butcherblock, the first dwarven king, appears before 
          the dwarven rogue Duskan Hammerhand and a dark elven cleric named Teuil 
          N'Mar. In the vision, the hammer is revealed, secreted beneath the murky 
          waters of Dagnor's Cauldron within a barnacle-encrusted tower, and guarded 
          by aqua goblins. Duskan recognizes the holy relic, and immediately makes 
          a foolish attempt to retrieve the hammer alone, desiring the glory of 
          the successful deed solely for himself. He fails, narrowly escaping 
          the aqua goblins with his life.</p>
        <p align="left">Crawling along the shore, barely coherent and near death, 
          Duskan manages to convince a party of passing adventurers to escort 
          him to his King. When Duskan is brought before King Kazon Stormhammer 
          and reveals his story of the vision and his botched raid, the King organizes 
          an expedition for the recovery of the Butcherblock Hammer, known among 
          the dwarves as Dagnor's Fist. Three dwarven champions are chosen to 
          head the effort: Boris Stormhammer, the King's nephew, Kalek Orefinder, 
          and Fenric Ogrebane, son of the legendary Furtog Ogrebane. These three, 
          aided by the adventurers, easily cut down the aqua goblins guarding 
          the hammer. As the goblin Tidal Lord is dying, Phinigel Autropos himself 
          appears. He stymies the dwarves and adventurers, driving them back. 
          Then, as swiftly as he appeared, he disappears. The dwarves and adventurers 
          finish off the last goblin and rescue the hammer.</p>
        <p align="left">As they march victoriously back to Kaladim, a dark elven 
          raiding party ambushes and slaughters them. In the fight, the dark elven 
          wizard perishes, preventing the raiders' return to Neriak. The leader, 
          Valkis D'Vinn, carefully seals the captured relic in an enchanted adamantium 
          chest, and orders his group to march to Crushbone, where another dark 
          elven wizard awaits.</p>
        <p align="left">Fenric, thought dead but actually feigning, overhears 
          these plans, and immediately seeks help once they leave.</p>
        <p align="left">The dark elven raiding party discovers upon returning 
          to Crushbone that the wizard they sought, Szasi R'Alis, is dead, along 
          with Grak Crushbone, who died defending her. Valkis attempts to bargain 
          with the adventurers who surround them, but is quickly cut down. The 
          sealed Adamant Chest of Thex passes into the possession of the adventurers, 
          who return to Kaladim to deliver the chest to King Kazon. The Dwarven 
          King declares the dwarf in the party of adventurers his champion, and 
          instructs him to return with the key to the chest.</p>
        <p align="left">The adventurers travel to Nektulos and slay Captain Na'Var, 
          holder of the key. The Captain struggles, but is outmatched. The adventurers 
          take the key back to the King, who rewards them with baubles from his 
          treasury. The King then declares the dwarf adventurer who was integral 
          to the success of the mission to be Champion of the Dwarves, and Guardian 
          of Butcherblock's Hammer.</p>
