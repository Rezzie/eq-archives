<p><font color="#999999" size="2">The Quest starts in Najena, in the jail 
        cells that are guarded by Moosh the Ogre Guard. In the cell that has the 
        injured Halfling is a High Elf enchanter named Linara Parlone. When you 
        hail her she speaks of being released and says that the key she needs 
        is on a Priest that is now in an estate. [/ooc She is speaking about The 
        Priest of Najena in Unrest +504, +65. He is a rare spawn (a normal ghoul 
        spawns in his place), and was blue to me at Lv 37. Three shots of 318 
        and he was dead. He drops the Tarnished Bronze Key.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#999999" size="2">Once you get the key from the Priest go 

        back and give it to her. She will give you a sealed note. She then tells 

        you to bring it to her father. [/ooc her father is one of the fishermen 

        near the lake in Felwithe. His name is Tolkar Parlone. His loc is -60 

        + 680.] He gives you a Faded cloak and tells you to bring it to his wife 

        in Erudin so that she can enchance it for you.]</font></p>

      <p><font color="#999999" size="2">Bring the Faded Cloak to the Enchanters 

        guild in Erudin and on the second floor of the Enchanters guild you will 

        find her mother, his wife, Trilani Parlone [loc +530 +730]. Give her the 

        Faded Cloak and she will then give you the Mystic Cloak [8 AC, + 5 int, 

        + 5 Magic Resist. 10 charges of Steelskin.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#999999" size="2">ALL parts are NO DROP, So once someone 
        gets the key, they must do the rest of the quest. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#999999" size="2">This quest is geared for light races.
