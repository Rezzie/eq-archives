    can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn, 
    open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow 
    the hallway around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door 
    upon your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to 
    everyone. Hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman and you will 
    receive positive TrueSpirit faction. <i>(Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00,

      shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro himself tutored 
      them. He considered them to be like his own children. I know of one who 
      still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor. He used to specialize 
      in the storing of magic into physical objects. Arantir has been hiding for 
      many, many years and will most assuredly be going by another name, so keep 
      your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue my research. Return to

    to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was thinking 
    when they did this part of the quest. There are <i>zero</i> clues as to who 
    or where this person is and honestly, it's sort of disturbing to me that every 
    other class' quest is straightforward, but still has a very good degree of 
    difficulty. None the less, there is a female NPC vendor in Halas named '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('dargon.jpg','dargon','width=149,height=363')">Dargon</a>' 
    that sells a potion called <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('ros_breath.jpg','rosbreath','width=330,height=145')">Ro's

    and charisma. <i>(**evil races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's. 
    See <a href="halas.htm">this page</a> for Halas Guard and Vendor info**)</i>.

    them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed that 
    you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge, 
    and then take it to Dargon. Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas will make 
    her turn into Arantir and the quest will continue.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Camin 
    gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of Lava 
    charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.<br>
    <i>Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must 
    hand the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will

      that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began 
      to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate 
      Norrath. Solusek Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, 
      he stripped us of them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One 
      was called Sylen Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard

      I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his 
      powers were stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was captured by 
      a rival wizard who specialized in magics of the water. Search for that wizard

      himself to be more powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself.

      was that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of one of 
      his own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind diminished 
      in capacity, even for a gnome. I remember others calling him 'Old Stewpot' 
      in jest. I do not know if this is his birth name, but it may help you to 
      locate him. I hear he also stays close to water because of the explosion. 
      You never know when another gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this 
      letter to help motivate him to remember. </font></p>

    Firepot</a>. Kandin can be found in the Southwest region of ButcherBlock Mountains 
    (-1500 +2800) near the ocean. Handing Kandin the note from Arantir results 
    in the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>

      Firepot says</b> 'Brother! I have one of those. He's great, but he's dead. 
      His name was Gabstik and he was a really powerful wizard. I still have one 
      of his greatest possessions! Hey, I know! You can help me with my greatest 
      firework! I need you to get me a skin to put the powder from my firework 
      in. That's the only thing I can think of to use though I cannot get myself. 
      I need a skin that is dry and brittle, yet can still be shaped. So go fetch 
      me some and I'll scratch your back.</font></p>

    When identified, the skin comes up with 'Item Lore: Brittle yet malleable

  <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take

      I forgot I needed another part to my firework, and you are exactly the person 
      to get it for me! I need some mistletoe powder. Now, go find some for me! 
      Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, wait! Hold on to my bag for me, please. You can

  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">You 
    will now have a note from Kandin that you must take to Arantir. This is where 
    things go weird. Occy, the wizard that first completed this quest, took the 
    note to Arantir and handed it to him. Upon handing it to Arantir, nothing 
    happened. No item handed back to Occy, no words spoken by Arantir... nothing. 
    Needless to say, Occy just about cr*pped himself. All Occy heard was the experience 
    'chime'. Then Occy hailed Arantir <i>after</i> he handed in the note.</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">At 
    this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the Gnarled 
    Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik. </font></p>

      be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, intact, to Solomen. 
      He will then reward you. Now that I have helped you, leave me in peace.</font></p>
