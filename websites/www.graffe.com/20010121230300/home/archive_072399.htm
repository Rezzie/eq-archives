          Well, I was up for a full 32 hours with no rest. 15 of those hours were 

          spent within EQ. Yes, just when I said I would not go back in Najena 

          for a while, I did. And yes... I went back to help my best friend acquire 

          some Journeyman Boots. This time it only took 8 hours of camping until 

          we got the first pair. We actually got 3 pairs in about 10 hours.</p>

        <p>I had Saladan of Xegony get in touch with me in game last night. He 

          had in his posession the Shining Metallic Robe and some other nifty 

          items. I will put up the info asap. Thanks!</p>

          Stalkin of The Rathe seems to be the first to acquire the spell 'Ice 

          Comet'. It does 1120 damage while using 400 mana. Sure would like to 

          know the casting time on this to put to rest the 40 second myths. If 

          you know, let <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">me</a> know. Thanks!</p>

        Receiving many reports that the new Spell Research Training does not work 

        up until the third set of runes. Don't waste your ingredients! I will 

        keep you posted when this is resolved.</div>

        While getting the pic of the female Dark Elf that initiates the Evil Research 
        Quest out of my directory, I happened on a photo I took a while back. 
        Seemed this Ogre Officer did not want to lie down after slain. So I carefully 
        rested upon him. Take a <a href="../screenpics/resting_on_officer.jpg" target="_blank">look</a>

          <br>

          -Players are no longer able to cast Shadowstep next to a zone point 

          and teleport to an area past the teleport region, which is inaccessible 

          to other characters.<br>

          <br>

          -If the Eye of Zomm makes contact with a zone-point, the spell will 

          immediately wear off.<br>

          <br>

          <br>

          -A Quest to help casters with research has been added. Good aligned

          Lengis Osmadi of Solusek Ro was kind enough to send in these pics of 

          a GM that showed up in Solusek B with some fancy new robes. Take a look!</p>

          After some tweaking, I seemed to have the site squared away for all 

          of you Netscape users. I apoligize for not doing this earlier. Site 

          sure was ugly for you. Let me know if you have any troubles (besides 

          the color scheme). Heh... no matter what you do, there is always going 

          to be one person that won't like it. I have changed the text color once 

          to accomodate a few people.. please don't make me do it again. =) </p>

        Well, I bit the bullet and downloaded the new Netscape and looked at the 

        website with it. All I can say is 'bleh'. Boy do I wish they would come 

        to an agreement with MS as to what things should look like. Sure as heck 

        would make it easier for the web designers. I'm not going to tell you 

        what browser to use, but in my own honest opinion.. Microsoft does have 

        a superior browser. Anyway, I'll do what I can for the Netscape users 

        out there... by the way, this text is really grey. =)<br>

          Due to the fact that the pages are starting to grow in size, when updating 

          pages I created a little graphic to denote where the changes or additions 

          have taken effect. When you see this little glowing ball &quot;<img src="purple_ani.gif" width="14" height="14">&quot;, 

          this will be the updated info. Hope this helps to find them a bit easier.<br>

        <p>Just a word of thanks to the people I met within my home dungeon of 

          Najena last night. I logged on in the morning with the hopes of obtaining 

          a pair of Journeyman Boots. A group was already camping and they agreed 

          to turn the room over to me when they were done. Myself and my guildmates 

          took the room over at 10am and over the course of 12 hours, I waited 

          the drop from Drelzna. Finally, at about 10pm I got my boots. Yes, I 

          looted every single one of her corpses during that period with no boots. 

          (I have quite the extensive amount of Earrings of Disease Reflection 

          by the way). During this whole camping process, a group came behind 

          wanting the room. I talked with them and they agreed to wait until got 

          my boots before they took over the room. I want to thank them for their 

          great patience.</p>

        <p>Corwyn - High Elf Wizard<br>

          Bacc - Human Wizard<br>

          Mezloc - Don't know what you played. =)<br>

          Gaelead - Enchanter, so who knows what he really was.</p>

        <p>All of you listed above.. A HUGE thank you for your patience, keeping 

          me laughing, and encouraging me to stay until I got them. People like 

          you make this game a great enjoyment for me and others.</p>

        <p>Besides the individuals listed, I wish to thank my guildmates of Darkmoon. 

          Without you, Drelzna would have Harm Touched me to death a few times. 

          Keiote', Atos, Darmak, Izzterl, Nytewolf, Jenalea, Hrava, and an ex-guildmember 

          but always a true friend.. Hwaan. Over the long camping many of you 

          came and went, thank you for filling the spots of those who had to leave. 

          (If I forgot anybody.. forgive me. I am a very forgetful old Wizard)</p>
