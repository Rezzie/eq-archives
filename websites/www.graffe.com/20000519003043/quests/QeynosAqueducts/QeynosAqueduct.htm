<div id="QeynosAqua" style="position:absolute; left:49px; top:79px; width:521px; height:92px; z-index:2; visibility: visible">Within 
  Qeynos at the bridge near the bank, there is an NPC named <a href="Zamel.jpg" target="_blank">Zamel</a>. 
  Speak to him about the aqueducts, beasts and children. He will then give you 
  the information you need to start the quest. Go down into the water where the 
  bridge is and find the spawn point within the sewer (132, -63). Please note 
  that there is a way down in the water right next to Zamel but it has been blocked 
  off for downward travel. You must use the other entrances to get down. Kill 
  everything that spawns and at some point <a href="GraffeVSCuburt.jpg" target="_blank">Cuburt</a>, 
  a gelatinous cube, will come out. Kill him and he will sometimes drop a tattered 
  dress. Kill Cuburt quickly or he will sometimes kill himself within the water 
  as he runs away. Take the tattered dress back to Zamel and he will in return 
  give you a +3 intelligence earring (the booby prize is a piece of hemitite). 
  Getting the earring in return is actually quite rare. Be prepared to do this 
  quest over and over.<br>
