        <p>Could you review with Poe and others whether it is intentional that 
          rain spells cannot kill a mob?</p>
        <p>If a creature has less hitpoints than the amount of damage of the rain 
          hit, it will ALWAYS resist. This basically means that you cannot kill 
          a mob with a rain spell solely. It is my opinion this is just an unseen 
          sideaffect of some errant if-then loop or something, rather than an 
          intended behavior. Can we get some definitive statement please?</p>

          <p>I've been hearing a lot of reports about this. We're looking into 
            it. Hopefully I will be able to shed some light on this in the near 
            future. Thanks for the feedback</p>

        <p>This is probably the sort of thing that is better sent to the QA boards. 
          I'm glad you sent it in, but next time it's probably better to go through 
          the other board.</p>
        <p>Thanks.</p>
