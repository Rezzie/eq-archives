      Pon in West Karana will ask you to deliver a note to his brother in Freeport 
      named Hyrill Pon. Yiz Pon is running from the Dungeon of Splitpaw and some 
      monster is after him. After you talk to Yiz, a Splitpaw assassin will show 
      himself. Kill the assassin and you will loot a hollow skull container from 
      him. Apparently, Yiz Pon stole this skull from within Splitpaw and tried 
      to escape, but then had to give it to the assassin so that it would stop 
      hunting him. However, the assassin is still trying to kill him. Take a note 
      from Yiz Pon to his brother Hyrill Pon in West Freeport. Hyrill will tell 
      you that his brother was searching for some powerful skull which should 
      give great power to a wizard. To continue with the quest from Hyrill, you 
      must find two Eyes made of rubies. One ruby is found on Lyunga in Innothule 
      Swamp. She is a level 32 Troll that sometimes casts and sometimes dual wields. 
      (Note that killing her will more than likely give you bad faction within 
      Grobb). The second ruby is called a 'Ruby Pendant' and can be looted from 
      a Gnoll Shaman named Kurrpok who spawns in the Dungeon of Splitpaw. Once 
      you have acquired both +1 Intelligence Ruby Eyes, put them in the Hollowed 
      Skull and press 'combine'. After they have all been combined, you will now 
      have a Jeweled skull.<br>
