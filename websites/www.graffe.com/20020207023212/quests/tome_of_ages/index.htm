  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Oracle of K`Arnon'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'Greetings, I am the Oracle of K'Arnon. Do 
      you quest for [knowledge] yourself, or do you offer that which I [seek]?</p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'I quest for knowledge'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I have lived long and have insight into many 
      matters, yet I despise charity. To learn from me, you must first bring me 
      that which I [seek]. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What do you seek?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I seek knowledge, which is superior to all 
      things. And no knowledge is greater than that which is contained within 
      the [Tome of Ages]. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What is the Tome of Ages?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'The Tome of Ages has been compiled over the 
      millennia by the Scribes of [Dal]. It was divided into seven distinct books 
      by the scribes to keep the knowledge from one such as me. That said, with 
      aid, I shall unite these books and the Tome of Ages shall be mine. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'Who are the Scribes of Dal?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'They were elves once, but now are Teir'Dal, 
      and as evil as they are wise. Many tomes have they written, but none greater 
      than the Tome of Ages. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What books?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'The seven books that make up the Tome of 
      Ages are those of enlightenment, scale, turmoil, monuments, elders, blood, 
      and the lost book. Each of these great books is an important chapter in 
      the history of Norrath. If ever you find one of these books, bring it to 
      me. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What is the Book of Turmoil?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'Ah, yes! The Book of Turmoil. I seek this 
      book, and should you find it and return it to me, I will reward you with 
      secret knowledge. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The Tome of Ages was written by the Scribes of Dal. The Scribes 
    of Dal are a group of dark elves that broke the tomb into seven separate pieces 
    and are keeping those pieces hidden from the Oracle. The first piece he seeks 
    is the Book of Turmoil.</p>
  <p align="left">To get the Book of Turmoil, you must head to Neriak's Third 
    Gate and go inside the library. Stay left once inside the library and you 
    will find a young dark elven necromancer named Lokar To`Biath and his pet. 
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Lokar ToBiath' <br>
      <b>Lokar ToBiath says</b> 'I am the Scribe of Innoruuk. If you do not have 
      business with me, begone! <br>
      <b>You say</b>, 'What vow?' <br>
      <b>Lokar ToBiath says</b> 'Break the vow? She might. Were you to tithe 70 
      gold to your god, Innoruuk, he might aid you. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Hand him 70 gold (there is a lot more before this but you can 
    skip it) </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>Lokar ToBiath says</b> 'Take this note to the Scribe of Dal, and perhaps 
      she will break her vow. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with DarkBargainers got better <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardOuter got better <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardInner got better <br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now you have a <a href="note_lokar_to_rysva.jpg" target="_blank">note</a> 
    in your inventory. Take this note to Lokar's sister, <a href="rysva.jpg" target="_blank">Rysva 
    To`Biath</a>, which is a barmaid in the bottom of the Blind Fish found in 
    Neriak Commons.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Rysva To`Biath'<br>
      <b>Rysva To`Biath says</b> 'Hello. Let me know if I can get you a drink.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hand her the note -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>Rysva To`Biath says</b> 'Take this note and be gone with you. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with DarkBargainers got better <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardOuter got better <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardInner got better <br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Rysva has given you a <a href="note_rysva_to_you.jpg" target="_blank">note</a> 
    that tells you to kill her brother Lokar and bring his head as well as this 
    note back to her. So.. go visit him and throw some mana his way -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You have slain Lokar ToBiath! <br>
      Your faction standing with DarkBargainers got worse <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardOuter got worse <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardInner got worse <br>
      Lokar ToBiath says 'The death of a Dark Bargainer never goes unnoticed!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now grab his <a href="dark_elf_decapitated_head.jpg" target="_blank">head</a> 
    (and his robe if you want it) and run back to Rysva in the Blind Fish. At 
    the same time, hand her the note she gave you as well as his head - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rysva To`Biath says 'Take this book and be gone with you. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with DarkBargainers got better <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardOuter got better <br>
      Your faction standing with DreadguardInner got better <br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now own the <a href="book_of_turmoil_closed.jpg" target="_blank">Book 
    of Turmoil</a> (picture of <a href="book_of_turmoil_1_and_2.jpg" target="_blank">pages 
    1 &amp; 2</a> - picture of <a href="book_of_turmoil_3_and_4.jpg" target="_blank">pages 
    3 &amp; 4</a>) Taking this book to the Oracle of K'Arnon will result in a 
    Glowing Torch (weak item for an enchanter) and the following faction adjustments 
    -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'Thank thee for this tome. Be sure to check 
      back with me later, as I might have another task for thee. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with OracleOfKarnon got better<br>
      Your faction standing with OracleOfMarud got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
    <p> <b>You say</b>, 'What is the Book of Scale?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'Ah, the Book of Scale.. It would be wondrous 
      indeed if you could recover the Book of Scale for me. If you do manage to 
      procure the Book of Scale, I will gladly part with an artifact of my own 
      that may be of interest to you. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The book of scale drops in two pieces. One piece from the dragon Lord Nagafen 
    in Solusek's Lair and the other from the dragon Lady Vox in Permafrost. Once 
    you have both halves, bring them to Rysva To`Biath in the Blind Fish of Neriak 
    Commons. Hand both halves as well as 1000pp and she will combine them for 
    you (remember the note? She can restore the other books as well).</p>
  <p>This is what the Oracle will tell you if you ask about any of the other books 
    -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <b>You say</b>, 'What is the Book of Enlightenment?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I do not seek the Book of Enlightenment at 
      this time, but I might have need of it in the future. </p>
    <p> <b>You say</b>, 'What is the Book of Monuments?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I do not seek the Book of Monuments at this 
      time, but I might have need of it in the future. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What is the Book of Elders?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I do not seek the Book of Elders at this 
      time, but I might have need of it in the future. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What is the Book of Blood?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I do not seek the Book of Blood at this time, 
      but I might have need of it in the future. </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'What is the Lost Book?'<br>
      <b>Oracle of K`Arnon says</b> 'I do not seek the Lost Book at this time, 
      but I might have need of it in the future. </p>

  <hr noshade width="200">
  <p>The following is a copy of the e-mail I recieved from the anonymous item 
    submitter and this is thought to be a hoax - </p>
  <p>&quot;..Hi there. I'm just writing in to inform you that today I completed 
    the Tome of Ages quest started by the oricle in Ocean of Tears. I really don't 
    feel like posting a walk through, or what the key words are to various NPC's 
    (which is why I'm posting this anonymously) but I will give you a small hint 
    as to what's in store. </p>
  <p align="left">Hint - Before I was able to aquire the robe and hat, I had to 
    obtain an item from every non-kunark "Boss" in the game. This was to show 
    that I was worthy of the rewards. Anyway, in no perticular order -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phinigel Autropos - Rod of Malisement</li>
    <li>Maestro - Shield of Stalwart Seas</li>
    <li>Innoruuk - Diamond Rod</li>
    <li>Master Yael (which makes me think this quest was recently updated) - Idol 
      of the Underking</li>
    <li>Dracoliche - Bone Razor</li>
    <li>Cazic Thule - Lyssa's Darkwood Piccolo</li>
    <li>Lady Vox - Dragon Bone Braclet </li>
    <li>Lord Nagafen - Gold Plated Koshigatana.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first reward is a scepter. Then came the robe and the final reward was 
    the hat. Very nice items I must say. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ruby Studded Scepter info - The effect on it is a proc an not a right 
      click (oh well...) </li>
    <li>Gift of the Oricle info - The robe does the same thing as a greater lightstone 
    </li>
    <li>Crown of the Ages - The effect is always on. No need to click it.&quot;</li>
