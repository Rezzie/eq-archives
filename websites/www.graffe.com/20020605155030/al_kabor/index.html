        <p>Though it is true that no wizard walking the face of Norrath wields 
          the power that I do, I must continue my research to be protected from 
          all evil that lurks beyond Norrath.</p>
        <p>The search for immortality is not an easy quest to complete. I struggle 
          each day to find the knowledge that has, for so long, been a dream of 
          mine.</p>
        <p>Some have found crystals that offer healing powers. I must seek out 
          such crystals. Perhaps I shall find the one crystal that give me the 
          ultimate long life.</p>
        <p>While venturing through the frigid plains of the Barbarians, I came 
          across some unusual ice crystals. These crystals radiated a strange, 
          glistening glow.</p>
        <p>In order to fully understand the power within them, I brought the ice 
          crystals back to my laboratory in Erudin and immediately started my 
          experiment with them.</p>
        <p>My research continues.</p>

        <p>When I applied high pressure to the crystals, and electric force emanated 
          from each tip. This force was strong enough to polarize the floating 
          particles that hovered around the tips of the crystal.</p>
        <p>With this luminescent energy surrounding the tips of the crystal, I 
          knew that I must drain its power in order to complete this stage of 
          my experiment.</p>
        <p>So far my research has been somewhat positive. Once I managed to drain 
          the powers from the ice crystals that I found in the barbaric lands 
          some time ago, I was ready to move on to the next stage of my experiment.</p>
        <p>By mixing this extraordinary energy with various materials, I managed 
          to create a Rune of my very own, which I can use to store much power.</p>

        <p>Recently, I returned to the continent of Kunark. Traveling to unknown
