      <p>Let me start here with an apology. Someone pointed out that I was ranting 
        a bit with my last post, and I was. I shouldn't be doing that. I apologize.

So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this."<P>This is 100% incorrect.  An item was found with Flowing Thought I on a Giant in Great Divide who was apart of the ring quest.  Not only was an item with Flowing Thought I found on him, but an item with Flowing Thought II was found as well.</B><P>Yup, it seems to be the case that there are a few of the super high powered Flowing Thought II items available as well…<P>Flowing Thought II is, well, a little better than Flowing Thought.  It is still far less useful than Clarity (though it might rival Breeze…), and it still stacks with all of those spells, so it's still not much of an issue.  I would agree that an item better than that might be worthy of some concern, even if it does stack with Clarity.<P>And, as one reader has pointed out, there are in fact a few Clarity items in the game.<P>There are perhaps three items in the game that have the ability to cast Clarity II on their wielder (and only on the wielder).  When I say three, I mean three total, across all the servers.  These are, in fact, artifacts given out at two of the gatherings.  As far as I know, no more of these items will ever come into the game (though I suppose they might, it's not part of any current plan, that's for sure).<P>Were these items dropping off any NPC in the game, no matter how rare, I would be concerned.  But having three of them on all the servers should have absolutely no effect on the desire for enchanters or bards.<P><BR>This one is kinda long, so I'm going to respond within the post.  My comments are not bolded.<P><B>Greetings Absor,<P>I was reading over the post you made regarding wizards and I had a couple comments. Forgive me but I dont know the codes for this board.<P>Absor said: "Wizards can't sustain their damage output in fights that last longer than those that existed before Velious. This is the issue you're heading at. And, sure, giving Wizards a larger mana pool or a form of massive mana regeneration would fix it. But it also makes them more efficient in all other forms of casting. "<P>Mostly true. The wizard community feels it doesn't do enough damage, which is our primary focus. You mention that giving us 'massive' mana regeneration would too greatly benefit our other casting abilities and you would have to compensate.<P>Raising mana cost of non-dmg spells seems reasonable given what a wizard is, dmg caster, but mana regeneration may not entirely be the solution. At least in my opinion it isn't because of other problems wizards experience: ie agro. I dont have a useable skill\spell to lower my agro so typical raid fights entail casting and waiting for melees to rebuild up agro for me to cast again. THIS is why mana regeneration isnt entirely the solution for wizards. It may help, but in raid scenarios wont solve our problems. <P>To put it simply, wizards have 2 problems:<BR>1) Low dmg<BR>2) High agro doing that dmg.</B><P>Ok, I don't agree that wizards have problem #1.  Low damage needs to be qualified with a 'compared to', in other words 'Low damage when compared with what a rogue can do over the course of ten minutes of continuous fighting' or 'Low damage when compared to what any other class can do when dumping mana to finish something off'.  I'd say yes to one and no to the other.  The problem is that when you make comparisons like that it's all in the wording.<P>As for #2, well, no more aggro than anyone else that does the same damage in the same time frame.<P><B>Mana regen solves 1, but makes 2 worse.</B><P>If wizards could suddenly regenerate mana at ten times the rate they do now, they could control their aggro, and in fact aggro control would be the only limit on their damage potential.<P><B>Absor said: "Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that melee characters draw their hit points from healers and their speed from casters."<P>You should stress this more as it is the crux for grouping in EQ. Unfortunately, if any two of those become too strong the third isn't necessary. Velious fights last minutes and in that duration melee is the most effective damage source. In that context, healer-melee is the only dynamic that matters. Casters just are added to fill in the gaps if necessary. </B><P>Agreed.  And this is the place where the imbalance exists.  But people too easily forget that when you are comparing melee damage to caster damage, you have to keep in mind that there are two people doing that melee damage, the melee and the healer.  Take away the healer and your melee isn't going to live long enough to outdamage the caster in question.<P>But it is this situation where the imbalance exists, and it is these situations that we are aiming to fix.<P><B>Absor said: "Heck, wizards have a great damage over time ratio and this isn't even something that we're looking at improving."<P>This, to me, doesn't make much sense. You mentioned above it was something being considered as a result of Wizard Talk. So how can we have 'great damage over time ratio'? Maybe explaining your qualifications for this would make it clear because in nearly all raiding fights melees do more than me.</B><P>Perhaps we're thinking of different uses of the term 'damage over time'.  A lot of the responses sent in were telling me that a melee character does a lot more damage over an hour than a wizard.  That's probably true at the upper levels.  But what about over the course of one minute?  If an NPC is fleeing, who finishes it off?  I was thinking of damage over time as it relates to most fights, not the rare long fight one can encounter in Velious, since I've covered that separately.<P><B>Absor said RE dmg/mana: "Bane spells. Other than that, I don't know."<P>I am not sure if you know this Absor, maybe ask Poe about it for further detail, but banes have a very very select group of creatures it can hit. About 10 in game roughly I would guess can be hit by both banes. Being effective on about 10 mobs doesn't make us more attractive. Just means you CoH in the wizards when you are getting ready for the final boss NPC. You also have to be level 60 to use them. </B><P>I know exactly how the bane spells work.  That 'select group of creatures' are exactly the creatures that take a long time to kill.  They are the creatures where the wizard has the greatest problems, and is the exact group of combats that we wanted to target.<P><B>Absor said: "Isn't now, hasn't been in the past, probably won't be in the future. Just because you are the 'best' at travel does not mean that travel is what you do best."<P>Cool.</B>

      <P><BR>Ok, I've received a lot of comments that were much less… polite that Alch's comment.  I'm not going to repost them here.  But I'll address their concerns.<P>Too frequently folks get caught up in their current concern and don't step back to look at the big picture (I hate the phrase, someone get me a new one…).  If we do something that allows Wizards to crank out the damage on high hit point NPCs in any way other than bane spells, then the life expectancy of old world NPCs would be nil.  Improve the ratios of damage for Wizard spells to make them effective in the places where they feel weak now, and they destroy the old world with but a thought.<P>And I've noted that every (and I mean EVERY) person that has sent in some numbers showing how their wizard can't do the damage of a melee character sends in data comparing them to a rogue that has Ragebringer and is constantly backstabbing?  Is that a good comparison?  Keep in mind that the rogue is a three person damage dealer.  He needs a tank and someone to heal that tank to do his damage.  It might be fairer to add the damage dealt by all three of those people in a fight and divide by three, then compare…<P>The problem is that we're comparing melee and spell damage, and that's not a good comparison.  The two are very different.<P>Group desirability is the other thing that is most mentioned about Wizards.  They say they aren't.  I argue that if there were no complaints about your ability to deal damage, then there would be no problem getting groups…  But we also have plans that will dramatically reduce the problem with getting groups at higher levels.  I can't tell you about it until we get it working and until we're done with the balancing stuff, but it will make a wizard desirable to groups.<P>I hate to say this, but it might be possible that part of the reason that a wizard might not be getting invited to groups is that you've spent so much time telling everyone how you aren't useful…  It's hard to tell the sequence of events here, it's a chicken and the egg thing.  But I often worry that this might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Tell enough people that you're not useful and they will believe you.<P>This may not be true, but I worry about it nonetheless.<P>I received and e-mail from a friend this morning, saying many of the things that many of you have said.  He said something though, that struck a cord with me.  He mentioned something about Wizards in literature and how they are something to be feared.<P>They sure are.  But, well, Gandalf isn't a balanced character.  He can't exist in Norrath because then there would be a majority of these literature-based character class and few of the others.  Tolkien never needed to balance gameplay with Mithrandir in mind.  We do.<P>I know that what I've been saying sounds like I don't understand your point of view.  But my concern here is that you don't see mine.  There is more to balancing a class than just turning up the damage volume until everyone that plays that class is happy.  It's not that easy.<P>Keep sending in your comments, we'll read them all.  But for now I'm not going to make more comments on balance issues until we're done with our run through of all the classes.<P>Alan</td>
