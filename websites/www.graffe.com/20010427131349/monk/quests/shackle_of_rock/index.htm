              describe the life of Talon Southpaw.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><b>Book of Talon Southpaw</b><br>
                <i>&quot;Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist ever to walk 
                within the Court of Pain. His speed rivaled that of the great 
                Grandmaster Tynn. He could often be found within the local taverns 
                demonstrating the awesome speed of his left fist.<br>
                Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this caste. Although quick 
                with fist and tail, the speed of his left arm was not to come 
                to blossom for a couple of decades past his rebirth. It was to 
                follow his captivity by the accursed sarnak.</i></p>
              <p><i>Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon went on a wandering 
                retreat into the dangerous outlands of Kunark. He was not heard 
                from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to Cabilis he told 
                of his captivity within an ancient city of the Iksar now claimed 
                by the sarnak. He told of intense torture. He survived the ordeal. 
                He escaped from the claws of the sarnak with numerous scars which 
                proved his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars were never 
                seen. Talon wore a robe which he never removed. The scars underneath 
                were for no lizard's eyes. His great perseverance gave him an 
                inner strength no other monk could lay claim to.<br>
                He now possessed incredible, almost blinding speed with his left 
                arm. He could trap a foe's arm with his left and strike with it 
                as if he had a third arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails. 
                All in the empire either respected or feared him. None would spar 
                him outside of the taverns. With grog comes stupidity. Upon his 
                death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn removed his hands in a private 
                ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze upon Talon's body. The 
                fists were then sealed in a canopic which would stay within the 
                Tower of Kurn His body was dusted. This is his tale as told by 
                Rinmark.&quot;</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you read the above, you'll learn that Talon frequented the local 
              taverns of Cabilis. So head over to the Tink N Babble and talk to 
              the bartender 'Klok Poklon' found on the second floor for a bit 
              more info if you want -</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'hail Klok Poklon'<br>
                Klok Poklon says 'Greetings, thirsty traveler. Pull up a stool 
                and lay yer copper down. It's time to drink and be merry. Just 
                don't get too merry or I will have to call the troopers. </p>
              <p>You say, 'Who was Talon Southpaw?'<br>
                Klok Poklon feints with two quick left hooks!! 'Talon Southpaw. 
                He had the fastest hands in the empire. I remember he once beat 
                another lizard in an arm wrestling match. The amazing thing was, 
                while he was gripping the croak's left hand, he left-hooked him 
                without losing his hold!! That's quick!! I hear one of his treasured 
                hands is in the possession of a monk called Master Rinmark.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You can find a little bit about the whereabouts of Master Rinmark 
              by talking to Master Bain who is found in the Court of Pain (Cabilis 
              Monk Guild) -</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'where is Master Rinmark?'<br>
                Master Bain says 'Seeking Master Rinmark? He has left the Court 
                of Pain. Gone to focus his thoughts on the elements of wind and 
                thunder. I believe he was headed toward the Overthere. That was 
                the last I heard of his trek. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Now to find Master Rinmark. Even though Master Bain in the Court 
              of Pain says he was headed toward the Overthere, it seems Rinmark 
              ventured a bit further. He's all the way out in the middle of the 
              <a href="../../../maps/kunark/timorous_deep.jpg" target="_blank">Timorous 
              Deep</a> on top of the rocks on the island better known as 'chessboard 
              isle' at location -5060, +2800. He's not labeled as 'Master Rinmark' 
              but labeled simply as '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('an_iksar_master.jpg','aniksarmaster','width=240,height=432')">an 
              iksar master</a>'. Be careful out here, there is another NPC down 
              on the sand that really does not like little iksars. Try speaking 
              to the iksar master -</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'hail an iksar master'<br>
                an iksar master is humming and chanting softly. He seems oblivious 
                to your presence. <br>
              </p>
              <p>You say, 'Who is Master Rinmark?'<br>
                an iksar master squints one eye open, then returns to his meditation. 
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>You say, 'What about the fists of Talon Southpaw?'<br>
                an iksar master waves his arms in the air. 'The great master. 
                His soul is the wind. He speaks to us in words of thunder. He 
                strikes Norrath with bolts of lightning. I seek to be as he is. 
                I have traveled the globe in search of his fists. I have found 
                only one. Another is said to be with [Gomoz]. I shall return it 
                when I am finished with my seasons-long meditation or perhaps 
                I shall find a monk to [return the hand to Cabilis].' <br>
              </p>
              <p>You say, 'Who is Gomoz?'<br>
                an iksar master says 'Disciple Gomoz was once Talon Southpaw's 
                pupil. It is rumored that he has only one hand. Unfortunately, 
                a horde of ogre raiders swiped his bones, along with others, from 
                their place in Kurn's Tower. What those simple oafs plan to do 
                with them is a mystery. Only one who has studied the arcane sciences 
                could use them. They most likely used them as soup bones. <br>
              </p>
              <p>You say, 'I will return the hand to Cabilis.'<br>
                an iksar master hands you an old tattered sack. 'This shall be 
                your proof of allegiance. Prove that you are strong with an intact 
                mandible of a skulking brutling and the claws of a burynai excavator. 
                Prove that you are a monk of fist and tail with a sash of an exiled 
                human monk and the sparring gloves of a goblin pit fighter. Combined, 
                these items make the sack full. This will earn my trust and the 
                hand.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He gives you an <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('tattered_sack_from_rinmark.jpg','tatteredsackfromrinmark','width=330,height=145')">old 
              tattered sack</a> for you to put the four items in. We'll do it 
              in the order that he gave them in.</p>
            <p>The first item he wants is an intact mandible of a skulking brutling. 
              The real item name is '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('intact_brutling_choppers.jpg','intactbrutlingchoppers','width=330,height=145')">Intact 
              Brutling Choppers</a>'. These <i>only</i> come from 'a skulking 
              brutling'. Not from skulking runtlings or skulking bruts. In order 
              to find this little orange monkey, goto Warslik Woods and head over 
              to the general area of -2000, +3000 (just South of the iksar bandit 
              lake) and start looking. To help get the spawn rotating, start killing 
              off goblin bonecasters and skulking runtlings. This item took me 
              about two hours to acquire and a ranger really helps doing this 
              part.</p>
            <p>The second item he wants is the claws of a burynai excavator. The 
              real item name is '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('excavator_claws.jpg','excavatorclaws','width=330,height=145')">Excavator 
              Claws</a>'. You can easily find one of these on the burynai excavators 
              in Kurns Tower as well as in the Field of Bones.</p>
            <p>The third item he asks for is the sash of an exiled human monk. 
              The real item name is '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('torn_sash.jpg','tornsash','width=330,height=145')">Torn 
              Sash</a>' and can be found on 'a young ronin' at any dervish cutthroat 
              camp in North Ro, Oasis, or South Ro. The best place I found to 
              acquire this in Oasis due to it has two camps very close to each 
              other and each camp has 3 spawns. Just keep cycle killing each camp 
              until he spawns. You don't hail him.. you just kill him and take 
              the sash from his corpse. This took me about 3 hours to acquire.</p>
            <p>The fourth item asked for is the sparring gloves of a goblin pit 
              fighter. The actual name for this item is '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('goblin_sparring_gloves.jpg','goblinsparringgloves','width=330,height=145')">Goblin 
              Sparring Gloves</a>'. These are also found in Warslik Woods at the 
              goblin fortress in the Northeast area of the zone. The mob you are 
              looking for is a goblin pitfighter. Not 'Pitfighter Dob'. In order 
              to get him to spawn, start killing anything you can in the fortress. 
              Everytime I have seen him, he's spawned in the tents but you might 
              find him at another location in the fortress. His spawn point is 
              random. You can sometimes get lucky if there are some high level 
              players there trying to get Grachnist the Destroyer to spawn. Just 
              nicely ask them if you can kill or loot the goblin pitfighter if 
              he spawns.</p>
            <p>Now that you have all four items, put them in the 'Tattered Sack 
              from Rinmark' and hit combine. It will turn into a '<a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('full_sack_for_master.jpg','fullsackformaster','width=330,height=145')">Full 
              Sack for Master</a>'. Now take this back to the iksar master (Master 
              Rinmark) in the Timorous Deep and hand it over -</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>an iksar master bows before you and takes a wrinkled, mummified 
                hand from a pouch at his side. 'Take the hand. Let it rest within 
                Cabilis and be reunited with the left.' </p>
              <p>Your faction standing with Swifttails got better<br>
                Your faction standing with LegionOfCabilis got better</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You now have the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('iksar_right_hand.jpg','iksarrighthand','width=330,height=145')">Iksar 
              Right Hand</a>. Now you are done dealing with Rinmark, but remember 
              how he talked about the Ogre Raiders that stole the bones? Well 
              the Ogres are actually in Timorous Deep as well. They are found 
              on the island that houses the dock for the evil boat at about +6000, 
              +3000. You will need to deal with a male ogre named 'The Great Oowomp'. 
              He is now indifferent to iksars but the problem is that there is 
              usually a female ogre raider in the house right behind him within 
              aggro distance and she is KOS. This really wouldn't be an issue 
              but as soon as she aggro's you, The Great Oowomp aggros as well. 
              So you can try a couple things -</p>
            <ol>
              <li>See if there are any other players camping the ogres for experience 
                and have them kill the ogre raider behind Oowomp for you.</li>
              <li>Attempt to FD pull to a safe distance out of the camp but if 
                you are not careful or you'll <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('donstep_monkey_tree.jpg','donstepmonkeytree','width=660,height=500')">end 
                up like me</a>. One thing to remember if you try this method is 
                that the skelly you are trying to get the Great Oowomp to summon 
                is going to end up back in town where he was standing. So if you 
                don't kill the female KOS ogre, the skelly is going to summoned 
                right there next to her. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once all is clear and Oowomp is alone, hand him 5 gold pieces -</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The Great Oowomp flings the coins into the air and they all fall 
                neatly into his oversized coin pouch. &lt;Tink, tink, tink, tink, 
                TINK!!&gt; 'Gaze in awe at my awesome powers of the arcane!! You, 
                a simple citizen, shall see my power. Allakabam!!' </p>

              withered 4&quot; finger</a>. Take note that all four of these fingers 
              are droppable so you might get lucky by simply ooc'ing for some. 
              To find the fingered skeleton, you have to go downstairs into the 
              basement where the burynai's reside. I have marked <a href="../../../maps/kunark/kurns_tower.jpg" target="_blank">this 
              map</a> with a bright green line to show the fingered skeleton's 
              pathing. The fingered skeleton is on a 20 minute spawn rotation 
              and his place holders include the Thick boned skeleton. Once you 
              have all four withered fingers, put them in the 'hand with one only 
              a thumb' and hit combine. You will have the first <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('iksar_left_hand.jpg','iksarlefthand','width=330,height=145')">Iksar 
              Left Hand</a>. Remember the book spoke that he could strike like 
              he had three arms or hands? It was true, there's one more to go.</p>
            <p>Now for the last fist.. the 'second' left fist. This was no picnic 
              and I highly suggest getting a ranger to help you with this part 
              as well. The left fist is found on a Sarnak Courier in the Lake 
              of Ill Omen. He is a somewhat rare spawn and the majority of the 
              time he is found wandering the area just North of the Windmill near 
              the ruins. I found him smack dab in the middle of the field at about 
              -1500, -2500 but there are rumors he has even been seen on the other 
              side of the zone near the goblin mines. Like I said... get a ranger 
              to help. This part of the quest, even with a ranger helping, took 
              me about 7 hours. Once you kill the Sarnak Courier, you will pull 
              the last hand from the corpse.. the second <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('iksar_left_hand.jpg','iksarlefthand','width=330,height=145')">Iksar 
              Left Hand</a>.</p>
            <p>Now you have three hands. Take all three of them back to the female 
              monk trainer, Master Niska, in the Court of Pain and hand them over. 
              Take note that you only have to hand over the hands, you get to 
              keep your Shackle of Stone this time. Hit the trade button -</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Master Niska removes a crudely hewn shackle. 'This is yours. 
                It is one of the keys to the third rung. I see that you are truly 
                a great monk and have studied your disciplines well. I have need 
                of one such as you. I have heard of [troubles with an outlander].'

              <p>Your faction standing with Swifttails got better.<br>

            <p align="left">Summary:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I recommend getting all of the items together before heading 
                out to the iksar master in the Timorous Deep. This way you only 
                have to make one trip. Get the bag, put the already acquired items 
                in it, hit combine, hand it over. Then on your way out, stop by 
                and do the part with the Great Oowomp.</li>
              <li>You'll get frustrated at the long, boring camps for this quest 
                but if you look at it as you can gain experience while doing it 
                (many quests weren't designed this way) and the fact that you 
                must do it to continue with the shackle quest series, it's not 
                all that bad.</li>
