Nope. I managed to select race and class as well as entering my name. Then I quit after I hit the part where it wanted me to pick a server. I'll try again though to make sure. Wait a moment.</div></div><hr />

I preordered and have a preorder box. The box clearly states that it is a code for pre entry.</div></div><hr />

The key that comes with the pre-order box was suppoed to both get you into beta if you weren't in already and flag your account for early entry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to Vanguard: Saga of Heroes!<br />
Congratulations! Your pre-order of Vanguard allows you to be one of the first to witness the exciting, dangerous, and ever-changing world of Telon. Telon is a living world, and like any world its early days is going to be fraught with turbulence. Expect us to have to &quot;patch&quot; any cracks as they appear for the first days.<br />
<br />
We know you are excited to explore the world we created for you, and we are equally excited to have you here. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the landscape... enjoy the freedom... of Vanguard.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY NOTES<br />
- Many cases of &quot;lost corpses&quot; are now free for summoning at the altar. (&quot;Free&quot; meaning the experience that can be recovered by looting the corpse/tombstone will remain on it, and there will be no durability hit).<br />
- Charmed NPC that are not a fixed duration have a significantly greater chance to break early. NPCs higher than the casters level still have an increased break chance. <br />
- All ranged items should now be purchasable in stacks <br />
- The non-damage resistance rate on high challenge level NPCs has been reduced.<br />
<br />
- Many activated racial abilities have had their effects tweaked and recast timers changed:<br />
- Goblin - Cast time lowered to 15 minutes<br />
- Orc - Damage healed is now 50% of damage done, duration lowered to 15 minutes<br />
- Kojan Humans - Cast time lowered to 30 minutes - diminishing effects are now in place, preventing the same target from receiving more than 1 spirit of jin within a 10 minute period<br />
- Half Elves - Ability has been fixed. The rune has become 15% spell damage, and duration raised to 60 seconds Recast time reduced to 30 minutes.<br />
- Raki - Plane shifting is now activated once per 30 minutes, lasts 1 minute. The health drain has been removed, and the mitigation to spell damage has been increased to 50%.<br />
- Wood Elves - The run speed buff has been increased. Recast time is 30 minutes. More changes likely to come with this.<br />
- Qaliathari Human - This effect now works. 100% evasion for 10 seconds. Recast time reduced to 30 minutes.<br />
- Varanthari - Melee mitigation has raised to 35%. The recast has changed to 30 minutes.<br />
- Mordebi - Ancient curse now simply stuns the target for 8 seconds, and reduces the agro range to 0. The target will not assist/agro while stunned, and the effect does not generate any agro. Recast is now 30 minutes.<br />
- Dark Elves - Blood elves now use the arcane caster version of the pet. The pet will now despawn whether it's in combat or not. Recast has changed to 30 minutes. The psionicists and necro pets will soon become minions. This change is not in effect yet.<br />

- Halfling warriors: Pride of the Vael: This ability will add a vast amount of hate to a single target, and apply a buff on the Halfling for 30 seconds. All attacks during this time period will count for double agro. - recast time is 15 minutes.<br />
- All other classes: Shroud of the Vael: this ability will remove 99% of agro from a single target but keep the Halfling in combat. Additionally, for 30 seconds afterwards, any spell cast or attack made will have its agro reduced to 1% of normal as well.<br />
- Lesser Giants - The effect has been fixed to only grant 50% additional hitpoints. However a regen component has been added as well, and the duration has been increased to 60 seconds. Recast time is now 30 minutes.<br />
- Barbarians - The effect has changed to cut the cost of all endurance/energy spells by half, and the damage increase stays the same. Recast time is now 30 minutes.<br />
- High Elves - Recast time is now 15 minutes.<br />
- Vulmane - Recast time is now 15 minutes.<br />
- A first iteration on PC passive abilities are in for crafting, harvesting, and adventuring attributes. It is likely there will be an additional adventuring ability for each race added shortly.<br />

How did he manually consume it? The only option I see is to consume it from the pre-order DVD which takes you to the SOE page and simply asks to consume it. I've seen no option to type the key in anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Not sure I get your question.  You should have astation account.  Then you add the subscription key to the station account.  Once that updates the server will let you in.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, said BF is at work, and doesn't get off work for 4.5 more hours.  Instead I get to sit here, having my ramen noodles while reading about all you people having issues getting into the game.  Soooooo maybe things will be smoothed out by the time I get home. :grinno:</div></div><hr />

I have the account for VG - entering the preorder key in two different links (one from ten ton and one from my VG subscription page) gives the error that the key is already registered.<br />
<br />
I'm not yet paying for full station access or whatever you want to call it. My EQ2 account is still active and my brand new EQ1 account is still on it's first 30 days.  But all 3 games are on the same account in preparation of paying for station access.<br />
<br />
The BF's account is on station access (I think that's how he reactivated EQ1). The only difference between his account and mine is the station access he's paying for and that I got invited to beta 4, he didn't.</div></div><hr />

They told me that I would have to pay 50 bucks for a pre-order just for those three days<br />
You should have to buy the game, in order to play, even with station access.  Station Access does not give you an account on the game; it just means you don't have to pay the additional monthly fee for the game, and you get some extra stuff (extra character slots and website stuffs on EQ1 and EQ2).</div></div><hr />

The setup screen said my code was consumed successfully but I get no futher. I look at my station account and it says I have a Vanguard subscription, but I can't get logged on. Did anyone find a fix for this?</div></div><hr />

I see on their forums that this will happen until the game officially goes live sometime tomorrow. Who can I lash out blindly at? Oh the nine-toed villainy of it all!</div></div><hr />
