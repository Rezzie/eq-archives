      <p>No one else was around, and at first I mis-took Al`Kabor for some Erudite<br>
        who had simply slipped the name through the name filter, until I went 
        to<br>
        target him, couldn't get him with F7, and when I targeted him and /who-ed<br>
        him, he didn't show up in /who. Then I dropped target and punched F8 - 
        paid<br>
        a bit closer attention to the color of his name, and his robe (cryosilk<br>
        pattern, with a slight purple tinted base, and dark brown eyes and center<br>
        stripes). He was wielding a staff of the wheel graphic staff, nothing 
        in<br>
        the off hand. We had the following conversation...</p>
      <p>Laughs: LOL<br>
        Emote: Laughs points at Al`Kabor. Yeah you!<br>
        Emote: Laughs rolls on the floor laughing at Al`Kabor.<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Laughs.<br>
        Al`Kabor: Pardon?<br>
        Al`Kabor: Don't laugh at me<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor grins evilly at Laughs.<br>
        Laughs: hmm... you don't show up in /who. . .<br>
        Emote: Laughs chuckles at Al`Kabor.<br>
        Laughs: hmm... you're an NPC. . .<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Laughs.<br>
        Al`Kabor: pardon?<br>
        Emote: Laughs bows before Al`Kabor.<br>
        Laughs: nice to make your Aquiantance.<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor nods.<br>
        Al`Kabor: I'm sure<br>
        Emote: Laughs chuckles at himself. Shesh.<br>
        Laughs: So what brings you to Dreadlands?<br>
        Al`Kabor: I continue my research, of course<br>
        Laughs: what are you researching, presently?<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor shrugs unknowingly.<br>
        Emote: Laughs smiles.<br>
        Al`Kabor: Oh, just a spell that will allow me to live forever<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor smiles.<br>
        Laughs: typical<br>
        Emote: Laughs smiles.<br>
        Al`Kabor: And be the most powerful wizard ever<br>
        Al`Kabor: Of course... I already AM the most powerful wizard ever, but 
        this<br>
        will ensure that is always true, to the end of time<br>
        Laughs: Any tips on where an aspiring wizard might find such knowledge?<br>
        Al`Kabor: I still am finding that out myself, actually.</p>
      <p>***Al`Kabor gives me the book***</p>
      <p>Al`Kabor: That this book, so you may leard more<br>
        Emote: Al`Kabor beams a smile at Laughs.</p>
      <p>***At this point he immediately ran off quite rapidly*** </p>
