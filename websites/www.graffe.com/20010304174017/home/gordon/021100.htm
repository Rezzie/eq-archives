        <p><b>Wizard – Catalist of Death?<p>
My name is Rindelk Ellendil, a 40th level wizard on Fennin Ro. I love being a wizard, I think it is a great class, and cannot imagine wanting to play anything other than the master of brutal arcane power. I enjoy my time in Norrath, and rarely do I feel inadequate in the face of my peers.<p>

At this point in my carreer, I’ve noticed that as things become increasingly more difficult, relative to my purpose, which is to inflict damage, that I do not last long in battle. I’ve questioned myself on the reasons behind this, which I will share with you in a moment.<p>

Wizard – How to play<p>

I’ve learnt a couple of things during my stay in Norrath, and IMHO, I think the proper conduct of a wizard in a group is as follows.<p>

1. Never burn a mob at the beginning of battle, but rather stun him in order to let the melee types do their jobs.<br>
2. You can burn a little, once the mobs hp has decreased below or equal to half it’s maximum.<br>
3. Space out the burn, as to make sure the mob does not agro on you.<br>
4. Save mana for an evacuation.<br>
5. Finish off runners if possible.<br>
6. Help members getting hit hard using the “skin tank” methode.<p>

I can go on and on about tactics, but this is not what the thread is about. What I’m trying to point out, is after a normal battle, fighting lets say one blue mob. I have used over 1 bubble of mana. Lets say we take on multiples, say 3. Three bubs of mana gone, and the rest will be saved for an emergency burn, skin, or evac. At this point, the party has to wait for me to med up, and even with clarity, it takes over 10 minutes to med 800 to 900 mana. (I currently have 1300+ mana)<p>

Wizard – Consumption<p>

Here is where my suggestions come into play. If Verant increase mana regeneration, (a suggestion I don’t really agree with, because it would decrease the uniqueness of enchanters, but for arguments sake) we would effectively be able to get our group back into battle in a shorter period of time. This would increase the want/need for wizards in a group setting.<br>
An alternative (and preffered by myself) to faster mana regeneration, would be to decrease the amount of mana required to cast our direct Damage spells. This would not IMO imbalance the game. Increasing mana efficiency would not increase the damage we do per cast, but rather damage over time. This would not change behavior such as KSing, but would improve our group capabilities. People that want to power level, would perhaps have the upper hand, due to the fact they can stay in battle longer, but as any wizard knows, the more you blast, the more the mob gets angry at you, the faster you die, because root just does not always work.<p>

Wizard – Implementation of suggestions<p>

This particular suggestion would have to be properly implemented in order to be successful. Here are some of my ideas on how Verant can do this, painlessly.<br>
Verant could use the current specialization system, and simply further decrease the amount of mana required per cast based on your current specialize evocation level. This is already done, I believe. (Not certain as to the current behavior of specializations) But is can be pushed further to successfully give us better mana efficiency.
They could simply decrease the amount of mana required to cast for individual spells. This is a brute force methode, and might have negative consequences beyond my knowledge.<br>
They could have a quest, for an item which you would hold (perhaps a staff =) ) that would help you channel your mana better, thus increasing your efficiency. The quest could be for players of level 29+, which would help avoid consequential powerleveling using the channeling item.<p>

These are my thoughts on how Verant can help our class. I hope that the direction I’ve taken is that shared by you, the reader.<p>

Thank you for reading this topic, and lets hope that the Gods favor us, and that they give us the tools we need to be successful in combat.<p>

Rindelk Ellendil<br>
Wizard of the 40th<br>
Fennin Ro</b><p>

I've read this, and although most everything here is very well-written, I'm afraid I don't agree with the assertions that wizards are horribly lacking. 
First, it does not take 10 minutes to meditate 800-900 mana with clarity. You will in-fact get that much mana *without* medding during that time.<p>

As far as resistances go, the "cap" is there for a reason. It's not a hard level cap as some people think, but a variable cap based upon the level of the caster. A wizard of level 36 is certainly capable of doing damage to the level 40-42 critters mentioned in another thread. Couple the wizard above 35 with a staff and an enchanter, shaman, and/or shaman, and the wizard should be able to do good damage to almost anything.<p>

We've added the staff and the innate reduction to resistances for wizards above 35. There are now several classes capable of doing resistance debuffs. Perhaps an enchanter and/or shaman is required equipment for a wizard in the same fashion that a cleric is required equipment for a warrior.<p>
