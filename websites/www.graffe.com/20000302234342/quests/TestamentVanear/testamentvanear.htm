  <p><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> </font></b>This quest is actually a small part 
    of the 'Library Quest' that starts within Erudin. Although this quest would 
    be more sought after by a cleric or some other class that needs wisdom, the 
    Testament does give mana and plus.. quests are fun!</p>
  <p>In Highpass Hold, there is a secret area under the pond near the Orc side. 
    This hidden area is a smugglers den. Once through, walk around until you find 
    Dyllin Starsine (only person in there that looks like a Qeynos Guard). Kill 
    him and loot page 30. Be warned the other smugglers will attack you as soon 
    as attack Dyllin. Now you will need to travel to Qeynos and find the Crow's 
    Tavern. Moodoro Finharm is in the Crow's Tavern but you can wait until he 
    comes out of the tavern to puke in the pond. Give Moodoro Finharn 2 gold and 
    he will give you the book to combine page 30 and 34 in. Then give him 4 gold 
    and you will recieve a card. If it is a Jester, give it back to him in return 
    for page 34. You may get alot of different cards but you need the Jester so 
    be prepared to spend a bit of money here. Once you have both pages 30 and 
    34 in your posession, combine them and create the Testament of Vanear.</p>
