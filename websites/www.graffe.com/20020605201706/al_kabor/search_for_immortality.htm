      <p>Al'Kabor, the most powerful wizard living on Norrath, has reached heights 
        of power the likes of which most have never even dreamed. For him, however, 
        this will all be for naught if he is unable to achieve what he desires 
        more than anything: Immortality. This would give him the ultimate power, 
        the power over death itself.</p>
      <p>So, Al'Kabor returns to his roots, to Erudin, to begin his research on 
        the watermen, The Kedge. He now needs the help of adventurers to continue 
        this research.</p>
      <p>Al'Kabor requires a few components. He cannot be bothered with the menial 
        task of retrieving his own spell components, thus he tasks a group of 
        adventurers with the responsibility of bringing him the components he 
        needs. First, he sends a group of adventurers to retrieve four gnoll teeth. 
        With these in hand, he dispatches a group to retrieve an aviak charm from 
        South Karana.</p>
      <p>Finally, Al'Kabor needs something with a little more staying power, so 
        to speak. Mammoth tusks from the beasts that roam the frozen plains of 
        Norrath are said to hold this special property.</p>
      <p>With these items collected, Al'Kabor continues his research.</p>
