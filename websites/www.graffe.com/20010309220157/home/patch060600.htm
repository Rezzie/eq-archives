      <p align="left"><font size="2">Greetings! The live servers have been updated 
        to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>General</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes. 
          Check your Kunark spell vendors.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall 
          to their deaths upon zoning. The majority of these issues should no 
          longer occur.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including 
          the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The 
          Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 
          51+ spells in Kunark. They should be more plentiful now. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Updated pathing information in many zones, making it 
          easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Items</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed 
          Sword. Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade 
          their sword out for a working one.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain 
          in your possession when you leave the game.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced 
          in weight.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in 
          Kunark.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><b>PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently 
        mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, 
        illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion 
        casts an offensive spell upon any player-character. Players should keep 
        this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction 
        standing is less than desirable. <br>
        <br>
        Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different 
        than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, as well as 
        other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Risk and Reward</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The concept of risk and reward is very important to the 
        game of EverQuest. Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should 
        also provide substantial risk. Over the past several weeks, we've been 
        identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and 
        making necessary adjustments. <br>
        <br>
        In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward 
        for a specific action. For example, we recently increased the experience 
        awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk 
        associated with adventuring there. We also do this quite frequently by 
        increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as 
        we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest. <br>
        <br>
        However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess 
        of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those 
        above as we come across them. For example, there are many cases where 
        a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding 
        the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk. <br>
        <br>
        Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we 
        did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities corrected 
        over the next several weeks.<br>
        <br>
        <b>PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are 
        aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting 
        rights from PvP combat. Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin 
        plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot 
        with no right to loot items.<br>
        <br>
        Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, 
        we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move. 
        Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 
        2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, 
        June 12th, 2000. You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog 
        yes" command during the registration window. There is no limit to the 
        number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon 
        Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br>
        <br>
        Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can 
        not be rescinded. The actual character-move will take place sometime next 
        week, at a time to be announced later. Please keep in mind that corpses 
        are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed 
        corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <br>
        <br>
        Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message 
        Forum available via <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">www.everquest.com</a>.</font></p>
