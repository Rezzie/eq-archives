      <p align="left"><font size="2">*General Changes* </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Sounds have been updated for NPCs in Kunark. Your Iksar 
          should no longer sound like humans. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane 
          will no longer be natively KOS to the outpost in the Overthere. Take 
          care that if you have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently 
          by your deeds, you may still find yourself KOS. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane 
          of Fear. Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Several problems with the guards that were buffed up 
          last week have been addressed. Some guards that should not have been 
          buffed have been fixed. In addition, due to the level of the new guards, 
          they all gained the ability to innately see-invisible. The level of 
          those guards has been reduced so that they no longer automatically get 
          this ability, making it a bit easier to sneak by them. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in 
          terms of ease of completion and reward. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">*Item Updates* </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked 
          as NO RENT, causing it to disappear on logout. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back. It 
          was showing as a 2H sword when equipped. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an 
          artifact. This has been corrected. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai 
          Hide Armor. It was displaying improperly in the inventory slots. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that 
          it must be worn to activate its effect.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2"> Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby 
          the damage and delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 
          delay weapon. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead 
          of a small sack. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked 
          like a small sack, now looks as intended. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's 
          effect set to the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee 
          weapon. The "Lull" effect has been replaced with an appropriate effect. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Pouch of Mistletoe Powder will now impart its effect 
          on the targeted character.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Mosquito Wings are available in game once again. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Many items had incorrect usage restrictions, and have 
          been repaired. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">As always, we strive to avoid making negative changes 
        to items that already exist in game. However, there are cases where a 
        particularly unbalancing error has been made, such as with the Scourgetail 
        Whip mentioned above, where the item in question must be fixed in interest 
        of maintaining game balance. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We will continue to repair problems, add content, and 
        enhance gameplay in both Kunark and EQ proper. We appreciate everyone's 
        support. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Thank you, </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The EverQuest Team </font></p>
