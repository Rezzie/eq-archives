      <p align="left"><b>Spell Changes and Additions</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids 
          and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These 
          spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.</b></li>
        <li><b>Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing 
          of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.</b></li>
        <li><b>Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain 
          types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available 
          in the game. May your quest for such spells be successful.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Item Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves. After a fair
    amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water
    effects from these items. They have been replaced with modified versions of
    Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves).</li>
  <li>The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the
    waist.</li>
  <li>The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate.</li>
  <li>Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to
    right click and worn to activate.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug Fixes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the
    wrong location.</li>
  <li>Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6
    to 16.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging.</li>
  <li>Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals.</li>
  <li>Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters
    even when he is away from his home.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild. Typing /guildd
    in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete. /guildd now has
    a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to the
    accidental deletion of a guild.</li>
        <li><b>Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can 
          turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This will 
          only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle 
          effects.  This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that 
          hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still 
          being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain 
          paladin weapons...</b></li>
  <li>Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages. This will allow
    you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others
    misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC
    spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the
    client.  This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your
    connection, and can help those with slower connections with better
    performance and connectivity.</li>
  <li>Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones. They will also
    be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through. Any of those
    zones that they are not currently making announcements in will be added in
    the next patch or two.</li>
  <li>Shift Left and Shift Right will now repeat in the chat window. This means
    that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and
    Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning
    of the line or until you release the keys.</li>
        <li><b>The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when 
          you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.</b></li>
  <li>View perspective in wolf form has been fixed. First-person view will now
    be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it. At the same
    time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing on
    the ground instead of floating a few feet above it.</li>
  <li>Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the
    craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the
    craftsperson is using the proper ingredients. Failure of the craftsman to
    use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent.</li>
  <li>In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from
    a trade window. You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust
    the amount of money involved in the trade.</li>
        <li><b>We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells 
          no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will allow 
          those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates 
          even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quest </b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to
    the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you.</li>
