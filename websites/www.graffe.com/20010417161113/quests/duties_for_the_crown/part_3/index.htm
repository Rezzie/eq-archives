  <p>Once again, go find Loremaster Borannin in the Thurgadin library (-303.00, 
    812.00).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>You say, 'what chore'</p>
    <p>Loremaster Borannin says 'The council agrees that you have demonstrated 
      a disdain for our enemy, the Kromrif, that rivals our own. They now ask 
      that you demonstrate your loyalty to the Dain by humbling yourself and serving 
      our people. Give this, my seal, to Mordrin. He will instruct you further.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have what looks like a silver coin in your inventory called <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('bornannins_seal.jpg','bornanninsseal','width=330,height=145')">Bornannin's 
    Seal</a>. You can find <i>Mordin</i> Frostcleaver<i> </i>inside Mordin's Meats 
    at -221, -220. Note that his name is Mordin and not Mordrin.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'hail Mordin Frostcleaver' </p>
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Ah, hello there, and welcome to me shop. Ye'll 
      have to excuse the mess but I've been havin a bloody good time here lately. 
      . . HAR HAR, ye get it? Anyways, thanks to you offlanders I now have a selection 
      of some exotic meats never afore seen here on Velious. In addition to supplyin' 
      the freshest meat in Thurgadin I also offer tasks to would-be hunters in 
      the wastes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now hand Mordin the Bornannin's Seal.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hullo, I see you've signed on for a bit of<br>
      food service eh? Well we can always use an extra pair a hands here dat's 
      fer sure. First things first, warsh yer grubby mitts an cook up dinner fer 
      good ol Leif. Shouldn be too tough fer ye, he has simple enough taste. Make 
      him a Tundrabear sandwich an lemme know when he's been fed. Dontcha ferget 
      ta give him this with his meal.</p>
    <p><i>(you do not get experience here but you might get faction)</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have in your inventory <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('leifs_napkin.jpg','leifsnapkin','width=330,height=145')">Leif's 
    Napkin</a>.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'What tundrabear sandwich?'</p>
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Dat's easy, ye just take a slab a dat Tundra<br>
      Kodiak meat and a jug a sauce, put it in da oven, den combine the product 
      with a loaf a bread in a mixin bowl an there ye be.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now go out and kill a Tundra Kodiak to loot the Tundra Kodiak Meat. The closest 
    place to find them is in the SouthWest part of Great Divide or roaming in 
    Eastern Wastes near the Orc Fort. The jug a sauce can be purchased from Perkins 
    in the Exchange. The recipe for the Tundrabear Sandwich is -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step One. 1 Tundra Kodiak Meat, 1 Jug of Sauce. Put them in an oven and 
      hit combine. You now have some <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('saucy_bearmeat.jpg','saucybearmeat','width=330,height=145')">Saucy 
      Bearmeat</a>.</li>
    <li>Step Two. 1 Saucy Bearmeat from step one, 1 loaf of bread. Put these in 
      a mixing bowl and hit combine. You should now have a Tundrabear Sandwich.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now go find Guard Leif located outside the guard barracks (-285.00, +500.00) 
    near the library and hand him the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('tundrabear_sandwich.jpg','tundrabearsandwich','width=330,height=145')">Tundrabear 
    Sandwich</a> sandwich along with Leif's Napkin that you got from Mordin.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Guard Leif says 'Well I'll be derned. An outlander that can make a good<br>
      Bearmeat 'n Bread! Thank ye.</p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Guard Leif gives you back a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('used_napkin.jpg','usednapkin','width=330,height=145')">Used 
    Napkin</a>. Take this napkin back to to Mordin Frostcleaver and hand it to 
    him. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Well done outlander! We'll make a chef of you<br>
      before we're through. Next you'll need to whip up some Snow Bunny stew fer 
      missus Coldheart. Again, give her this napkin with her meal an lemme know 
      when she's been served.</p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mordin has now handed you <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('tritas_napkin.jpg','tritasnapkin','width=330,height=145')">Trita's 
    Napkin</a>. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'What snow bunny stew'</p>
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Simple enuff, getcherself two hunksa Bunny meat 
      and a jug a sauces. Stir 'em in a mixin bowl, then put spices and two flasks 
      a water with it and cook it in a pot. Mmmm, zesty!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To find bunnies, head to Eastern Wastes. You may have to kill a lot of bunnies 
    for the meat... or you may have good luck and get two right off the bat. Again, 
    jug of sauce are at Perkins and a mixing bowl is neccessary. To make Snow 
    Bunny Stew, use the following recipe -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step One. 2 Snow Bunny Meats, 1 Jug of Sauce. Put these in a mixing bowl 
      and hit combine. You now have some <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('saucy_bunnymeat.jpg','saucybunnymeat','width=330,height=145')">Saucy 
      Bunnymeat</a>.</li>
    <li>Step Two. 1 Saucy Bunnymeat from step one, 1 pot, 1 spices, 2 waters (not 
      summoned or foraged). Put these in an oven and hit combine. You should now 
      have a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('snow_bunny_stew.jpg','snowbunnystew','width=330,height=145')">Snow 
      Bunny Stew</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep in mind that in order to make all of these recipes, your baking skill 
    must be sufficient enough to do so. One submitter's baking was at 67 and making 
    the meat was trivial. Now hand this stew and Trita's Napkin to Trita Coldheart. 
    She can be found in an unnamed building, in the back and down a bit (-115.00, 
    +317.00).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Trita Coldheart says 'Why thank you, I haven't tasted snow bunny stew<br>
      this good in quite some time. Be a dear and take this back to Mordin for 
      me. </p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>She gives you a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('dirty_pot.jpg','dirtypot','width=330,height=145')">Dirty 
    Pot</a> to return to Mordin. Go back to Mordin and hand it to him.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Now yer cookin! Letsee here... Guard Leif,<br>
      check... Trita Coldheart, check... Ahh yes, next we need an Ulthork meat 
      pie fer Brita. She's a doll, smart too, but she can be testy when she's 
      hungry so get movin!</p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
    <p>You say, 'what ulthork meat pie'</p>
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'Hmm, lemme look that one up. Been awhile since 
      I made one. Here we are, two Ulthork meats, a vinegar and a spices in a 
      mixin bowl. Put yer meat mix, a clump a dough, an a pie tin in da oven an 
      yer good ta go.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ulthrok Meat Pie Recipe</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step One is 1 Milk, 1 Flour, 1 Snake Egg. Put in mixing bowl and hit combine. 
      You now have 'a clump of dough'.</li>
    <li>Step Two is 2 Ulthork Meats, 1 vinegar, 1 spices in a mixing bowl and 
      hit combine. You now have some <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('spicy_ulthork_meat.jpg','spicyulthorkmeat','width=330,height=145')">Spicy 
      Ulthork Meat</a>. </li>
    <li>Step Three is 1 clump of dough, 1 Spicy Ulthork Meat (from step two), 
      1 pie tin. Put these three items in an oven and hit combine. You now have 
      an Ulthork Meat Pie. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Give the Ulthork Meat Pie to Lorekeeper Brita in the library (-184.00, 810.00).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Lorekeeper Brita says 'Ohh, that's better. I get so touchy when I'm hungry. 
      I should probably go apologize to Derrin for being snappy. Please return 
      this to Mordin for me.</p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>She gives you a used pie plate or tin<i> (name not positive, picture needed).</i> 
    Give this item to Mordin. Upon doing so Mordin will give you &quot;Thoridain's 
    Napkin&quot; and reply with the following dialogue -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'More dirty dishes eh? Well outlander, only one<br>
      more meal to serve and I'll be done with ye. Make a Snow Griffin souffle 
      fer the GzRST Historian himself. It's his favorite.</p>
    <p>You say, 'what snow griffin soufle'</p>
    <p>Mordin Frostcleaver says 'This one's a bit tricky, ya toss four snow griffin<br>
      eggs and a pack of spices in de oven. Ye must bake it just right or it's 
      all<br>
      gunna be wasted. When yer done bring it to Thoridain and if ye did it right 
      he'll give ye his special seal. Just show Borannin that seal and yer shawl 
      and he'll know that yer finished in the kitchen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Snow griffin eggs can be found on snow griffins in Eastern Wastes. A pack 
    of spices can once again be found for sale on Perkins in the Exchange. The 
    recipe for Snow Griffin Soufle is -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>4 Snow Griffin Eggs, 1 spices. Put these items in an oven and hit combine. 
      You should now have a Snow Griffin Soufle.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>One submitter tried to combine the items with a baking skill of 67 and failed. 
    Another viewer did the baking with a skill of 125 and it was trivial. Now 
    give the snow griffin soufle as well as Thoridain's Napkin to Grand Historian 
    Thoridain. Thoridain can be found in the library also (-317.00, +805.00)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Grand Historian Thoridain says 'My compliments, Arrta , what a wonderful 
      dish! Please accept my personal Seal as a token of my appreciation. May 
      it give you power over your adversaries.</p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He gives you a 'Seal of Thoridain'. Now take this seal and your shawl from 
    quest 2 to Loremaster Borannin and trade. In return, Borannin will upgrade 
    your shawl to a Woven Coldain Prayer Shawl with once again, +1 on all stats 
    as well as give you back the Seal of Thoridain to you.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Loremaster Borannin says 'Well done Arrta , the council will be impressed 
      with your effort. Here is the woven prayer shawl, wear it with pride. I 
      know there is talk of great plans for you, be sure to come back and ask 
      me what the council has [brewing].</p>
    <p>Your faction standing with Coldain got better<br>
      Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse<br>
      Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse<br>
      You gain experience!!</p>
