      <p align="left"><b><u><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patch 
        Day</font></u></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        The primary focus of today's patch is to implement changes noted in the 
        new Producer's Letter which can be found at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml" target="_blank">http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml</a> <br>
        <br>
        It is <b>highly recommended </b>that you read the Producer's Letter before 
        playing EverQuest. It contains some unprecedented and exciting enhancements 
        to gameplay.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to these changes, the following changes have been implemented:<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Bug Fixes</u></b><br>
        </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fixed 
          a bug that caused 'root' and 'snare' type spells to function incorrectly 
          when stacked. They should now stack properly.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fixed 
          a bug that negated the 'instrument modifier' for bards using Selo's, 
          causing them to run slower than they otherwise would. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fixed 
          a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to stack. 
          Levitation spells should not stack.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Track 
          Corpse' spell now works.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tracked 
          down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very small percentage 
          of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the game.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fixed 
          a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear on death 
          if the wearer was of extremely low level.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tserrina's 
          Whip has been fixed. If you received one prior to today's patch, you 
          will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get one that 
          works correctly.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week's 
          patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing, and Torpor, 
          so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally causing 
          it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells. This has been 
          fixed. The downside to this fix is that these spells will now overwrite 
          the 'Call of Bones' series. As the three former spells are cast to save 
          a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial 
          for all of those involved. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stronger 
          /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for confirmation when 
          looting your own corpse. It is highly suggested that everyone reset 
          their option to the strongest security available: /lootnodrop <u>always</u> 
          (always ask for confirmation).</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Added 
          some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that being 
          that an NPC named 'Ragefire' would die and not leave a corpse. Though 
          we were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we added 
          should function as a catch-all for this problem. Please be sure to let 
          us know how this goes.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Changes/Enhancements</u></b><br>
        </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
          not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier 
          has also been increased in Guk (Upper Guk), by roughly 12%.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Lay on 
          Hands' has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overlooked 
          in the last patch message, new spells were made available to Rangers 
          and Paladins in the upper levels. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'Voice 
          of the Berserker', a beneficial spell, no longer drains mana over the 
          duration of the spell.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The maximum 
          duration of 'Strength of Nature' has been increased.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new 
          spell for magicians is now available in game.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Shield 
          of the Eighth' spell will now last a number of minutes equal to your 
          level.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can 
          now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the character 
          select screen. In addition, the last character you chose will be automatically 
          hilighted when entering that screen.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This value 
          is stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file as 'LastCharSel=0-7'</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ranger's 
          'Trueshot' discipline has had its damage increased after analyzing data 
          from its fix last week. Prior to the last patch, all bows, while under 
          the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows regardless of 
          the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage was based on the 
          damage of the bow. This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in relation 
          to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses). </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can 
          now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers using the /reversesound 
          command. This should be very useful for those who have had to place 
          their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Made some 
          improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address some concerns 
          brought forth by the players. Both zones had some problems that would 
          cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some cases.</font></li>
