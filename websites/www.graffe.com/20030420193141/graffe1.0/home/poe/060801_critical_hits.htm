          Here is a possible way to implement critical hits on evocation spells:</p>
        <p>base number = X*(Evoc skill/Spell Level) + (research skill/10) + (specialization 
          Evocation/10).</p>
        <p>Where spell level is the level of the spell being cast. X is a modifier 
          based on class. 2 for wizards, 1 for other classes (if crit hits are 
          not wizard only).</p>
        <p>When a spell is cast get a random number 1-100. If this number is less 
          than the base number a crit hit occurs. When a crit hit occurs, there 
          is no chance for resist and the spell does (base - rand number) extra 
          damage.</p>
        <p>This will max out at about 50% chance if the caster is using their 
          most recently obtained spells.</p>
        <p>Here are a few comments on the idea:<br>
          1. Max base number is 50. Therefore max crit hit is 150% of norm and 
          max chance for crit is 50%.</p>
        <p>2. Creatures 10 levels higher than caster can not be crit hit.</p>
        <p>3. Creatures over the 6 lvl limit, but under the 10 lvl crit limit 
          can only be hit if a spell crits.</p>
        <p>4. Agro is counted the same as if spell didn't crit.</p>
        <p>5. Research is included to represent that a good researcher would have 
          superiour knowledge of both the mob and the spell.</p>
        <p>6. Crit hits would show up in battle text, just like warrior crit hits 
          do.</p>
        <p>7. Perhaps, the base should be modified for different zones or continents. 
          This could be a way to help balance the classes in different continents. 
          The 50% damage bonus could vary from zone to zone, but I wouldn't make 
          it too high.</p>
        <p>8. It should be noticibly better for wizards, if not wizard only. </p>
        <p>9. Resistant chance reduction is a critical aspect of this idea. </p>
        <p>10. Items which aid this could be introduced, but be careful.</p>
        <p>Oh, and yes, I'm a wizard. I enjoy my class very much. I also play 
          a variety of alts.</p>

          <p>Thanks for the well written suggestion. Critical hits on spells is 
            something we have discussed in the past. I personally think it's an 
            excellent idea, and that it could be balanced to account for the different 
            power scales over our continents. That being said, we don't have the 
            time to allocate adding this type of functionality right now. Critical 
            spell hits would be a big change requiring a lot of play testing. 
            currently there are no plans to add it, but I won't rule it out as 
            a feature that we may decide to add at some point down the road. </p>
          <p>Thanks for the feedback, and glad you enjoy the game so much</p>

          <p>We get a few suggestions about this every day. Thanks for the answer,
