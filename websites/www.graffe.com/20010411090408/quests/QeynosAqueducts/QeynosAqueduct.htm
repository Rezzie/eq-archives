      <p>Within Qeynos at the bridge near the bank, there is an NPC named <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('Zamel.jpg','zamel','width=313,height=316')">Zamel</a>. 
        Speak to him about the aqueducts, beasts and children. He will then give 
        you the information you need to start the quest. Go down into the water 
        where the bridge is and find the spawn point within the sewer (132, -63). 
        Please note that there is a way down in the water right next to Zamel 
        but it has been blocked off for downward travel. You must use the other 
        entrances to get down. Kill everything that spawns and at some point <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('GraffeVSCuburt.jpg','cuburt','width=634,height=481')">Cuburt</a>, 
        a gelatinous cube, will come out. Kill him and he will sometimes drop 
        a tattered dress. Kill Cuburt quickly or he will sometimes kill himself 
        within the water as he runs away. Take the tattered dress back to Zamel 
        and he will in return give you a +3 intelligence earring (the booby prize 
        is a piece of hemitite). Getting the earring in return is actually quite 
        rare. Be prepared to do this quest over and over.</p>
      <p>HELPFUL INFO:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faction can be easily raised by giving Guard Wenbie muffins 4 at a 
          time in <br>
          Qeynos. The reward on the earring quest seems to be relative to faction.</li>
