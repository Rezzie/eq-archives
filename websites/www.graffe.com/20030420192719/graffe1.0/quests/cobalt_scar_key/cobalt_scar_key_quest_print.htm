<p class=MsoBodyText2 align="center">In order to enter Cobalt Scar from the zone 
  of Skyshrine, you or a party member will need a key. In order to get this key 
  you will need to kill a named drake called 'Ziglark Whisperwing' within Skyshrine 
  or you can quest for it.</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>**SPOILER**</b></p>
<p>If you wish to quest for the key, your faction with 'scarsofveeshan' will need 
  to be at least dubious or you will need an enchanter to charm Ziglark Whisperwing. 
  Note that only one party member needs the key from this quest in order for your 
  party to be taken to Cobalt Scar. </p>
<p>To get to Ziglark Whisperwing, enter skyshrine, go through first portcullus, 
  go right then left. To get to the fountain, go through first portcullus, go 
  left, left, right, left. Once you find Ziglark, he will need to be charmed before 
  you can speak to him. Once charmed -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You say, 'hail Ziglark Whisperwing'<br>
    Ziglark Whisperwing says 'Greetings Xekl, I am the Herald of Lord Yelinak 
    the great Ice Dragon. Im charged with taking care of all mundane tasks that 
    are too trivial for the great dragon.</p>
  <p>You say, 'I am worthy'<br>
    Ziglark Whisperwing says 'You must first prove this to me before I allow you 
    through our home. Wenglawks of Kael is an acquaintance of ours that has been 
    feeding us information on the Storm Giants movements through Velious. Lately 
    our couriers to him have disappeared. What you must do is take this request 
    to him along with 200 platinum as payment for the Storm Giants locations and 
    return the information back to me. After you complete this task for me we 
    will discuss passage through the skyshrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You now have in your posession a 'Message to Herald'. You must take this to 
  Wenglawks of Kael and hand him both the platinum as well as this message at 
  the same time. You can hand it to him while being invisible but be ready to 
  high-tail it to the zone as soon as you hit 'trade', because all hell is going 
  to break loose.</p>
<p>Wenglawks can be found in Kael at location +317, +1910. To get there, from 
  Wakening Lands enter Kael and take the first possible left. You'll come to 2 
  giant wooden doors at about location +200, +1750. Enter either one and go through 
  another doorway to find Wenglawks. If you are KOS, stay invis and hand Wenglawks 
  the message as well as the 200pp and hit trade. This is the text that follows 
  but don't stick around read it - run for the zone! <i>(one report that a player 
  was attacked as soon as they opened up the trade window, so be careful!)</i> 
  -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Wenglawks Kkeak says 'Here is the information your employer requested. Now 
    be gone, I have more business to take care of.</p>
  <p>You gain experience!!</p>
  <p>You appear.</p>
  <p>Wenglawks Kkeak says 'You will not live to regret that!<br>
    Wenglawks Kkeak says 'Wizards like you always bring out the worst in me.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You now have a letter that you must take back to Ziglark in Skyshrine. You 
  will need to have an enchanter charm him again in order to hand him the letter. 
  After he is charmed, hail him to start up the quest again and then hand him 
  the letter. In return for the letter, Ziglark will give you the key to Cobalt 
  Scar. Ziglark spawns every 24 minutes.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Ziglark Whisperwing says 'Excellent, you have gotten the information back 
    and you are still in one piece. Perhaps you could be useful to our cause. 
    Here is the key to leave the Skyshrine. Just place it on the flaming pot of 
    the dragon statue, near the center of the pool in the courtyard.</p>
  <p>You gain experience!!</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'><img width=310 height=125 id="_x0000_i1031"
src="shrine_key.jpg" border=0></p>
<p>This key is like the Sebilis and Howling Stones key in that it is 'soulbound'. 
  This means that even if you die, it will be on you... not your corpse. The difference 
  in this key is that only one party member needs the key in order to transport 
  the group to Cobalt Scar.</p>
