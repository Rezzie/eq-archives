<br />
Assuming the worst possible case &#8211; that you are the only one nuking the mob:<br />
<br />
There are 32 possible outcomes over the next 5 nukes when arcomancy procs; only two of these cases allow for all 5 procs to be used (52.2% of the time).  The next most common case is that only 1 proc is used (15% of the time), with the other cases ranked 2 3 4 procs used.  Overall, the average efficiency of arcomancy in the worst case is ~74.2%.  This means:<br />
<br />
Arcomancy 6 = 1250 x 5 x .742 = 4637.5 damage per proc, or 4637.5 * .15 = 695.625 damage per spell cast<br />
<br />
When using 1 magic nuke and 1 of any other nuke, the efficiency is 88.5%, so:<br />
<br />
Arcomancy 6 = 1250 x 5 x .885 = 5531.25 damage per proc, or 5531.25  * .075 = 414.814 damage per spell cast.		<br />
<br />
<br />
The quickest possible magic/magic chain is 5.5 seconds which means Arcomancy adds ~253 damage/second at its maximal state.<br />
<br />
In a TW+WMB chain, the dps is lower, at 102.4 damage/second.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is interesting is arcomancy on raids is actually significantly better than it is in a group.  In a perfect world, all 5 procs could be used within a single cast + spell recast, thereby increasing the efficiency of the effect to 100% or 340.9 damage/second when chaining CBB/CBS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pyromancy<br />
<br />
Pyromancy on the other hand, has actually decreased in per proc efficiency post spell revamp, as the number of casts possible in 30 seconds has increased. Also, it&#8217;s maximum dps addition is 166.7 damage. EDIT - What's interesting about pryomancy is that while it's per proc efficiency has decreased, the actual dps addition has increased; Because the damage is independent of your  casts, a second proc during the current damage event is not an unfavorable condition -- in fact you're significantly more likely to proc a new cast of pyromancy before the first is complete than not! So while you gain less per proc, the volatility of the additional damage is much lower.  The likely case (~76%) is that you will continuously have pyromancy on the mob.   Still, the cost is excessive and the dps gain is significantly lower than Arcomancy. To be competitive, Pyromancy 6 should be increased in damage by as much as 2.05x, while reducing the AA cost by about 2 per level.  I'm interested in seeing exactly where the average damage of this effect sits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cryomancy<br />
<br />
Cryomancy is an easy model, since the direct damage portion is always the same, and never fails to damage -- it has the highest damage volatility but a perfect efficiency at 510 damage per cold spell cast.  Unfortunately this means 127.5 damage per second on average, which is significantly lower than even Pyromancy.  4637 damage per proc for rank 6 would put the damage impact equivalent to the average arcomancy case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tangleweave Energy impacts our damage multiplier:<br />
<br />
In Focus: 2.059 x<br />
Out of Focus: 1.884 x<br />
Tangleweaved; 2.384 x<br />
<br />
The difference between our normal damage cases and our Tangleweave case is:<br />
<br />
In Focus: 2.384 - 2.059 = .325 @ 25% rate = + .08125 x; this equates to .08125 / 2.059 = 3.95% increase in the average damage of the next spell cast.<br />
Out of Focus: 2.384 - 1.884 = .500 @ 25% rate = .125 x; this equates to .125 / 1.884 = 6.63% increase in the average damage of the next spell cast.<br />
<br />
The problem with Tangleweave is you actually have to cast it, and it really isn't very good.  It is better efficiency than any of the other &quot;core&quot; nukes, but that doesn't mean that it is better than the nukes we actually [should] use on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Your best case for TW + X, for overall dps gained is TW + Ethereal Incineration:<br />
<br />
11565 + (19337 x 1.0663 = 20661) / 9.63 = 3346 dps -- no recourse dps of 3209, for a gain of 137 dps or 4.27% overall.<br />
Efficiency of 32227/2163 = 14.90 damage per mana -- no recourse dpm of 14.28 for a gain of .61 dpm.<br />
<br />
For reference, the worst case is TW + Claw of Selig, at about 1.5% increase in dps.<br />
<br />
The problem is, there is *always* a better case for DPS and DPM for all variations on X when you're trying to maximize DPS; Adding a  combination of FF/RS and WMS/WMB allow you to overwhelm any possible TW pattern except:<br />
<br />
When you are casting TW + FF/RS or WMB.  The TW + WMB case may actually be the most efficient damage possible at the DPS, I didn't try every possible case available but it seems to be that you cannot perform a spell cycle both more dpm and more dps than 2177 dps at 20.11 dpm, which is TW + WMB's damage.  Arcomancy adds 102.5 dps to that making it 21.05 dpm.  I didn't model FF/RS and TW, I will later maybe.<br />
<br />
The problem I have, is trying to find a case where I'd want to maximize to 21.05 dpm.  You gain massive efficiency on the way to 1550 dps, up to 30 dpm; you gain massive dps on the way down to 15 dpm, up to 4500.  I just don't see a use for it, even though it is perhaps the most efficient damage you can do at a given dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously, there are uses for TW when you want to use magic but not maximize burst -- it is the best magic nuke for efficiency by far.  The only time I'd choose use magic for that purpose is if hell has frozen over, though.  Arcomancy doesn't make up for the fact that our magic spells are trash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wanted to figure out if your TW + WMB cycle had any merit, but first I had to figure out how much damage Arcomancy did to model it correctly, so I spent a few days thinking about it on and off and just brute forced the conditional probability tree.  Interestingly enough, TW+WMB might be our dps critical point which is neat!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arcomancy = 695.625 dmg / cast<br />
MR III = 1937 / cast.<br />
<br />
There is honestly no reason why these abilities should not stack other than a code issue -- I hope it is on the list to make these stack at some point.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough though, when pyromancy was innate, it didn't cause this issue -- Could we change these to innate again, and then give a no-cost AA that blocks them (call it Dampen Magic), so we can turn off pyromancy if we wanted?  This might work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
~2500 is with full focuses, adding slightly more than 102 dps for arcomancy since CBB will proc it too. That's a non-volatile base of ~2300 dps, with CBB making up the other 200 on GoERM procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pallin</div><div class="date">January 16th, 2008, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cryomancy is an easy model, since the direct damage portion is always the same, and never fails to damage -- it has the highest damage volatility but a perfect efficiency at 510 damage per cold spell cast.

<br />
I am going to have to disagree with your assessment of Cyromancy vs Pyromancy for the fact that you do not consider the distribution of the procs over the course of time.  If you have two Pryos fire back to back the damage added by pyro mancy is 1000 points (since all it does is reset the dot timer from what I gather) however if you have two Cryos proc back to back your added damage is 3400 points.  Take the following example encounter:<br />
<br />
720 second encounter (12 minutes or 120 ticks)<br />
200 spells casted (One spell cast every 3.6 seconds)<br />
Average number of procs = 200*.15 = 30<br />
<br />
Over the course of the fight, assuming the best proc distribution of 1 proc every (720/30) 24 seconds, the absolute most that pyromancy can add is (120 tics * 1000pts/tic) 120,000 points of damage.  <br />
<br />
If Cyromancy procs the exact number of times, regardless of when the procs happen, it would add (30*3400) or 102,000 points of damage.<br />
<br />
If you don't consider when the procs are fired you would simply be able to say that Cyromancy added (102,000/720) 141.67 DPS and Pyromancy added (120,000/720) 166.67 DPS.<br />
<br />
The previous calculations are an absolute MAX that pyromancy can put out and the average amount that Cyromancy can put out.  If procs all happened back to back, although very improbable, pryomancy would only be up for 23 tics adding at a maximum of 23,000 pts of damage ... Cyromancy would still add the same 102k.<br />
<br />
If you have an above average number of procs, pryomancy is still capped at the 120k, cyromancy remains uncapped.  Suppose all 200 spells fire a mancy  (again very improbable but it supports my point), pyro does only 120k, Cryomancy does an additional (3400*200) 680k.  <br />
<br />
Given the example above in order for Cyromancy to eclipse Pyromancy in added damage, there would need to be 36 procs instead of 30 over the course of 12 minutes or a proc rate of 20% instead of 15% ... anything equal to or greater then a proc rate of 20% and Cryomancy will out damage pryomancy regardless of how the procs are distributed over the course of a fight.<br />
<br />
Don't be so quick to ride off Cyromancy as less powerfull then Pyromancy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varressa Evocara</div><div class="date">January 16th, 2008, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't do a full model of Pyromancy, which I mentioned.  I took a look at the chance of losing pryomancy over the course of 36 seconds (with an 8 second cycle - 512 possible proc outcomes) -- which is 19.6%.  The other 80.4% of the time, you'll keep pyromancy up.  A simple look suggests 166.7 dps x .804 = 143 dps average.  Speeding that up to the fastest possible cycle nets you a 3 second cast...but who would cast FF + CC + CI over any length of time?  In any case, you should get a 88% chance to keep pyromancy up continuously with a 3 second cast (4096 outcomes).  <br />
<br />
With cold, I also modeled for 8 seconds a cycle or 127.5 dps &lt; 143 (pyro).  The fastest cold case is actually RS-Selig-Selay, at 3.5 seconds/spell, but I don't see that as a normal spell cycle, and since fire's quickest spell cycle is 3 seconds/cast, it isn't fair to compare apples to oranges, but you can make the same basic argument and see 145.5 dps for Cryomancy &lt; 146.6 dps for Pyromancy, which *is* a much closer comparison, you're right.<br />
<br />
Simply, my argument was that pryomancy is very stable dps, and tends to be very close to maximum potential over any length of time (even the slowest casting case will be close to 140 dps), and at the most common cycle speed (1 cast per 4 seconds) is better than cryomancy.<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right though, the stability of pryomancy is gained by sacrificing potential;  Cryomancy's perfect efficiency means that as reality diverges from the average, cryomancy gains more than pryomancy -- of course this also means if it is a negative diversion, you're going to lose more than pyromancy.  Over the long term though, Pyromancy should net you about 112% of the damage of Cryomancy.</div></div><hr />

That's a great idea. Make all 3 -mancies innate and add a blocking AA for the rare cases when it's unwanted.

FYI, I am fairly new at playing a wizard so sometimes I may ask you to speak slowly. :)<br />

Since I don't have RS yet, I use CS-Selig-Selay when clearing which when raid buffed I can almost maintain indefinately.  When clearing, rarely does pyromancy get to run its full course so I find that Cyromancy is better in this scenario.<br />

Being innate when there was only Pyromancy is one thing, now you have 3. All 3 being innate would be WONDERFULL. You would be able to have all 3 happen at once on occasion and all this while having MR on you.

All 3 being innate would be WONDERFULL. You would be able to have all 3 happen at once on occasion and all this while having MR on you. This would really not avg. to a huge DPS boost but it would sure beat + spell dmg and silly trinkets like that.<br />

I would be shocked if they let us have it.<br />
You already can have it:<br />

Still, stacking with MR would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also to fix mr procing issues if all thats needed is making it innate, then  just change pyro to a DD like it should be and all the issues with dots breaking mez and junk are gone. also maybe just turn cyro into a dd too but have a new snare proc aa.  problem soved all around really.</div></div><hr />

Changing WMB to a 1 point magic dd would make Arcomancy proc off it. That's not exactly what is desired. It should proc Arco/Pyro/Cryo off the random part. Although, as a temporary measure I would agree on just proccing Arco off the dummy part.<br />
<br />
Making Pyro into a DD is kinda meh, the dot is fine. But again, if that solves the bigger issues - why not.</div></div><hr />

To me these 3 are worth almost nothing as they are. I am not going to put 1 additional AA point in any of them past what I had in TSS, I would much rather buy expandable AAs.</div></div><hr />

Frist is a simple question.<br />

If it procs, can you switch to a different mancy without losing effect..ie Pryo dot or Cryo snare?<br />

Third.<br />
I maxed out Acro for raids only, since it makes the most sence to use it in that situation.  But in order to get it to proc, I will need to use the Magic Spell line much more often.  Wont I be loosing DPS if focus is much better in the Fire and Ice lines?<br />
<br />
Fourth (and Final for now)<br />
When soloing, I am playing with the idea of using Cryo to pull hoping that the slow will proc, then switch to fire because of focus.  Or is it better to snare the mob still.  (I know, snare is old school, but it keeps me alive)<br />

I am not sure of the cryomancy and I am just now saving for accromancy, but for pyromancy I have an audio trigger for the words &quot;your target is now engulfed in flames&quot;. I need to make one for the other two.<br />

<br />
It has a duration, not too many tics, but yes, you can switch and as you cast the requisite line of spells (fire with pyromany, cold with cryomancy, etc) it has a chance to proc.<br />
<br />

I can't speak intelligently on the DPS levels as I do not have the advanced math degrees that others seem to have. :D <br />
<br />
I still use snare except in the unusual instance where you can't snare except with a cryomancy proc (Cogs in Fort Mechanotus) but even then it is a gamble and you are still running for your life.<br />
<br />
I don't see snare ever going out of style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not have or have plans to buy Acro as it is now. I used it a little in Beta. It offers some benefit in groups. In raids I am affraid it is no help.<br />
<br />
As far as I know this is how it works. It has a limited number of procs, 5 I belive. This means that once you get it, debuff is placed on the mob. Keep in mind you are not the only one who can use it. It also is used by any nuke, not just magic. That means that any ranger, beast, sham, dru,....gets the benefit and uses up one of the procs. Very simple this is not such a great benefit to raid DPS. Chances are you will never get to use more than 1 of those procs.<br />
<br />
To be able to get proc you must not have MR on. That is a huge price to pay for questionable outcome. I would not use it. If you never get MR than it is ok.</div></div><hr />

Was just skimming through things to see if I overlooked anything the first time through.  I came across this post about switching which -mancy you are using.  I was away from EQ for a while and returned about 1 year ago.  I use hotkeys with /cast #, but I'm not familiar with the hotkey command line  &quot;/alt activate ###&quot;.  Also, I don't recall whether or not casting a new -mancy automatically overwrites the current one like MR does.<br />
<br />
Is /alt a short form of /alternate ability?  Does activate mean anything other than activate the AA?  Most importantly where does one find the numbers that go into the ### for each -mancy for this type of quick switch back and forth (or for that matter the numbers for any alternate ability)?<br />
<br />
That said, unless you use the Improved familiar instead of a focus flappy, why would you want to be switching back and forth on the -mancy?  You would be losing the 35% benefit of your flappy much of the time wouldn't you?  Maybe there are isolated instances when switching  the -mancy would be a benefit.  Can anyone give me an example please?</div></div><hr />
