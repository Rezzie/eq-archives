        <p>Hello. 
        <p>I have a slight issue I would greatly like to be addressed. 
        <p>The issue is really quite simple, why don't Wizards get the spell Enduring 
          Breath? 
        <p>Here is my logic as to why they should: 
        <p>A. EB seems to be in the same spell line as Levitate, I call it the 
          'Utility' spell line. Every other class that gets Levitate gets EB. 
          Actually, every casting class except Cleric get those two spells. 
        <p>Shaman : Levi, EB <br>
          Druid : Levi, EB <br>
          Enchanter : Levi, EB <br>
          Magician : Ring of Flight (Levi), Waterstone (EB) <br>
          Necro : Dead Man Floating (Levi & EB) <br>
          Wizard : Levi 
        <p>Why? 
        <p>I realize that Wizards get several spell lines that are not intended 
          for the overall use of the class (Bolt Line, Dmg Shield [O'Kiels]) but 
          we stop getting those at lvl 16. 
        <p>Levi is lvl 20, in addition it is RESEARCH. Why would we have to research 
          a spell that is for a line we aren't even going to get completed? 
        <p>I just really don't understand this, and I hope it is an oversight. 
        <p>So is it a mistake that we have levitate, or is it a mistake that we 
          don't have Enduring Breath? I really think these two spells are in the 
          same arena. 
        <p>Thank you for your time. <br>

        <p><b>There are more utility spells out there then Enduring Breath and 
          levitate, and though they are indeed utility spells, they aren't of 
          the same line. </b></p>
        <p><b>Utility spells are any spells that are not combat related. Examples 
          of this, while including EB and Levitate, also include Shrink, most 
          of the mages non-pet summons (even if the result of the summoned item 
          is an attack/defense spell), and a good portion of the enchanter spells 
          (such as metal enchantments, alliance, etc). There are many others as 
          well, including travel spells which would also fall under this definition. 
          </b></p>
        <p><b>Off the top of my head, I don't believe that clerics get either 
          of those spells. I might be wrong about that though. </b></p>
        <p><b>It's not an oversight, it's by design.</b></p>
