<H3>How to get the rod from Erud's Crossing
  <HR noshade>
</H3>
<PRE>
Get yourself some water stones, I acquired six but I think two or three would be good enough.
Get your supply of bat wings out for your levitate spell, I had a stack of 20 on me when I did this.

Once you get to the Island in Erud's Crossing bind yourself there, 
I bound myself on the Island near the sunken ship.

The location of the rod is right on the money (-1162, +2340), 

I tried to get this rod the kamikaze way, where you go to the loc of the rod and then dive for it
but I would always come face to face with a Killer Shark, I tried this twice and both times I had no
success.  Then I said "Bah there's gotta be an easier way to do this".

This is how I did it, the killer sharks never bit me, saw me or agro me.

First thing to do is to cast all you personal buffs and use a water stone for endure breathe
and then caste levitate. 

Be careful when going out there and stay away from the zombie sailors, wandering sharks and
killer sharks.

From the Island looking out at the sunken ship, go to the left of the ship and move out a bit
until you are just past the cliff.

Now look down and move down until you crack the surface of the water, you will be bobbing like a cork
and will have a nice clear view of everything on the bottom of the ocean floor.  Mouse look comes in
handy here to look around and see what is swimming around you.

Observing the Ocean floor I notice 6 sharks swimming in the area.

1 Shark (con green to me at lvl 41)
5 Killer Sharks (con blue to me at lvl 41)

There is a shark(GREEN CON) wandering near the surface of the water (he's just there to scare ya hehe),
there is also 1 and sometimes 2 wandering Killer Sharks(BLUE CON) which swim mid way to the bottom 
but don't see you when bobbing from above them.

If you look down at the Ocean floor you will notice that there are 3 or 4 killer sharks and they swim 
in a triangular pattern.  These three or four killer sharks eventually all meet up in one corner of 
the triangle they form and swim in a group.

When all the sharks are swimming in a group and are at point 'A' of the triangle start to prepare to go 
down, The first killer shark will take off for point 'B' and the other two or three will follow 
accordingly.  When the last killer shark is heading for point 'B' to join up with his group this is when 
you go down after the rod.  

If the killer sharks are swimming in a group of 3 it looks like you have a 30 second window 
to get the rod, if they are swimming in a group of 4 the window is about 20 seconds.

If you see the leading killer shark heading for point 'C' don't bother going down, this shark will agro
you the second he senses you near him, since the rod is between points 'A' and 'C' of the triangle.

Point 'B' of the triangle is so far from the rod that they don't even know you are there, but keep 
an eye out for those wandering Killer Sharks.

I swam towards the cliff and to the bottom then headed north/west when my window opportunity arrived
and there was the rod I took it, swam up and I cheered, danced and went Wooohoooo!!!

FYI, when I was bobbing at the surface I notice a little gold dote and it was the rod.

I hope this helps you out.


Good Luck
