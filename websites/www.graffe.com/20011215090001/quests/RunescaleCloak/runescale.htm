      <p> <font size="2"> This quest begins in the Temple of Solusek Ro from Vilissia. 
        One of the items she offers you is the Runescale Cloak. To obtain this 
        item, you must return to her a Lizardscale Cloak (8ac 5dex) and 3 Runes 
        of Scale.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"> &nbsp; The Lizardscale Cloak can be obtained as the common 
        drop off of the Tae En Templar in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. Please note 
        that unless it has changed with the removal of Rubicite, he spawns very 
        rarely. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"> &nbsp; The Runes are rather tricky to get as well. The 
        easiest is the ones on Deepwater Crocodiles, these are in Oasis and rather 
        plentiful. If you're feeling kind and don't wish to take kills from the 
        newbies, just offer the zone 20pp for looting rights on one that drops 
        the Rune. However, note that the Rune drops 10% of the time at best. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"> &nbsp; The second rune is held by Saltwater Crocodiles 
        in Upper Guk. Please note that these are not the wandering ones at the 
        beginning, to prevent extreme camping I will not go into further detail. 
        The main problem here is that they still come up about 10% of the time 
        but the only saltwater crocs in the entire zone spawn every 25 minutes. 
        Furthermore, as all the saltwater crocs spawn at the same time, either 
        they all have the rune or all don't. For reference, I camped this, alone, 
        with no one else bothering me, for 3-4hrs. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"> &nbsp; The final rune is the one held by the Firescale 
        Crocodile. Again, I won't say the exact location because seeing as there 
        is only 1 in all of Lavastorm, it would be camped worse than Hattan (the 
        fishbone earring guy). I will say that his spawn is very near to the Temple 
        of Solusek Ro, and he spawns every 25 minutes. Verant showed a little 
        more mercy on this one, he seems to drop the rune about 25% of the time. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">&nbsp;Good luck! If all goes well you should have a 5ac, 
        3int, 3agi, 5sv poison, 5sv disease cloak. </font></p>
