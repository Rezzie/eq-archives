<br />
I had heard of this couple years ago, and just wondered if this is still even possible, or even desirable.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind, if you have epic and manarobe and don't have a horse. . . . WTF is wrong with you!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gemlin</div><div class="date">March 25th, 2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer the original posters question:<br />
<br />
Yes you can Epic and use the manarobe to gain mana.<br />
<br />
Effectiveness? <br />
<br />
Depends on your manaregen. If you have a insane manaregen with buffs/flowing thought/etc (FT and buffs upwards up to 92 mana regen a tick STANDING)... then no its better to sit on your horse and med (The 15 second cast time on the epic and the endless clicking isn't worth it). <br />
<br />
However if you are in a smaller guild that doesn't give you the opportunity to get Flowing thought gear, then yes, the robe should be priceless to you</div></div><hr />

Guess it would get up to 92 with Emp robe and maybe the bard song is more due to epic and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aphasia Andesite</div><div class="date">March 26th, 2003, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a mana robe and I did the math. I'll not repeat it right now cuz im lazy.<br />
<br />
it works out to 28 mana/tic accounting for the 15 second cast time on epic and 3 sec per click of epic.<br />
<br />
If you are in an outdoor zone on a horse/lizzie, you get this 28 mana/tic IN ADDITION to your medding regen, so its sweet. <br />
<br />
If you're in a dungeon where you cannot use the horse, then its only 10 mana/tic better than medding (roughly), and believe me, you'll get tired of clicking the damn thing. <br />
<br />
The real problem is you get tired of clicking the robe after a few months. but it really does matter when you do click it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So It's use is marginal to me.<br />
<br />
In a xp group, outside, with horse available, I'd be impressed if a puller could pull fast enough to warrent digging it out ...<br />
Unless the ENC was awol :)</div></div><hr />

Its roughly 2 minutes from oom to FM with a manapool of 4800 back then.  So 20 tics / 4800 = 240mana tic.<br />
Have to factor in zoning time though.<br />
