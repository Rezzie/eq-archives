      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">Today's 
        patch requires that Velious subscribers press the "Velious Patch" button 
        on the patch program UI. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">*Emergency 
        Patch* </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">We 
        appreciate everyone's patience while we address a few issues as tens of 
        thousands of new players check out Velious. This emergency patch addresses 
        several issues: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">The 
          transparent inventory screen will no longer come up in 640x480 resolution. 
          It was not supposed to come up as the available screen space is not 
          large enough to house the new screen. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">"Disabled" 
          windows in full screen mode will no longer interfere with mouse clicks. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">Addressed 
          some item drop bugs in Skyshrine that had the highest-level loot dropping 
          off of yard fodder. This has been addressed with a retroactive item 
          change. We apologize for the inconvenience. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">Several 
          disciplines (Resistant, Trueshot, Unholyaura, and Holyforge) have been 
          upgraded. Please read the updated EQManual_Supplement.doc (or .txt) 
          in your EverQuest Directory. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">"Dragon 
          Circles" have been fully implemented. In short, you will not be able 
          to receive a teleport to a dragon circle unless you've been to the circle 
          before and carry a soulbound souvenir that spawns at the circle. Please 
          read the updated EQManual_Supplement.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">Innate 
          class-based resistances implemented a year or so ago did not take into 
          account levels 50 through 60 with exception to those provided to the 
          warrior. As such, each class that has class-based resistance bonuses 
          (with exception to the warrior) will get an additional bonus as they 
          level from 50 to 60.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">The 
          problem of blank faction messages being reported to the players has 
          been corrected.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">Screenshots 
          are again enabled. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">Overall 
        the Velious launch is going very well. We are happy to see that the problems 
        found so far are minor and that we can address them quickly. </font></p>
