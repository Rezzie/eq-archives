      <p align="left"><b>** New and Changed Features **</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Guild Message of the Day. Guild Officers and Leaders will be able 
          to type /guildmotd &lt;text&gt; to set up a Guild Message of the Day 
          (GMotD). From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will 
          see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, 
          so you will know who sent the message. Any guild member will also be 
          able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will 
          be displayed again. The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, 
          however. You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back 
          up.</li>
        <li><b>/assist changed and improved. It should be much more reliable now. 
          It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted. The assisted 
          person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.</b></li>
        <li>Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses 
          that were too far above or below you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <b>** Skill Change **</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty 
          messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food. 
          We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and 
          increased the chance that you will forage water.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <b>** Spell Changes **</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.</li>
        <li><b>Translocate now has the proper spell gem.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <b>** Bug Fix **</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users. This fix will most 
          likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are 
          having problems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <b>** Item Changes **</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you 
          to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures. We have decided 
          to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish 
          to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show 
          no graphics.</li>
        <li>Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been 
          added.</li>
        <li>Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed. It no longer has the 
          same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.</li>
        <li>Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors. Tinting was 
          never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look 
          better without it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <b>** Miscellaneous Items **</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing 
          the availability of one of the quest items.</li>
        <li>Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.</li>
        <li>Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        <b>** 'Combine' container changes **</b></p>
      <p>We've made a change to 'combine' containers. In order to prevent people 
        from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button 
        will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe. This will 
        be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath. But this removes the 
        only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their reduced weight 
        and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, 
        with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made 
        a mistake.</p>
      <p>We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat. 
        Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh 
        as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.</p>
      <p>Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case 
        you didn't know, most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction 
        of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the weight 
        reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click.</p>
