          Bonds of Force has been uploaded to all servers and is available for

          This will slow your enemies to a walk when casted upon. Finally something

        Well, for those of you that didn't take notice earlier today, I've once 
        again maxed my bandwidth and hits. With over a total of 125,000 page hits 
        in the last 24 hours (don't you think somebody would want to sponsor me? 
        hehe) .. my web host had to put pipe clamp on me once again. I finally 
        bit the bullet and purchased myself a dedicated server on a better host 
        (I hope.. grass is always greener on the other side) and will soon be 
        moving. Also, the URL will soon be shortened. =)</p>
      <p>Enderlin Anklebiter sent in the current info on the new spell Bonds of 
        Force:<br>
        Level 29 Area Effect<br>
        75 mana to cast</p>
      <p>Hoping somebody took a pic of the stats while on the vendor (or bought 
        it) and can tell us exactly what it does. From the name, it does sound 
        like either an Area Root or an Area Root with damage. Any info would be 
        most appreciated. <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">Send</a> it in!</p>

          Lightning and the other is for the level 29 spell, Energy Storm. Visit

          This is the start of the sites color change. Hope this makes it a bit 
          easier to read for you guys. Out of everybody, I received two <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">emails</a> 
          from people that had troubles reading the way it was before... and that 
          is two too many. I want to make this site enjoyable and user friendly 
          for everybody. So if you have a problem with it, let me know. Also, 
          in the table of contents to the left, I switched the rollover image 
          color to match this text. That should also make it a bit easier for 
          you to navigate. For an explanation of the old color scheme: I am a 
          Dark Elf and was going for a 'dark' feel. Well, I got it... not knowing 
          that the site would get this much traffic, I continued to add pages 
          in the same format. So, out with the old and in with the new. Enjoy... 
          the rest of the site will soon match. (just have to pry myself from 
          Norrath). <br>

          Duran DiNova emailed me this bit of news that most of you will find 
          interesting:</p>
        <p><br>
          A deed has been commited, a horrible deed. You know they happen often, 
          but this one finally stuck to you, but you cannot explain why. You take 
          a walk to clear your head and relieve some of the tension you feel gripping 
          you. As you are walking, you find yourself lost, you don't know how 
          you could have ended up lost in an area you grew up in. It grows dark. 
          You stop, in the distance, a figure is walking towards you, it is soon 
          standing before you, but you cannot make out the face. Then it speaks... 
          "The paladins fell, the heros grow corrupt, the you? Ways that led back 
          to the same. You have been blinded as to what is the truth, you knew 
          that all your life? But now a choice has been given to you. Begin on 
          the path of the true understanding now, the understanding you have been 
          trying to find. Are you of the Silence?" The Order of the Silence is 
          a Solusek Ro worshiping guild getting ready for the racewar server. 
          This means that only wizards and Bards will be allowed within it's ranks. 
          We are focused greatly on RP and on creating an RP enviroment on the 
          Racewar server. Since this is a Wizard board, please give this guild 
          your consideration. We all know the power of a Wiz, but we all know 
          the hardships which we must go through in order to gain that power. 
          This guild plans on helping it's members in all cases, especially with 
          solving disputes. Our guild will back up our members in all cases. Many 
          of you that have played this game for a while (myself since beta) may 
          have found that a non-pvp enviroment can be boring and unrealistic, 
          not to mention extremely under-roleplayed. We believe that the racewar 
          server will solve this problem.</p>

          Boy did I blow it. As you can see below, I put the time down as PST.. 
          when infact it was EST. The info page was correct, but I'm sure a few 
          of you were very confused. I apoligize for this. Regardless of this 
          error, there was a tremendous showing of Wizards. So many in fact that 
          the Forum was moved to chat where it could be moderated. Brad showed 
          along with a total of 6 GM's including Geoffrey Z, the lead magic/spell 
          programmer. For a long time it felt like everything we said was shot 
          down in flames by them but in the end they started to listen and reason 
          and actually said they were to make improvements and look into areas 
          we discussed. A huge thanks goes out to Indalamar for getting all of 
          this going.</p>

          Due to many requests, I have implemented a message board. I waited to 
          do so for so long due to the fact that my cgi is overloaded as well 
          as my bandwidth. =) I apoligize for the little ad banners at the bottom 
          of each message board page, but it was part of the deal to get it upon 
          another server. Keep it clean and all I ask is that if you are responding 
          or posting about a spoiler, that you put something in the message header 
          letting people know so. Thanks and enjoy!</p>

          Just recieved a courtesy call from my web host. ((Grin)) Very politely 
          wanted to warn me that my site was about to be shut down. Funny, I could 
          have sworn it was shut down yesterday? </p>
        <p>Anybody out there work for 3dFX, Diamond, Verant, or any other game 
          related company that has connections within that would be willing to 
          throw a logo up here somewhere for a bit of cash? Hehe.. just kidding. 
          Hopefully, this site will be able to handle the load very soon. I moved 
          yet another page to a different shell in hopes of evening out the traffic. 
          Thanks to everybody that views the site and sends in their compliments! 
          Positive reinforcement helps keep me going. I hope to start putting 
          more updates on Wizard info instead of this info concerning the status 
          of the site soon!</p>

          Moved some of the graphic intensive pages to different shell I have. 
          Hope that releives some of the stress the site is experiencing. Again, 
          I am very sorry for the happenings and I know how frustrating it is 
          when a site is slow, not to mention down completely. This website should 
          never be slow for the connection it has is of the highest bandwidth.</p>

          Seems that the traffic on this site is picking up. I've maxed out my 
          quota for bandwidth and its time to find either sponsors or somebody

          Not much happening as of late. Beware that all bolt spells <b>do not</b> 
          work since the patch this morning. Had a rude crash today in Cazic Thule. 
          Our full party was fighting a few lizards when the last thing I remember 
          is casting Force Shock when 'poof', I was back at my desktop. Tried 
          restarting EQ twice and crashed to desktop both times while loading 
          character selection screen. Rebooted and logged on successfully only 
          to find one party member dead and me in the middle of the courtyard 
          with one bubble of life left. Put two and two together and zoned. Seems 
          the entire party crashed for some reason or another and all had to reboot 
          to get back online. If anybody has had this problem, please send me 
          an email so I can see it is just me or there is a majority of us.</p>
        <p>On a side note, a good Dark Elven Wizard friend on Xegony named Indalamar 
          has had it with the current status of our, so to speak, powers. He is 
          holding a wizard forum on Monday, June 14th at 8pm EST. It will be held 
          at the zone drop in Greater Faydark on the Xegony Server (Click <a href="GreaterFaydarkForum.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> 
          for map). All are encouraged to come as he is trying to get GM's to 
          show so that they can see the number of frustrated Wizards out there.<br>

          area: Beholder, Misty Thicket, and Runnyeye. I also put a link to the 
          maker of the majority of the individual zone maps. I stated before a 
          while back that I did not create the maps but I wished to give credit 
          where credit is due. Therefore, I edited in a statement onto the world 
          map so all can see each time. Mapping out a zone is not an easy task 
          and alot of time and frustration is put into each map. These people 
          make our traveling much easier and deserve all the credit in Norrath. 
          As I find maps that I feel are of great quality, I will add them to 
          the missing zones. Enjoy.</p>
