          of Air?:<br>
          Many seem to think the Plane of Air is really for the expansion. The 
          zone is mainly composed of red mobs although yellows and blues are scattered 
          about. Reports of really bad trains and the such. So it seems that this 
          Plane will be for the expansion once everyone is able to level a bit 
          further than the current maximum of 50. Dregen Darklithim of Fennin 
          Ro sent in two pics just to give you an idea of how hard things hit. 
          (note: Dregen even claims that a friend was punched by a Gnome for 1200+

        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Wizard Patch Changes:<br>
          The changes to Wizards mean that for any Wizard above Level 35 they 
          get a lower chance of their Cold, Fire, or Magic spells being resisted. 
          In reality their spells are basically given a built in "debuff" factor. 
          This stacks with any other debuff, such as Tashania, Malosi or Temperate 
          Flux and gives Wizards much better combat effectiveness. It is not a 
          duration debuff. It does not mean when you cast a DD spell the mobs 
          resistance is lowered for other casters in the group. What the tweak 
          does is when a DD spell is cast it looks at the current resistance of 
          the target, and then the new tweak reduces that resistance amount further, 
          then uses that new reduced resistance within the game formula to determine 
          if the spell lands, or is partially or fully resisted. This process 
          is done each and every time you cast a spell which is enchanced by the 
          new code. Wizards should now notice the following with these types of 
          spells now:·Green Mobs: Rarely Resited ·Blue Mobs: Rarely Resited ·White 
          Mobs: Much Lower Resistance ·Yellow Mobs: Much Lower Resistance ·Light 
          Reds: You will now have a much better chance against these mobs. ·Deep 
          Reds: Regular Resistance, with a slight chance of the "debuff factor" 
          assisting. This tweak for Wizards doesn't change the 6 level cap. It 
          simply makes general combat much easier for the Wizard Class. They should 
          be able to use more powerful spells with less resists on mobs that would 
          be resisted by most other members of the party. It should help to keep 
          the Wizard the true masters of direct damage spells.<br>

        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Patch Message:<br>
          The patch wasn't large (took about 30 seconds on DSL) but a lot of things 
          have been updated and added to the game. I'll post what is directly 
          effected to us as wizards here:</p>
        <p> The Plane of Sky is now open!!! As a reminder to our customers, the 
          alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical 
          or ethereal rules as Norrath proper. Enjoy!</p>
        <p>- Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items. 
          This was done to correct issues that could arise from people chain-casting 
          these items.</p>
        <p>*Spell Changes*<br>
          - All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly 
          increased<br>
          - Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<br>
          - NPCs will now treat the "Cancel Magic" series of spells as hostile. 
          Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs 
          before attacking. Now they will.</p>
        <p>*Levitation Changed* <br>
          Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the 
          code that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was 
          active is no longer necessary and has been backed out. The Levitate 
          spell may now be refreshed while the spell is in use. </p>
        <p>*Quest and Items*<br>
          - We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from 
          a level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll. The issuance of a level 49 scroll 
          was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass an abnormally 
          large amount of currency.</p>
        <p>*Paw* <br>
          The difficulty of Paw has been decreased. We found that many of the 
          gnolls in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more 
          difficult than it should have been for the desired level target. Please 
          let us know how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.</p>
        <p>*The Plane of Fear* <br>
          The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased. 
          This change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however 
          the data was not exported. It has been tested and equipment drops are 
          now occurring at a much higher rate.</p>
        <p>*The Plane of Hate*<br>
          The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane 
          of Hate have been decreased. Previously, these NPCs used the same drop-percentages 
          as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop percentages to be extremely 
          high. Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for 
          illusions, and tend to "Hate" everyone. </p>
        <p>*Wizard Enhancement*<br>
          Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, 
          or Fire) much less likely to be resisted. This effect stacks with the 
          Staff of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance 
          debuffs. <br>
          This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about 
          the level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance 
          rates go up. Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes sense 
          that they should be better at causing that damage than the other classes. 
        </p>
        <p>*Manastone Changed* <br>
          The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone, 
          which no longer drops. They cite that people without a Manastone are 
          not as welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other areas as 
          people with them. Since dropping additional Manastones via quest or 
          removing them from the existing populace is not desirable, we've decided 
          to make it so that the Manastone will no longer function in the alternate 
          planes. Furthermore, it will not function in any of the zones included 
          with the Kunark Expansion. </p>
        <p>We apologize to those adversely affected by this change. Our general 
          goal is to avoid making changes to items in peoples' possession, however 
          we felt this change was, all things considered, warranted and for the 
          benefit of the game as a whole. </p>

          allow a little Dark Elf ask a human out for dinner. *smile* Great work 
          Venicia!<br>

        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Mother of all patches?:<br>
          Rumors (only rumors) say that tomorrow's patch will be one of considerable 
          size... much larger than any other patch we have downloaded yet. If 
          this is correct, you may wish to run home tomorrow at lunch or fire 
          it off before you head to work/school and start the download so that 
          you can play when you get home. I'll try to find out just how big tomorrow's 
          patch will be and keep you all posted.<br>

        <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Upcoming Patch:<br>
          I'm simply amazed. Last nights message says that the patch will be going 
          in not on Wednesday but will be started at 7am on Thursday morning. 
          The reason I am amazed is that it is going to be on a day that I actually 
          work. It never fails that the big patches always seem to hit on days 
          that I have all day to play (therefore not letting me play due to the 
          patch and after consequences that usually double their expected time). 
          Keep your fingers crossed that our patch to help us in group makes it 
          in tomorrows update.<br>

          Apparently the changes to Fear were not witnessed across all the servers. 
          On Mith Marr there are still only about 4 fingers and the drop rate 
          was horrible tonight, maybe 2% and that's being generous. I'm glad to 
          hear that some of the servers have it better and I hope that things 
          for us will be fixed on the next installment or something. <br>

          WIZARDS REJOICE ONE AND ALL! Lindiien Lightbringer here, Xegony server 
          i am here to sell you wizards no longer get the shaft when it comes 
          to plane of fear armor. Before yesterday there were only 3 frightfingers 
          in the zone with about a 5% chance of dropping carmine. Sunday, on xegony, 
          i organized and broke the plane of fear and was pleasantly surprised. 
          the changes i noticed are as follows <br>
          1- a LOT more roamers which means fear is harder to break. <br>
          2- the previous samhain tower has had samhains replaced with frightfingers 
          while the old frightfinger house still has frightfingers. This means 
          that instead of 3 fingers in the zone we now have 6. <br>
          Plus on tuedsay the drop rate in fear will be changed from5% to match 
          the 15% drop rate of fear. <br>
          Lindiien Lightbringer Xegony server 50 wizard<br>

          The ever-elusive Carmine Robe has seemed to start showing it's face 
          just a bit more lateley. Either Fear is being overrun or the drop ratio 
          is on a roll. Congrats to both of these guys on their beautiful robes!

          Well the message boards have been down a while. I'm trying to see what
