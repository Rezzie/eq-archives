Created by Merloc Kole, this is a mod to alter the way the spellbook looks.
<br> - No "Done" button, who needs it?
<br> - No left/right page turn buttons, simply click on the background of the page to turn.
<br> - A more compact layout, reducing the covered area from 498x395 to 371x315 pixels.
<br> - A better title!
<br> - Different background and text colors, (edit: spellbook01.tga to make your own background).

      which lets you calculate your mana, be it on an INT or WIS base calculation, 


      without having to do anything special. The calculator will also display 


      mana for every level from 1 to 50, and depending if your character is a 


      pure caster, or a hybrid class, you will get the appropriate results. Thanks
