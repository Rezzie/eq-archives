        <b>***EverQuest Turns Two***</b>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing 
          the course of online gaming. Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active 
          subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%. Peak usage tops 89,000 
          simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000. The EverQuest 
          community continues to grow daily. </p>
        <p>We've put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest's 
          achievement and to thank our loyal fans. Over the next couple of days 
          we will be posting interesting content from EverQuest's humble beginnings, 
          as well as a few surprises. Check it out! <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp" target="_blank">http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp</a></p>

      <p align="left"><b>*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*</b>
      <p align="left">The Warrens:
      <blockquote> 
        <p>As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the 
          release of &quot;The Warrens&quot;, a free expansion zone located on 
          Odus. &quot;The Warrens&quot; is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the 
          home of the Kobolds on Odus. You can patch the Warrens by running the 
          &quot;Optional Patch&quot;. </p>
        <p>In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, &quot;the Warrens&quot; 
          will also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought 
          forth by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some 
          common gameplay issues. We would like to see what options might be open 
          to and enjoyed by the players in the future.</p>
        <p>The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level 
          characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level 
          creatures. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that &quot;outclasses&quot; 
          a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP. 
          All other loot will drop. &quot;Outclassing&quot; a foe is defined as 
          having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience 
          from the kill. This can happen if, for instance, the foe is &quot;green&quot; 
          to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level 
          range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular 
          experience rules.</p>
        <p>Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due 
          to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was &quot;trivial&quot; 
          will be displayed to the group. </p>
        <p>As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and adjustements 
          in the Warrens. Please be sure to let us know what you think!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>The Planes:</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year 
          celebration. Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some 
          high-level foes are now available. <b><i>Rewards for former &quot;boss 
          npcs&quot; have been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful 
          as the old bosses were.</i></b></p>
        <p>The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also 
          includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, 
          now full high-level expansion-oriented content. Much as with Fear, rewards 
          from bosses have been moved. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>Epic Quests:</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic 
          quests for a number of classes. Previously, questers of many classes 
          were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers 
          for a few coveted spawns. In these cases, a new step has been added 
          to separate the &quot;Epic Encounter&quot; NPCs from the &quot;Epic 
          Quest&quot; NPCs. </p>
        <p>For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the 
          same. In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, 
          the same reward applies. What has changed is that some components may 
          be in a different location from where you expect them. It is recommended 
          that you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find 
          where you need to go next.</p>

      <p><b>***Patch Day***</b></p>
      <p>Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time 
          between character control being established and loading of character 
          faction tables.</i></b><br>
        </li>
        <li><i><b>Fixed the Dagger of Frost. Its special item flags were improperly 
          removed in the last patch.</b></i><br>
        </li>
        <li>The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to 
          the enhanced Mark of Karn. The casting time on these items has also 
          been changed to 9 seconds.<br>
        </li>
        <li>NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that 
          caused framerate to drop over time.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole 
          stack. This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause 
          you to pick up one. These both also work for coins now as well as items.<br>
        </li>
        <li>In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking 
          the &quot;Sell&quot; button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell 
          the entire stack of items if a stack is selected. For example, you can 
          sell 20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking &quot;Sell&quot;. 
          I'd recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric 
          first though :) The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation 
          in the near future.<br>
        </li>
        <li>There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there. Check 
          your books. <br>
        </li>
        <li>There are a bunch of new quests as well.<br>
        </li>
        <li>It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it 
          to be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready 
          for use. Let us know if there are any further problems.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what 
          you've foraged.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled 
        for this weekend. Please read the message below for details on the /movelog.</p>
      <p><b>*A Message From Customer Service*</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters 
          moved from one server to another, or from one account to another. Unfortunately, 
          due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the 
          desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other 
          problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters 
          across servers or accounts. </p>
        <p>It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server 
          remain on that server. We also feel that it is important that characters 
          that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the 
          consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from 
          that reputation by changing servers.</p>
        <p>The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving 
          a large number of characters to new servers. At no other time will we 
          move a character in such a fashion.</p>
