        originates by talking to Vilissia within the Temple of Solusek Ro.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;Vilissia 
        says 'The Acumen Mask, as its name suggests, confers to its wearer certain 
        powers of insight and knowledge.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;Vilissia says 'I can make for you an Acumen Mask, but you will need 
        to bring me the proper components. I will need a Glowing Mask from a Skeletal 
        Monk in the Caverns of Guk, A Patch of Shadow from our mortal enemies 
        the Shadowed Men, a Darkbone Skull from a Darkbone Skeleton in the Estate 
        of Unrest and a Bonechipped Mask from a Goblin Headmaster in the Ocean 
        of Tears. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patch 
        of Shadow- this is dropped by Shadowmen (roughly level 25 -30), the place 
        I hunted them to get it was in west commons in the corner of the zone 
        wall, if you follow the right zone wall from Kithicor when facing outwards. 
        you will only see their name and the weapons they carry because they are 
        transparent. (Get this item last. All Shadowmen items are NO RENT which 
        means they will dissapear from your inventory once you log out. -Graff&euml;) 
        Also, be sure you have done the 'Optional Patch' to Everquest so that 
        the Temple of Solusek Ro zone can load. If you have not patched, you cannot 
        go in the Temple.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darkbone 
        Skull- found off of a GREATER darkbone skeleton (roughly level 27-28) 
        in Unrest. Note- I went around blasting normals for an hour then killed 
        a greater in a train and it had it :P (Many of these spawn near the bloodpool 
        and the Ghost in the basement. - Graff&euml;)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glowing 
        mask- this is found in Upper Guk, NOT Unrest. If you go towards the main 
        lower guk zone there is the place that you cross a plank (it is also filled 
        with Heart Spiders), jump in the water and search around for a hidden 
        room. Within that room you will find Tempus, a Dark Elf Necromancer (roughly 
        level 25 -26). The Skeleton Monk (roughly level 24-25) with the mask will 
        be next to him (if you attack the monk, the necro and his pet will join 
        in). I have been told by some that the Necro will not join but he will 
        attempt to heal the Skeletal Monk. This all depends on your level. (note:Glowing 
        Mask has been found upon the Scryer in Upper Guk and did work as a component 
        for the quest - submit by Kyal) (If you cross the wooden plank in the 
        Spider room (see <a href="../../maps/_upper_guk_full.jpg" target="_blank">map</a>), 
        look to your left and you will see a ladder that leads to a ledge and 
        another below that leads from the ledge to the water. Swim to the very 
        bottom there and follow the wall to the right, you will find the room 
        up in an 'air pocket' there. - Graff&euml;)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bonechipped 
        Mask- This is dropped by the Goblin Headmaster (roughly level 24-25) on 
        the Isle Goblin island in the Ocean of Tears. This is the same island 
        the Oracle is on (known to some as the Oracle Island). If you still don't 
        know where this is, keep following the pier on the Sisters' island and 
        swim out into the ocean until you see the island. The Headmaster spawns 
        in front of a small hut and drops the mask fairly often (2 out of 6 times 
        was my experience). Verant was furthermore merciful - he spawns every 
        5 to 10 minutes. He has approximately 900hp. The shamans that spawn near 
        him go down easily, it might be a good idea to take them out first. (Follow 
        the water's edge around the Goblin island until you see a stone ruin. 
        There is a Goblin hut near that ruin and the Headmaster spawns in front 
        of that hut. -Graff&euml;)</font></p>
