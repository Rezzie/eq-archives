        I just wanted to say Thank You to Glinlor Stormweaver, Wizard of Xegony. 
        I had a really bad incident on Xegony the other night, some of you Xegonite's 
        may have read it on the EQVault boards and Glinlor did something on his

        <p><i>Last night my guild Affliction on Erollisi Marr decided to take 
          a shot at Phinigel in Kedge Keep. After a few failed attempts to pull

          It was an epic battle, but we managed to take them all down. The really

        Over the last few months, I've had a few people e-mail me concerning the 
        Brazier of Elemental Summoning found on the <a href="../equipment/equipment.htm">Equipment</a> 
        page. Many were doubtful that the item existed and many said I should 
        remove it from the site because it is a hoax. This item is not a hoax, 
        it is just somewhat rare (I even camped it briefly with no luck). The 
        other day I received an e-mail from Palora Krimsonfury, a level 50 wizard 
        of Bertoxxulous, with a little pet elemental next to her. It's not a strong 
        pet by any means, but how many wizards do you know with a tag-a-long? 
        Pretty neat!</p>

        In the spirit that Merloc Kole has been keeping, a strong-willed wizard 
        by the name of Blal Stormcaller has decided to start a rune event on Quellios. 
        Here is the info on the event:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sever: Quellios</li>
        <li>Zone: Greater Faydark</li>
        <li>Place: Wizard Spires</li>

        <li>Time: 4:00pm PST</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Show your support and bring your runes. Look for Blal Stormcaster and 
        trade with him. Blal is going to try and have some level 50 Wizards there 
        to create spells for the unfortunate wizards without the research skills.

        Brad commented on people looking at the spdat.eff file and taking all

        the parser progams come up with as the real numbers because there is more 
        that goes on at the server end. Geoffrey Zatkin (GZ) put's a lot of false 
        data in those files (even jokes from time to time) just to throw off all 
        of us. Here's what Brad had to say on alt.games.everquest:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>You know guys, you're just encouraging GZ do this more often. The more 
          you guys parse through his file and jump to conclusions, the more he's 
          gonna play with numbers to get a rise out of you... and most of all 
          to help make his point: </p>
        <p>don't parse files, especially on Test! </p>
        <p>I just called him and told him what a snowball this has turned into 
          in a just a few hours thanks to our friends at eqcasters and he chuckled 
          and said 'wow, faster than I'd thought'. tsk tsk</p>

        <br>
        Xiae Soulmender of Veeshan sent word that there was a very signifigant 
        spawn of Frightfingers within the Plane of Fear. This may be isolated 
        to Veeshan, but if so, let's hope it spreads to all servers and the spawns 
        keep coming. Carmine for everyone! This from Xiae:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>I was fighting in Fear two nights ago w/ Fires of Heaven and there 
          were about 36+ people there from Fires and friends. To cut down on lag, 
          we split up into two groups and each went to different areas to pull. 
          Throughout the night, we basically went for Cazic Thule with a few side 
          pulls. When we were done, there was probably half the zone still up. 
          However, I am happy to report that MY group along fought FIVE frightfingers. 
          I do not know how many, if any, the other group got, but if even one 
          that's an improvement. Also, there were about 12 people across the zone 
          who were pulling different stuff, whom were from Avatars of the Flame. 
          I do not know how many they pulled, if any, but it's possible we're 
          talking a major increase in the number of Frightfingers throughout the 
          zone. </i></p>

        This first was shown on EQDruids a few days ago, then migrated to a couple

        submitting it (all the same picture I might add). This is a hoax. I have 
        no concrete evidence that it is, but two people from Verant have told 
        me in the past that no other class but the enchanter will ever get an 
        item that gives 'clarity' like effects. To just double check my memory, 
        I ran it by another employee of Verant today and the answer was &quot;<i>pretty

        If you haven't been keeping up on the news lately, there is a growing 
        concern on the PVP servers about the usage of AoE's while in group. On 
        the pure PVP (free for all) servers, the majority of our AoE spells will 
        damage anyone in it's wake. GZ commented to this growing concern a few 
        days ago (click <a href="gz/pvpaoe031500.htm">here</a> for that interview). 
        Now with that being said, Tannista Daemonsyre has done a bit of research 
        for me and has found out that on the PVP <u>Teams</u> server, this is 
        not the issue. Example: a Wood Elf, a High Elf, and a Half Elf are grouped 
        together. The High Elf is a wizard and casts an AoE in the middle of the 
        group. None of the group members are damaged by his AoE because they are 
        on the appropriate team. Now if a Gnome joins the group and that same 
        High Elf casts an AoE, everyone in the group is safe <i>except</i> the 
        Gnome. Now the question remains as to if Verant would even think to implement 
        a code to make group members immune on the other Zek servers. It's doubtful, 
        but we'll see.<br>

        Like most weekends, there's not much news happening due to everyone being 
        so busy playing. I am keeping my eye on a particular thread over on the 
        EQ Gameplay Forum that Abashi is supposed to be replying to come Monday. 
        If you want to read it now before he posts his final thoughts, click <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/026506.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
        He has posted to it twice so far, but these are not his final words. I'll 
        make sure his reply hits here as soon as he posts tomorrow.<br>

        Just a reminder to everyone that the expansion spell lists are <b>not</b> 
        finalized yet and the information gained from parsing the spdat.ef file 
        is often incomplete or just plain inaccurate. What we have posted is the 
        best information currently available, but it does not necessarily reflect 
        the real nature of the spells. For this reason, I will no longer be accepting 
        questions about the expansion spells until post-release when I've had 
        a chance to try them out. Keep faith, everyone; Verant's always done a 
        good job with spell balance in the past, I trust that wizards will get 
        fair treatment in what's to come.<br>

      <p><img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Talks with GZ:<br>
        Yesterday, Geoffrey Zatkin took a bit of time out so that I could go over 
        a few things with him concerning our class as wizards. I'm not going to 
        quote him because our chat was very relaxed and not based on facts or 
        numbers, so to speak. I will enlighten you as to a couple key points. 
      <ol>
        <li><b>Our value in a group</b> - Personally, I feel our class could be 
          made more useful in a group. Verant thinks we are fine and no drastic 
          changes are going to happen. I brought up the point that our AoE's are 
          beautiful examples of the wizard's true power but so many groups are 
          afraid to bring more than one mob in to fight. GZ made a valid comment 
          that we as wizards, need to educate our groups much like enchanters 
          have to with mesmerize. End result - start using your AoE's guys and 
          gals. With the expansion coming, we are getting some very nifty high 
          level AoE's.. start learning how to <a href="../editorials/area_effects/aoe_use.htm">use 
          them effectively</a>. GZ's end comment was that we are getting some 
          cool high level expansion stuff, but Verant is not going to be adding 
          or taking away much stuff in the future as to how our class is played.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Rain Spells</b> - What is up with the number of cycles per the 
          number of mobs? If you haven't noticed, with more mobs in the area effect 
          of a rain spell, the less times it 'rains'. GZ said that all rain spells 
          (not just wizards) need to be looked at and they will before Kunark 
          is released.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Closing statement on all of this. I love being a wizard, please don't 
        e-mail me begging me to start a petition or start throwing rocks at Verant. 
        I do think our class is one of the best or I would not continue to play 
        it or run this site. But just like any class, we have our downfalls. Keep 
        in mind that the game is HUGE and it is constantly evolving. If you have 
        comments about the class, <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">e-mail</a> 
        them to Verant or use their <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro" target="_blank">Forums</a>. 
        If you want to be heard, be constructive. Don't cuss, don't whine.. much 
        more will become of it.<br>
