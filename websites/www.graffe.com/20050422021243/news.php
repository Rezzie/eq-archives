<br><ul>*** Headlines ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a character has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled and pressing it will log the character into the game in their starting city.<BR>
- If a character is logged out for more than an hour, full health, mana, and endurance will be granted upon logging in. This is still a bit under development. You may not be quite at 100% but very close.<BR>
- Re-envisioning has begun!<BR>
- Over 600 Spell modifications.<BR>
- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation. Crossing the bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the world. Note that all characters are in the same area now. There are no longer class specific areas.<BR>
- New Hot Spots!*<BR>
The Warrens<BR>
Netherbian Lair<BR>
Echo Caverns<BR>
The Scarlet Desert<BR>
The Tower of Frozen Shadow<BR>
The Hole<BR>
The Grey<BR>
Howling Stones<BR>
The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B)<BR>
<BR>
- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options menu, Open Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then using them will open/close all your general inventory slot bags (bag1-bag8).<BR>
- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.*<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Re-envisioning Specifics ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well. These changes have caused the damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these spells in nearly all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose spells such as undead and summoned direct damage spells. Please check the in game descriptions for specific changes.*<BR>
- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.*<BR>
- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will be adding new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to fear higher level NPCs.*<BR>
- Assassin’s Feint will now work on NPCs level 60 and higher.*<BR>
- Spells with poison counters no longer have innate agro added. The spells themselves still generate aggro based on their other properities, but you will see a reduction in the amount of aggro generated in many cases.*<BR>
- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.*<BR>
- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off through a new filter in the options window.*<BR>
- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell descriptions in game for details.*<BR>
- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been increased.*<BR>
- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack.<BR>
- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from a NPC that has 100 mana.*<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Spells, Skills <BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger AA Auspice of the Hunter.*<BR>
- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.*<BR>
- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.*<BR>
- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is more likely to land on NPCs now.*<BR>
- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm Channeling. Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance.<BR>
- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate shared spell timer.<BR>
- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by Alternate advancement skills and/or focus effects.<BR>
- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often and be resisted much less often.<BR>
- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the Hunter.*<BR>
- Spirit of the Panther and Spirit of the Leopard have been modified. NPCs were able to trigger the effects of these spells at a much higher rate then players. The rate of NPCs triggering these effects has been lowered to match PCs. Additionally, the base damage of the effect has been lowered, and the spell will now only land on PCs and pets that are a part of your group.<BR>
- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect found on the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells up to level 70 the same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0 does.* <BR>
- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the highest effect if more than one focus effect was worn.<BR>
- Dragon Fang and Leopard Claw will now generate less hate.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Items ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due to the spell changes in this patch have either had their proc rate adjusted to compensate or use a new spell to maintain their damage potential.<BR>
- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell focus effect.<BR>
- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods.<BR>
- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items such as the Soul Orb.<BR>
- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc.<BR>
- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon.<BR>
- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon.<BR>
- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod to backstab.<BR>
- Fang of Kessdona now has +12% mod to backstab.<BR>
- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid, +4 spell rune and +4 regen.<BR>
- Aegis of the Amber Moon now has +3 shielding, +4 dot rune, +6 regen.<BR>
- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn effect.<BR>
- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of the Ikaav.<BR>
- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often.<BR>
- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called “Oculus of Yar`Lir”.<BR>
- Bracelet of the Corrupter now has +2 mana regen.<BR>
- Wristband of Spectral Corruption now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.<BR>
- Bracer of Corrupted Souls now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.<BR>
- Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Missions, Quests <BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions<BR>
House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only)<BR>
Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only)<BR>
A Goblin's Escort<BR>
Halfling's Treasure Map<BR>
Signal Fires<BR>
Sudden Tremors<BR>
These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction. <BR>
- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better reflect how long they are taking to complete.<BR>
- Changed the adventure “The Gilded Scroll” to fix some situations that could cause players to be unable to finish the mission. Now the Noble Kirin Scholar will not spawn before the real scroll is found. We also fixed a problem that could, in very rare cases, cause the real scroll not to be placed on an NPC.<BR>
- The corrupted drake adds in the Vishimtar encounter will now respawn correctly after a failure.<BR>
- Made a change to Burning Woods that should reduce the number of NPCs that get stuck under the world . This should make the hornets easier to find.<BR>
- Increased the drop rate for the Collector's Fire Hornet Wing and Collector's Iksar Witch Doll.<BR>
- We've extended the 6th anniversary scavenger hunt so that it will be available through Sunday, the 17th. <BR>
- Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground trials. The major changes are: Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial of Ingenuity was significantly changed, and NPC resists in all single group trials were lowered.<BR>
- Corrected a problem that was causing some NPCs in the Muramite Proving Grounds to show up in the wrong part of the zone.<BR>
- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage Vangl without completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first.<BR>
- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish to bring some extra allies with you. <BR>
- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram encounter will spawn directly on top of you. <BR>
- Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun’muram off Zun’Murum Tkarish Zyk in Txevu. <BR>
- Changed the quest that gives alternative access to Txevu. When you hail the golem at the end of Inktu`ta it will check your items and flags and do the following:<BR>
If you do not yet have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you the Splinter of the High Temple.<BR>
If you do have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.<BR>
If you already have a Txevu flag, the Cipher of Txevu item, or all three fragments of the High Temple, the golem will ignore you.<BR>
Likewise, when you complete the Qvic backflag, if you have the Splinter of the High Temple from completing Inktu`ta you will automatically receive whichever High Temple pieces you are missing.<BR>
This change allows the combination of Inktu`ta and the Qvic backflag quest to count for Txevu access and the two can be completed in any order. This change is not retroactive.<BR>
- A bug was fixed so that Alkron Wyrmsong will no longer give bards a cloth cap when an error is made during the quest for Epic 2.0<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** NPCs ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff 100% of the time.<BR>
- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC would treat the stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is now a check to help with people putting in a stack of items and losing them.<BR>
- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when looted.<BR>
- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which should prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming invisible. Please let us know if you see this happen any more. <BR>
- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer get stuck in the geometry.<BR>
- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that area.<BR>
<BR>
*** Tradeskills ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills. Previously there was a large increase in the average number of combines needed for a skill increase for skill values of 160 through 190. This made sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have changed the algorithm to remove the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups from 160 to 190, making it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For more details please see the post here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade<BR>
- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in tradeskills.<BR>
- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only available through foraging before.<BR>
- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are: Unfired Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired Troll Cookie Cutter and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter.<BR>
- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The sketches and molds should be easily found on vendors.<BR>
- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions.<BR>
- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper Egg. It turns out that there were two items with similar names, but the one used in the recipe doesn't drop in game.<BR>
- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power armor. This recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in any recipes.<BR>
- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level 65+ Vah Shir racial armor pattern book quest.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Server stability ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag that has been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live servers was willing to come over to our test server and verify the raid in pofire was working properly without causing the zone to lag out. They were able to complete many of the stages of the raid successfully and even multiple times without issue. There was one instance of a mob warping after getting in a bad location, but we have made vast improvements from its current state. We have also improved our logging code to better detect similar problems should they occur again in the future. Please let us know if you experience any problems related to this.<BR>
- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world servers has had much progress. Several memory leaks related to the previous update have been corrected, and server stability has improved measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor the servers closely for memory leak issues.<BR>
- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been fixed.<BR>
- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was being charmed or feared has been fixed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Chat filtering ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer broadcast, but go only to the owner of the pet.*<BR>
- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected to any chat window.*<BR>
- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected to any chat window, and be filtered to not show at all.*<BR>
- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will now be displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter as other crits.*<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Mail System ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the current server from any of your characters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Title Suffixes ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new feature are the server titles.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Guild Hall (Guilds) ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall.<BR>
- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items.<BR>
- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove items from the Guild bank.<BR>
- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to server select.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Bazaar/Barter ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar.<BR>
- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any items which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level outside the boundaries set in the new fields will not be returned by the search.<BR>
- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to keeping the client properly synchronized with the server which have been fixed. It now more accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple players are interacting with a buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item, any buy-lines that require the LORE item will now automatically disable because the buyer would not be able to complete the transaction (because it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously this was causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being disconnected.<BR>
- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found in a search will display that item. You now have to right click on the Buyer's name to get the search path.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** UI ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots. <BR>
- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of elements.<BR>
- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click the tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a toggle button.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*** Miscellaneous ***<BR>
------------------------------------<BR>
- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you.<BR>
- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit.<BR>
- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved out of dynamic zones.<BR>
- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to crash.<BR>
- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let us know if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.<BR>

Class Re-envisioning<BR>
Over the course of the last few months, since we announced this project, we have had numerous discussions on the classes. During these discussions we identified some key changes, that are relatively easy for us to implement, that could result in better gameplay for all of you. While this is far from complete (the process and this list) it is the start of this class re-envisionment, reflections, redefinition, whatever we all decide to call it besides balance. Some of these changes you see on this list will make it live for our April 6th update. Others we would like to hear your thoughts and ideas on before continuing. We think that there are some very positive changes here, some of which kind of go against the grain of EQ gameplay. So let the discussion begin; <BR>
<BR>
We'll start with some general gameplay changes that either affect all classes or multiple classes. <BR>
<BR>
General<BR>
<BR>
We are removing the level 55 fear cap and adding advanced spells to the fear lines to make them current. Now, this doesn't mean that all NPCs can be feared, we will be making use of a no-fear flag to stop potential game-play problems. <BR>
<BR>
We will remove the hard coded aggro generated by poison based debuffs which will result in some DoTs and Tash generating less aggro than they currently do as well as more consistent aggro generation.<BR>
<BR>
We are going to spread spell progression out for levels 1 to 50 to reduce the levels gaps between gaining new spells. We would like casters to gain new spells every level and enjoy more even progression. <BR>
<BR>
We are planning to add new abilities and disciplines to non-casters and spread those out between levels 1 to 50, along with their current abilities to make sure non-casters also have progression, in the form of a new ability, every level.<BR>
<BR>
Pet owners will be able to click off any buffs they do not want their pet to have.<BR>
<BR>
We are changing many of the all-or-nothing immune flags so they mitigate the effect instead. We want you to use your abilities on most NPCs, but where we feel the ability might be problematic the ability will have a lesser effect.<BR>
<BR>
You will see the healing messages for Heal Over Time spells. There will also be a filter for this new message.<BR>
<BR>
We will change the potion "Essence of Concealment" from invisibility to improved invisibility and make the components easier for alchemists to find. <BR>
<BR>
All spells will check for immunity before they are cast. So if the target is immune, the spell will not generate aggro for the caster. <BR>
<BR>
We would like ammunition to auto-feed from your inventory directly to the ranged slot.<BR>
<BR>
We are eliminating the +mana cap. <BR>
<BR>
We are removing the inherent resist rate from rain spells.<BR>
<BR>
Solo Play<BR>
<BR>
EverQuest is a group-based game we all know that but we also know that there are times that many of us like to hunt alone. Some of our classes can solo effectively, while others can't. We plan to make changes to classes that struggle with soloing to allow them some solo play. These changes will be made to only affect their abilities while solo and not affect how they perform in groups.<BR>
<BR>
1. We are still discussing the best way to go about this but some of the options we have discussed are listed here;<BR>
<BR>
a. Add healing potions to the game. To prevent this from unbalancing the group game, we need to be careful how these potions work. They may need to be a healing potion that does heal-over-time and does not stack with any other healing spells. Another option is simply having a long reuse on the potion so its effectiveness in a group situation, where the player is generally taking on much more difficult NPCs, is not affected much.<BR>
<BR>
b. We are exploring class abilities that add the pieces needed to solo while also taking away the abilities that make them useful in a group situation. An example of this is a warrior ability that increases their defensive abilities and gives them a damage boost, but causes them to be able to generate nearly no aggro while the ability is in effect, so the warrior would not be able to tank for most groups<BR>
<BR>
Class Specific Changes<BR>
<BR>
Now onto the class changes. We know that this is what most of you are looking for and we think we have a pretty solid plan. Again, as I mentioned above, this is just the beginning folks. Our team is still crunching numbers and other changes are dependent upon that data. We will not be making any changes to melee DPS, tanking and other combat balance issues until that data is completed and we see what effects these changes have on gameplay. We ask that you please discuss these changes on your class board. And please folks, be constructive. If you think the ideas have no merit, say why. We can't work on it with you with bad feedback. OMG This SUXXORS is not going to help.<BR>
<BR>
Bards<BR>
<BR>
We will be increasing your instrument mod cap and using itemization to limit the inherent power gains. This also means that certain songs will have built in maximums to prevent them from scaling indefinitely.<BR>
<BR>
Beastlords<BR>
<BR>
We will add at least one new slow spell for you which has an innate resistance mod built in so that it lands more often. This will help you perform the role of slower in your groups, since you don't have access to the powerful resistance lowering spells of other slowing classes.<BR>
<BR>
We will be boosting your healing so it stays on par with ranger healing when we improve ranger heals.<BR>
<BR>
We want to assure pet classes that we believe you should be able to use their pets in most gameplay situations, including raids. We believe that pet classes do not have many problems with pets on raids at the moment, but want you to understand that we intend for you to use pets on raids and if you find that there is a problem, we will find ways to correct it.<BR>
<BR>
We will be increasing the availability of pet focus items, particularly for the more casual players.<BR>
<BR>
We will be looking into the casting time of some of your pet healing spells and reducing the casting time where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
Berserkers<BR>
<BR>
Many Berserker complaints are about their damage output and this isn’t something we can really address without the results of the number crunching. Our thoughts are that you are fine at lower levels and pretty decent at high levels with your AAs, but you may need some help at the mid levels. Should our numbers support our thoughts, we will be adjusting things so your damage progression is smoother across the levels.<BR>
<BR>
We are looking into the endurance cost of many of your abilities and lowering them as necessary. <BR>
<BR>
We are looking into adding throwing quivers that grant innate haste similar to normal quivers.<BR>
<BR>
Clerics<BR>
<BR>
With Dragons of Norrath you gained two new spells that you seem to enjoy; Mark of Vengeance and Mark of Retribution. We will be changing these spells into full spell lines that you get early on and that scale up as you level.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We want to make your Turn Undead spells effective at all levels. Some of the suggested changes include:<BR>
<BR>
a. Changing the fear part of the spell so the rest of the spell still works even if the fear fails or removing the fear portion of the spell entirely.<BR>
<BR>
b. Adding a strong snare effect.<BR>
<BR>
Druids<BR>
<BR>
Druids are a unique challenge in that the class is divided evenly between you offensive druids who enjoy doing damage, and you defensive druids who prefer to play the role of healer. We want to support both play styles, but if we were to increase both halves of the druid equally the class would quickly become overpowered. Our plan is to introduce a new option where a druid can enter into a particular “mode” or “stance” where they become better at one part at the expense of the other. Our preferred solution for this is to add an innate ability for druids. The ability would get its own button similar to abilities such as backstab or track. You will be able to be in one of three states and can switch between them once every 5 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
a. Normal – Their healing and offensive abilities are in balance. This is the state they exist in today.<BR>
<BR>
b. Offensive – Their offensive power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their healing spells.<BR>
<BR>
c. Defensive – Their healing power is boosted by 25%, but they suffer a 50% reduction in the power of their offensive spells.<BR>
<BR>
Another of our goals is to broaden the core grouping roles to allow all classes to more easily put together groups. Similar to how any of the 3 main tanks should be able to perform that role in a group, we want any of the 3 healers to be able to perform the role of a main healer in a group. The changes mentioned above for druids will allow you to fill a healing role and perform at about 80% of the effectiveness of a cleric.<BR>
<BR>
Enchanters<BR>
<BR>
We will add higher level upgrades to the Word of Morell spell line.<BR>
<BR>
We plan to change the way mana drain works. In the past the spell had diminishing effects on NPCs above level 53. We will be removing that limitation so you can use Theft of Thought on higher level caster NPCs and we can introduce more powerful spells in that line, in the future. However, we will also be changing drains so that they only return the mana the NPC has instead of always returning the full amount. If an NPC only has 100 mana and your spell does a 400 drain, you will only get 100 mana. This is a necessary change as most NPCs, including non-casters, are given small amounts of mana in order to power some innates.<BR>
<BR>
We all know that the power of NPCs has climbed and the difficulty in charming NPCs has retreated. This has led to an imbalance where you were able to charm NPCs that do far more damage than ever intended and with minimal risk. This lead us to the unfortunate decision to make many NPC's uncharmable. With OOW, we introduced a change to charm that allowed us to make most NPCs charmable again, but reduce their effectiveness and remove the gameplay imbalance. We did this by reducing their stats while charmed. This presented some new problems though, the largest of which is you like to haste and buff your pets to get the most out of them and when the charm breaks, you face a much more powerful NPC. We have a plan to ensure charm’s usefulness and want to gather your opinion before putting it into motion.<BR>
<BR>
a. We want charm to be an integral part of your gameplay. You should be able to grab a charmed pet in most circumstances and use that to benefit your group.<BR>
<BR>
b. We will be looking at the stats NPCs use when charmed to ensure they are within the intended range.<BR>
<BR>
c. We would like to add innate buff effects to enchanter charm spells. While an NPC is under the effects of the charm, they will also be under the effect of spells similar to what you would use to buff your pet. When charm breaks those effects will go away so you are only dealing with the NPC in its base state.<BR>
<BR>
d. The change mentioned above would cause further imbalance in zones where NPCs don’t currently lower their stats when charmed, the changes that were made in Omens will need to be made across the rest of the game and this will be the way new charm works in all of Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
e. After charm changes for all zones, we can go back and open up the use of charm in areas where it was previously excluded due to balance problems making charm much more usable throughout the game world.<BR>
<BR>
Mages<BR>
<BR>
We will be converting most, if not all, of your summons to place the items directly into the hands of the target. Of course, we will also need a new toggle that lets players turn off this ability from anyone not in their group, anyone not in their raid, or anyone at all.<BR>
<BR>
We will be adding new pet pack spells that contain the more used summoned pet item to help relieve the tedium of summoning many different items.<BR>
<BR>
We will be fixing Turn Summoned in a way similar to how we fix Turn Undead for clerics. See the cleric section for more details.<BR>
<BR>
We want to assure pet classes that we believe you should be able to use their pets in most gameplay situations, including raids. We believe that pet classes do not have many problems with pets on raids at the moment, but want you to understand that we intend for you to use pets on raids and if you find that there is a problem, we will find ways to correct it.<BR>
<BR>
We will be increasing the availability of pet focus items, particularly for the more casual players.<BR>
<BR>
We will be looking into the casting time of some of your pet heals and reducing the casting time where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
Monks<BR>
<BR>
We will be reversing the AC mitigation reduction that you received during the Planes of Power era.<BR>
<BR>
Necromancers<BR>
<BR>
We will add new spells in the Screaming Terror line to give you some more combat utility.<BR>
<BR>
We want to assure pet classes that we believe you should be able to use their pets in most gameplay situations, including raids. We believe that pet classes do not have many problems with pets on raids at the moment, but want you to understand that we intend for you to use pets on raids and if you find that there is a problem, we will find ways to correct it.<BR>
<BR>
We will be increasing the availability of pet focus items, particularly for the more casual players.<BR>
<BR>
We will be looking into the casting time of some of your pet heal spells and reducing the casting times where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
Paladins<BR>
<BR>
We want you to be a main tank in group situations. We believe that you are currently able to fill this role, but want to assure you that our intent is for a group to be able to grab a warrior, paladin, or shadowknight as their main tank and be effective with any of them.<BR>
<BR>
With DoN, you gained a limited form of defensive. We are monitoring your feedback and if you like this direction; we plan to make it a full spell line that begins at the level warriors get the defensive discipline.<BR>
<BR>
Rangers<BR>
<BR>
Rangers are good at many things and when all the parts add up properly, they’re a class that is in heavy demand. Our feeling is that the parts are not adding up properly in the current game. We are still digesting all of the DPS numbers and stats but in the meantime we identified a couple of things we can increase in the short term.<BR>
<BR>
a. We will be improving the damage you do through spells.<BR>
<BR>
b. We will be boosting your healing ability, particularly at the top end of the game.<BR>
<BR>
Rogues<BR>
<BR>
We will fix the problems with Assassin’s Feint so it works correctly and then gauge your reaction to the working ability. If it turns out to be something that you like, we will look into adding more combat utility through a similar means.<BR>
<BR>
We are looking into adding throwing quivers that grant innate haste similar to how normal quivers work<BR>
<BR>
Shadowknights<BR>
<BR>
We also want Shadowknights to be a main tank in group situations. We believe that you are currently able to fill this role, but want to assure you that our intent is for a group to be able to grab a warrior, paladin, or shadowknight as their main tank and be effective with any of them.<BR>
<BR>
With DoN, you also gained a limited form of defensive. We are monitoring your feedback and if you like this direction; we plan to make it a full spell line that begins at the level warriors get the defensive discipline.<BR>
<BR>
Shaman<BR>
<BR>
In DoN you received the spells Spirit of the Leopard and Spirit of the Panther. You seem to like these new spells and they have added more desirability for you in groups. We will be extending these into full spell lines so that Shaman of other level ranges can see the benefits from these spells.<BR>
<BR>
As with Druids, we are looking to increase your healing ability so you can function better as main healer in groups. You folks are a little problematic though, since your healing ability is the function of not just your heals, but your ability to reduce an NPCs damage output through slows. In a situation where an NPC is fully slowable, you are a superb healer but against an NPC who cannot be slowed, your healing falls behind. If we were to just improve your heals, you would quickly outshine any other healer when facing NPCs that can be slowed. So, we are investigating ways to improve your healing ability only in circumstances where an NPC cannot be slowed or you choose not to slow the NPC (for your own strange reasons). These changes will be rolled out at the same time as any druid healing changes to ensure that one class does not eclipse the other. <BR>
<BR>
Warriors<BR>
<BR>
Many of the ideas for changes to the warrior class are dependant upon the results of the data we are still compiling. However, we are looking into improving your ability to solo in the mid and high level game as well as;<BR>
<BR>
We are looking into the endurance cost of many of your disciplines and lowering them as necessary. <BR>
<BR>
We will increase the knockback on Press the Attack slightly.<BR>
<BR>
Wizards<BR>
<BR>
With DoN, you received more mana efficient nukes that are aimed at improving your sustained DPS. We will be extending this into a line of spells to help out with sustained DPS at different level ranges.<BR>
<BR>
We will fix Manaburn. Our preferred method is to uncap the ability and implement a cap based on the maximum percentage of health you can do in a single hit. So one of you, facing a million hit point boss mob (fairly common in today’s game) can expect a full manaburn to land for 10s of thousands of points of damage in one hit.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once again I would like to remind you that this is the beginning of the changes and there is still more to come. We encourage you to openly discuss these changes and let us know what you think. We want this to be a cooperative exchange and we will chime in on your discussions when appropriate. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks all.<BR>

<BR>
*** Bazaar <BR>
---------------------------------<BR>
We have made the Bazaar zone free for everyone.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to this, we have consolidated the Barter zone and the Bazaar zone into one hybrid zone, which uses the existing Bazaar zone. You will now be able to activate both the /buyer commands and the /trader commands in the Bazaar zone. In addition to this change, we have made a few other changes for your convenience.<BR>
<BR>
- Removed the zone line from the Bazaar to the Barter zone.<BR>

<BR>
The Barter zone is still active, so those of you who are camped out in the zone will be able to log in just fine, though you will want to migrate to the Bazaar in order to set up your buyer. Please make sure that you are not weighed down with coin and items before leaving the zone, or you may find yourself unable to move.<BR>

- We've changed the way that corpse lock works when an NPC is killed by someone in a shared task. You should no longer see corpses locked to a shared task when you are killing NPCs not related to a shared task. <BR>
<BR>

- The map window will properly tint the map area again on the map tab.<BR>
- We've made significant changes to the fog and rain settings in all original EverQuest zones. Visibility should be greatly improved in many of these zones and rain will generally be more infrequent. Seasonal changes from rain to snow have also been incorporated into these zones as appropriate. In addition, we’ve increased the visibility in all zones when it is raining or snowing.<BR>
- Added a new command, /tasktimers, which will display a list of shared tasks and how long you must wait before you can undertake that shared task again.

<BR>
Those Zek players who have already executed the /movelog command will be moved to the server they chose, unless that server was Solusek Ro or Kane Bayle. Zek players who chose either of these servers will need to execute the command again, choosing a new server. <BR>
<BR>
If you have changed your mind as to which server you would like to move to, the /movelog UI (after Thursdays update) will have a disregard button. Using the disregard button will cancel any pending movelog requests and allow you to execute a new movelog request.<BR>
<BR>
We will begin processing the movelog requests on Friday night (March 4th) and will continue nightly for a period of 30 days. Any accounts that have executed the movelog request will need to make certain they have no corpses in the world. If you have a shared bank already in use on your destination server, you will need to empty either shared bank out as only one will be available after the movelog is complete.<BR>
