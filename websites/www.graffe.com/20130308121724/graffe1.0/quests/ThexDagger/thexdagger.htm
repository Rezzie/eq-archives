      <p><font size="2" color="#999999">This is the correct way to get the Thex 
        Dagger. First hail Tearon IN the front of Highpass Keep and tell him you 
        want to be a hero,"I want to be a hero". Run up the stairs to the top 
        floor of the keep and as you turn the corner from the stairs, you will 
        see a picture with two torches on either side. This is a fake wall. Walk 
        through and follow the right wall until you find Princess Lenya. Once 
        you find her, give her the bracer that Tearon gave you when you said,"I 
        want to be a hero". She will hand this bracer back to you and vanish, 
        making her pet suicide. She will immediately reappear in less then 5 seconds. 
        Run down stairs and get ready to hand the second bracer (handed back to 
        you by Princess Lenya) to Tearon. Group with a near level player as you 
        and have that grouped member tell Tearon that,"I want to be a hero." Tell 
        him how to get to princess Lenya and tell him to wait for your command 
        to give her the bracer from Tearon. Okay, now you should both be in place 
        and have your trade windows open with The Princess and Tearon. On your 
        command tell you friend to hit give. If you are near the same level you 
        should see,"You gained party experience!!!" As soon as you see that hit 
        the give button to Tearon and then princess Lenya should appear right 
        next to you down stairs. Also, you will notice in your inventory that 
        Tearon has given you an amulet to return to her. Conveniently, she is 
        right there. When you hand her the amulet she thanks you and gives you 
        a letter to give to her father or Tolon Nurbyte within the Inn in Felwithe. 
        Now teleport to Felwithe and find the Inn. Ask the Inn Keeper," Where 
        is Tolon Nurbyte?". He will respond, &quot;You two are up to no good I 
        can feel it&quot;. Then he will tell you he is on the second floor last 
        door on the right. When you hand Tolon Nurbyte the letter, he tells you 
        the Princess wanted you to have this and gives you the Thex dagger in 
        your inventory. </font></p>
