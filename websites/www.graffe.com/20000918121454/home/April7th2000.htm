      <blockquote> 
        <p> Player: Gordon, could you state your 'view' on the MR of high creatures 
          ( those 49+ ? ) or could we possibly setup some type of poll to see 
          how many enchanters feel they are an effective part of the party when 
          dealing with planes/giants/dragons and what their feelings on MR are? 
        </p>
        <p> Abashi:<b> Certain special encounters (dragons, gods) have high resistances 
          (to the point of being immune) to all but one type of magic. Normal 
          monsters typically don't have the incredibly high resists across the 
          board. </b></p>
        <p><b>We realize that this sometimes limits the damage-dealing potential 
          of some classes, however those classes typically have either other ways 
          of dealing damage (e.g. pets) or have other uses besides dealing damage 
          (e.g. buffs). </b></p>

        Test Server:<br>
        A new level 39 spell called Concussion was implemented on the Test Server. 
        Using hardly any mana (25), it seems to be a quick cast (2 second) spell 
        for interrupting caster mobs. It also does not have recast time delay 
        such as the level 20 Tishan's Clash.<font size="1"><br>
        Note: this spell is <u>not</u> on the live servers and may change before 
        it is fully implemented.<br>

      <p>Keep in mind that Blal is on a time schedule and is from across the drink 
        (U.K.) so he needs his rest. If you need a rune, they are FREE. So help 
        Blal out and donate runes that you do not need. Some have asked if he 
        is giving free equipment (this makes me sick.. earn your items!). Blal 
        cannot afford to give away items. If you have some items you wish to give

        <p>Nightmares Asylum (NA) will sponsor their first BASH THE TWINK Event 
          in <b>The Arena</b> in Lake Rathe. Date: <b>April 15</b>, 2000 Time: 
          <b>10 AM Pacific</b> time (1 PM Eastern, 7 PM European)<br>
          NA will create a Level 1 Ogre Warrior and equip it with the finest armor 
          and weapons and the very best buffs available to the Norrathian masters 
          of their arts. All "newbies" of Levels 1-5 are invited to appear at 
          Wizard or Druid teleport locations and obtain a ride and escort to the 
          Arena for this event. All "newbies" gathered in the Arena will commence 
          the battle with the Twink at the same time. The "newbie" who slays the 
          Twink will receive an item with immense magical properties depending 
          on his class. Fallen "newbies" will be ressurected at which time they 
          can resume the battle. We will have several of these battles until our 
          Prizes are exhausted or our brains are riddled with boredom.<br>
          Miscellaneous Rules:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> All "newbies" will be stripped of all buffs prior to the battle. 
            They can re-apply their own buffs afterwards if they wish. </li>
          <li> Any newbie caught receiving buffs from anyone other than themselves 
            will be removed from the competition. </li>
          <li> Nobody can heal the Twink. Anyone caught healing the Twink will 
            be removed from the competition. </li>
          <li> Newbies can use any skill, spell or ability they wish to enhance 
            their chances at slaying the Twink. </li>

        Unfolds:<br>
        Madcat Warwiz of Prexus, Nebucadnezzar of Bertoxxulous, and Ebin Ashelin 
        of Bertoxxulous all sent in screenpics and word of a GM ran event that 
        is continuing to teach us players of the history of Norrath. Here is what 
        Madcat said concerning the event:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>It started in Everfrost. These four people in Shining Metallic Robes 
          showed up asking to be taken to Permafrost. We were there killing Ice 
          Giants so we met them and took them into Permafrost. At the first ladder 
          into Perma, they met a dwarf who had a chrystalline shard. Supposedly 
          this dwarf stole the shard from the dragon, Lady Vox and was employed 
          by Mayong Mistmoore. The four GM's killed the dwarf after a long conversation 
          with him. Apparently this upset Vox and Mayong. Vox never did appear 
          though she was just heard screaming in the background. From there it 
          moved to Rathe Mountains by the Sphinx. Using the shard, three of the 
          GM's were turned into dragons. Just as quick as the dragons appeared 
          Mayong appeared and I know he killed one of them not sure what happened 
          to the other two. Of course the crowd went ballistic on Mayong but he 
          was dropping people all over the place and he only got to about 3/4 
          health then disappeared. He dropped my level 48 warrior friend with 
          one spell. OUCH! After all that the remaining GM's gave an ogre warrior 
          the shard which turns out is a nail from Veeshan. Pretty nice 1hs 16dam 
          24dly effect incapacitate sword. The four GM's were from the Ring of 
          Scale and vowed to get Mayong. Also by killing the ogre warrior who 
          got the sword and rebirthing him somehow the curtains hiding the plane 
          of air were lifted or that is what they said anyways.</p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p>Greetings of the Vault, <br>
          Four brand new Ruins of Kunark screenshots have been posted on the EQVault 
          (<a href="http://www.eqvault.com">www.eqvault.com</a>). These new shots 
          are in high resolution at 1024x768. <br>
          Also of note, EQVault just launched their brand new design (Hmm, what 
          interesting timing..new design and new shots on the same day ;)) with 
          a ton of new features, strategy, articles and more content. </p>
        <p>Thanks for your time, <br>
          Aurum </p>

        Still no link to me from EQVault, but I won't hold it against you Aurum.

        Sent in by Synge Darkmynd of Lanys T'vyl, this is a picture of a new wizard 
        hybrid class. Well, not really. Just a GM having some fun with their powers. 
        Granted, perhaps at that level we should be known as this.<br>

        With the pop up message I had yesterday for April Fools, wrongly stating 
        that I was shutting the site down, the joke was really on me. My e-mail 
        was overflowing with words of sorrow that just made me feel like a jerk 
        for doing what I did, the quest and map pages got a workout in the bandwidth 
        area from people scrambling to download and print (a record high for those 
        pages - a full gigabyte combined yesterday). Anyway, I'm glad I'm not 
        leaving. I have such a wonderful group of viewers, you. Whoever says wizards 
        are whiners can bite me. You guys and gals are the greatest.<br>
        <font size="1">Thanks everyone!<br>

        Boy.. I really tried to hold out until tomorrow without saying anything, 
        but all of your great e-mails were just tearing me apart. I am amazed 
        at the outpour of everyone's feelings in thier e-mails. <b>The site isn't 
        going anywhere</b>, I'm still here for all of you. I'll leave the pop-up 
        message up for the remainder of the day just to get a few stragglers. 
        But at least they can read the truth here. It was just an <b>April Fools</b> 
        joke. Take care everyone, you are all the best!<br>
