      <p align="left">One thing that has always shocked and saddened me about 
        the ongoing wizard class balance debate is the high number of posts in 
        the message boards complaining that wizards don't get pets. I can only 
        assume that these posts are written by failed lowbie wizards who have 
        neglected to undertake the research necessary to master the full power 
        of their class. </p>
      <p align="left">Each of the many prosperous wizards I have met in EQ has 
        been well aware that the wizard class indeed has pets, that wizard pets 
        are in many ways far more potent weapons than any other pets in the game, 
        and wield those pets to merciless advantage in the dungeons and wildernesses 
        of Norrath. In order to balance this excess of power, Verant has wisely 
        attached a number of difficulties to the use of wizard pets -- They are 
        more difficult and expensive to summon, more difficult to control, and 
        they take a much bigger portion of party experience than any other pet 
        type. Further, the control interface is atrociously bugged, with some 
        commands completely broken, and others giving unpredictable (sometimes 
        catastrophic) results. </p>
      <p align="left">The worst difficulty with wizard pets, and the reason why 
        I'm writing this, is that they are very much an undocumented feature. 
        You can't simply pad into your guildhall and find all the secrets of summoning 
        neatly packaged on a scroll and proffered for sale at the cost of a few 
        gold coins. You have to find it all out for yourself. Indeed, as the many 
        misinformed posts in the forums show, even the very existance of wizard 
        pets is something you are expected to deduce on your own while adventuring. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">On principle, I cannot approve of "spoilers." Neither, I 
        presume, can the community of veteran wizards who have earned their pets 
        the hard way, hence the veil of secrecy about the matter. On the other 
        hand, dissatisfaction among the uninformed has risen to such a pitch that 
        I feel the time is come to publish a brief primer and guide on the subject. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>***SPOILER FOLLOWS*** </b></p>
      <p align="left">PART 1 -- How to Summon Your Pet There is no need to obtain 
        or scribe a spell scroll for this. All wizards are able to cast the summoning 
        as an intrinsic class ability. To do this, first enter the zone in which 
        you intend to hunt, then enter the following command: </p>
      <p align="left">/shout Group seeks lvl [your level] tank </p>
      <p align="left">Expect many fizzles. In fact, this spell fizzles so often 
        that the fizzle message has been disabled to spare you the spam, so on 
        failure you just get stony silence. On the bright side, it costs you niether 
        mana nor items to cast (...initially, that is. You'll pay through the 
        nose in terms of mana and items as your pet goes into action.) Don't be 
        discouraged. Keep casting and soon your tank will appear. </p>
      <p align="left">PART 2 -- What is a "Tank?" <br>
        Just as enchanters get animations and magicians get elementals, wizards 
        get "tanks." While I would have thought, before reading all this "Give 
        us pets!" nonsense, that the sight of a wizard plunging nose-first into 
        peril with his faithful tank in tow was one of the more common sights 
        in Norrath, it is, I suppose, understandable that one could overlook them. 
        Let us take stock of the tank, then, and compare it to the other caster 
        pets. </p>
      <p align="left">Tanks are most like mage pets in both apperance and behavior, 
        though they are substantially inferior in combat power. They can be easily 
        distinguished from each other in that tanks have heads, although this 
        is purely there for decoration. Like mage pets, tanks may be given weapons 
        to use, but should not be given anything that you expect to get back. 
        Fortunately, unlike mage pets, tanks generally come equipped with weapons 
        on summoning, hence the prudent wizard doesn't give them Jack Diddly. 
        Finally, just like mage pets, most tanks have some kind of minor magical 
        attack, along with an unrestrainable tendancy to use it exactly when you 
        don't want them to. </p>
      <p align="left">PART 3 -- Getting a Good Tank <br>
        In contrast to the common practice of other pet-wielding classes, the 
        high failure rate of the summoning means that wizards cannot expect to 
        summon and destroy thier tanks until they get an "even pet." The "/tank 
        get lost" command is bugged anyway, leading to unpredictable results. 
        If you simply must destroy your tank, it is far more efficient to send 
        it out on a pull, invis everyone in the party while it is gone, then hit 
        the "disband" key as soon as it makes contact. It should return to a point 
        near the camp and, if invis holds, it will mill around a little until 
        it finally succumbs to the pulled MOB's. At this point you may attempt 
        to cast a summoning for another tank. (N.B. It is widely rumored among 
        higher level wizards that repeated use of this method results in a higher 
        fizzle rate for the summoning.) </p>
      <p align="left">PART 4 -- Fighting with a Tank in the Party <br>
        Tanks, like enchanter pets, are largely automated, with one important 
        difference: Tanks are highly active and aggro on almost everything. This 
        has its good and bad aspects. On the one hand, tanks can be set to auto-pull 
        MOB's and dice them up at camp, netting you exp while you med, eat, watch 
        TV, fondle the girlfriend, etc.; on the other hand, they have a variety 
        of obnoxious personal habits, such as binge drinking, sexually harassing 
        the party's druid, and pulling trios of fire giants while you're at 10% 
        mana. You have to take the good with the bad -- just remember to always 
        have gate memmed. </p>
      <p align="left">The typical "tank pull" goes something like this: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> The tank is buffed and told to pull. </li>
        <li>The tank signals readiness to pull by chugging ale until he weaves 
          and commenting on the druid's breasts. </li>
        <li>The tank departs and the druid bitterly starts listening to Ani DiFranco 
          tunes while she meds. </li>
        <li>The tank returns suddenly with about four dangerous and upset MOB's 
          on his tail. </li>
        <li>The tank says "Incoming!" </li>
        <li>With the exception of the druid, who is still jamming with Ani, the 
          group leaps into coordinated action, focusing their attacks on the group's 
          bard. </li>
        <li>The bard's instrument is vigorously lodged in his rectum so that the 
          party can target the enemy. </li>
        <li>Acquiring your target by assisting the puller, you light off your 
          most potent nuke. </li>
        <li>Your target rushes you, and you summon the tank to your aid saying 
          "ON ME!" </li>
        <li>The cleric pulls the remaining 3 MOB's off the tank by healing him. 
        </li>
        <li>The enchanter highlights the MOB attacking you by casting mesmerize 
          on it. </li>
        <li>The tank, guided by the blue flash, rushes to attack the mezzed MOB. 
        </li>
        <li>With mez broken, the MOB continues to pound you while the tank attempts 
          to taunt it off you. </li>
        <li>Taunt succeeds a few seconds after you die. </li>
        <li>The cleric, forgotten in all the excitement, is killed by the other 
          3 MOB's. </li>
        <li>With the cleric dead, the tank panics and trains his MOB to zone; 
          meanwhile, the 3 other MOB's pounce on the medding/grooving druid. </li>
        <li>The druid prepares to evac while the enchanter prepares to mesmerize 
          the MOBs off her. </li>
        <li>The bard extracts his instrument from his nethers and strikes up a 
          tune, taunting all the MOBs off the druid. </li>
        <li>The enchanter mesmerizes the bard. </li>
        <li>The bard dies and the druid evacs to safety with the enchanter. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Of course, it doesn't always go this well, but this is the general idea.
