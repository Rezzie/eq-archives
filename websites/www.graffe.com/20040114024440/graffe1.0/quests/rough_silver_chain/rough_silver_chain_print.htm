<p align="center">This quest starts by speaking to two gnomish pirates <i>(text 
  log, pics, names, location needed)</i> in Icelad Ocean, one of them named 'Nilham 
  the Chef'. Upon speaking to them, they will tell you that they lost a case of 
  rum and also the key to the case. They will tell you that if these items are 
  found, they should be taken to the Captain.</p>

<p align="left">If you speak to the Nilham the Chef, he will tell you what happened 
  -</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You say, 'What cat?' </p>
  <p>Nilham the Chef says 'That was a nasty cat. I dun think it was after us, 
    though. I think it just smelled the fresh chunk of wooly rhino jerky I had. 
    It didn't do anythin' but knock us over. I guess that's what it likes, walrus. 
    After it knocked us over it slipped away towards the bridge island like a 
    ghostly mist. I'm thinkin I saw a glimmer in its maw while it was runnin off.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get two Coldwater Barracuda livers from coldwater barracudas in the bay in 
  Cobalt Scars. I found the barracuda in the east center and the north center 
  parts. The liver dropped about 1 in 10. </p>
<p>Turn the livers into a named otter, Qarrgy Scallopgobble <i>(text log, picture, 
  loc needed)</i>, who is in the shell house closest to the tower. Get bladder 
  of acidic ooze. </p>
<p>Go to Wakening Lands. Forage sap <i>(picture needed)</i>. Random forage chance. 
  This will have to be done by a druid and multi-quested with you due to the sap 
  is a no drop item.</p>
<p>Go to Thurgadin. Give sap and ooze to Pythic Urson. He is in the bar in the 
  back area next to the mines. Get bottle of Dissolving Liquid <i>(picture needed)</i> 
  in return. </p>
<p>Go to Great Divide. Give the bottle of dissolving liquid to the Gnomish Deserter 
  <i>(text log, picture, loc needed)</i>, who is at the very top of the mountain 
  in the middle (the one that has the wurm tunnels). Get the Locked Rum Box. </p>
<p>Go to Eastern Wastes. Kill wooly rhinos until you get four &quot;fresh&quot; 
  chunks of rhino meat<i> (picture needed)</i>, the regular wooly rhino meat will 
  not do. I found the fresh meat to be a very rare drop, about 1 in 25 or 30. 
  You are most likely to find rhinos in the SE, NE, and North parts of EW. They 
  spawn pretty readily up by Warden Burke's hole and the ulthorks (they're part 
  of the general spawn table there...don't forget to kill the bunnies).</p>
<p>While in Eastern Wastes, go ahead and kill Dire Wolves, too. You need 1 High 
  Quality Dire Wolf Pelt <i>(stat pic needed)</i>. I got one after 15 kills. </p>
<p>Go to Wakening Lands. On the south shore of the lake in the center is a level 
  60 mist panther <i>(text log, picture, loc needed)</i>. Give the 4 chunks of 
  fresh rhino meat to the panther and you'll get a broken golden key<i> (picture 
  needed)</i> in return. Note: supposedly this panther is KOS to some.. charming 
  a level 60 panther could spell disaster so visit the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm13">forum</a> 
  or check back often for details.</p>
<p>Go to the gnoll village by the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad Ocean. Give 
  the snowfang gnoll named 'Errgriz' <i>(text log, loc , picture needed)</i> in 
  one of the tents the High Quality Dire Wolf Pelt. You'll get earmuffs/head covering<i> 
  (picture needed)</i> in return. </p>
<p>Go to Sojan the Sleepless <i>(text log, loc, picture needed)</i> in the Southernmost 
  igloo in the gnome pirate village in Iceclad. Give him the earmuffs, get fine 
  metal chain <i>(picture needed)</i> in return. Give Sojan the fine metal chain 
  and the broken golden key, get rum box key <i>(picture needed)</i> back. </p>
<p>Go to the Captain<i> (text log, loc, picture needed)</i> in the igloo to the 
  North. Give him the rum box and key, get a bottle of Captain Nalot's Triple 
  Strength Rum <i>(picture needed)</i> back. </p>
<p>Go to the docks on the same island. Give the rum to Nelet Durzit<i> (text log, 
  loc, picture needed) </i>who is on the docks there. Get the Rough Silver Chain 
  in return.</p>
