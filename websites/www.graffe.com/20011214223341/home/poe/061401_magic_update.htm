        <p>Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to 
          sit down and write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple 
          quick notes. </p>
        <p>The &quot;problem&quot; with rain spell pulses always being resisted 
          if they will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an 
          intentional design feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse 
          poof buf. If the Rain killed the NPC and the server was unsure where 
          the damage came from the corpse would poof, so these spells were coded 
          in this manner to prevent that from happening. I'm working with the 
          coders to come up with a better solution. We're all pretty busy right 
          now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when a better 
          solution will be implemented.</p>
        <p>Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You 
          won't have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply 
          to both Wizards and Druids evac spells. </p>
        <p>Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make 
          sense for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) 
          and not have the self version work indoors. </p>
        <p>Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test 
          server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells 
          on test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose 
          slam, sorry for the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way 
          to give SKs skeleton form.</p>
        <p>Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're 
          working on some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. 
          More stacking issues should be resolved in the coming months. High level 
          players should be pleased to know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call 
          of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will no longer conflict after the 
          next patch. </p>
        <p>New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells 
          up on test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you 
          can expect that cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again. 
        </p>
        <p>Now on to the &quot;Burning issue&quot;. I know the Wizard community 
          has been *patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on 
          The coding for the new spell effect has been finished and it is going 
          through extensive internal testing. It has also been on Test Server 
          for a week, but I doubt you would have seen it in a parser &#150; cause 
          I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on the new spells there's 
          a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that wizards are balanced 
          fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be receiving 
          an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help 
          is group utility. </p>
        <p>As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility 
          type spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless 
          hours pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums 
          and emails looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution 
          was found! I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy 
          about the new enhancement but this is an idea I've seen tossed around 
          on a number of forums and I think not only does it fit in well with 
          wizards being the masters of arcane transportation, I think it will 
          make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels where they seem to be 
          struggling for usefulness. </p>
        <p>The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. 
          There will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will 
          each have a different resistance type. One of the problems with duration 
          based effects is stacking and negating the need for multiple characters 
          of the same class. I am designing these spells with that in mind. If 
          you want to 100% ensure an NPC does not gate you will need more than 
          one wizard. I understand this may upset some people but the need for 
          multiple wizards to &quot;Anchor&quot; an NPC won't really happen until 
          you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers. For single 
          group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most situations, 
          be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells implemented 
          and ready to go before the next patch. </p>
        <p>Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who 
          have reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over 
          the past couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>
        <p>Take care all!<br>
