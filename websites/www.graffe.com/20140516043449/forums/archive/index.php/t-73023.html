<br />
<br />
Professional fighting games are on the verge of breaking into the big time as a spectator sport, with over 2 million people tuning in to live streams of last August's EVO fighting game championship and millions more watching streamed fighting matches on TwitchTV every month. But a recent controversy over the overtly sexist treatment of a female competitor has some wondering if the fighting game community is really ready for prime time.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has seen a fighting game tournament knows the community is well known for a casual, trash-talk, and bravado-filled atmosphere, where players actively try to psyche each other out for an advantage. But that's probably not enough to explain the way competitor Aris Bakhtanians treated teammate Miranda &quot;SuperYan&quot; Pakozdi during the Cross Assault event, a Capcom-sponsored, reality show-style competition pitting two teams against each other in Street Fighter x Tekken matches for a $25,000 prize.<br />
<br />
Live-streamed footage from the first day of the tournament shows Bakhtanians, leader of the Tekken team, making sexual comments towards Pakozdi that range from crude to potentially abusive. Spurred on by commenters interacting via a live chatroom, Bakhtanians proceeds to guess at Pakozdi's bra size, suggest she take part in a mud wrestling match, expresses a desire to spy on her in the women's bathroom, suggests she wear a skirt he would buy for her, and threatens to smell her if she makes a mistake.<br />

<br />
Pakozdi, for her part, is seen in the video laughing nervously at the comments, though she does say at one point &quot;this is creepy.&quot; She later commented on her Twitter account that Bakhtanians' actions were &quot;not funny at all&quot; and that he had &quot;made my life incredibly hard and hasn't helped me [deal with hecklers] at all. He made it way worse.&quot; Pakozdi also suggests via Twitter that when she confronted Bakhtanians about his behavior, it was &quot;pretty obvious he just doesn't give a shit.' (Pakozdi has publicly rejected interview requests)<br />
<br />
Bakhtanians defended his behavior in an impromptu discussion with TwitchTV community manager Jared Rea on the fifth day of the tournament (the discussion starts around 1:45:00 in this video archive). &quot;Those are jokes and if you were really a member of the fighting game community, you would know that,&quot; he says of his behavior. &quot;This is a community that's, you know, 15 or 20 years old, and the sexual harassment is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community&#8212;it's StarCraft,&quot; he continued.<br />
<br />
Bakhtanians was more circumspect in a prepared statement provided to Ars Technica after his behavior started drawing more attention around the Internet. &quot;I understand that I said some controversial statements on the Cross Assault show, and a lot of people are deeply offended with what was said,&quot; he said in the statement. &quot;I unfortunately used extreme examples in the heat of the moment and feel that my statements don't actually communicate how I feel. This is similar to what people say when they get into an argument with their girlfriend, and they say things that they deeply regret. I sincerely apologize if I have offended anyone.&quot;<br />
Censoring the community?<br />

<br />
But Bakhtanians also continued to argue against what he sees as efforts to try to sanitize the fighting game community by submitting players to what amounts to censorship. &quot;What I was trying to communicate is that mild hostility has always been a defining characteristic of the fighting game scene,&quot; he said. &quot;Back when arcades were more prevalent, people didn't like newcomers, and players needed to fight and pay their dues to get respect. The debate I was in was with a person who supported professional leagues, who have intent to censor the community to make it more accessible.&quot;<br />
<br />
That person, TwitchTV community manager Jared Rea, tells Ars Technica that censoring players is not his goal. &quot;There's absolutely a way to keep that edge and keep it positive,&quot; Rea said. &quot;When the NBA brings on Charles Barkley [to comment], you can tell immediately he has that trademark attitude, he has his edge, he's going to take little snipes here and there, but it's still pretty friendly. You go, 'Oh, that Charles Barkley&#8212;he's kind of a jerk, but that's why we like him.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, the fighting game community is home to many players and spectators who have created an environment that &quot;is just not friendly towards women.&quot; He recalled a number of instances where players and spectators hurled misogynistic or homophobic comments in a crowded tournament hall, at one point forcing Rea's girlfriend to leave the one and only tournament she'd ever attended.<br />
<br />
These kinds of incidents are helping to hold back the mainstream success of fighting games as a spectator sport, Rea said, despite the genre's easier-to-understand gameplay. &quot;You find that more women watch games like Starcraft and League of Legends,&quot; Rea says. &quot;One could say 'Oh, that's because fighting is inherently more a boy thing... boys get off more on carnage...' [but] what I've found is it's not that other types of games are more elegant or that women enjoy more intellectual pursuits. A lot of it is the community. I have many friends who say to me they like watching Starcraft more because the community itself and the commentators make it a more fun environment to be in.&quot;<br />
Change through sponsorship<br />

<br />
Is this kind of culture something that can be changed? &quot;I think we've discovered a few times now that calling out the fighting game community and slapping them on the wrist and saying 'No, no, no. That's not right,' doesn't work, because the more you do that the harder they fight against that,&quot; Rea said. Instead, those that are looking for a more respectable community should &quot;support people who support that vision,&quot; he said, and not the people who want to &quot;bring things back to the dark ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sponsorship could have a significant effect on this process, Rea suggested, noting that professional leagues like MLG and IGN Pro League hire players and commentators from within the community who can act professionally, and provide media training so their employees &quot;know how to present themselves well. ... [Pros] know that, when it comes to being a sponsored player there are certain things they have to represent, and that's perfectly fine, that's definitely not a judgement. Some people would say, 'Oh they're sell outs,' but honestly it's the responsible thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Capcom, the major sponsor of Cross Assault, is for its part publicly distancing itself from Bakhtanians' actions. &quot;The views and opinions expressed by cast members in the live internet program 'Cross Assault' do not reflect those of Capcom,&quot; the company said in a statement to Ars Technica. &quot;As a company, Capcom believes that everyone should be treated with respect. This particular issue was brought to our attention and has been addressed. We sincerely apologize to anyone that was offended by any comments expressed during the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Rea thinks the company could go farther. &quot;I think it would be in [Capcom's] best interest to say to these guys 'Hey, if we're going to give you money, if we're going to sponsor your event with cash, you'd better keep it relatively clean.' It's in their best interest as a sponsor. That's kind of in the sponsor's responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the end, Rea said he hopes this incident can be a learning opportunity for everyone involved. &quot;I hope this really serves as a wake up call to the fighting game community, to say, 'You've reached the point at which people outside the fighting game community are actually really fascinated by what goes on inside the fighting game community.'<br />
<br />
&quot;If the fighting game community is going to grow and reach levels of success it could very well reach, they've got to take a hard look within themselves and figure out what it is that they want to represent,&quot; he continued. &quot;I think it's fair to say that with this whole blow up, it's not a good look.&quot;<br />
 edit i actually didnt know it was that bad with the girl when i posted this, i just seen some stuff on kotaku on teh stream after which i thought wasnt as bad lol. anyways i'll update this post with a cool dsp clip that i found on the issues!  <br />
<br />
what happened in a nutshell is this web series  was meant to be capcoms 1st legit big sponsored event to try to get fighting games a bit more main stream with a big grand prize and pretty much fails due to this girl player getting sexually harassed for 5 days. no one really noticed it till she started throwing matches and she really didnt tell the guy to stop either. <br />
<br />
what do major game outlets like penny arcade do? instead of going after teh guy or capcom that allowed this to happen, they just attack the fighting game community  saying this is why no one takes you seriously!<br />
<br />
the following week srk has its fight nights and the commentators say some sexiest and racist off color jokes which then kotaku picks up on saying this proves out point  which then  causes another uproar.<br />
<br />
<br />
so now everyone has a vary bad taste in their mouth over all this and wonder how it's going to effect the community in the future. will they tone it down, will they get more regulation, will it get boring like a starcraft or any fps stream.? <br />
<br />
what do you think?!<br />
<br />
here are 2 clips from somone that i follow on youtube that i think explain everything pretty well :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yttrium</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2012, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For my opinion, I believe a community has to learn to self-regulate before it can be taken seriously / en masse. Same with people - if you can't self-soothe, or behave in a semi-rational manner in public, why do you get let out of your cage? I don't take non-house-trained pets to people's homes, and I wouldn't put that asshat on any type of public broadcast.<br />
<br />
The lack of &quot;yeah, you're right - this is fucked up! Off with his head!&quot; from the community reinforces this: the community won't be taken seriously by the public-at-large if they don't try to behave in a manner consistent with the majority :\ Basic sociology.<br />
<br />
On an even more personal note, I find it amusing that a &quot;fighting game community&quot; exists. Isn't the very basis of the game conflict? Heh.</div></div><hr />

That's like saying &quot;it's just not baseball without racism!&quot; If your cultural identify is dependent on bigotry then it isn't worth preserving. Although honestly, a lot of these assholes are such snobs that they are probably delighted at the prospect of ruining their chances to become part of mainstream culture.<br />
<br />
Too bad you aren't a pro fighting game player Alikat, you could rip out that guy's emotional spine and screw him with it. I suppose it's possible what he really meant was the fighting game culture is dependent on heckling, but I think it's probably possible to maintain that without coming off as a creepy neanderthal.</div></div><hr />

Or at the very least, get one of them so pissed off that they make the mistake of trying to hit me, I'm pretty sure either way the dude would be crying.  But unfortunately I just don't like fighting games that much, last one I played was Altered Beast on my old Sega Genesis.</div></div><hr />

Oh my God that's Ares - Didn't he go more for Kayo Police at EVO? Why would he betray his true love? XD XD<br />
<br />
I'm gonna be honest with you - There's a lot of fields and arenas where being a woman is promised to get you a lot of heat, and the only way around it is to be tough, because the world and scene isn't going to change for you, or anyone. Any female on that EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESPORTS show is going to have a fight on her hands.<br />
<br />
We're talking Gaming community, here. Capcom (LOL) really wants this piece of shit game to succeed (to the point they threw a big chuck of resources at EVO to make sure nothing else would be there), and has thrown their money behind it. They took these ESPORTS folk and put em in a house or some shit, and guess what? They're acting like themselves. It's a reality TV show. They should have thought about it more carefully. <br />
<br />
This is drama. It shouldn't be surprising in the least that a guy in love with Traps like Kayo Police is going to be a complete pig whether the cameras like it or not. It's fucking videogames, the fucking game sucks, and if you stick it out you get thousands of dollars for fucking around. Not one person in that room gives a shit, if they do, they probably are way in over their heads both in the FGC and the stupid ass ESPORTS TV show.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
There are several very popular streams nd events , mostly for the largest (CAPCOM) games. Other games are known to have poverty communities, but major events do happen - you really need ot be in the community ot know about it. <br />
<br />
Evolution is the big daddy here in the US. Capcom is very invested in making sure it succeeds. Sadly, my games are not featured in the main event. (Unless you count KOF13. I promise that will be fun to watch. KOF community is really nice out west.)</div></div><hr />

It's fucking Baseball, the fucking game sucks, and if you stick it out you get thousands of dollars for fucking around. Not one person in that ballpark gives a shit, if they do, they probably are way in over their heads both in the MLB and the stupid ass sports TV show. <br />
