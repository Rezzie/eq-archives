      <p>First you have maybe acquired those languages by grouping with someone 
        who accidentally or purposely spoke few lines of them so other learn the 
        basics. I have done that few times my self. Other way to get those special 
        languages is training them in your guild. The guildmaster teaches them, 
        but they appear on the list as you advance levels. There aren't all of 
        them when you start as a fresh new wizard.</p>
      <p> How to improve you ask. Well, if you know the basics you can teach yourself 
        to excellent level with a patient and interested friend. Before the skill 
        level is 100 you can teach someone other one point above your own skill 
        level. Here is the system in brief: <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Turn group chat filter off from options. Keeps your screen clearer. 
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Make a social button which looks like: <br>
          /gsay a <br>
          /gsay a <br>
          /gsay a <br>
          /gsay a <br>
          /gsay a<br>
        </li>
        <li>Group with one person (faster and less lag) <br>
        </li>
        <li>Find two fast loading zones. I used Felwithe South and Felwithe North 
          zone line. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Change language to one you want to excel in.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Spam your friend until he/she has 2 improvements. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Switch to other language, if you are excelling multiple languages 
          and repeat #6. <br>
        </li>
        <li>You both zone to other side <br>
        </li>
        <li>Your friend switches to language you are excelling. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Your friend spams you, until you get two improvements. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Your friend switches to other language, if you are excelling multiple 
          languages and repeat #10. <br>
        </li>
        <li>You both zone again. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Continue from #5. Until there aren't any more improvements. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Ok. There is the trick and how is it done. It takes a while to get skills 
        from 1 to 100, but it is worth it. I excelled 11 or 13 (can't remember 
        anymore) this way.<br>
        It is true that one excellent teacher can teach a language to you to excellent 
        level in less than 5 minutes without zoning. I have taught many people 
        in last month. Then I went back to leveling. If you have any more questions, 
        please ask. </p>
