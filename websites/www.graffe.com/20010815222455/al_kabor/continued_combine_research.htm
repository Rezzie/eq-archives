      <p align="left">Remarkable, truly remarkable...</p>
      <p>Written amongst pages of the ancient tomes of the Combine Empire, I discovered 
        something that contradicts what has been theorized about the Combine ruins. 
        For years, it was believed that the Combine Empire created the structures 
        that facilitate teleportation for wizards, however, I found evidence in 
        the ancient tomes that proves these theories to be incorrect.</p>
      <p>Within their manuscripts, scientists of the Combine Empire made notes 
        of the discovery of sets of four tall spires found in several areas across 
        Norrath. The spires emanated a magical energy that was unexplainable. 
        After years of extensive research and experimental studies of the structures, 
        they came across a method of using this power for teleporting to several 
        locations. In order to use this power to its fullest, they built the pyramidal 
        structures in the middle of each set of these monuments.</p>
      <p>As I study the Combine spires... no... as a man of knowledge I can not 
        continue giving credit to the Combine Empire for creating something they 
        did not. The quadroliths, as I see more fit to dub them, contain a tremendous 
        amount of power. Some time ago, I sent my assistant Sorko Talvazon to 
        scrape some fragments off the portal in the Dreadlands. I hope this will 
        be possible. Before I continue with my research, I must study this magical 
        energy closer.</p>
      <p>Recently, I intercepted a letter from one of my former assistants, Terblyn 
        Zelbus, that was addressed to Sorko Talvazon. This letter was sent by 
        a messenger and delivered to my laboratory so I was well within my rights 
        to determine the nature of it. In between the usual gibberish that gnomes 
        tend to use, Terblyn seemed to be making arrangements for meeting Sorko 
        to get more information and to pay him for what he had already received, 
        including new spells that I had been working on. I asked myself what information 
        had Sorko sent to this little beast? I had not authorized any additional 
        scrolls to be sent to him.</p>
      <p>Blast! Why do I always end up surrounded by incompetent chuckleheads? 
        While searching my laboratory to make sure everything was in place, I 
        noticed a scroll hidden behind a few bottles on a dusty old shelf. I opened 
        this scroll and it was a detailed list of the experiments my assistants 
        and I have been working on. </p>
      <p>In order to confront Sorko, I decided to continue my planned journey 
        to Kunark and wait for him at the outpost of Firiona Vie, near the area 
        where he was supposed to meet with me. After he did not appear, I selected, 
        from those pleading for a chance to assist me, a wizard of no particular 
        standing, to assist me with my task in the Dreadlands. Once in that location, 
        I spotted Sorko Talvazon kneeling down picking away at the portal collecting 
        the fragments as if he was innocent of any wrongdoing. </p>
      <p>&quot;Fool!&quot; I addressed him. &quot;Did you honestly think that 
        I would not find out?&quot; He stood before me and pleaded that he didn't 
        know of what I spoke. After silencing him, I told him that I knew of his 
        selling that gnome both the spell scrolls and documentation of my enchantment 
        process for the portal fragments.</p>
      <p>Sorko Talvazon has been one of my assistants for several years. I put 
        forth a great deal of trust in having him assist me with my research in 
        confidence. I have warned him many times what the consequences of betraying 
        me would be. All the skill in wizardry that he possessed was gained under 
        my tutelage. Betrayal of my trusting and congenial nature proved to me 
        that he was not worthy of having such magical forces at his fingertips. 
        To preserve the secrecy of my work, I knew that I had to strip him of 
        all knowledge of my research and of all the wizardry I have taught him 
        over the years. Sadly, this dreaded act is one that I have performed before 
        and, despite the betrayal, it was not something that I was looking forward 
        to doing again.</p>
      <p>As I have written in past journals, this may be accomplished by the simultaneous 
        impact of a shocking blow knocking one's target unconscious, nullification 
        of any magic surrounding them and finally, blurring their memory. While 
        it is not a perfected process, I have had success with in the past. In 
        order to safeguard the process, I misled the young menial aiding me on 
        what was about to be done. Once the deed was done, I informed Sorko that 
        he was no longer one of my assistants and that he was banned from my laboratory. 
        Why I was merciful with him, I do not know. It is merely another of my 
        many endearing traits, no doubt.</p>
      <p>After examining the portal fragments, I brought them back to my laboratory. 
        Just as I projected, the power from the portals remained in the fragments 
        but in order for that energy to be amplified for usage, they needed to 
        go through enchantment. By submerging the small fragments in a solvent 
        made of mushlett acid and haze panther bile, then subjecting them to immense 
        amounts of heat, they became enchanted sources of energy. </p>
      <p>Once enchanted, the fragments did not produce enough power to reach the 
        dragon portals, but did manage to provide enough magical energy to translocate 
        to the weaker portals of Antonica - the dark forest of Nektulos, the western 
        half of the Commonlands, the western plains of Karana, the most northern 
        portion of the Desert of Ro, and even the temple of Cazic-Thule. With 
        the stolen spell scrolls and documentation of my enchantment process, 
        no doubt Terblyn Zelbus will be selling the spells and fragments in his 
        puny shop. Perhaps somehow I can discourage him, but meanwhile, I have 
        more urgent things to tend to. </p>
      <p>My research continues...</p>

      <p>The following text was taken from submitted chat logs during a time that 
        Al`Kabor visited Fironia Vie and the Dreadlands in search of his apprentice, 
        Sorko Talvazon-</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Sorko Talvazon says, 'Yes master, I have them right here!' <br>
          Al`Kabor grabs the bag from Sorko Talvazon. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Ah yes yes' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'These will need to be enchanted however'<br>
          Sorko Talvazon bows before Al`Kabor. <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Of course Master.' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'stand there Sorko Talvazon' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon bows before Al`Kabor. <br>
          Al`Kabor turns an icy glare upon Ankhamun. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Stand forth High Elf' <br>
          You snap to attention and salute Al`Kabor crisply. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'I have been told you could assist me this day?' <br>
          You say, 'Aye I would happy to assist you Al'Kabor' <br>
          You kneel before Al`Kabor in humility and reverence. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'very well' <br>
          You say, 'how may i help?' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'While I do not expect you to understand what procedure 
          I am performing, I will instruct you on what your part shall be in this 
          casting' <br>
          You say, 'what shall my part be in the casting sir?' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'When I say Cast Now! you are to target this bag which 
          will be in the hands of my assistant' <br>
          You say, 'ok, target the bag... ' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'You must cast a spell that will nullify magic upon it' 
          <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Yes the bag that Sorko shall be holding.' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon blinks his eyes and looks confused. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'You must do this at the same time I shall cast one of 
          my own spells' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Do you understand this task?' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Master?' <br>
          You say, 'I understand this task ' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'then prepare and stay where you stand' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'What process is this? This is not the enchantment 
          we tested in the laboratory?' <br>
          Laia says, 'what might happen should the timing of the spells be off?' 
          <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'hold the bag !' <br>
          You say, 'yes, what might happen should the timing of the spells be 
          off?' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'But, Master?' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'that is a good question' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'as this has not been done before I do not know' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Master.....' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'perhaps the rest of you should stand back some' <br>
          You say, 'ready when you are Al'Kabor' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'do not move Sorko Talvazon' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Cast Now !' <br>
          You begin casting Nullify Magic. <br>
          Sorko Talvazon feels dispelled. <br>
          Al`Kabor takes the fragments from Sorko. <br>
          Al`Kabor ponders the fragments. <br>
          You say, 'Did it work Al Kabor?' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon boggles, shaking his head and looking confused. <br>
          Sorko Talvazon staggers and almost falls. <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Master, I feel so weak....' <br>
          Laia offers Sorko Talvazon a shoulder to lean on.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Fool! Did you honestly think I would not find out that 
          you betrayed me by selling the scrolls that I have been working on and 
          the documentation of my enchantment process for the portal fragments?' 
          <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Master, forgive me, I do not know what you speak 
          of!' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'do not lend him aid Wood Elf' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon boggles, shaking his head and looking confused. <br>
          Al`Kabor turns an icy glare upon Sorko Talvazon. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Silence ungreatful child !' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon staggers again. <br>
          Sorko Talvazon feels very weak. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Aye - you should stagger and feel weak!' <br>
          You say, 'I've very disappointed with you Sorko :-(' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Master?' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'I warned you what the consequences would be if you betrayed 
          me!' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'Betrayal? I do not understand Master! I have made 
          no betrayal!' <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'You are weak because you no longer have the powers that 
          I have taught you over the years!' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'No master, forgive me, please!' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon grovels before Al`Kabor. <br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'your act of betrayal proves to me that you are not worthy 
          of having such magical forces at your hands' <br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'No, I meant no harm Master, please! Forgive my 
          foolishness!'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'you have fallen in my eyes and therefore are no longer 
          apprentice to Al`Kabor !'<br>
          Sorko Talvazon hangs his head in shame.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Further you shall not step foot within my laboratory 
          lest you die !'<br>
          Ankhamun kneels before Al`Kabor in humility and reverence.<br>
          Sorko Talvazon kneels before Al`Kabor in humility and reverence.<br>
          Sorko Talvazon says, 'As you command.'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'You should feel lucky that I am showing you mercy this 
          day. Leave my sight!'<br>
          Sorko Talvazon lowers his head and walks away in shame.<br>
          Al`Kabor examines the fragments closely.<br>
          Ankhamun says, 'Is there any way I can help you Al'Kabor?'<br>
          Al`Kabor speaking to himself seems to drift off in thought.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Just as I projected'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'the power from the portals remains in the fragments'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'ah yes. but they do need to be enchanted for the energy 
          to be amplified for use'<br>
          Al`Kabor turns the fragments over in his hands.<br>
          Ankhamun says, 'I would be happy to get them enchanted for you Al'Kabor'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Once enchanted I do not think they will port to the 
          greater Drogon Portals, but perhaps the lesser ones'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'yes indeed that will be most likely'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'perhaps they will even allow translocation.'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'a great power indeed is hidden within these fragments'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'hmmm.... I must get these to my laboratory for more 
          studies'<br>
          Al`Kabor looks up at those standing near him.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'no no'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'I was only thinking aloud'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'do not pay heed to my ramblings'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'I am most capable of this enchantment.'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'I am sure none other could do this as only I have been 
          researching the Combine magics. But, I can not tell you more'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'understand though that a magic unlike anything I have 
          seen may be hidden within these ancient quadrolithes'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Well I suppose you will want some type of reward or 
          payment for helping me High Elf ?'<br>
          Ankhamun says, 'This has been its own reward, but do what you think 
          is right dear sir '<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Indeed! A true Koada`Dal shows no greed....'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'I shall reward for what you assited me in this day'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'it is the least I can do '<br>
          Ankhamun bows before Al`Kabor.<br>
          Ankhamun says, 'you are too, too kind '<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'The coin of insight I Give to you'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'it is imbued with a magic that will soon fade'<br>
          Ankhamun says, 'thank you Al'Kabor'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'gring it to Ailerina the Gentle within the outpost'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'She is often found in prayer at the feet of the statue 
          of your Princess Firiona Vie'<br>
          Ankhamun says, 'i will do this right away '<br>
          Ankhamun kneels before Al`Kabor in humility and reverence.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'do not delay, for the magic is fragile'<br>
          Al`Kabor nods at Ankhamun.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'Laia step forward '<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'let it not be said I treat the Wood Elf unkindly. I 
          do remember you offered your service at the bridge'<br>
          You say, 'I offer my assistance when I can.'<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'spend it well'<br>
          You bow before Al`Kabor.<br>
          You say, 'Fare well in your research, great Wizard.'<br>
          Obidiah says, 'hrmm...I wonder if the great Al'Kabor could port Ranger 
          in need for CR. ' <i><font size="1">(sorry.. had to leave that one in 
          the text. -Graffe)</font></i><br>
          Ankhamun kneels before Al`Kabor in humility and reverence.<br>
          Al`Kabor says, 'too many have seen what I did here this day. I must 
          take my leave. Farewell'</p>
