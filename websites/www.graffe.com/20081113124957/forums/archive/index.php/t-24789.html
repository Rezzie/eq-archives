You can go in see what place you came in and quick synopsis of the game. You can also check up on your friends and how they do. But here is the best part, they keep EVERYTHING!<br />
<br />
Here is the game list:<br />

<br />
Now click on the game name in the left hand column and you will get this:<br />
(Note the top line of tabs, Kills, Stats (how many flags you scored, flag saves, or bomb plants etc), Hits (shots fires, accuracy), PvP (who killed you most, who you killed most), Medals (awarded for doing 'cool things'))<br />

I am MeanDevil (my little brother picked the name 2 years ago and you can't change it, so lame). My medals are for example: 2x Multikill, 1 Stealth Kill, 1 Boarded vehicle (i punched someone off their banshe), 1 Flag Grab (no clue) and 1 Flag Carrier Kill.<br />
<br />
Now within each game you can click &quot;Game Viewer&quot; This brings up a ton of pictures of the level. You click on them to see different angles of the zone. But you can also click on a players name. You can see where they were killed, where they killed other people, the paths they followed, where they picked up weapons and which they were, etc. <br />

They did a pretty good job on this end of the Halo2 stuff.</div></div><hr />
