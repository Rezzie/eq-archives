      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We all started 

        out at the gate point within Greater Faydark between the four pillars. 

        One GM named Arian showed in a timely fashion with an explosive entrance 

        and the meeting got underway. Indalamar took the floor and brought up 

        many issues that concerned all of us. It seemed as if the GM did not want 

        to hear our pleas. Another GM showed and then another. At this time the 

        meeting in the forest started to get a bit unmoderated so we moved it 

        to the chat server. Once in chat, the following GM's and designers showed 

        up:<br>

      the first hour within chat, it seemed as if whatever the speaker said, the 

      GM's did not want to listen at all. The topic of our damage was brought 

      up and they assured us that in later levels (MUCH later levels), we become 

      the masters of destruction. A high level spoke up and tried to explain that 

      this is simply not true. Verant came back with their facts that our damage 

      to mana ratio far outweighs any other class and they would not tweak us 

      in any way.</font></td>

    <td width="54%"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

      let the GM's know that root in no way works as we would like it to. The 

      programmers let us know that every class that uses Root, uses the same exact 

      spell and there is no difference between any of them. Once again, they threw 

      the statistics of all four spells at us and said nothing would be done to 

      rework it. One submitted the idea of a 'push' spell that would throw the 

      enemy away much like a Tentacle Terror does. GZ said this would in no way 

      be possible for the way the AI of the mobs works. Apparently they move on 

      invisible 'tracks' and this push spell would in no way work.</font></td>

      subject was based on the fact that area effect spells are nothing but a

      have their place and time for use. Again, nothing is to be done about them.</font></td>

      areas of research were brought up. From the spawn rates of runes to the 

      spells that are not researchable. Geoffrey Z stated that he again is upping 

      the spawn rate of runes and that researching of spells is still being fixed. 

      He stated he was to look into the rate of which the research skill andvances 

      also. We are to expect some fixes in the next patch. Hooray! Finally something 

      is going our way.</font></td>

    <td width="54%"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Geoffrey 

      Z stated that his best work comes from creating 'Toy Spells' for casters. 

      Some Wizards stated that a morph spell would be a nice addition and he agreed 

      to the idea. Although he cannot create a new graphic for use to morph into, 

      he said it was feasible to create a spell for us to morph into a creature 

      that is already on the servers. It seems our sight line of spells were to 

      be our 'Toy Spells' and he said they were implemented at the last moment 

      in beta and really haven't been dealt with too much. One wizard spoke up 

      and stated the truth, all they seem to do is 'magnify' your screen.. they 

      don't really let you see farther at all. GZ quickly stated that he uses 

      it to target certain mobs in camps before the fight and also uses them to 

      make sure there is no extra mobs in a camp they can't see. GZ also relayed 

      that our 'Eye of Zomm' is being reworked to not train monsters and we should 

      see a fix in the next patch.</font></td>

      Although many were upset at the outcome of the meeting, there were many 
      that were happy with it. I for one was just simply surprised at the turnout 
      of all of Verants people and their willingness to take time out for us. 
      This shows that they do care about their game and their paying customers. 
      Please note that it has been a very long day for me and I am writing all 
      of this off the top of my head. Also, I am writing this as my character 
      is meditating on my other compter... so if I missed something or mistakenly 
      wrote something wrong, go easy on me. Send me an <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">email</a>
