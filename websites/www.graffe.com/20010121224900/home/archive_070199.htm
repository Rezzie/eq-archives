          Wow.. Huge apoligy for the site being down today. Sort of totally out 

          of my hands. Seems that the server I lease took a major crash this morning. 

          I did everything in my power to get things going, but there was just 

          no server to work with. The worst part was that there was no way for 

          me to let you viewers know that it would be back. Anyway.. on a lighter 

          note. Last night I put up a small quiz survey on your opinions of the 

          Wizard class. By a huge margin the most common answer was &quot;Average. 

          We need minor tweaks.&quot; I personally love being a Wizard and would 

          never trade for another class. I do feel we need a small tweak, but 

          hey... what class doesn't. There is no 'perfect' class. I think Wizards 

          just kick butt. Period.</p>

          Last night on Xegony the GM's had a high level player event within Oasis 

          of Marr. Dubbed the 'Undead War', the GM's took control of all undead, 

          were in named spectre's, and a flying armored Troll. High level 40 players 

          were having to zone during the battle. I witnessed one area effect spell 

          casted by the GM's that killed in excess of 25 players in one shot. 

          Here is a pic of the beach after that area effect.</p>

          Just need to do an explanation for submits. Lately, I have received 

          a few item submits with the stat pics directly from EQ'lizer. This is 

          not cool. These guys work very hard on their website and I will not 

          accept these submits. Plagiarism is a no-no in my book. I appreciate 

          the submits, but please make them original. If you know somebody with 

          a unique item, ask them to put it in trade window and take a pic of 

          the stats. I'll still give you the credit for it. Remember mana and 

          intelligence items are very welcome. Thank you for understanding. -Graff&euml;<br>

          Since the moving of the site, I've had a few people (including myself) 

          only seeing this news page in it's old form (July 3rd was the last update 

          to the old site). This is a browser problem with IE 5.0 and here is 

          how to rectify the problem:</p>

        <p>1. Close down all instances of IE 5.0 that are running and restart 

          one session.<br>

          2. Delete your shortcut to this site (even if it says www.graffe.com 

          is the URL)<br>

          3. Delete the browser cache (Tools\Internet Options\General Tab\'Delete 

          Files')<br>

          4. If you can, I suggest deleting your History also.<br>

          5. Browse to this new URL again www.graffe.com and make a new shortcut.</p>

        <p>Sorry about all of this, gotta love Microsnot. Sorry to say, I've given 

          into the dark side and use MSIE 5.0 also. I was a Netscape loyal until 

          they sold out to AOL (Army of Loosers). Oops.. did I say that? Sorry 

          if I offended anybody that uses AOL out there but I really dispise them 

          and their practices of shoving their service down the throat of the 

          general population with all of thier false promises. Damn.. that rant 

          felt GOOD!</p>

          Updated the <a href="../equipment/equipment.htm" target="main">Equipment</a>

        <p>Want to thank everyone that emails in their appreciation of the site. 

          Puts a smile on my face and reminds me that the work doesn't go unappreciated. 

          You guys are great. </p>

          Server Updates:<br>

          <b>Chill Sight</b>. For sale now on merchants. Not confirmed but Geoffrey 

          Z hinted that it was the Wizards completion for our toy spells in the 

          'Sight' line and is rumored to be much like Ultravision. I am waiting 

          until I confirm this spell before I add it to the spells page.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="ChillSight.jpg" width="308" height="124"></p>

        <p align="left"><b>Invisibility Warning</b>. Server patch news stated 

          &quot;Invisibility spells (Invisibility, Gather Shadows, Camouflage, 

          etc.) will now blink before they wears off.&quot; Seems that this is 

          not working correctly. I've gotten the 'You Appear' message at least 

          10 times tonight.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Root spells</b>. &quot;Root spells will now overwrite 

          spells with both positive and negative movement components in a more 

          consistent pattern.&quot; My guess on this one is that if you have casted 

          Bonds of Force on a mob and you quickly Root it, Root will work and 

          cancel out the Bonds of Force.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Research</b>. &quot;Research for higher level spells 

          has been made a bit easier.&quot; LOL! Ya, right. They call killing 

          Lady Vox and Nagafen easy?</p>

          Finally came to the conclusion that it would not be implimented until 

          the scheduled maintenace at 3am this morning. I will update the site 

          with the info tonight (at work now).</p>

          Been receiving alot of submits with spell locations. This is really 

          helping me out. I wish to thank all of you for taking the time to send 

          in the info. I am working on the page (doesn't seem too extensive but 

          there is alot of info that needs to go in) but it will take a while 

          to get it into a format that I like. Plus I hope you all understand 

          that I need my game time too. =) </p>

        <p>By the way... the counter is back. Made it so it will only count unique

          Well, I'm back. As I hoped, I had a pretty full mailbox. Not too many 

          submissions, but a couple good ones. The additions and changes are as 

          follows:</p>

        <p>Added the Petrified Erudite Heart Pendant to the <a href="../armor/armor.htm" target="main">Armor</a>

          page.<br>

          <br>

          Made it known upon the <a href="../research/research.htm" target="main">Research</a> 

          page that there is two types of Fulguration Runes out there. Both are 

          stackable yet only one will work with creating spells. <br>

          <br>

          Added a 'Rune Disclaimer' to the <a href="../research/research.htm" target="main">Research</a> 

          page. I had to add this because I had many new Wizards asking what mobs 

          drop what runes. After a while it gets a bit tedious e-mailing the same 

          thing over and over. &quot;There is no set mob that will drop a set 

          rune. Rune drops are completely random.&quot; If you are of level 16 

          or lower, please go read it. I do not mean to sound harsh here, for 

          we all were in your position at one time too. I just hope this shed 

          some light on the subject.<br>

          I will be on a short vacation until Thursday. Figured it wasn't hot 

          enough here in Silicon Valley, might as well head south and really warm 

          up. Heck, I might just stop by Verant and say hello. &quot;Graffe who?&quot;.

        <p> Hopefully when I return I will have a full mailbox of new submits. 

          I'm looking for a stat pic of the Fire Crystal Staff (if it exists) 

          and the Shiny Metallic Robe (+10ac +9int +8 vs fire +8vs cold). <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">Send</a> 

          in anything that adds Intelligence or Mana to ourselves and is not already 

          upon the site. <br>
