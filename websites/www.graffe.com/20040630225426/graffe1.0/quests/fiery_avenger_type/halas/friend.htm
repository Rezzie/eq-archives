          did some agro tests tonight in Halas. If you have a friend buy the potion 
          for you, hand the potion into Camin, then head back over to Halas and 
          hand it into Dargon and she will spawn into Arantir Korandor.....You 
          CAN sit back and Hail Arantir and NOT get agro'ed by the Shaman Guildmaster, 
          even though he is lvl 60+ and Scowls, he does NOT agro. Stand in the 
          back of Dargon, you can hail Arantir from this spot, or move closer. 
          At one point I was standing right infront of Dargon and only 3 feet 
          from the guildmaster Shaman and he never agro'ed me. The guards pathing 
          can be timed and you will have more then enough time to do the first 
          and second leg of the talking with AK, with no agro at all. In Conlusion...Don't 
          worry about faction at all, just have a friend buy the potion for you 
          and Hail Arantir Korandor and do all your work from there on in. Questing 
          to get good faction is a total waste of time. </i></font></p>
