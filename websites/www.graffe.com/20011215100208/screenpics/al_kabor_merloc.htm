 Al`Kabor says, 'It may be, Zarasta'
 Al`Kabor regards you indifferently -- looks like he would wipe the floor with you!
 You say, 'hail Al`Kabor'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Take this Journal, Merloc'
 Orinab says, 'Mayhaps something like this?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'No, Orinab.  It has power, but not the type I seek'
 Al`Kabor regards you indifferently -- looks like he would wipe the floor with you!
 Al`Kabor is looking at your equipment...
 Sero says, 'you seek the runes which construct ice coment?'
 Sero says, 'comet'
 Tankish says, 'hail Al`Kabor'
 Al`Kabor says, 'No, Sero. I long ago created that spell'
 You say, 'What is this book you have given me?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'It is part of my Journal, Merloc'
 Badany says, 'Do you seek a spell?'
 Rokvald says, 'I'd like a sheet from your journal, oh grand wizard. How 'bout it?'
 You say, 'I have followed your work since I began to study the wizardly arts.'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I seek to MAKE  a spell'
 Al`Kabor nods at Merloc.
 Stardawne says, 'what items do you need?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I have only heard rumors, rumors that say it may be found in this place'
 You say, 'Although, I must say, I have never found any of your spells to be particularly useful.'
 Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Merloc.
 Al`Kabor says, 'They are most powerful, but you must, like anything, use them in the proper time and manner'
 Rokvald says, 'If you're such a powerful wizard, why not blow up the castle, yank out the huge iksar inside and smack it around until it gives you what you want?'
 You say, 'I will admit, there are still many things I do not know.'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Greetings, Mystic'
 Al`Kabor nods at Merloc.
 Al`Kabor says, 'I am the only one that can create spells from nothing, Succurso.  All others follow where I lead in this'
 Badany says, 'Is the item you seek within the castle Al'Kabor?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I doubt  it Badany'
 Al`Kabor says, 'No, Mystic'
 Al`Kabor says, 'It would not be armor'
 Tebelin says, 'hail Al`Kabor'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Hail, Tebelin'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Hmm... noooo. not toes, Mystic'
 Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Mysticshadow.
 Al`Kabor says, 'Frost and cold, Mystic.. not steel.....'
 Al`Kabor turns an icy glare upon Mysticshadow.
 Tebelin makes a rude gesture at Al`Kabor.
 Al`Kabor says, 'No, Derek'
 Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Tebelin.
 Derek nods.
 Tebelin laughs at Al`Kabor.
 Derek says, 'Most elusive indeed'
 Al`Kabor sighs at Tebelin.
 Al`Kabor shrugs unknowingly.
 Al`Kabor says, 'She was a Drunk Druid, what else is there to say?'
 Al`Kabor smiles.
 Derek says, 'I dont suppose one of you sorcerers here might spare a levitate to expediate me on this quest?'
 Merloc sits down to rest.
 Badany giggles.
 Xeonz says, 'hail Al`Kabor'
 Tebelin points at Al`Kabor. Yeah you!
 Al`Kabor boggles at Tebelin, shaking his head and looking confused.
 You say, 'I despise druids.'
 Al`Kabor nods at Merloc.
 Tebelin grins evilly at Al`Kabor.
 Derek says, 'Perhaps this item of power you seek is not an item, but a place?   Druids can be quite cryptic at times'
 Al`Kabor looks at Derek.
 Al`Kabor shrugs unknowingly.
 Orinab says, 'No offense Sirra but not many creatures have power...natural or unatural of frost or cold in this reagon'
 Al`Kabor says, 'You never know'
 Singrakth says, 'alkabor if i may ask what exactly did she say to you'
 Derek says, in Erudian, 'Me loc, you shuuldnt speak of druads thyt way . you never know when one might sovi your life'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I do not know if it even comes FROM soemthing.  It may be the mst comon of item'
 Al`Kabor shrugs unknowingly.
 You say, 'What exactly were you told, Al'Kabor?'
 Veness tells the guild, 'night Thundax ))'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I have searched most of these lands myself, without luck'
 Orinab says, 'Where did she say exactly that she saw it?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'That she found a frosty "thing", that emitted cold.'
 Al`Kabor says, 'She said it actually froze her thigh, which was next to where she stored it'
 You say, 'And where did she find this frosty thing?'
 Orinab says, 'Sounds like a frost gem...from the derv creaturs in Iceclad'
 Orinab says, 'but...this is far from there'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I have read of such a thing in a certain text that I have.  I belive that is a pure form of the power of cold, one that can emit huge amounts of power if done correctly'
 Singrakth says, 'what did she say she did with it alkabor'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Ver drunk'
 Tebelin bonks Al`Kabor on the head!
 Al`Kabor says, 'Very very drunk'
 Orinab says, 'So....its possible she was in Iceclad?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I have no need of coin, Tebelin'
 Majdar says, 'hail Al`Kabor'
 Ellise tells the guild, 'Night Tindi =)'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Hail, Majdar'
 Tebelin pokes Al`Kabor.
 Al`Kabor says, 'Something made of Frost'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Autum, Xeonz'
 You say, 'A Rune of Frost, perhaps?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'No, Merloc'
 Orinab says, 'like a Frost gem? or a Velium piece'
 Al`Kabor says, 'yes, a frost gem, or something like that, might be it'
 Orinab says, 'Velium is Ice so cold that items can be crafted from it'
 Al`Kabor says, 'It may not BE a gem, I am not sure. And no, it wouldn't be a weapon'
 Tebelin pokes Al`Kabor.
 Al`Kabor says, 'Stardawne...'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Where did you get this?'
 Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Stardawne.
 Al`Kabor looks closer.
 Al`Kabor says, 'Do you know where THEY got it from?'
 You told stardawne, 'What did you give him?'
 Al`Kabor raises an eyebrow at Stardawne.

 Al`Kabor says, 'This is what I am looking for'
 Beginning to memorize Wrath of Al'Kabor...
 You have finished memorizing Wrath of Al'Kabor.
 Al`Kabor says, 'here. Take this coin, Stardawne.'
 Stardawne tells you, 'frost crystal'
 You told majdar, 'I think we should mass nuke him with Wrath of Al'Kabor'
 You told Stardawne, 'From Permafrost?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'Trade with me Star'

 Stardawne tells you, 'retribution of al kabor'
 Orinab says, 'Master Al'Kabor can any wizard produce this spell with the correct items'
 Al`Kabor says, 'There, Star'
 Tebelin waves goodbye to Al`Kabor.
 Al`Kabor says, 'No, I still am researching it, this is only ONE part of the spell'
 You say, 'What other parts do you need?'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I have a long way to go.. but with Stardawne's help, I believe this power is within my grasp now...'
 Al`Kabor says, 'I do not know, Merloc. I must return to my tower in Erudin to continue my research now.'
 Al`Kabor says, 'The lake of this special kind of power has stopped me until now'
 Anyen kneels before Al`Kabor in humility and reverence.
 Al`Kabor beams a smile at Stardawne.
