          This is a call to all the Wizards on Norrath, After listening to Verant 
          once again that nothing is going to be made about the spell cap on wizards, 
          we are going to declare a week of pacific protest, During that week 
          we wont teleport, bind, or help in anyway to any but guild mates that 
          support us, also we will remove the anonymous so everybody can see that 
          we ,the wizards of Norrath, have our hands tied by Verant. What we hope 
          to get is attention on the spell cap issue, and a modification/removal 
          of the cap. This will take effect from the 22th to the 29th of January.

          On Saturday, January 22, 2000 from 1pm to 3pm EST, Members of the Honor 
          Guild on the Xegony server will be hosting an event on the Xegony Server. 
          The Event will take place on the do docks in the Oasis zone. Hopefully 
          the entire guild will be available to participate. ANYONE is eligible, 
          Level 1 - 50. The event will include and not be limited to:<br>
          <br>
          1- Teleporting - Anyone that needs a ride will be teleported for the 
          time that we are there, we will teleport you wherever you want to go, 
          from Tox to Hate. <br>
          <br>
          2- Healing - Will be provided for the hours that we will be there. <br>
          <br>
          3- Buffing - Will be provided for the time that we are there, but there 
          is one exception, any buff that requires the use of an component to 
          cast (i.e. Jaspers or Peridots for Symbol) will only be cast if the 
          component is provided. <br>
          <br>
          4- Sowing - Will be provided for those hours that we are there. <br>
          <br>
          The next series of services that we will provide are trade skill services 
          that have many contingencies to them since they are volatile in performance. 
          Note that these services ARE NOT 100% GUARANTEED. There will be failures. 
          All materials that are required to perform these services are to be 
          provided by the individual requesting the service.<br>
          <br>
          5- Fletching - Free fletching serviced will be provided from a master 
          Fletcher with a 200 skill. He will be decked out in all the higher level 
          cleric items to boast his wisdom in order to minimize failures. **Again 
          all materials are to be provided by the person requesting the service.** 
          <br>
          <br>
          6- Jewel Crafting - Free jewel crafting services will be provided from 
          a master jewel crafter with a 200 skill. He will be decked out in all 
          the higher level cleric items to boast his wisdom in order to minimize 
          failures. **Again all materials are to be provided by the person requesting 
          the service.** <br>
          <br>
          7- Research - Free research will be provided from a wizard with a ******180***** 
          skill in research. Although this isn't the maximum skill, it might be 
          helpful to research some of the lower level spells. He will be decked 
          out in all the higher level cleric items to boast his wisdom in order 
          to minimize failures. **Again all materials are to be provided by the 
          person requesting the service.** <br>
          <br>

          I had a short talk with GZ yesterday concerning our class as Wizards 
          and the state of all of the petitions and such that are going around. 
          Near the end of our talk, he said, &quot;I do have something coming 
          in for wizards this patch - we will have to see what they think&quot;. 
          Now don't go getting your hopes up thinking we will become the all powerful 
          class within Norrath because that will never happen... that is a balance 
          issue. I'm sure it will be a small tweak, but none the less, it's something.

          a little bit of common sense here:<br>
          <i>&quot;I have noticed a trend in current GM events. When players can 
          not figure out what a GM controlled NPC wants, they turn on him and 
          want to kill him, gathering up as many people in the zone as possible 
          to try and pound the NPC into dust. On my server today, Quellious, there 
          were several tiny Sand Giants that had appeared and wanted to play games 
          with the PCs nearbye. This was real fun at first, as we played tag, 
          got them Orcs to squish [they really enjoyed squishing things] and generally 
          roleplayed with us. I brought them some things to kill, gave them some 
          wine I was carrying, talked to them [with little response, as they were 
          being talked to be everyone] and tried to have a decent time. Then after 
          a bit some players got bored of this and wanted to get items from the 
          little giants, since they were not giving them away, they tried to take 
          them by force. It was a futile effort at first as they could not muster 
          up enough dmg to make a different, but after a bit many many more people 
          joined and started to actually hurt the playful giants, a lot! The whole 
          time they were being attacked they asked us via shouts why were we attacking 
          them when all they wanted to do was to play? I tried to help the giants 
          while they were being attacked, but since I am a wizard there is very 
          little I can do to help other than try to get the giants out of there 
          [I gave them several warnings to run away so they would not have to 
          die]. After about 30 mins of solid combat, some of the PCs gave up and 
          the battle became somewhat light, this is where I was summoned to the 
          "lead" Sand Giant. At first I thought it was part of their games, cause 
          they did this before. [they would summon someone back and forth across 
          the zone and roleplay that they were having a game of catch with you 
          as the ball! :) ] After i tried to get away for the 6th or 7th time 
          and was resummoned back time and again, I sat down and smiled at him. 
          Then he gave me a Rubicite Helm! He said thank you for the games and 
          the help. About 10 mins after that all the playful Giants went away. 
          As far as I know I was one of the few people to get any item at all, 
          and I got it just because I was nice to them. Anyway, the point of this 
          email is that force is not always the way to get things, and when it 
          comes to GM events, listen to the GMs and try to play as best you can 
          with what it is they want to do. They are not looking for the perfect 
          role playing time, but rather just to see the ingenuity of people, and 
          to make others have a good time. Sorry this email is so huge bud, but 
          I feel this is something that people have to try an learn if they want 
          to participate in GM events and make them successful for all involved. 
          Have a safe journey. <br>

          &quot;This quest is still fairly easy to complete. This is what I did. 
          I collected the 4 items. Then met my enchanter friend in Freeport. Give 
          the enchanter the Kiola Nut. Then I gave the bartender the fish, the 
          tonic, and the honey jum. After that the enchanter gave the bartender 
          the kiola nut. Poof! The enchanter got the Bartender's Compendium; He 
          gave me HIS stein and then set off to get another one. This is very 
          easy to do, especially if you do all of the leg work first and then

          <font color="#FFFFFF">Graffe</font>: <i>&quot;Is there a limit as to 
          how many mobs any Area Effect can hit? Lately I have been getting conflicting 
          reports on all AoE's, but mainly Supernova. Many say Supernova was 'nerfed'.&quot;</i><br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: <i>&quot;There has been a limit to 
          the number of mobs an AoE can hit since early Beta. The bigger the AoE, 
          the more mobs it can effect - but it has been like that forever. It 
          was from early beta when we'd get one person collecting monsters, and 
          then a few Wizards casting AoE's and getting 20 or so mobs per hit.&quot;<br>
          </i><font color="#FFFFFF">footnote from Graffe</font>: Keep in mind 
          that just like any spell we cast, it is a roll of the dice on how it 
          hits. Therefore, you may only hit a few mobs with a level 49 AoE and 
          you may hit 10 mobs with a level 16 AoE (although I've never done it).

          Sit Out:<i><br>
          &quot;Hello everyone, I am here today to explain and to solve a problem 
          that has been on Everquest for a certain time regarding Wizards resist 
          cap. I as a felow wizard is tired of it. We wizards have to wait several 
          levels more than the other classes to get into groups that gives quite 
          good experience. This situation is unberable and is very frustrating 
          because it is just not fair for us wizards to have to wait for more 
          levels.<br>
          Exemple: 2 of my friends, Lvl 36 bard and lvl 37 warrior joined DT (Death 
          tower) in Lower guk a few days ago while i was gettin trhou my hell 
          lvl 35. Well they made it to 39 in DT in 2 days. Imagine my excitement 
          when i learned i was too low to get in DT group or even list because 
          the frog would resist too much. How does that make me fell, well useless 
          and frustrated about it. Now i have to go in a lower level group longer 
          than my 2 other friends.<br>
          How to settle this? Me and some friends a putin together a Sit-out for 
          wizards on the Mithaniel Marr server and hope some of the other server 
          will do the same. We are gonna sit as long as it takes to get thing 
          sort out. We will not tolerate this injustice. Now im leaving my E-mail 
          for people of the other servers to contact me so we will execute the 
          event at the same time and place. I hope you felow wizard will understand 
          and support us because you felow young wizard will get annoyed too. 
          imgaine a lvl 50 wizard not even capable of doing partial damage on 
          a Lvl 50 mob. And would really like it if other class would help them 
          out too in there Sit-out. <br>
          When? Im so tired of it im doing it soon. Lets say Wednesday January 
          5th by 8 pm eastern time at West Freeport at the West Gate. Create lvl 
          1 characters wizard or bring your own precious character with you. Thank 
          you for your time and please consider this the movement that will make 
          us wizards equal.&quot;</i><br>

          this at <a href="mailto:pfk182@hotmail.com">pfk182@hotmail.com</a><br>
