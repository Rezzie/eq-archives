Seems to me that it was in the third or fourth big &quot;rectangular&quot; area.  I know it was in the area where the signature orcs start appearing, and the posts are pretty much right in the open.  My advice is to get a couple of other guys and make a beeline for the Goblin King's chamber, by going straight through all the big rooms and no sidetracks through side tunnels.  You should see the poles.  But yah there are more difficult mobs around iirc.<br />
 <br />
BTW the next part of the quest is in the Uruk area in the goblin town, its on the left side looking at the overhead map.  <br />
 <br />
And if you want, here's a map (http://forums.lotro.com/showthread.php?t=98845) of goblin town.  Its slightly spoilerish.</div></div><hr />
