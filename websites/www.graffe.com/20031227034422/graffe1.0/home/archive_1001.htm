 Only one spell is in the spdat for wizards so far; a spell called "Manaburn".  It is not clear exactly how the spell works, but it is a DD of some kind.

 To make a long story short, the current web host has but a strangle hold on the bandwidth and resources this site uses.  I was paying for unlimited bandwidth and hits but apparently the webhost viewed this site as abusing that part of the contract.

 I want to apologize for the frustration you are all having with the website and I'm doing all I can to find some other way to get this site back up and running like it once did.</p>       <p><font size="1">8:58am PST -<a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">Graffe</a></font></p> <!--ENDSAMEDAY -->     </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td colspan="2" height="2">        <hr noshade>       <b></b></td>   </tr>

 <UL>
 <B>
 <P>In addition to the melee changes mentioned above, we’ve also made some wide-ranging changes to the way the spell system works, or more accurately, the spell-resist system and how it works in regards to content, specifically content of a high level.</P>
 
 <P>Through our testing we found that many higher level creatures, and especially those creatures that are above 60th level, were typically resisting magical damage to an extent far greater than they should have been. This lead to a couple of classes having their usefulness in these situations either negated or reduced to a pure utility role. As such we’ve made the following changes:</P>
 <P>
 NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. We’ve increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We’ve also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious. Finally, we’ve given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn’t want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don’t take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature.
 </P>
 <P>Players will now also receive messages when an NPC is immune to a particular type of spell, much like messages regarding mesmerization have always been sent. We can do this since the designers have direct control over the effectiveness of certain utility effects, while still allowing damage-causing spells to go through. As an example, NPCs that were always immune to melee-speed debuffs by virtue of the fact that they had a very high magic resistance will still be immune to those spells, but magic-based spells that cause damage or do some other effect that the designer didn’t necessarily want to rule out would now go through.</P>
 <P>
 Finally, to compensate for increased magical damage, some NPCs have received additional abilities and/or stats. This serves to keep the encounters at a similar level of difficulty while balancing the contribution of melee and casters, rather than engaging exclusively in the melee-heavy strategy of before.
