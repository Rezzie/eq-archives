      <p>To continue his search for immortality, the wizard Al'Kabor needs certain 
        items to replicate a most heinous ceremony. In his studies in the library 
        of Erudin, he has read about a scroll of great power, and the fateful 
        journey leading to its loss at sea.</p>
      <p>The ship &quot;Shark's Bane&quot; was chartered to carry the scroll from 
        Butcherblock to Freeport during some of the worst storms that ocean had 
        yet seen. Despite being crewed by rough and seedy veteran seaman, none 
        of whom were strangers to travel in treacherous conditions, the voyage 
        turned disastrous.</p>
      <p>Upon reaching the Ocean of Tears, the ship's captain determined it would 
        be prudent to seek refuge at the Sisters of Erollisi Isle. His order to 
        the tillerman to steer hard to port was met with no response. Turning, 
        he watched as the poor soul was swept over the rail on the crest of a 
        wave. The captain scrambled toward the rigging. A second wave breached 
        the starboard side. The captain shut his eyes tightly and prepared for 
        the impact. When none came, he opened his eyes. A muffled screamed escaped 
        him as he watched the wave, now standing impossibly on the deck, sprout 
        great arms and reach for him. The cacophony of snapping timbers and the 
        thundering of water were all that bespoke the final voyage of the &quot;Shark's 
        Bane&quot;.</p>
      <p>Al'Kabor's knowledge of the ship and its fate are the results of his 
        studies in the great Library of Erudin. However, as is the case with tales 
        of this sort, much of the text was based upon hearsay. But there was mention 
        of one Tillerman Jairik as the only survivor of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Excited at the prospect of adding this scroll to his &quot;Shopping List 
        of Armageddon,&quot; Al'Kabor once again recruits a party to seek out 
        Tillerman Jairik, and convince him to return to the site of the wreck 
        to assist in the retrieval of the lost cargo. The wizard's knowledge of 
        Jairik is limited to his general location. &quot;The wretch has reverted 
        to the meaningless existence of an arms monger, peddling his wares in 
        the cave of East Commonlands. Were it not for the fact that within his 
        tiny skull is locked the key so conjunctive to my research, I would give 
        no more thought to his death than I would afford a mosquito in Feerrott.&quot;</p>
      <p>Tillerman Jairik has no knowledge of the cargo of the ship, though he 
        knew it was valuable. He avoided the hold of the ship when the item was 
        loaded, and was issued strict orders by the captain not to snoop. He felt 
        an eerie presence even as he boarded the ship that rainy evening. &quot;Arr, 
        what a man don't know about, won't show up later to bite him in the arse!&quot;</p>
      <p>Jairik has a mild fear of the sea now, but he overcomes it in order to 
        accompany the adventurers to the location of the wreck. &quot;Me ol' bones 
        will feel more at ease knowin' me crewmates be at peace in their watery 
        graves, aye.&quot; Because he was swept overboard before the attack of 
        what Al'Kabor identified as a water elemental, he has no knowledge of 
        the beast. He fully expects the ship to be in ruins with its cargo plundered 
        long ago. Little does he know, the elemental has taken up residence aboard 
        the lost ship.</p>
      <p>By the time the ship reaches the docks in the Ocean of Tears, Jairik 
        has regained his sea legs, and has no problem swimming to the rocky isle. 
        &quot;C'mon, ye scurvy dogs! The salty brine will keep ya afloat, like 
        an egg on a glass table!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Prexus! Don't be takin' me now!&quot; Jairik exclaims when he sees 
        the ghostly Shark's Bane docked at the isle, and the great Water Elemental 
        floating upon its deck. &quot;Ach, I dinnae want to be fish food!&quot;</p>
      <p>The water elemental disembarks and attacks the adventurers. Jairik, overcome 
        with terror, only assists in the battle when the party becomes overwhelmed, 
        and even then only half-heartedly.</p>
      <p>With the defeat of the water elemental, Jairik continues on with the 
        party to the Sisters of Erollisi island, where Al'Kabor awaits them. Anxious 
        to return to his laboratory and continue his research, Al'Kabor quickly 
        rewards the adventurers. The party's questions annoy him, they being far 
        too simple to comprehend his plans, and he rudely departs. </p>
      <p>Tillerman Jairik, the Swashbuckler, returns to the Commonlands and resumes 
        his peaceful mercantile life.</p>
