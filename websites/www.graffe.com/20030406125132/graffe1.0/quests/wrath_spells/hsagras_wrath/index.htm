  <blockquote> 
    <p><br>
      You say, 'hail Lawyla'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Hail and well met Ninan . I can see by your appearance that 
      you are well traveled. I congratulate you on your thirst for adventure as 
      you are obviously far from where you call home. Would you happen to study 
      the art of Sorcery? </p>
    <p>You say, 'yes, i study the art of sorcery'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Then I believe you would be interested in hearing of the sad 
      tale of our beloved Hsagra. Many years ago, Hsagra was slain by the wicked 
      Kromzek Porlos. Unfortunately, Porlos found out that Hsagra had discovered 
      a new magic that was extremely powerful against the Giants. Hsagra was the 
      mate of Yelinak. You might have heard the tale of Yelinak, for he still 
      lives with the terrible memory of the horrid day that he lost his wingmate. 
      The Giants even have the gaul to have made the throne of King Tormax out 
      of the skull of Hsagra. Do you wish to avenge Hsagra after what I have told 
      you? </p>
    <p>You say, 'i wish to avenge hsagra'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'The Kromzek have been a bane upon our very existence for far 
      too long. If you wish to aid our cause, I will need proof of your devotion 
      and allegiance. We will not waste our time educating anyone who does not 
      have our best interests at heart. The journey will prove very dangerous 
      both to you as well as whom you choose to accompany you. After knowing this, 
      do you still want to prove your allegiance? </p>
    <p>You say, 'yes, i wish to prove my allegiance'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Before I divulge the secret behind the sorcery against the 
      Kromzek, I require three items from you, and you alone. Please also keep 
      in mind I will need to combine these 3 items together, so I will not accept 
      them individually. First, we must start out with the teachings of Relinar, 
      for it is necessary in recreating the magic against the vile giants. Our 
      lorekeeper is one you must seek out to acquire those teachings, He resides 
      within the confines of our dwelling. </p>
    <p>You say, 'who is the lorekeeper'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Jualicn is the one that you seek. Ask him of Relinar and he 
      will guide you in acquiring the teachings of our Relinar who rediscovered 
      the lost magic that once belonged to Hsagra. Once you have all of the items 
      in hand that are needed to recreate this powerful spell, come back and we 
      will continue this discussion then. Until that point, our business here 
      is done. May you be blessed in your efforts to assist in the annihilation 
      of the Kromzek. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jualicn is the dragon we passed just before Lawyla.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'hail Jualicn'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'Why hello there Ninan . I do not see many that pass through 
      these chambers unless they are trusted. What brings you before me today? 
    </p>
    <p>You say, 'i wish to acquire the teachings of relinar'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'In order to receive the teachings, you need to gather four 
      runes from the descendants of Relinar. Each descendant of Relinar has one 
      of the four runes. You will find them where they stand six abreast in the 
      wasteland. However in order to know that you have my blessing you must present 
      them with a treasure that they would know came from me. </p>
    <p>You say, 'treasure'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'I do have an ancient token that I have carried with me for 
      quite some time. It is very special to me, but if you have been sent here 
      by Lawyla then you must be worthy, for she is quick to see through the lies 
      that some believe will gain them admittance to our halls. Please take this 
      and present it to each of the descendants so that they will know you are 
      truthful when you say that you were sent by me. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('jualicns_token.jpg','jualicntoken','width=330,height=145')">Jualicn 
    token</a>.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'who are descendants of relinar'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'Another Wizard joining our ranks? Excellent. Listen closely 
      Ninan . I will give you the Lexicon of Relinar, a great and well remembered 
      Sorcerer whose teachings are necessary in constructing a spell that is very 
      powerful against the Giants. I will give you his ancient lexicon which can 
      harness his teachings if you can carry this large tome. You may need to 
      rearrange your belongings. Are you ready to receive the Lexicon? </p>
    <p>You say, 'i am ready to receive the lexicon'</p>
    <p>Jualicn says 'Combine the four in this lexicon and you will then have the 
      teachings of Relinar. After you have done this, you are required to speak 
      again with Lawyla about the problems we are having of late with Kromzek 
      spies. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You will now be given back the Jualicn Token and you will also recieve a 
    <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('lexicon_of_relinar_stats.jpg','lexiconofrelinarstats','width=330,height=145')">Lexicon 
    of Relinar</a> (be sure to have one main slot empty in your inventory because 
    the the lexicon is a container.. therefore it won't fit in another container). 
  </p>
  <p>Now go back to Lawyla -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'what problems with Kromzek spies?'</p>
    <p>Lawyla says 'Hello again Ninan . I see that you have spoken to Jualicn. 
      We have been having problems with spies in this area. I require three items 
      in order to recreate the magic necessary to scribe the spell. I need the 
      head of a Kromzek spy, the teachings of Relinar, and finally a scale from 
      Hsagra. In order for the magic of Hsagra to work, we must have some of her 
      remains to complete the components. It is rumored that high ranking Giant 
      Noble that goes by the name Helssen, treasures a scale that came from the 
      body of Hsagra herself. But I believe you will have to kill him in order 
      to take the scale away from him. He resides in the Giant City with the other 
      vile creatures. Bring it to me along with the head of the spy and the Teachings 
      of Relinar and we will conclude our dealings. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Now move to Western Wastes, the dragons guard the entrance to Temple of Veeshan 
    and find <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('ionat_pic.jpg','ionatpic','width=660,height=500')">Ionat</a> 
    (loc +195.00, +1557.00).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You say, 'hail Ionat'</p>
    <p>Ionat says 'Hello Ninan . It is good to see that you have traveled so far 
      to be in my presence. I do believe that you are the one chosen to aid us 
      in our fight against the Giants. If you are then I am sure that you will 
      need my rune for your research. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Give Ionat the Jualicn token -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Ionat says 'Take this Rune of Revenge Ninan . You will need it to extract 
      retribution in remembrance of our dear Hsagra. I thank you for your contributions 
      to our cause, It is good to have you amongst our ranks. </p>

    of Revenge</a> as well as the Jualicn Token. Go find <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('entariz_pic.jpg','entarizpic','width=660,height=500')">Entariz</a> 
    in Western Wastes (loc +343.00, +1191.00)</p>

    <p>Entariz says 'Greetings Ninan . I have heard that one is amongst us in 
      the lands which will aid us in our cause. If you are the one that seeks 
      my ancient rune for your studies please make sure it is not used in vain. 
      I do not talk to many that pass through here and I feel in my heart that 
      it is you that shall help us. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Give Entariz the Jualicn token -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Entariz says 'Ah of course Ninan . You will need a Rune of Eradication 
      for your lexicon. We are counting on your loyalty. Remember that you will 
      need to bring the teachings of Relinar to Lawyla for further instructions, 
      as she requires them to pass on the magic to those worthy of it. I bid you 
      farewell Ninan . </p>

    in Western Wastes (loc +859.00, +65.00)</p>

    <p>Draazak says 'Greetings Ninan . It cannot be that you would present yourself 
      before me without reason. What brings you to these lands on this day? Please 
      be quick for I have many ancient runes I must study. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Give Draazak the Jualicn token -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Ninan , which Relinar found to be necessary for the success of the magic 
      against those foul Giants. I present this to you with faith that you are

  <p>So you just have to kill now <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('noble_helssen_pic.jpg','noblehelsson','width=660,height=500')">Noble 
    Helsson</a> in Kael, found next to Wenglawks in the Noble building.</p>
  <p>He cons yellow to Lvl 53, so his lvl is max 55. We took him down with one 
    group, Monk58, Rogue56, Paladin53, Cleric56, Druid57, Wizard60. He dropped 
    a <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('scale_of_hsagra.jpg','scaleofhsagra','width=330,height=145')">scale 
    of Hsagra</a>.</p>
  <p>Back to Skyshrine, we moved up again very high and found the Kromzek Spy 
    on the icy path before Jualicn at loc 1413,2465,-37. He cons yellow again 
    to lvl 53, so again max lvl 55. The icy path is tricky, so keep in mind to 
    have levitation or dead man floating on.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a kromzek spy says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromzek of Kael Drakkel! 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We took him down with the same group. He dropped the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('head_of_a_kromzek_spy.jpg','headofakromzekspy','width=330,height=145')">head 
    of a kromzek spy</a>.</p>
  <p>Now moved the short way to Lawyla and handed over the three pieces from the 
    quest (head, scale, teachings).</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Lawyla says 'Ninan . You are to be commended for your valor and determination 
      in assisting my Kin. Here is the spell that Hsagra died so long ago over. 
      I only ask that each time that you use the sorcery here, that you remember 
      Hsagra in a silent prayer of thanks. For I hope that will help ease Yelinaks 
      still tormented soul from his loss. I bid you farewell. You are welcome 
      amongst our ranks. </p>
