  <p>If you wish to quest for the key, your faction with 'scarsofveeshan' will 
    need to be at least dubious or you will need an enchanter to charm Ziglark 
    Whisperwing. Note that only one party member needs the key from this quest 
    in order for your party to be taken to Cobalt Scar.</p>
  <p align="left">To get to Ziglark Whisperwing, enter skyshrine, go through first 
    portcullus, go right then left. To get to the fountain, go through first portcullus, 
    go left, left, right, left. Once you find Ziglark, he will need to be charmed 
    before you can speak to him. Once charmed -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#CCCCCC" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You 
      say</font>, 'hail Ziglark Whisperwing'<br>
      Ziglark Whisperwing says 'Greetings Xekl, I am the Herald of Lord Yelinak 
      the great Ice Dragon. Im charged with taking care of all mundane tasks that 
      are too trivial for the great dragon.</p>
    <p>You say, 'I am worthy'<br>
      Ziglark Whisperwing says 'You must first prove this to me before I allow 
      you through our home. Wenglawks of Kael is an acquaintance of ours that 
      has been feeding us information on the Storm Giants movements through Velious. 
      Lately our couriers to him have disappeared. What you must do is take this 
      request to him along with 200 platinum as payment for the Storm Giants locations 
      and return the information back to me. After you complete this task for 
      me we will discuss passage through the skyshrine.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have in your posession a 'Message to Herald'. You must take this 
    to Wenglawks of Kael and hand him both the platinum as well as this message 
    at the same time. You can hand it to him while being invisible but be ready 
    to high-tail it to the zone as soon as you hit 'trade', because all hell is 
    going to break loose.</p>
  <p> Wenglawks can be found in Kael at location +317, +1910. To get there, from 
    Wakening Lands enter Kael and take the first possible left. You'll come to 
    2 giant wooden doors at about location +200, +1750. Enter either one and go 
    through another doorway to find Wenglawks. If you are KOS, stay invis and 
    hand Wenglawks the message as well as the 200pp and hit trade. This is the 
    text that follows but don't stick around read it - run for the zone! <i>(one 
    report that a player was attacked as soon as they opened up the trade window, 
    so be careful!)</i> -</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Wenglawks Kkeak says 'Here is the information your employer requested. 
      Now be gone, I have more business to take care of.</p>
    <p>You gain experience!!</p>
    <p>You appear.</p>
    <p>Wenglawks Kkeak says 'You will not live to regret that!<br>
      Wenglawks Kkeak says 'Wizards like you always bring out the worst in me.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You now have a letter that you must take back to Ziglark in Skyshrine. You 
    will need to have an enchanter charm him again in order to hand him the letter. 
    After he is charmed, hail him to start up the quest again and then hand him 
    the letter. In return for the letter, Ziglark will give you the key to Cobalt 
    Scar. Ziglark spawns every 24 minutes.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Ziglark Whisperwing says 'Excellent, you have gotten the information back 
      and you are still in one piece. Perhaps you could be useful to our cause. 
      Here is the key to leave the Skyshrine. Just place it on the flaming pot 
      of the dragon statue, near the center of the pool in the courtyard.</p>
    <p>You gain experience!!</p>

  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
    key is like the Sebilis and Howling Stones key in that it is 'soulbound'. 
    This means that even if you die, it will be on you... not your corpse. The 
    difference in this key is that only one party member needs the key in order 
    to transport the group to Cobalt Scar.</font></p>
