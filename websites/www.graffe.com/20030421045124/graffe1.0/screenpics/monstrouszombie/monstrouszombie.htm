        <p>A loyal viewer of the site, Thresh SoulRend of Rodcet Nife, sent this 
          story in the other day. I must say that I was very skeptical of the 
          whole thing, mostly due to the fact that the 'Monstrous Zombie' looks 
          just like the Giant Dark Boned Skeleton that spawns in the Rathe Mountains 
          as well but with my past experiences with Thresh, he is not one to make 
          such a story up. The accounts he wrote about here are quite long but 
          will keep you on the edge of your seat. I will leave his writings in 
          exactly the way he wrote them unto me... enjoy.</p>

        <p>A lv 50 shadow knight in our guild "Masters of Destiny" needed research 
          components for one of his last spells, im not sure what it was for, 
          but we had to trapse around in perma, kill ice giants, and then several 
          frozen tentacle terrors untill he got a "prickly pear" off one of em 
          (yeah i know, i was like whats up with this). so he gets the prickly 
          pear then its off to rathe mountains to track down a lv 50 necro and 
          give it to him (forgot name and location but since this isnt a shadow 
          knight site who cares right?). So he gives the necro the pear and then 
          the necro gives him a nice item (a cool looking neck slot item that 
          was +7int and +7 wis...THIS might be worth doing the quest for druids 
          and even wizzies hehe who arent erudite like myself and need EVERY bit 
          of INT they can scrape up 8) ). the necro then tells him to find another 
          NPC in rathe mountains and have him give that item to her (thank god 
          we had a high lvl ranger with us or this would have been a pain because 
          our shadow knight was just going on very little info and speculation 
          at this point, which as it turns out was a very long quest requiring 
          ALOT of item hunting). we find this other NPC and he anxiously gives 
          the item to her and she talks a bit, glows or something then he receives 
          something else (at this point we had been running around rathe for a 
          few hours and i was losing interesting in documenting this huge item 
          hunt so i dont recall what she gave him) and then nothing seems to happen. 
          we had like 6 lvl 50's in our group and about 7-8 other very high lvls 
          following us around consuming all this drama with bated breath. and 
          the reason for this was because it was RUMORED that once you give a 
          certain NPC the LAST item in this huge item hunt either the npc or the 
          npc summons a lv 52-54 GIANT MONSTROUS ZOMBIE that well, doesnt con 
          friendly lets just say hehe. so we find the last npc and at this point 
          in time i was very tired and our groups cleric and myself got seperated 
          from the main group that was going to give the npc the item. in the 
          process of looking around for our group (which turned out to be just 
          on the other side of one of the hills in rathe) i see "You gain party 
          experience", (he gave the npc the item) and then all of a sudden i see 
          in group and in OOC "OH MY GOD GET EM OFF ME" "WOW HES HUGE" "WHERES 
          OUR HEALS" "THRESH EVAC US!! (this was directed to me) and in general, 
          crys of utter chaos. i looked at my party list a few seconds after seeing 
          all this chatter and ALL but the magician (who was feared and was running 
          blindly towards me with 70 hps) and the cleric who was lost with me 
          in the begining of this encounter were killed seemingly instantly (we 
          have killed the alweasuar(sp) big lizzie many many times, and alot of 
          other special high lvl mobs outside of the plane of fear and had very 
          little problem with a full group of lv 50's, not to mention some of 
          the other high lvl people who were following us around watching this 
          item hunt had died also). i was lucky to be able to con the BIG 'MOUNSTROUS 
          ZOMBIE' before i was able to get an evac off in time to snag the feared 
          magician and myself to safety, and the cleric was UNEARTHLY lucky in 
          his ability to run to the zone. well just like nagafen and lady vox 
          raids that have gone bad, we realized we had the arduous unpleasant 
          task of retrieving several bodies. (by the way the 'monstrous zombie' 
          looks like a HUGE high lv necro pet, about the size of the big lizzie 
          in OOT) so after playing cat and mouse with the huge nasty spell casting 
          mob we finally got everyones body back to the main zone, and in the 
          process had inadvertantly pulled the zombie back to the feerot zone 
          to the unpleasant surprise of several lower lv players out for some 
          pleasant exploring in the rathe mountains, cause as we all can imagine, 
          a lv 53 GIANT MONSTROUS ZOMBIE who casts some VERY nasty spells can 
          ruin your day when you zone in. let me also add that the majority of 
          the reason why we got laid out so quick by this thing, is because we 
          werent prepared, because some of us just flat out did not believe the 
          rumors of the zombie spawn, and others thought it was just a long item 
          hunt that was to become uneventful. well, they (including myself) were 
          all wrong as many cold corpses on the ground will attest to. so this 
          time we wanted revenge, and many of us (the picture i sent in only shows 
          3/4 of the ones present in the battle) were there to give it to him 
          (probably 9 players and a few scared spectators). why did we have so 
          many people for a mob that is just a few lvls than the big lizzie in 
          OOT? well i forgot to mention that during our attempts to return our 
          bodies back to the feerot zone, and the ensueing dragging of one MONSTROUS 
          ZOMBIE, we saw him snag our ranger for a few second before he could 
          zone, and do 188 damage a hit, 3 times in one round!! so its understandable 
          as to why we had so many people there. well anyways, the second time 
          we all buffed up like crazy, buffed the pets, and basically used every 
          protection spell between us, we pulled the zombie, and surprisingly 
          it fell kind of quick (if you are ever involved in an attempt to kill 
          this mob, DO NOT cast any real high lvl nukes on him untill he has lost 
          a good deal of hps because, as i found out, hes just like nagafen in 
          his ability to summon you and beat on you profusely (see above 188 damage 
          3 times a round). the zombie dropped some type of heart (no runes much 
          to my disappointment) which we assumed was the final part of the shadow 
          knight quest, but since we had no info on the heart we didnt want to 
          waste it on the wrong npc. the battle was alot of fun and a good time 
          was had by all (even the ones that died). heres the two pics, one of 
          us massed near the feerot zone before the fight that took out the mob, 
          and one during, i apologise for the darkness of the pics, when i took 
          them, they seem very bright and lustrous, but obviously did not turn 
          out that way. enjoy. some people might find the +7int +7wis item relavent 
          to them, even tho i was a lil lite on the quest info, cause, well, it 
          was a shadow knight quest hehehe.</p>
