      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">This 
        quest starts out in North Qeynos inside the Crow's Tavern. Once inside, 
        speak to the Erudite librarian named Umvera Dekash:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>You say</b>, 'hail Umvera Dekash' 
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'What, Graffe 
          ? Do I look like a merchant to you? Just because all these merchants 
          are in my library, it doesn't mean that I am one. If you are interested 
          in something other than spell scrolls, then, we can talk. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>You say</b>, 'I am interested' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Ah, so you 
          do have half a wit about you! Very well. As you can clearly see, I am 
          the librarian here. I keep track of all of the mystic tomes that enter 
          this divine building. I also take care of all of the purchasing. Have 
          you something to offer? </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>You say</b>, 'I have something to 
          offer' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Excellent! 
          You have no idea how difficult it is to get good help these days. Do 
          you think you would have the time to gather some information for me? 
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>You say</b>, 'I think I will have 
          the time to help you gather information' </font></p>
        <p><font color="#999999" size="2"><b>Umvera Dekash says</b> 'Even better! 
          Well, it has been some time since the Tesch Val gnolls moved in on the 
          Split Paw. That being said, we still know little to nothing of their 
          origins. If you can bring me back the four scrolls that our diviners 
          speak of, I believe I can reward you well. </font></p>
        </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">The 
        scrolls he wants are four different LORE Tanned Split Paw Skins, which 
        are dropped randomly off Gnolls in Infected Paw and look like actual scrolls, 
        not spells. Each skin/scroll can be identified and each has a number from 
        1 through 4 that will appear near the beginning of the identify message. 
        Being that they are LORE, you cannot have two of one scroll so that should 
        narrow things down for you as well. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">After 
        you have each of the four scrolls, head back to North Qeynos and visit 
        Umvera Dekash again in the Crow's Tavern. Hand him the scrolls and in 
        turn, will give you a book of the translated split paw skins. Umvera will 
        then inform you that you need to have the book bound by Jheron Felkis.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">Jheron 
        Felkis can be found in East Freeport at Velith & Bardo's bar. Give the 
        book to Jheron and it will rewrite itself into a series of letters written 
        by the Ishva Verishe Val called "A Paw Book". Take this new book back 
        to Umvera in North Qeynos and he will give you a sealed letter to take 
        to Durkis Battlemore.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">You 
        can find Durkis in the Butcherblock Mountains inside a hut near Kaladim, 
        on he path from the docks. Give Durkis the sealed letter and he will give 
        you a set of Gem Inlaid Gauntlets.</font></p>
