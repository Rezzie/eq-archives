            You’ll need to sit around for a few minutes and wait for her to repop.&nbsp; 
            This can take anywhere from 10-25 minutes as I’m unsure of her spawn

            are multi-questing have everyone else turn in their staves then you 
            turn in yours) and he will give you the bag with his staff and your

            VERY important you have a major inventory slot open when turning in 
            your three staves!&nbsp; The bag Arantir hands you is classified as 
            a ‘GIANT’ item.&nbsp; If you have a Tinkerer’s Bag or Skarlon Pack 
            make sure you have an open slot in them.&nbsp; If you don’t, make 
            sure you have a free MAIN INVENTORY slot.&nbsp; At this point, GMs 
            are becoming stricter with enforcing the rules and are denying Wizards 
            reimburses for a loss of this kind.&nbsp; Please, make sure you have 
            a major inventory slot open, it will prevent a lot of frustration.<o:p>

            how you do it.&nbsp; Have the person who got the green oil turn the 
            note into Dargon and spawn Arantir.&nbsp; Boom, there is Arantir.&nbsp; 
            Now, have the people who are NOT getting the epic turn their staves 
            in, then you turn your staff or staves in and you should receive the 
            bag.&nbsp; It's very important that the people multi-questing have 
            apprehensive or higher faction.&nbsp; If they have dubious the staves 
            will be eaten.&nbsp; If they are dubious have them place the staff 
            into trade with Arantir, then cast invisibility on them.&nbsp; This 
            will give them indifferent faction.&nbsp; Once invisible, have them 
            hand in the staff or staves then you hand in yours.&nbsp; It's that 
            simple!
