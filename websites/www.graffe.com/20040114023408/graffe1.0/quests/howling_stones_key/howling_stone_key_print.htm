      <p align="left">If you are a high level player looking to for adventure 
        in the depths of the dungeon of <a href="../../maps/kunark/howling_stones.jpg" target="_blank">Howling 
        Stones</a>, you will need to do this quest. In order to gain entry into 
        Howling Stones, you need a key. In order to obtain that key, you need 
        to complete the following quest.</p>
      <p>This quest starts in the <a href="../../maps/kunark/swamp_of_no_hope.gif" target="_blank">Swamp 
        of No Hope</a> with a froglok named <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('dugroz.jpg','dugroz','width=492,height=356')">Dugroz</a> 
        along with his pet skeleton. You can find Dugroz in a cave <i>within</i> 
        the cave that leads to Trakanons Teeth. The easiest way is to get to the 
        waterfall cliff in the Swamp of No Hope. Turn around and head into the 
        cave that leads to the Trakanon's Teeth zone line. Along the right-hand 
        wall of the cave there is a very small opening (+1147.05, -4000.00, +196.22) 
        to a smaller cave. Go in that cave, invis yourself, and follow the wall 
        left. You will pass a few froglok shin shamans, and some froglok gaz knights 
        before you come to Dugroz. He is in a room with two froglok gaz knights. 
        His standing location is +419.33, -4020.66, +198.26. Dugroz considers 
        dubious to most. To speak to him, you will need to get a druid to turn 
        you into wolf form. Upon speaking to him, he will tell you he needs two 
        items in return for the key to Howling Stones. These two items are the 
        Jade Chodikai Prod and the Xalgozian Fang.</p>
      <p>The <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('jade_chokidai_prod.jpg','jadeprod','width=330,height=145')">Jade 
        Chodikai Prod</a> (note: this stat pic was taken on the opening day of 
        Kunark. The Prod is now Shaman Only) can be found upon <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('chancellor_of_dizok.jpg','chancellorofdizok','width=650,height=504')">Chancellor 
        of Di`zok</a>. The Chancellor is a level 35-40, shaman classed sarnak 
        with a pet, that can be found in the very back of the <a href="../../maps/kunark/sarnak_fortress.jpg" target="_blank">sarnak 
        fortress</a> in Lake of Ill Omen. He spawns once every two hours and he 
        may or may not drop the Prod every time. If he has the Prod, you will 
        see him wielding it. </p>
      <p>The <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('xalgozian_fang.jpg','xalgozianfang','width=330,height=145')">Xalgozian 
        Fang</a> is dropped by <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('xalgoz.jpg','xalgoz','width=516,height=380')">Xalgoz</a>, 
        in the church very deep inside <a href="../../maps/kunark/kaesora.gif" target="_blank">Kaesora</a>. 
        If you are a level 50+ caster, there is a chance of you doing this solo 
        but it is much easier if you get a group of 3 or more level 50+ to clear 
        the area around Xalgoz and kill him off with no incidents. Xalgoz or his 
        place holder spawns once every 28 minutes and drops the fang about 75% 
        of the time. The church room spawn is 18 minutes.</p>
      <p>Once you have both pieces, head back to the Swamp of No Hope and find 
        Dugroz. There are conflicting reports that due to Dugroz being dubious 
        or worse to most races/classes, he may or may not give you the key once 
        you hand over the two items. To be safe, get a wolf form, initiate dialogue 
        with him, go through <u>ALL</u> of the dialogue, and then hand over the 
        pieces. This way you should be sure to get your key. There are reports 
        of wolf form not even working though. Dugroz is on beta-neutral faction. 
      </p>
      <p>Notes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reports on the Dugroz cave are that you can kill the gaz knights next 
          to Dugroz without him being provoked. Even while you are 'glower dubious' 
          with him.</li>
        <li>Reports are that Dugroz will give you the dialoge AND the key even 
          if you are 'glower dubious' to him.</li>
