  <p>Let me say a few things before you read any further into this quest. I have 
    done this in two ways so I don't ruin the quest for anybody. If you wish only 
    to see the text within the book &quot;The Wheel of Tarton&quot; given by Sulgar, 
    click on 'Riddle'. If you wish to see the complete spoiler, click on 'Spoiler'. 
    If you get confused with what rods you have in your inventory, you can use 
    the identify spell on them to confirm. Good luck! - Graff&euml;<br>

  <hr noshade>
  <p>The Ice Comet Rune Quest starts by talking to Sulgar within Everfrost. To 
    find Sulgar, zone out of Blackburrow and head for the North wall (loc +3033, 
    -2393). He is standing next to two Barbarians. <i>If you cannot interact with 
    him, petition a GM to correct your beta-neutral faction. If the GM will not 
    help you, Merloc Kole of The Rathe says that all parts of the Tishans Kilt 
    Quest will up your beta-neutral faction.</i> Also, you can try asking about 
    'Tarton Wheel' (leaving off the apostropy and the s in 'Tarton' and see if 
    that helps) Once you have the rods, go back to Sulgar and ask him for the 
    chest <i>(Be sure to get the chest last for it is a NO RENT item. Once you 
    log out, the chest and everything in it will dissapear)</i> which you need 
    to combine the rods. Upon a successful combining of the rods, you make two 
    items. One is the Staff of the Wheel and the other is the <a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../../equipment/miscellaneous/star_of_eyes.jpg','starofeyes','width=330,height=145')">Star 
    of Eyes</a>. Either of these items you can keep (many use the staff for it's 
    intelligence bonus) or return both to Sulgar in trade for the runes.</p>

  <p>This list gives the complete location of each rod that needs to be found 
    for the quest.</p>
  <p>1. Azia- In Erud's crossing on the deep part of the ocean floor past the 
    shipwreck infested with undead, location -1162, +2340 (one user suggested 
    levitating to find the coordinates first, then diving for it). Use the best 
    of your shields, load your fades, shadow steps and gates. Acquiring this rod 
    can get ugly. Seems that 'Killer Sharks' (level 40) inhabit this area and 
    make it very difficult to acquire the rods. Some say the sharks see through 
    invisible and some say they cannot. - <b>you have been warned</b> - For even 
    more help on this rod, I suggest looking at this <a href="erud_rod/azia.html" target="_blank">walkthru</a> 
    and also reading this <a href="Azia.zip">text file</a>.</p>
  <p>2. Beza- In Everfrost, within the underwater caves, it is in the "house" 
    all the way back and right in the cave, where three Ice boned skeletons guard 
    it in the center of the room. To find the hole in the ice that leads to the 
    underwater cave, goto +2420, -4060. You may or may not need enduring breath 
    for this swim depending on your swimming skill. Jump in the water and swim 
    North. Once you hit dry land inside the cave, keep right the whole way until 
    you reach the &quot;house&quot;. (mob info correction by Talisin Sa`Lidar)</p>
  <p>3. Caza- Lake Rathe, Underneath the first island you see is an underwater 
    tunnel leading to a stone tower, its on the top floor of the tower (need enduring 
    breath for this one). This is guarded by water goblins that may attack unprovoked. 
    Be careful for some say they can see through invisiblitly also. - you have 
    been warned - </p>
  <p>4. Dena- Dagnor's Cauldron, right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. If 
    you face with your back to Kedge Keep, it is directly diagonal left, in a 
    corner. Loc -890, -740.</p>
  <p>5. Ena- Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you 
    need a group for, unless you are brave and kamakaze it. Warning: depending 
    on how your video card / colors are set up, the floor may be the same color 
    as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find with the Hand and 
    the dar beating on you. </p>
  <p>6. Fana- Oasis is correct but the tower is underwater next to the above ground 
    tower, this one is on the top floor of the tower as well. This is guarded 
    by water goblins that may attack unprovoked. Be careful for some say they 
    can see through invisiblitly also. - you have been warned - </p>
  <p>7. Geza- Highpass Hold is correct, it is in the water near the waterfall 
    closest to the Tiger's Roar Inn, there are two waterfalls there, the rod is 
    in front of the one closest to the Inn.</p>
  <p>8. Heda- Erudin is wrong, it is within the Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark 
    pit there. Some High Elves with the wrong faction may have to deal with an 
    NPC by the name of Riggin Vix, in which they may be KoS to.</p>
  <p>9. Izah- Neriak is correct, but it is in the water in front of the bar called 
    "The Blind Fish". The bar has four glass windows that are underwater and the 
    rod spawns right in front of those windows. (If you do not know Neriak or 
    are not welcomed there, I suggest creating a newbie Dark Elf to get familiar 
    with the waterway area, the guards, and the location of the rod before attempting 
    to grab this one. There are MANY guards that patrol the bridge area but you 
    will be safe in the water - Graff&euml;)</p>
  <p>10. Jaka- It is in Unrest but not near a mob that drops dwarven armor. It 
    is in the water outside to the right of the mansion. Near where the the Gnome 
    Spelunker is. Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to the Spelunker, 
    there is a very shallow tunnel that is to the right. Within that tunnel lies 
    the rod.</p>
  <p> The Runes of Frost and Astral are NO DROP items from the quest as is the 
    scroll they make.</p>
  <p>Statistics on the Star of Eyes: It is a jewel that can cast unlimited identify 
    spell.<br>
    Statistics on the Staff of the Wheel are found in the picture at the top of 
    this page.</p>
