        is simply humor. That is not what we stand for. I apologize for being 
        so out of character but recent events have provoked me to find humor in 
        it all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We in Darkmoon 
        are very strict in the people we call family. We will not tolerate in 
        house squabbling. If you squabble, you must settle the situation immediately 
        with said person or look to a long time member to help you resolve your 
        issues. If you do not, you will be promptly removed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have come 
        to the realization that Everquest is not a true roleplaying game and we 
        must change to make the play style more enjoyable for our members. Take 
        note that being out of character in public is still not tolerated. There 
        are times to roleplay and there are times to relax. Our family members 
        can judge for themselves when these times are (only with another family 
        member).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Darkmoon 
        is made up of friends. True friends. Friends that do not backstab. Friends 
        that do not put loot above everything else. Friends that would do anything 
        to make each other smile. Being in Darkmoon is a privilege. You will not 
        seek us out. We will seek you.</font></p>
